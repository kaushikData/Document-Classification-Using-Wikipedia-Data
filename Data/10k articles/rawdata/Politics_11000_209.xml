An '''Alcalde-Presidente''' is an [[Alcalde]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for municipal Mayor) who also functions as President(e) of a higher administrative level.

Cases include:
*colonial [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] on [[Puerto Rico]], 1879–1902; the last one succeeded himself as first 'normal' Alcalde 
*in [[Spain]]:
**[[Mayor-President of Ceuta]], the head of government of [[Ceuta]], an autonomous city
**[[Mayor-President of Melilla]], the head of government of [[Melilla]], autonomous city
*As [[Singapore]] is a [[city-state]], its [[President of Singapore|President]] can be thought of a Mayor who also functions as a President of a higher (in this case, the highest) administrative level; however, the President of Singapore, though not entirely ceremonial, is [[Powers of the President of Singapore|not the city-state's chief executive]]. The [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] does.

An '''anti-keylogger''' (or '''anti–keystroke logger''') is a type of software specifically designed for the detection of [[keystroke logger]] software; often, such software will also incorporate the ability to delete or at least immobilize hidden keystroke logger software on a computer. In comparison to most [[anti-virus]] or [[anti-spyware]] software, the primary difference is that an anti-keylogger does not make a distinction between a ''legitimate'' keystroke-logging program and an ''illegitimate'' keystroke-logging program (such as malware); all keystroke-logging programs are flagged and optionally removed, whether they appear to be legitimate keystroke-logging software or not.

==Use of anti-keyloggers==

Keyloggers are sometimes part of malware packages downloaded onto computers without the owners' knowledge. Detecting the presence of a keylogger on a computer can be difficult. So-called anti- keylogging programs have been developed to thwart keylogging systems, and these are often effective when used properly. 

Anti-keyloggers are used both by large organizations as well as individuals in order to scan for and remove (or in some cases simply immobilize) [[keystroke logging]] software on a computer. It is generally advised the software developers that anti-keylogging scans be run on a regular basis in order to reduce the amount of time during which a keylogger may record keystrokes.  For example, if a system is scanned once every three days, there is a maximum of only three days during which a keylogger could be hidden on the system and recording keystrokes.

===Public computers===

[[Public computer]]s are extremely susceptible to the installation of [[keystroke logging]] software and hardware, and there are documented instances of this occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/keyloggers-found-plugged-into-library-computers/article/196936/ |title=Keyloggers found plugged into library computers |accessdate=25 April 2011|newspaper=SC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public computers are particularly susceptible to keyloggers because any number of people can gain access to the machine and install both a [[hardware keylogger]] and a software keylogger, either or both of which can be secretly installed in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="SpyReveal Anti Keylogger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spyreveal.com/anti-keylogging-public-computers|work=Anti Keylogging &amp; Public Computers|accessdate=10 May 2011|title=Anti Keylogging &amp; Public Computers| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522031359/http://spyreveal.com/anti-keylogging-public-computers| archivedate= 22 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-keyloggers are often used on a daily basis to ensure that public computers are not infected with keyloggers, and are safe for public use.

===Gaming usage===

Keyloggers have been prevalent in the online gaming industry, being used to secretly record a gamer's access credentials, user name and password, when logging into an account, this information is sent back to the hacker. The hacker can sign on later to the account and change the password to the account, thus stealing it.

[[World of Warcraft]] has been of particular importance to game hackers and has been the target of numerous keylogging viruses. Anti-keyloggers are used by many World of Warcraft and other gaming community members in order to try to keep their gaming accounts secure.

===Financial institutions===

[[Financial institution]]s have become the target of keyloggers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber threat landscape faced by financial and insurance industry|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/401-420/tandi408.html|publisher=Dr Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those institutions which do not use advanced security features such as [[Personal identification number|PIN]] pads or screen keyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/123397/article.html|work=Privacy Watch: More Criminals Use Keystroke Loggers|publisher=PC World About|title=Privacy Watch: More Criminals Use Keystroke Loggers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-keyloggers are used to run regular scans of any computer on which banking or client information is accessed, protecting passwords, banking information, and credit card numbers from identity thieves.

===Personal use===

The most common use of an anti-keylogger is by individuals wishing to protect their privacy while using their computer; uses range from protecting financial information used in online banking, any passwords, personal communication, and virtually any other information which may be typed into a computer. Keyloggers are often installed by people known by the computer's owner, and many times have been installed by an ex-partner hoping to spy on their ex-partner's activities, particularly chat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kimkomando/2010-03-04-computer-spying_N.htm|accessdate=25 April 2011|newspaper=USA Today | title=Is someone you know spying on you?|date=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

===Signature-based===
This type of software has a signature base, that is strategic information that helps to uniquely identify a keylogger, and the list contains as many known keyloggers as possible. Some vendors make some effort or availability of an up-to-date listing for download by customers. Each time a 'System Scan' is run, this software compares the contents of the hard disk drive, item by item, against the list, looking for any matches.

This type of software is a rather widespread one, but it has its own drawbacks  The biggest drawback of signature-based anti-keyloggers is that one can only be protected from keyloggers found on the signature-base list, thus staying vulnerable to unknown or unrecognized keyloggers.  A criminal can download one of many famous keyloggers, change it just enough, and the anti-keylogger won't recognize it.

===Heuristic analysis===
This software doesn't use signature bases, it uses a checklist of known features, attributes, and methods that keyloggers are known use.

It analyzes the methods of work of all the modules in a PC, thus blocking the activity of any module that is similar to the work of keyloggers. Though this method gives better keylogging protection than signature-based anti-keyloggers, it has its own drawbacks. One of them is that this type of software blocks non-keyloggers also. Several 'non-harmful' software modules, either part of the operating system or part of legitimate apps, use processes which keyloggers also use, which can trigger a [[false positive]]. Usually all the non signature-based keyloggers have the option to allow the user to unblock selected modules, but this can cause difficulties for inexperienced users who are unable to discern good modules from bad modules when manually choosing to block or unblock.

The '''Argentine debt restructuring''' is a process of [[debt restructuring]] by [[Argentina]] that began on January 14, 2005, and allowed it to resume payment on 76% of the [[United States dollar|US$]]82 billion in [[sovereign bond]]s that defaulted in 2001 at the depth of [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|the worst economic crisis]] in the nation's history.  A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of bonds under some form of repayment to 93%, though ongoing disputes with [[holdout problem|holdouts]] remained.&lt;ref name=jf&gt;{{cite web |url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41029.pdf |title=Argentina's Defaulted Sovereign Debt: Dealing with the "Holdouts"|author=J.F.Hornbeck|work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/banks-fear-court-ruling-in-argentina-bond-debt/?_r=0|title=Banks Fear Court Ruling in Argentina Bond Debt|work=The New York Times|date=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bondholders who participated in the restructuring settled for repayments of around 30% of face value and deferred payment terms, and began to be paid punctually; the value of their nearly worthless bonds also began to rise.&lt;ref name=snub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/the-world-economic-crisis/general-analysis-2/51203-billionaire-hedge-funds-snub-90-returns.html|title=Billionaire Hedge Funds Snub 90% Returns|author=Drew Benson|work=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304795804579101591978033018|title=Argentina Bonds Rally Despite Risk|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ips&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/08/argentina-seeks-to-restructure-debt-held-by-vulture-funds/|title=Argentina Seeks to Restructure Debt Held by Vulture Funds|work=IPS News|date=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 7% of bondholders later won the right to be repaid in full.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

As part of the restructuring process, Argentina drafted agreements in which repayments would be handled through a [[New York (state)|New York]] corporation and governed by United States law. The holdout bondholders found themselves unable to seize Argentine sovereign assets in settlement,&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; but realized that Argentina had omitted to provide for holdout situations and had instead deemed all bonds repayable on ''[[pari passu]]'' (equal) terms that prevented preferential treatment among bondholders. The holdout bondholders therefore sought, and won, an [[injunction]] in 2012 that prohibited Argentina from repaying the 93% of bonds that had been renegotiated, unless they simultaneously paid the 7% holdouts their full amount due as well. Together with the agreement's [[rights upon future offers]] ("RUFO") clause, this created a deadlock in which the 93% of renegotiated bondholders could not be paid without paying the 7% holdouts, but any payment to the holdouts would potentially (according to Argentina) trigger the 93% being due repayment at full value too; a sum of around $100 billion that Argentina could not afford.&lt;ref name="telegraph31july2014"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/11004486/Argentina-accuses-US-of-judicial-malpractice-for-triggering-needless-default.html Argentina accuses US of judicial malpractice for triggering needless default], ''The Telegraph'', 31 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts ruled that as Argentina had itself drafted the agreement, and chosen the terms it wished to propose, it could not now claim the terms were unreasonable or unfair, and that this could not be worked around by asserting sovereign status since the injunction did not affect sovereign assets, but simply ruled that Argentina must not give preferential treatment of any group of bondholders over any other group when making repayments.

Subsequently, though Argentina wanted to repay some creditors, the judgment prevented Argentina from doing so, because being forced to repay all creditors, including the holdouts, would have totaled around $100 billion. The country was therefore categorized as being in [[Default (finance)|selective default]] by [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] and in restricted default by [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=4 September 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-argentinas-weird-default/|title=Everything you need to know about Argentina's weird default|work=Washington Post|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=selective&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/argentina-ruled-selective-default-bonds-p-203657630.html|title=Argentina blames US for debt woes, denies default|author=Paula Bustamante|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|work=Yahoo! News|date=31 July 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling affected New York law Argentine bonds; Argentine bonds issued under Buenos Aires and [[European law]] were not affected.&lt;ref name=muddled&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/business/rulings-add-to-the-mess-in-argentine-bonds.html?_r=1|title=The Muddled Case of Argentine Bonds|work=The New York Times|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Europe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/166107/new-york-judge-allows-payment--to-bondholders-based-in-europe-|title=New York judge allows payment to bondholders in Europe|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed solutions include seeking [[waiver]]s of the RUFO clause from bondholders, or waiting for the RUFO clause to expire at the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="telegraph31july2014"/&gt; The dilemma raised concerns internationally about the ability of a small minority to forestall an otherwise-agreed debt restructuring of an insolvent country,&lt;ref name="telegraph31july2014"/&gt; and the ruling that led to it was widely criticized both within the United States and internationally. Although the media widely reported that the default ended with payments to the principal bondholders in early 2016, during the [[#Presidency of Mauricio Macri|presidency of Mauricio Macri]], several hundred million dollars in outstanding defaulted bonds remained unpaid, which resulted in continuation of litigation.  In November 2016 Argentina announced that it had settled with additional creditors for US$475 million.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1957560-el-gobierno-pago-us-475-millones-a-los-tenedores-de-titulos-en-default&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Argentine financial crisis===
{{see also|1998–2002 Argentine great depression}}
Around [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|1998 to 2002, Argentina's economy]] went into severe [[recession]]. On December 26, 2001, Argentina defaulted on a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]93 billion of its [[external debt]]; of around $81.8 billion in bonds that were [[Default (finance)|default]]ed, 51% were issued during this three-year period.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infonews.com/2013/08/28/economia-94629-el-detalle-del-proyecto-para-el-nuevo-canje-de-deuda-reapertura-del-canje.php|title=El detalle del proyecto para el nuevo canje de deuda|work=InfoNews|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign investment [[capital flight|fled the country]], and capital flow toward Argentina ceased almost completely from 2001 to 2003 (though it later recovered).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desde el 2003 aumentó la inversión extranjera productive |url=http://images.slideplayer.es/1/18037/slides/slide_7.jpg|work=MRECIC|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currency [[exchange rate]] (formerly a fixed 1-to-1 [[fixed exchange rate|parity]] between the [[Argentine peso]] and the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]) was [[floating exchange rate|floated]], and the peso [[devaluation|devalued]] quickly to nearly 4-to-1, producing a sudden rise in [[inflation]] to over 40% and a fall in real GDP of 11% in 2002.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt;

Large-scale [[debt restructuring]] was needed urgently, since the high-interest bonds had become unpayable. The Argentine government met severe challenges trying to [[refinancing|refinance]] its debt, however. Creditors (many of them private citizens in Spain, Italy, Germany, Japan, the United States, and other countries, who had [[investment|invested]] their [[saving]]s and [[retirement]] [[pension]]s in debt [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) denounced the default; this included bondholders from Argentina itself, estimated to compose about a fourth of affected bondholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.clarin.com/diario/2005/01/10/um/m-901690.htm|title=Los bonistas argentinos, entre entablar juicios o esperar un fracaso del canje|work=Clarín|date=January 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic recovery eventually allowed Argentina to offer large-scale debt swaps in 2005 and 2010; the first brought 76% of bonds out of default and the second, 91.3%.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt; The terms of the debt exchanges were not accepted by all private bondholders; the holders of around 7% of the defaulted bonds - known as "holdouts" - continued to seek full repayment. The [[IMF]] initially lobbied for the holdouts until Argentina's lump-sum repayment to the IMF in January 2006. Individual creditors worldwide, who represented about one third of this group, mobilized to seek repayment following the default. Among the most prominent were Task Force Argentina, an Italian retail bondholder association; and Mark Botsford, a private U.S. retail bondholder; and [[Kenneth Dart]], who unsuccessfully sued in 2003 to be paid $724 million for bonds purchased in 2001 for $120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessobserverfl.com/print/Squeezing-Argentina/|title=Squeezing Argentina|work=Business Observer|date=13 February 2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dart renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1994 for [[tax avoidance]] purposes, and his interests in Argentina became the focus of [[tax evasion]] charges in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-21/billionaire-dart-s-argentine-foam-cup-unit-raided-by-tax-agents.html|title=Billionaire Dart's Argentine Unit Raided by Tax Agents|work=Bloomberg|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian nationals had become the largest group of foreign retail investors in Argentine bonds when during the 1990s, banks in their country purchased $14 billion in bonds and then resold them to nearly half a million investors; the vast majority rejected the first swap but accepted the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-25/tired-italians-may-accept-anything-to-unload-argentina-s-defaulted-bonds.html|title=Tired Italians May `Accept Anything' to Unload Argentina's Defaulted Bonds|work=Bloomberg|date=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and holdout problem===
Upon default, Argentina's bondholders sued to be repaid 100% of their bonds' face value.&lt;ref name=Benson&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-28/u-s-judge-vacates-2-2-billion-order-in-argentine-bond-case.html|title=Argentine Funds Can’t Be Seized by Bond Holders, Judge Says|work=Bloomberg|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/argentina-offers-pay-debts-cash-bonds-040817493--finance.html|title= Argentina offers to pay debts with cash &amp; bonds|publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]|date=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cepr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/the-americas-blog/vulture-turns-to-pirate-blocks-argentine-ship-from-leaving-ghana|title=Vulture Turns to Pirate: Blocks Argentine Ship from Leaving Ghana|work=CEPR blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the bondholders were [[vulture funds]], who had [[Speculation|speculatively]] acquired US$1.3 billion of the bonds' total value on the [[secondary market]] for cents on the dollar after the 2001 default.&lt;ref name=ips/&gt;&lt;ref name=crazy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/08/27/elliott-vs-argentina-enter-the-crazy/|title=Elliott vs Argentina: Enter the crazy|author=Salmon, Felix|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vulture funds also owned a large quantity of [[credit default swap]]s (CDS) against Argentine bonds. This created a further incentive to not only trigger a default against Argentina; but also to undermine the value of the bonds themselves, as the CDS would pay out at a higher rate if the defaulted bonds decline to extremely low values.&lt;ref name=crazy/&gt;

The vulture funds held out for payment in full via [[litigation]] (hence their common description as "holdout" bondholders, or "holdouts"). Their legal tactics included seeking [[injunction]]s to [[attachment (law)|attach]] future payments to other bondholders by way of forcing Argentina to [[settlement (law)|settle]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=cepr/&gt;&lt;ref name=aba&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-04/bankers-group-supports-bond-trustee-in-argentina-appeal-1-.html|title=Bankers’ Group Supports Bond Trustee in Argentina Appeal|work=Bloomberg|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/the-americas-blog/argentina-vs-the-vultures-what-you-need-to-know|title=Argentina vs. the Vultures: What You Need to Know|work=CEPR|author=Arthur Phillips and Jake Johnston|date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3715779|title=A victory by default?|work=The Economist|date=March 3, 2005|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar strategy had been successfully pursued previously by vulture funds against [[Peru]] and a number of African nations,&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubileeusa.org/vulturefunds/vulture-fund-country-studies.html |title=Vulture Fund Case Studies: Peru and Elliott Associates |work=Jubilee USA Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015052539/http://www.jubileeusa.org/vulturefunds/vulture-fund-country-studies.html |archivedate=2013-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as against corporations in the United States itself, such as [[Delphi Automotive]], which was forced to pay [[Paul Singer (businessman)|Paul Singer]]'s [[Elliott Management Corporation]] a return of over 3,000% on [[corporate bond]]s defaulted during the 2008 recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-pope/romney-delphi-auto_b_2051373.html|title=Was Romney Blind to His Adviser's Vulture Fund?|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NML Capital Limited]], the [[Cayman Islands]]-based principal vulture funds in this dispute, is also owned by Singer.

As a result, Argentina has still not been able to raise finance on the international debt markets for fear that any money raised would be impounded by holdout lawsuits; their [[country risk]] borrowing cost premiums remain over 10%, much higher than comparable countries. Consequently, Argentina has been paying debt from [[Central Bank of Argentina|central bank]] reserves, has banned most retail purchases of dollars, limited imports, and ordered companies to repatriate money held abroad. Nevertheless, between 2003 and 2012 Argentina met [[Government debt|debt service]] payments totaling $173.7 billion, of which 81.5 billion was collected by bondholders, 51.2 billion by multilateral lenders such as the IMF and [[World Bank]], and 41 billion by Argentine government agencies. Public external debt denominated in foreign currencies (mainly in dollars and euros) accordingly fell from 150% of GDP in 2002 to 8.3% in 2013.&lt;ref name=info/&gt;

==Debt restructuring history==

===First restructuring (2005)===
[[File:Néstor Kirchner y Roberto Lavagna-Buenos Aires-23 de agosto de 2004.jpg|thumb|260px|President [[Néstor Kirchner]] and Economy Minister [[Roberto Lavagna]], who presented the first debt restructuring offer in 2005]]
In 2001, Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt.&lt;ref name=bbb&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuelan banks enjoy treasuries windfall|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6e8f3fce-928a-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html#axzz3ZTCiTC9c|accessdate=7 May 2015|work=Financial Times|date=31 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2005, the Argentine government offered the first [[debt restructuring]] to affected bondholders; nearly 76% of the defaulted bonds (US$62.5 billion) were thus exchanged and brought out of default. The exchange offered longer term [[accrual bond|par]], [[inflation-indexed bond|quasi-par]], and [[discount bond]]s - the latter with a [[haircut (finance)|much lower nominal value]] (25&amp;ndash;35% of the original). The majority of the Argentine bond market thereafter became based on [[GDP-linked bond]]s, and investors, both foreign and domestic, netted record yields amid renewed growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cronista.com/economiapolitica/El-PBI-subio-85-en-2010-y-asegura-pago-record-de-us-2.200-millones-a-inversores-20110119-0069.html |title=El PBI subió 8,5% en 2010 y asegura pago récord de u$s 2.200 millones a inversores |work=El Cronista Comercial |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mmSxU50?url=http://www.cronista.com/economiapolitica/El-PBI-subio-85-en-2010-y-asegura-pago-record-de-us-2.200-millones-a-inversores-20110119-0069.html |archivedate=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest single investors in Argentine bonds following these developments was [[Venezuela]], which bought a total of more than $5 billion in restructured Argentine bonds from 2005 to 2007.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN0835483220070808|title=Chavez keeps up South American energy diplomacy|agency= Reuters|date=Aug 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001-2006, Venezuela was the largest single buyer of Argentina's debt.&lt;ref name=bbb/&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, [[Banco Occidental de Descuento]] and [[Fondo Común]], owned by Venezuelan bankers Victor Vargas Irausquin and Victor Gill Ramirez respectively, bought most of Argentina's outstanding bonds and resold them on to the market.&lt;ref name=bbb/&gt; The banks bought $100 million worth of Argentine bonds and resold the bonds for a profit of approximately $17 million.&lt;ref name=fff&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coronel|first1=Gustavo|title=Corruption, Mismanagement, and Abuse of Power in HugoChávez's Venezuela (Development Policy Analysis)|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/dpa/html/dpa2/dpa200007.html|website=Center for Global Liberty &amp; Prosperity|publisher=The Cato Institute|location=Washington, D.C.|page=7|date=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who criticize Vargas have said that he made a $1 billion "backroom deal" with swaps of Argentine bonds as a sign of his friendship with Chavez.&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite news|last1=Padgett|first1=Tim|title=The Dead Polo Ponies and Their Millionaire Owner|work=Time Magazine|publisher=Time Inc.|url= http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1893280,00.html|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Financial Times'' interviewed financial analysts in the United States who said that the banks profited from the resale of the bonds; the Venezuelan government did not profit.&lt;ref name=fff/&gt;

Bondholders who had accepted the 2005 swap (three out of four did so) saw the value of their bonds rise 90% by 2012,&lt;ref name=snub/&gt; and these continued to rise strongly during 2013.&lt;ref name=lf/&gt;

===IMF repayment===
During the restructuring process, the [[International Monetary Fund]] was considered a "privileged creditor", that is, all debt was recognized and paid in full. During 2005 Argentina shifted from a policy of constant negotiation and refinancing with the IMF to payment in full, taking advantage of a large and growing fiscal surplus due to rising commodity prices and economic output, with the acknowledged intention of gaining financial independence from the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/28/um/m-1022668.htm|title=El Gobierno defiende el desendeudamiento con el Fondo|work=Clarín|date=July 28, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Néstor Kirchner]] on December 15, 2005, announced his intention of liquidating all the remaining debt to the IMF, in a single payment of US$9.81 billion, initially planned to take place before the end of the year (a similar move had been announced by Brazil two days before, and it is understood that the two measures were to be coordinated).&lt;ref name=chau&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-60572-2005-12-16.html|title=Todo en un pago y chau al Fondo|work=Página/12|date=December 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina under the Kirchner administration had already reduced its debt to the IMF from $15.5 billion in 2003&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; to $10.5 billion at the time of this announcement.&lt;ref name=chau/&gt; The last and largest remaining share of the IMF debt, about $9.5 billion, was paid on January 3, 2006. The debt was in fact denominated in [[special drawing rights]] (SDR; a unit employed by the IMF and calculated over a basket of currencies). The [[Banco Central de la República Argentina|Argentine Central Bank]] called on the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]], where a part of its currency reserves were deposited, to act as its agent. The BIS bought 3.78 billion SDR (equivalent to about $5.4 billion) from 16 central banks and ordered their transfer to the IMF. The rest (2.874 billion SDR or $4.1 billion) was transferred from Argentina's account in the IMF, deposited in the U.S. Federal Reserve.&lt;ref name=asia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/LG29Dj05.html|title=Pegs, boards and the IMF|work=Asia Times|date=July 29, 2010|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The payment served to cancel the debt installments that were to be paid in 2006 ($5.1 billion), 2007 ($4.6 billion), and 2008 ($432 million). This disbursement represented 8.8% of the total Argentine public debt and decreased the Central Bank's reserves by one third (from $28 billion to $18.6 billion). According to the official announcement, it also saved about a billion dollars in interest, though the actual savings amounted to $842 million (since the reserves that were in the BIS were until then receiving interest payments).&lt;ref name=chau/&gt; One of the largest single investors in Argentine bonds following these Venezuela bought a total of more than $5 billion in restructured Argentine bonds from 2005 to 2007.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

The initial announcement was made in a surprise press conference. President Kirchner said that, with this payment, "we bury an ignominious past of eternal, infinite indebtment." Many of those present later called the decision "historic". The head of the IMF, [[Rodrigo Rato]], saluted it, though remarking that Argentina "faces important challenges ahead". [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[John W. Snow]] said that this move "shows good faith" on the part of the Argentine government.&lt;ref name=chau/&gt; [[Nobel Economics Prize]] laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] repeatedly criticized the IMF and supported the Argentine strategies on the debt restructuring, but opposed the disindebtment policy, suggesting instead that the IMF should receive the same treatment as the other creditors. Local criticism of the IMF debt paydown centered around the cost, which made funds unavailable for productive purposes within Argentina or to come to terms with outstanding creditors; and second, that the government traded cheap IMF credits for new emissions of public debt at much higher interest rates.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt; Following the initial surprise and mixed reactions local markets rallied, with the [[MERVAL]] index growing more in January 2006 than in all of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/776913-en-enero-la-bolsa-gano-mas-que-en-todo-2005|title=En enero, la Bolsa ganó más que en todo 2005|work=La Nación|date=January 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Economy reported in June 2005 that the total official Argentine public debt was down by $63.5 billion from the first semester to $126.5 billion as a result of the restructuring process; of this, 46% was denominated in dollars, 36% in pesos, and 11% in [[euro]]s and other currencies. Due to the full payment of the IMF debt and several other adjustments, as of January 2006 the total figure decreased further to $124.3 billion; bonds not exchanged in 2005 accounted for $23.4 billion, of which 12.7 billion were already overdue. The Central Bank's reserves surpassed their pre-payment levels on September 27, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/economia/nota.asp?nota_id=844220|title=El Central recuperó las reservas del pago al Fondo Monetario|work=La Nación|date=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar agreement was reached eight years later with the [[Paris Club]] of creditor nations (the last remaining Argentine debt still in default besides bonds held by holdouts) on debt repayment totaling $9 billion including penalties and interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/165759/government-prepays-paris-club-as-a-sign-of-good-faith-over-default|title=Government pre-pays Paris Club as a sign of good faith over default|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=30 July 2014|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second debt swap: debt exchange reopens (2010)===
On April 15, 2010, the debt exchange was re-opened to bondholders who rejected the 2005 swap; 67% of these latter accepted the swap, leaving 7% as holdouts.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt; Holdouts continued to put pressure on the government by attempting to seize Argentine assets abroad,&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/10/05/the-real-story-behind-the-argentine-vessel-in-ghana-and-how-hedge-funds-tried-to-seize-the-presidential-plane/|title=The real story behind the Argentine vessel in Ghana and how hedge funds tried to seize the presidential plane|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by suing to attach future Argentine payments on restructured debt to receive better treatment than cooperating creditors.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/22/uk-argentina-debt-idUSLNE91L00B20130222|title=What Argentina's fight with holdout creditors is all about|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of approximately US$12.86 billion of eligible debt was tendered into the exchange launched in April 2010; this represented 69.5% of outstanding bonds still held by holdouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Wray|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/16/argentina-to-repay-2001-debt|title=Argentina to repay 2001 debt as Greece struggles to avoid default|work=The Guardian|date=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 152 types of bonds in seven different currencies under eight distinct jurisdictions were issued during the two debt exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embajadaabierta.com/?p=1883#sthash.8iV97Ip3.dpuf|title= Radiografía de un fondo buitre ensañado con Argentina|work=Embajada Abierta|author=[[Jorge Argüello]]|date=3 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 re-opening thus brought the total amount of debt restructured to 92.6% (the original 2005 debt exchange restructured 76.2% of Argentine government debt in default since 2001). The final settlement of the 2010 debt exchange took place on August 11, for bondholders that didn't participate in the early [[tranche]] that closed on May 14 and settled on May 17.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt;

==Holdout bondholders==
Although around 93% of bondholders accepted reduced repayments (typically being repaid only 30% of the face value of bonds), a minority owning around 7% of the debt (US$4 billion), mostly [[hedge fund]]s and [[vulture fund]]s, continued to argue in court that they were due repayment in full, and held out for full repayment, eventually winning their case.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

[[NML Capital Limited]], a [[Cayman Islands]]-based [[offshore banking|offshore]] unit of [[Paul Singer (businessman)|Paul Singer]]'s [[Elliott Management Corporation]], purchased many holdings in 2008, paying an estimated $49 million for one series of bonds whose face value was over $220 million;&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt; with the subsequent boom in Argentine bond values, this face value grew to $832 million by 2014.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; They in turn established the American Task Force Argentina [[lobbying]] group against Argentine bond restructuring efforts,&lt;ref name=cepr/&gt; and sued to enjoin Argentina's ongoing payments to the bondholders who had participated in the earlier restructurings.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

===Holdout parties win the right to be repaid in full===
During the 2000s NML Capital's lawyers initially obtained several large judgments against Argentina, all of which were affirmed on appeal. These rulings found that the holdout bondholders in the case were entitled to be repaid the full face value of the bonds they held, rather than alternative amounts such as the reduced settlements negotiated in 2005 and 2010, or the amounts they had purchased the bonds for.

After defaulting, Argentina continued to pay its renegotiated bondholders, but not the holdout bondholders who had rejected settlement. As Argentina refused to pay the holdout creditors at full value, the holdouts initially resorted to lawsuits to seize Argentine government assets abroad &amp;ndash; notably Central Bank deposits in the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/06/26/us-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-argentina-and-unfreezes-funds|title=US Supreme Court rules in favour of Argentina and unfreezes funds|work=MercoPress|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tango 01|presidential airplane]], and the {{ship|ARA|Libertad|Q-2|6}}.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; The ''Libertad'', an [[Argentine Navy]] training frigate, was arrested (though not seized) at the behest of NML Capital for ten weeks in late 2012 in the port of [[Tema]], [[Ghana]], until the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] ruled unanimously that it be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a6dfae3a-5abb-11e2-b60e-00144feab49a.html|title=Argentine naval frigate returns home|author=Daniel Schweimler|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually this approach proved fruitless. The holdout bondholders soon discovered that due to a number of [[sovereign immunity]] laws, it was impossible to actually [[Enforcement of foreign judgments|enforce their judgments]] by seizing the handful of Argentine assets still within the reach of U.S. jurisdiction.

In a lawsuit filed by NML, the lower UK courts found that Argentina had state immunity. Before 2011, Elliott successfully appealed the case to the [[UK Supreme Court]], which ruled that Elliott had the right to attempt to seize Argentine property in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Elliott_WSJ_2011"&gt;{{cite web

===Holdout parties win the right to have "equal payment" terms enforced===
The basis of the holdout bondholders' next approach arose from oversights on Argentina's part, due to both its economic history and partly from the legal wording chosen by the Argentina's government.

Because Argentina had been historically so unstable, it would have been difficult for it to solicit investors to buy bonds in Buenos Aires under Argentine jurisdiction, as few external investors trusted Argentina courts to enforce bonds against their own government. This consideration led Argentina to transfer the issue of bonds to New York, under United States law, on April 20, 1976, as were most subsequent bond issues.&lt;ref name=bae&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.infobae.com/andres-asiain/tag/rights-upon-future-offers-rufo/|title=El fallo Griesa y la operación buitre|work=Infobae|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bonds were therefore issued under a special kind of bond contract, a "Fiscal Agency Agreement" that was drafted by Argentina's U.S. attorneys under [[Law of New York|the law of the state of New York]]. The FAA stipulated that the repayments on the bonds were to be made by Argentina through a trustee, [[The Bank of New York Mellon]], which meant that the U.S. courts did have jurisdiction over that party to issue injunctive relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qctimes.com/business/argentina-s-debt-fight-what-it-is-why-it-matters/article_bd48d454-3079-52fc-b750-6995fad08309.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140623203912/http://qctimes.com/business/argentina-s-debt-fight-what-it-is-why-it-matters/article_bd48d454-3079-52fc-b750-6995fad08309.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 23, 2014 |title=Argentina's debt fight: What it is, why it matters |work=Quad City Business Journal |date=June 23, 2014 |accessdate=July 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fiscal Agency Agreement, Argentina's attorneys included a boilerplate ''[[pari passu]]'' clause, but neglected to include a [[collective action clause]]. ''Pari passu'' is a term generally used to signify equal priority or treatment, and a collective action clause would have obligated any holdouts to accept the generally offered terms if [[supermajority|enough other bondholders]] agreed to accept them. As a result, the holdouts realized that while Argentina could not force the holdouts to accept the terms in the 2005 or 2010 restructurings, NML could use the ''pari passu'' clause to force Argentina to choose between paying all its bondholders (including NML) or none of them.

NML Capital therefore sued Argentina in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] (i.e., a federal trial court) by invoking that court's [[diversity jurisdiction]] as well as [[Forum selection clause|forum selection]] and [[choice of law clause]]s in the Fiscal Agency Agreement itself.

====''Pari passu'' litigation case====
Federal district judge [[Thomas P. Griesa]] was assigned to hear the case. The crucial expression ''pari passu'' had not previously been interpreted in any published decision by the [[judiciary of New York|courts of the state of New York]], but there is no way in U.S. federal civil procedure for a federal district court to ''directly'' transfer a case to state court if it had not originally started there. (By way of contrast, if NML Capital had sued Argentina in a New York state court, Argentina would have had the option to "[[Removal jurisdiction|remove]]" the case to federal court.) Instead, the district court was required by ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' (1938) to make an "[[Erie doctrine|Erie guess]]" as to how a [[New York Supreme Court|New York state trial court]] would interpret that clause by applying general principles of contract law in the state of New York as articulated in the published decisions of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] and the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]]. The district court ruled in NML Capital's favor and issued broad permanent injunctions against Argentina and the bond trustee. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] (the federal appellate court with jurisdiction over New York) in turn affirmed the district court's interpretation, but did not exercise its optional right to certify that specific issue to the New York Court of Appeals for a ruling on New York state law.

According to the Second Circuit's opinion issued on October 26, 2012 (signed by senior circuit judge [[Barrington Daniels Parker, Jr.]]), Paragraph 1(c) of the 1994 version of Argentina's Fiscal Agency Agreement was as follows:

:The Securities will constitute ... direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Republic and shall at all times rank ''pari passu'' without any preference among themselves. The payment obligations of the Republic under the Securities shall at all times rank at least equally with all its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated External Indebtedness....&lt;ref name="NMLCapital"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13527582518963109632 NML Capital, Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina]'', 699 F.3d 246 (2nd Cir. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Second Circuit interpreted this clause under New York law and concluded "that in pairing the two sentences of its Pari Passu Clause, the FAA manifested an intention to protect bondholders from more than just formal subordination .... the two sentences ... protect against different forms of discrimination: the issuance of other superior debt (first sentence) and the giving of priority to other payment obligations (second sentence)."&lt;ref name="NMLCapital"/&gt; Argentina had argued the entire clause was intended to protect only against the ''first'' type of discrimination; the Second Circuit held that Argentina's approach was invalid because it ignored the critical differences in wording between the two sentences, treated the second sentence as redundant, and in turn violated New York's rule that "a contract should not be interpreted in such a way as would leave one of its provisions substantially without force or effect."&lt;ref name="NMLCapital"/&gt; Thus, the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision that Argentina could either pay ''all'' its bondholders or ''none'', but could not pay only those who cooperated with the 2005 and 2010 restructurings and ignore the rest.&lt;ref name="NMLCapital"/&gt;

Thus in 2012 (affirmed on appeal 2013), the courts ruled that paying the settled bondholders but not the holdouts was a breach of Argentina's agreement and discriminated against the holdout bondholders.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

Furthermore, the Second Circuit held that the trial court's injunctions did not violate Argentina's sovereign immunity because they merely enforced the prohibition against both formal and informal ''subordination'' of any part of the debt to any other debt: "They do not attach, arrest, or execute upon any property .... the Injunctions do not require Argentina to pay any bondholder any amount of money; nor do they limit the other uses to which Argentina may put its fiscal reserves. In other words, the Injunctions do not transfer any dominion or control over sovereign property to the court."&lt;ref name="NMLCapital"/&gt;

As of February 2013, after further decisions by the district court, the case came again before the Second Circuit.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg022613&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentina Seeks Relief From U.S. Court in Debt Fight|url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-02-26/argentina-seeks-relief-from-u-dot-s-dot-court-in-debt-fight|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=February 26, 2013|author=Bob Van Voris|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision of the appeals court was adverse and a motion for rehearing by a [[en banc|full panel]] was denied on March 26.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg032613&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentina Loses Bid for Full-Court Rehearing in Bond Appeal |accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Argentina-Loses-Bid-for-Full-Court-Rehearing-in-4386083.php|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=March 26, 2013|author=Bob Van Voris|author2=Katia Porzecanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2013, the Second Circuit (in another opinion also signed by Judge Parker) affirmed the lower court's latest ruling clarifying the scope of the permanent injunctions.&lt;ref name="NMLCapital2"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12349482740132205657 NML Capital, Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina]'', 727 F.3d 230 (2nd Cir. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court implied at the start of its opinion that since Argentina had taken a calculated risk to enjoy the benefit of New York law (i.e., a lower interest rate), it now had to bear the burden of New York law as well: "In order to enhance the marketability of the bonds, Argentina made a series of promises to the purchasers."&lt;ref name="NMLCapital2"/&gt; Among those promises in the 1994 Fiscal Agency Agreement were the ''pari passu'' clause, the aforementioned forum selection and choice-of-law clauses expressly referencing New York, as well as a promise of the free transferability of the bonds to any transferee, regardless of whether that transferee was a "university endowment, a so-called 'vulture fund,' or a widow or an orphan."&lt;ref name="NMLCapital2"/&gt; In other words, as the drafter of the Fiscal Agency Agreement, Argentina could have easily avoided the situation it found itself in by writing a different ''pari passu'' clause, omitting the transferability clause, including anti-assignment clauses (e.g., a clause providing that assignees could only recover the amount actually paid rather than face value of the debt), or writing the contract under the law of a different jurisdiction altogether, with the understanding that rational investors would have demanded higher interest rates in exchange for any of these things.

After refuting all of Argentina's arguments on the merits, the Second Circuit concluded: "We do not believe the outcome of this case threatens to steer bond issuers away from the New York marketplace ... We believe that the interest — one widely shared in the financial community — in maintaining New York's status as one of the foremost commercial centers is advanced by requiring debtors, including foreign debtors, to pay their debts."&lt;ref name="NMLCapital2"/&gt;

Notably, when it came to looking at big-picture public policy issues, both Second Circuit opinions examined them only through the lens of federal procedural law (i.e., whether the injunctions were an inequitable remedy) as opposed to the substantive rules of New York state contractual law. Although New York recognizes several defenses to the enforceability of a contract like [[unconscionability]], those defenses are usually available only to the weaker party at the time of contract formation, the party who did ''not'' write the contract (i.e., the bondholders), which explains why they were not discussed in the Second Circuit's opinions. If those defenses are unavailable (for example, because the party resisting enforcement was the one who wrote the contract), New York courts will mechanically enforce the plain language of a contract regardless of its harshness because "a court is not free to alter the contract to reflect its personal notions of fairness and equity."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3663883735767166212 Greenfield v. Philles Records]'', 98 N.Y.2d 562, 570 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina 2014 "selective default"===
The ''Pari passu'' ruling had a grave impact on Argentina's route out of economic difficulty. The issue perceived by Argentina was that the agreement also included a "[[rights upon future offers]]" ("RUFO") clause. The effect of such a clause was that, if a later settlement paid more, or on better terms, all existing settlements would be repaid on the improved terms. This was intended to reassure bondholders that it was safe to settle early, and reduce the incentive to hold out for a better later offer.

As a result of the earlier rulings for the holdout bondholders, Argentina now faced a situation whereby:
# The 7% of bonds held by the "Holdout" bondholders had to be paid at full face value, whereas the other 93% had agreed to be repaid around 30% of the bonds' face value;
# The 93% of renegotiated bonds could not have repayments made without also making repayments (on a larger scale) to the 7% of holdouts;
# Any repayments to the holdouts related to full face value would potentially trigger all earlier bondholders being entitled to repayments at full face value as well, effectively unwinding the entire intent of the renegotiations of 2000 - 2010, and creating an extra liability of $100 billion that Argentina could not afford to incur.

The U.S. judicial ''pari passu'' ruling therefore forced Argentina to miss the scheduled bond payments being managed from New York, as from July 30, 2014 (bonds issued under Argentine law (paid through [[Citibank Argentina]])&lt;ref name=muddled/&gt; and bonds issued under European Law (paid through [[Euroclear]] and [[Clearstream]]), were not affected.&lt;ref name=Europe/&gt;). This in turn caused Argentina to be declared in selective default by [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] and in restricted default by [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]], meaning that some Argentine bondholders were receiving payment while others now weren't.&lt;ref name=selective/&gt;

===Responses to the ruling and 2014 default===

====By Argentina====
President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] stated after the latter denial of certiorari that her country had an obligation to pay its creditors, but not to become the victims of [[extortion]] by speculators; even if Argentina can't use the U.S. financial system to do so, she said, teams of experts are working on ways to avoid such a default and keep Argentina's promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 June 2014|website= www.sfgate.com|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/politics/article/High-court-rejects-Argentina-s-appeal-over-debt-5555358.php|title=Argentina: Won't submit to 'extortion' on debt|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expiration of Rights Upon Future Offers ([[RUFO]]) in December 2014 will preclude other bondholders from suing for better terms should the Argentine Government and the vulture funds settle, making such a settlement all the more likely after that date should the dispute continue.&lt;ref name=bae/&gt;

=====International Court of Justice case=====
In August 2014, Argentina filed a case at the [[International Court of Justice]], alleging that through its court system's decision, the United States had "violat[ed] its sovereign immunity" and breached "[the] obligation not to use or encourage measures of economic and political action to force the sovereign will of another State",&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;[http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2014/08/07/argentina-solicita-demanda-contra-ee-uu-en-la-haya/ Argentina solicita un proceso contra EE.UU. en La Haya] ["Argentina requests a lawsuit against USA at The Hague"], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wjs1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-sues-u-s-in-international-court-of-justice-over-debt-dispute-1407431003|title=Argentina Sues U.S. in International Court of Justice Over Debt Dispute|author=Ken Parks|date=7 August 2014|work=WSJ|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was responsible for permitting judicial [[malpractice]] and [[Competence (law)|gross incompetence]] in allowing two small hedge funds to trigger a needless default against most other bondholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/11004486/Argentina-accuses-US-of-judicial-malpractice-for-triggering-needless-default.html|title=Argentina accuses US of judicial malpractice for triggering needless default|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information was likewise requested from the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] concerning the possibility of [[securities fraud]] involving the bonds by plaintiffs in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/english/notas/201408/2874-argentina-will-request-the-us-securities-exchange-commission-to-investigate-financial-fraud.html|title=Argentina will request the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to investigate financial fraud|work=Telam|date=4 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050722/http://www.telam.com.ar/english/notas/201408/2874-argentina-will-request-the-us-securities-exchange-commission-to-investigate-financial-fraud.html|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers note that the United States must consent to the case being heard, which has only happened 22 times in the ICJ's 68 years of existence,&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt;&lt;ref name=wjs1/&gt; and a Latin American and international law specialist at [[Oxford Analytica]] observed to media that, "From the point of view of the U.S. government, the New York court system has dealt with a contractual dispute in which the executive [branch] cannot intervene.

====Financial responses====
Large banks, investors, and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] objected to the federal courts' decisions and expressed concern over losses that could be incurred by bondholders and others, as well over disruption in the bond markets. Vladimir Werning, executive director for Latin American research at [[JPMorgan Chase]], observed that vulture funds "are trying to block the payments system" in the United States itself, something "unprecedented in the New York jurisdiction." Kevin Heine, a spokesman for [[Bank of New York Mellon]], which handles Argentina's international bond payments, said the ruling "will create unrest in the credit markets and result in cascades of litigation, which is precisely the opposite effect that an injunction should have."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The [[American Bankers Association]] agreed, noting that "permitting injunctions that preclude pre-existing obligations whenever expedient to enforce a judgment against the debtor will have significantly adverse consequences for the financial system."&lt;ref name=aba/&gt;

A consortium of Argentine banks, led by Argentine Banking Association (Adeba) President [[Jorge Horacio Brito|Jorge Brito]], meanwhile presented their own settlement offer on July 30, by which all vulture fund bond holdings in dispute would be purchased in installments for a total of US$1.4 billion, but the offer was refused; [[Citibank]], [[JP Morgan Chase]], and [[HSBC]] joined efforts to repurchase vulture fund holdings on August 1.&lt;ref name="Ambito_Intermeido_2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=751755|title=Cuarto intermedio en NY por acuerdo entre privados|work=Ámbito|date=30 July 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]], of which Singer's Elliott hedge fund is one of 15 bank members, granted Singer and fellow vulture fund plaintiff Aurelius Capital [[Credit default swap|CDS]] insurance payout of $1 billion on August 1.&lt;ref name=swaps/&gt;

==Impact of deadlocked bond repayments==

===Impact on Argentina===
The dispute limited Argentina's access to foreign credit markets as well; in October 2012 Argentina's theoretical borrowing costs were 10.7%, double the average for developing countries.&lt;ref name=Benson/&gt; Although Argentina has not raised money on the money markets since the default, the state-owned oil company [[YPF]] has already placed debt in the financial markets to finance its investment program in years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmneuquen.com.ar/noticias/2012/11/9/ypf-coloco-deuda-por-750-millones-de-pesos_168182|title=YPF colocó deuda por 750 millones de pesos|work=La Mañana Neuquén|date=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider implications for the financial system===
The possibility that holdout creditors can attach future payments on restructured debt and receive better treatment than cooperating creditors distorts incentives, can derail efforts for a cooperative restructuring,&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; and may ultimately lead to the United States no longer being viewed as a safe place to issue sovereign debt.&lt;ref name=stiglitz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/argentina-s-debt-and-american-courts-by-joseph-e--stiglitz|title=The Vultures' Victory|author=Joseph Stiglitz|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Circuit has acknowledged that New York Judiciary Law Section 489 (descended from an 1813 statute) appears to facially prohibit "essentially all 'secondary' transactions in debt instruments where the purchaser had an intent to enforce the debt obligation through litigation," but then ruled in a 1999 decision involving Elliott Management's earlier case against Peru that the history of that section as interpreted in New York state courts revealed that it was intended only to prohibit purchases made with the ''sole'' intent of bringing a lawsuit ''in and of itself''.&lt;ref name="ElliottAssoc"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7537030642058084794 Elliott Associates, LP v. Banco De La Nacion],'' 194 F. 3d 363, 372 (2nd Cir. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the New York Legislature was trying to stop attorneys or debt collectors from exploiting cost-shifting clauses in worthless promissory notes to obtain judgments for minuscule amounts (i.e., the face value of the notes) that also awarded massive costs incurred in the course of litigation.&lt;ref name="ElliottAssoc"/&gt; Section 489 does not apply to purchases made with the primary intent of collecting on the face value of the instrument, where litigation is merely a means to that end.&lt;ref name="ElliottAssoc"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom]], however, permanently banned the use of its courts for suits by vulture funds in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Al Jazeera America]]|url= http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/3/22/the-end-of-vulturefunds.html|title=The end of vulture funds?|date=22 March 2014|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 70% of the world's sovereign bonds are issued in New York, and 22% in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=12142|title=US Courts Defend Rights of Vulture Funds Over Argentina|work=[[The Real News]]|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Reuters]]'' in 2013, the case is likely to be of particular importance in cases in which the creditors are being asked to accept substantial debt and debt service reduction, though it is unclear given the special circumstances of the Elliot/NML case whether it will be broadly applicable to holdouts in other restructurings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/08/23/elliott-vs-argentina-its-not-over-yet/|title=Elliott vs Argentina: It's not over yet|author=Felix Salmon|agency=Reuters|date=August 23, 2013|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Bankers Association]] warned that the district court's interpretation of the [[Pari passu|equal terms]] provision could enable a single creditor to thwart the implementation of an internationally supported restructuring plan, and thereby undermine the decades of effort the United States has expended to encourage a system of cooperative resolution of sovereign debt crises.&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;

==Presidency of Mauricio Macri and default end (2015-2016)==

[[Mauricio Macri]] was elected president of Argentina in November 2015. He sought to negotiate with the holdouts and end the default, in order to return to the international capital markets and benefit the national economy.&lt;ref name="FT_DealHoldouts"/&gt; In early 2016, US courts ruled that Argentina must make full payments to four "holdout bondholders" (NML, [[Aurelius Capital Management]], [[Davidson Kempner Capital Management]], and [[Bracebridge Capital]]) by February 29.&lt;ref name="nytimesgilbertargentinareachesdeal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Jonathan|last2=Stevenson|first2=Alexandra|title=Argentina Reaches Deal With Hedge Funds Over Debt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/business/dealbook/argentina-reaches-deal-with-hedge-funds-over-debt.html|accessdate=March 11, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=February 29, 2016|quote=The four holdout firms, including Aurelius, a hedge fund run by Mark Brodsky, a former trader at Mr. Singer’s Elliott Management; Davidson Kempner; and Bracebridge Capital, have agreed not to try to prevent Argentina from raising new money, which it will need to do in order to pay the settlements it has made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina made an offer to pay $6.5 billion to settle lawsuits on February 5, requesting that the prior ruling on payments be lifted.&lt;ref name="NYT_dealbook_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/business/dealbook/hedge-funds-dealt-setback-as-us-sides-with-argentina.html?ref=world | title=Hedge Funds Dealt Setback as U.S. Sides With Argentina on Defaulted Bonds | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 24, 2016 | accessdate=March 25, 2016 | author=Stevenson, Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Pollack announced in February 2016 that Argentina had reached an agreement with Paul Singer.

Although ''[[Cambiemos]]'', Macri's political coalition, did not have a majority at either house of the Congress, the bill was approved by both of them in March. Many Peronist legislators supported it because the province governors would also benefit from access to international credit markets. With the bill approved, Argentina faced a court hearing in New York on April 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1c1f696c-f6fc-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44U7q7YSm|title=Argentina clears way for repayment of ‘holdout’ creditors|author=Benedict Mander|date=March 31, 2016|work=Financial Times|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court confirmed the ruling of Griesa, and allowed Argentina to pay to the bondholders of 2005, 2010 and those that were still in default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1888930-la-corte-de-nueva-york-confentina |title=La Corte de Nueva York confirmó la orden de Thomas Griesa para que la Argentina salga del default |trans-title=The Court of New York confirmed the order of Thomas Griesa for Argentina to leave the default|language=Spanish|author=Rafael Mathus Ruiz|work=La Nacion|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The payment will be done with a bond sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/04/13/us-court-ruling-allows-argentina-bond-sale-to-proceed/|title=US court ruling allows Argentina bond sale to proceed|date=April 13, 2016|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeared to the media to be the end of the Argentine default, which had started in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-13/argentina-wins-court-ruling-letting-bond-sale-proceed|title= Argentina Wins Court Ruling Letting Bond Sale Proceed|author= Bob Van Voris|date=April 13, 2016|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nearly US$1 billion in defaulted bonds remained unpaid, which resulted in continuing though less publicised litigation.  Argentina finally reported in November 2016 that it had reached agreements to pay US$475 million to settle the outstanding defaulted debt.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"/&gt; In January 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that the [[MSCI]] index would be considering re-accepting Argentina’s shares over 2017, and on January 5, [[JPMorgan Chase]] also said it would admit Argentina into its benchmark indices early in the year.&lt;ref name="Economist_Bonds_2017"&gt;{{Citation

In [[telecommunication]], '''automated information systems security''' comprises measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and [[availability]] of the [[information]] processed and stored by [[automated information system]]s. The unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction may be accidental or intentional.

Automated [[information systems security]] includes consideration of all [[computer hardware]] and [[software]] functions, characteristics and features; operational procedures; accountability procedures; and [[access control]]s at the central [[computer]] facility, remote computer, and [[computer terminal|terminal]] facilities; management constraints; physical structures and devices, such as computers, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] lines, and [[Electric power|power]] sources; and personnel and [[telecommunication|communications]] controls needed to provide an acceptable level of risk for the [[automated information system]] and for the [[data]] and information contained in the system. Automated information systems security also includes the totality of security safeguards needed to provide an acceptable protection level for an automated information system and for the data handled by an automated information system.

In [[information security]], automated information systems security is a synonym for [[computer security]].

The '''Azanian People's Liberation Army''' ('''APLA'''), formerly known as '''Poqo''',&lt;ref name="trc-submission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/hrvtrans/submit/apla.htm|title=TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION|author=|date=|website=www.justice.gov.za|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082219/http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/hrvtrans/submit/apla.htm|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the military wing of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]], an [[African nationalist]] movement in [[South Africa]].

After attacks on and the murder of several white families the APLA was subsequently classified as a [[terrorist organisation]] by the South African [[National Party (South Africa)|National]] government and the United States, and banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/themes.php?t=Umkhonto%20we%20Sizwe|title=The African National Congress website - Umkhonto we Sizwe|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033111/http://anc.org.za/themes.php?t=Umkhonto%20we%20Sizwe|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APLA was disbanded and integrated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF) in June 1994.&lt;ref name="South African History Online: Pan Africanist Congress timeline 1959-2011"/&gt;

==Etymology==
In 1968 the "Azanian People's Liberation Army" replaced defunct "Poqo" as the armed wing of the PAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv03445/04lv03446/05lv03451.htm|title=Azanian People'S Liberation Army (APLA) - The O'Malley Archives|author=|date=|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228020000/https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv03445/04lv03446/05lv03451.htm|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was derived from '''Azania''', the ancient Greek name for Southern Africa.

Azania is the name that has been applied to various parts of southeastern tropical [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Amalgamating eastern Gondwana: The evolution of the Circum-Indian Orogens|last = Collins &amp; Pisarevsky|first = |date = 2004|journal = Earth-Science Reviews|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period and perhaps earlier, the toponym referred to a portion of the Southeast African coast extending from [[Kenya]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia'', (Lalibela House: 1961), p.21&lt;/ref&gt; to perhaps as far south as [[Tanzania]].

==History==

===Formation and early resistance===
{{see also|Sharpeville massacre}}

Poqo was founded in 1961 following the [[Sharpeville massacre|massacre of PAC-led protestors]] at the hands of police outside the [[Sharpeville]] police station the previous year.&lt;ref name="trc-submission" /&gt; [[Potlako Leballo]], the chairman of the PAC at the time of the formation of its military wing in the 1960s, modelled APLA on the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]], with [[Templeton Ntantala]] as his deputy.

Members of Poqo targeted the town of [[Paarl]] in the [[Western Cape]] on 22 November 1962, when a crowd of over 200 people armed with axes, [[Machete|panga]]s and other home-made weapons marched from the Mbekweni [[township (South Africa)|township]] into Paarl and attacked the police station, homes and shops.&lt;ref name="South African History Online: Paarl"&gt;{{cite web |title =Violence erupts in Paarl |url =http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/violence-erupts-paarl |website =South African History Online |date = |accessdate =17 October 2015 |deadurl =no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160113164541/http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/violence-erupts-paarl |archivedate =13 January 2016 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two white residents, Frans Richard and Rencia Vermeulen were killed.&lt;ref name="South African History Online: Paarl"/&gt; This attack was followed by the murder of a family camping at [[Mbhashe River|Bashee River]] in the [[Transkei]] on 4 February 1963. Norman and Elizabeth Grobbelaar, their teenage daughters Edna and Dawn, together with Mr Derek Thompson, were hacked to death in their caravans.&lt;ref name="South African History Online: Poqo"&gt;{{cite web |title =Poqo |url =http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/poqo |website =South African History Online |date = |accessdate =17 October 2015 |deadurl =no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150922213121/http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/poqo |archivedate =22 September 2015 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership struggles in exile===
After the [[Soweto uprising]] in 1976, a number of students went into exile in APLA camps elsewhere on the African continent. In 1976, APLA received 500 recruits, including 178 [[Basotho]], for a new [[Lesotho Liberation Army]] (LLA), to be formed as an offshoot of the exiled-[[Basutoland Congress Party]] under the leadership of [[Matooane Mapefane]], who was a senior instructor of APLA in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenberg|first1=Scott|last2=Weisfelder|first2=Richard F.|date=2013|title=Historical Dictionary of Lesotho|location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]]|page=252|isbn=081-087-982-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Ntantala's original group of 70 APLA soldiers felt threatened by the influx of new recruits, leading Ntantala to attempt a [[coup]] against then commander, [[Potlako Leballo]] in [[Dar es Salaam]]. This was prevented by LLA soldiers, a move which exacerbated tensions within two PAC factions,&lt;ref name="Trust2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=South African Democracy Education Trust|title=The Road to Democracy in South Africa: 1970-1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGE-XB5QlD8C&amp;pg=PR17|year=2004|publisher=Unisa Press|isbn=978-1-86888-406-3|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "Diplomat-Reformist" (DR) and "Maoist-Revolutionary" (MR) factions. [[Vusumzi Make]]'s appointment as Leballo's successor sparked a mutiny at [[Chunya]], an APLA camp in Tanzania, on 11 March 1980, during which several APLA forces were killed and the rest further factionalised and confined to different camps; many escaped to Kenya.&lt;ref name="Kondlo2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kwandiwe Kondlo|title=In the Twilight of the Revolution: The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) 1959-1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZCPAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209|year=2009|publisher=Basler Afrika Bibliographien|isbn=978-3-905758-12-2|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leballo himself relocated to [[Zimbabwe]] in late 1980 along with senior intelligence and air force personnel from the MR faction. Pressure from Tanzania, however, resulted in his deportation in May–June 1981,&lt;ref name="Potlako Leballo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Potlako Leballo |url=http://memim.com/potlako-leballo.html |website=MEMIM Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=20 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073148/http://memim.com/potlako-leballo.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the deportation or imprisonment of the others. Make was replaced by [[John Nyathi Pokela]]&lt;ref name="Kondlo2009"/&gt; (who was released from [[Robben Island]] in 1980), but his ineffectual term of office was marred by further mutinies, executions and assassinations. Following Pokela’s death, Leballo made a comeback through support from Libya, North Korea and Ghana. After his sudden death in January 1986, the DR faction, outmaneuvered by the ANC, fell into disarray leaving behind the legacy of a semi-national socialist political front.

===Attacks on white civilians===
After 1986, APLA rejected the MR faction's concept of the guerrilla as a social reformer and instead adopted an ultimately disastrous rallying cry of "[[One Settler, One Bullet]]". In the 1990–94 period, the organisation became known for its attacks on civilians despite the progress in negotiations at the [[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]].&lt;ref name="South African History Online: Pan Africanist Congress timeline 1959-2011"&gt;{{cite web |title =Pan Africanist Congress timeline 1959-2011 |url =http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/pan-africanist-congress-timeline-1959-2011 |website =South African History Online |date = |accessdate =17 October 2015 |deadurl =no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151114203631/http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/pan-africanist-congress-timeline-1959-2011 |archivedate =14 November 2015 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the APLA’s chief commander, Sabelo Phama, declared that he "would aim his guns at children - to hurt whites where it hurts most." &lt;ref name="Truth Commission Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume2/chapter7/subsection36.htm|title=Truth Commission - Special Report - TRC Final Report - Volume 2, Section 1, Chapter|author=|date=|website=sabctrc.saha.org.za|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064438/http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume2/chapter7/subsection36.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phama proclaimed 1993 as "The Year of the Great Storm" and sanctioned the following attacks on civilians:

*[[King William’s Town Golf Club]] on 28 November 1992, killing four people.&lt;ref name="TRC final report - Volume 2 Chapter 7 Subsection 37"&gt;{{cite web|title =TRC final report - Volume 2 Chapter 7 Subsection 37|url =http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume2/chapter7/subsection37.htm&amp;tab=report|website =SABC|date =|accessdate =17 October 2015|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125338/http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume2/chapter7/subsection37.htm%26tab%3Dreport|archivedate =4 March 2016|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Highgate Hotel in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] on 1 May 1993, killing five people.&lt;ref name="TRC final report - Volume 2 Chapter 7 Subsection 37"/&gt;
*[[Saint James Church massacre]] in [[Kenilworth, Cape Town|Kenilworth]] on 25 July 1993, killing 11 people during a church service.&lt;ref name="Truth Commission Report"/&gt; 
*[[Heidelberg Tavern Massacre]] in [[Observatory, Cape Town|Observatory]] on 31 December 1993, killing four.&lt;ref name="Truth Commission Report"/&gt;
*[[Mdantsane]] on 11 March 1994, killing three [[Iran]]ians for being 'white'. APLA took responsibility for the attacks, stating that: "The men were shot to show there is no role in the new South Africa for any one of the race that invented apartheid or suppressed the black masses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/28182038/South_Africa_and_Iran_in_the_Apartheid_Era|title=South Africa and Iran in the Apartheid Era|first=Chehabi,|last=H.E.|date=|website=academia.edu|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total thirty-two applications were received for attacks on civilians. In these incidents, 24 people were killed and 122 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/originals/finalreport/volume6/html/BMvolume6_s5ch5.htm TRC Final Report, 6:5:5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122114109/http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/originals/finalreport/volume6/html/BMvolume6_s5ch5.htm |date=2015-11-22 }}, as presented by the [[SABC]] and the [[South African History Archive]]. (SAHA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] has presently charged that PAC-sanctioned action directed towards white South Africans were "gross violations of human rights for which the PAC and APLA leadership are held to be morally and politically responsible and accountable".

===End of the armed struggle===
In spite of their failure to achieve their goals at the negotiated settlements to end apartheid, the PAC decided to participate in the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 elections]], and PAC leader [[Clarence Makwetu]] ordered APLA to end its armed struggle.&lt;ref name="mg_backwards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-24-sa-has-moved-backwards-says-pac-stalwart-makwetu |title=SA has moved backwards, says PAC stalwart Makwetu |publisher=Mail and Guardian |accessdate=3 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412081238/http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-24-sa-has-moved-backwards-says-pac-stalwart-makwetu |archivedate=12 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1994===
In 1994, APLA was disbanded and absorbed into the new [[South African National Defence Force]], although members of the MR-faction refused to accept this agreement. Attempts by MR officers to regroup in [[Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], and [[China]] were unsuccessful, although links were maintained with the [[Tamil Tigers]] and Maoist groups in Nepal and India.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Occasional propaganda leaflets distributed within South Africa focus on disparity of wealth and the issue of land.

'''''Bowman v United Kingdom''''' [1998] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/4.html ECHR 4] is a [[UK constitutional law]] case, concerning the legitimate limits on campaign finance spending. A majority of the court held that countries joined to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] may be required to permit minimal levels of campaign spending. The minority held that the [[United Kingdom]]'s near total ban on election-related spending should be regarded as compatible with [[ECHR article 10]].

The principle in ''Bowman'' stands in contrast to the unlimited spending at elections that the [[US Supreme Court]] opened up by ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|424|1|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a majority struck down parts of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]], and the licence of corporations to donate money as a protected right of "free speech" in ''[[Citizens United v FEC]]'', with or without authorisation by their stakeholders.

==Facts==
Phyllis Bowman, an anti-abortion campaigner, distributed 25,000 leaflets in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] before the 1992 general election on the positions of three candidates on [[abortion]]. She was prosecuted under the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] section 75 for the offence of spending more than £5 on publications aiming to promote a candidate six weeks before an election, without authorisation. She was acquitted because the summons was issued out of time. However, Bowman contended at the European Court of Human Rights that her prosecution was an unjustifiable interference with her [[freedom of expression]] under the [[European Convention on Human Rights, article 10]].

==Judgement==
The majority of fourteen out of twenty judges on the European Court of Human Rights held there was a violation of [[ECHR article 10]]. The [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] section 75 was an indirect restriction freedom of expression. The restriction was prescribed by law, and pursued a legitimate aim of protecting others' rights: candidates and the electorate, by seeking to secure equality among candidates. Freedom of expression and the right to free elections were the foundation of a democratic system, but election spending could undermine equal elections. However, a £5 spending limit was practically an absolute bar on distributing information to influence voters. Given the lack of restrictions on political parties, it was not a proportionate response to secure equality between the candidates.

{{Cquote|42. Free elections and freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political debate, together form the bedrock of any democratic system. The two rights are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other: for example, as the court has observed in the past, freedom of expression is one of the ‘conditions’ necessary to ‘ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature’. For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely.}}

The '''Bureau of Energy Resources''' ('''ENR''') is an agency in the [[United States Department of State]] that coordinates the department's efforts in promoting international [[energy security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Keith|title=U.S. Brings Diplomacy to Politics Of Energy|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203503204577040503083257554|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Suzanne|title=Energy resource bureau aims to bring State Department out of the dark ages |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/nov/21/state-department-energy-resource-department|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 21, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bureau is under the purview of the [[Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department Organization Chart |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/99494.htm|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=March 2014|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Bureau of Energy Resources is Assistant Secretary [[Francis R. Fannon]].

==History==
The Bureau of Energy Resources was established in October 2011, following a recommendation in the 2010 [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]] calling on the department to create a bureau uniting diplomatic and programmatic efforts in the global production and use of energy.&lt;ref name="OIG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Department Launches "Bureau of Energy Resources" |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/11/177262.htm|publisher=[[Spokesperson for the United States Department of State]]|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State Department's New Bureau of Energy Resources: Shaping America's Global Energy Policy|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/pl/177233.htm|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new bureau combined personnel and assets previously assigned to existing energy-related offices in the department, primarily from what is now the [[Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs]].&lt;ref name="OIG"/&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:ENR chart.png|thumb|right|250px|Organizational chart of the Bureau of Energy Resources]]
The bureau is headed by the Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs, who is appointed by the [[United States Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="OIG"/&gt; Four Deputy Assistant Secretaries also oversee different divisions of the bureau, namely Energy Diplomacy, Energy Transformation, Energy Governance and Access, and Bureau Implementation and Coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureau of Energy Resources (ENR)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0460.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|date=October 22, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six unique offices exist within the bureau:
*Office of Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and Africa
*Office of the Middle East and Asia
*Office of Alternative and Renewable Energy
*Office of Electricity and Energy Efficiency
*Office of Policy Analysis and Public Diplomacy
*Office of Energy Programs

The bureau manages three foreign assistance programs with a total FY 2014 budget of $11.8&amp;nbsp;million in economic support funds. ENR relies heavily on interagency agreements with the Departments of [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], and [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], as well as on contracted private-sector firms, to implement technical assistance.&lt;ref name="OIG"/&gt;

[[File:Carless Days Newspaper Clipping (9397114558).jpg|thumb|Newspaper about clipping carless days]]
'''Carless days''' were introduced by the [[Third National Government of New Zealand]] on 30 July 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/carless-days Remembering carless days] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722142139/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/carless-days |date=22 July 2014 }}", ''NZ history online'', updated 30-Jul-2013. Retrieved 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The enabling legislation was one of several unsuccessful attempts to help the declining New Zealand economy after the [[1979 energy crisis|oil shock]]s of the late 1970s—other such policies included the [[Think Big]] strategy.

==Background==
In this scheme, the owners of all private petrol-powered motor vehicles under {{convert|4400|lb}}, with the exception of motorcycles, were required to refrain from using their car on one day of the week, that day being designated by the owner. Thursday was the most frequently chosen day. Each car displayed a coloured sticker on its windscreen which noted the day on which it could not be used, and infringements were punishable by a hefty fine (stickers were different colours, depending on which day of the week they displayed). Other restrictions were also brought in, including reducing the open-road speed limit from {{convert|100|km/h}} to {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}} and restricting the hours that [[petrol]] could be sold at [[filling station|service stations and garages]].

The first person fined was Gordon Marks of Christchurch, who forgot that at 3.45 am after a post-party nap in his car his "car-less day" had started at 2 am. He was fined $50 rather than the $400 maximum fine. Journalist Richard Griffin said that ''it was a bit like drunk driving - if you could get away with it you did. There was no stigma attached .... &lt;ref&gt; ''Dominion Post'', July 29 2017 page A12: "Couldn't car-less" &lt;/ref&gt;

The carless days scheme was highly unpopular, and largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M., "[https://www.flickr.com/photos/archivesnz/9397114558/ Carless days scheme is taking motorists for a ride]", ''Sunday News'', 3 February 1980, Retrieved 20 July 2014. (Flickr image of article, from Archives New Zealand)&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted less than a year, being scrapped in May 1980,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/carless-days-introduced Carless days introduced]", ''NZ history online'', updated 30-Jul-2013. Retrieved 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; though the 80&amp;nbsp;km/h limit remained for several years. The legislation was a failure for a number of reasons. Most importantly, exemptions were allowed, indicated by an exemption sticker. A [[black market]] for exemption stickers and imitations of them quickly developed, rendering the scheme unworkable. There was also a distinct problem in inequality—households that could afford to run two cars could simply choose different days for the two cars and continue to drive on all seven days as before. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence of people driving considerably greater mileages to achieve their daily travel needs on days they had the use of one car rather than two.

The '''Casitas del Sur case''' refers to the disappearance of several minors from children's refuges operated by the religious organization Iglesia Cristiana Restaurada (Restored Christian Church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/14session/A.HRC.14.32.Add1.pdf |title=Mexico |last1=Ezeilo |first1=Joy Ngozi |date= |publisher=[[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |booktitle=Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons |pages=11–13 |conference= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawyer Arrested for Child Trafficking in Mexico |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=14091&amp;ArticleId=418756 |newspaper=Latin American Herald Tribune |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case is a reference to the private [[Mexico City]] shelter 'Casitas del Sur' from which 126 children were rescued in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman Arrested in Mexico on Child-Trafficking Charges |author=[[EFE]] |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=14091&amp;ArticleId=476767 |newspaper=Latin American Herald Tribune |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 'Casitas del Sur' shelter, minors were reported missing from Centro de Adaptación e Integración Familiar A.C.

[[File:Casitas del Sur Missing Children March.jpg|thumb|300px|A rally for the missing children.]]
The case began to surface in 2005, when irregularities in La Casita shelter in Cancún were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Los responsables están avalados por el gobierno |first=Gastón |last=Pardo |url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article126095.html |newspaper=[[Voltaire Network]] |date=13 August 2005 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case became more publicized in late 2008 when ten-year-old Ilse Michel Curiel Martínez was not found in the Casitas del Sur shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Investiga PGJDF desaparición de niña enviada a casa hogar |url= |newspaper=[[Notimex]] |date=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Martinez was taken to a temporary shelter of the Mexico City Attorney General’s Office (PGJDF) due to an alleged case of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Busca2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Busca PGJDF en Morelos a niña desaparecida de casa hogar |url= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |date=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was sent to the Casitas del Sur shelter while the case was settled in the court. When the charges were dropped, the judge requested the release of the minor to her grandmother but shelter staff rejected the request. On 31 October 2008, government officials went to the property to request the release of the minor, but their entry was denied.&lt;ref name="Busca2008" /&gt; After obtaining a search warrant, police entered the facility to look for the minor but were unable to find her. 

Police suspect the minor had been transferred to the state of Morelos.&lt;ref name="Busca2008" /&gt; Local [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] congressman Agustín Castilla Marroquín filed a criminal complaint against the director of the temporary shelter, Lorena González, that transferred Ilse Michell to Casitas del Sur and demanded that she be relieved of her duties for her possible involvement in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Denuncian a directora de albergue de PGJDF por desaparición de niña |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; González denied having transferred the child to Casitas del Sur saying it was the responsibility of the district attorney's office.&lt;ref name="Sierra2009"&gt;{{cite news |title='Pierden' a otra niña en Casitas del Sur |first=Arturo |last=Sierra |url= |newspaper=Reforma |date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a second girl was reported missing on 27 January 2009, local PAN congressman Agustín Castilla charged public officials with negligence and complicity saying personnel from the District Attorney's office warned the shelter of the searches so that the minors could be removed from the facilities.&lt;ref name="Sierra2009" /&gt;

The children repeated phrases such as "Here only the almighty God exists, and here it all ends", leading officials to believe that the minors were encouraged to participate in a mass suicide.&lt;ref name="Sierra2009" /&gt; Police believed the children were subjected to severe religious indoctrination and transferred the 126 minors to the [[National System for Integral Family Development]] to undergo medical and psychological studies.&lt;ref name="Mendoza2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piden a PGJDF investigar operación de albergues "Casitas del Sur" |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were reluctant to provide information to psychologists.&lt;ref name="Sierra2009" /&gt; Officials discovered that children received no outside schooling and were forced to participate in long hours of prayer.&lt;ref name="Sierra2009" /&gt; A rescued girl initially identified herself as Martinez, but later identified as another minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Motiva cateo desaparición de ocho niños |first=Henia |last=Prado |url= |newspaper=Reforma |date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA tests performed on the minor gave a negative result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Desconoce PGJDF paradero de niña retenida por Casitas del Sur |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |date=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven shelter employees with arrested and charged with [[obstruction of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asegura PGJDF a 116 niños de casas-hogar en investigación |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2014 Ilse Michel arrived alone in a taxi to the offices of the [[National System for Integral Family Development]] in Ecatepec, Mexico. She reunited with her grandmother after spending five years with a couple who told her she had been abandoned. As of March 2014, eight children remain missing.

A '''cessavit''' was a [[writ]] in [[English law]], originating in Stat. 6 [[Edward I of England|Edw. I.]], given by statute to recover lands when the [[Tenant farmer|tenant]] has for two years failed to perform the conditions of his tenure. It was abolished in 3 and 4 [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Wm. IV]]. The forms and species of this writ were various; such as, ''cessavit de cantaria'', ''cessavit de feodifirma'', and ''cessavit per biennium''. 

An example can be seen in a Plea Roll of the Court of Common Pleas, in 1430, where Robert Gryttone, abbot of Colchester St John, is suing Nicholas Peke. The words can be seen in the third line as "p. biennium iam cessavit". &lt;ref&gt; National Archives; CP 40/677; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no677/bCP40no677dorses/IMG_0991.htm; first entry, (in Latin) &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ethnic Omaha sidebar}}

The '''Civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska''', has roots that extend back until at least 1912. With a history of [[Racial Tension in Omaha, Nebraska|racial tension]] that starts before the [[History of Omaha, Nebraska|founding of the city]], Omaha has been the home of numerous overt efforts related to securing [[civil rights]] for [[African Americans in Omaha, Nebraska|African Americans]] since at least the 1920s.

==Background==
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}
Prior to the formal founding of the civil rights movement in Omaha, several African Americans secured status that was relevant to later struggles. While the civil rights movement proper did not begin until the 1940s, the historical significance of Omaha in securing civil rights for a variety of American people could be said to start in 1876.

That year stands out in the [[American civil rights movement (1896–1954)|American civil rights movement]] as Omaha became the location of the pivotal 1876 trial of ''[[Standing Bear v. Crook]]''. In that trial a U.S. district court judge at [[Fort Omaha]] set U.S. legal precedent by recognising the personhood of Native Americans, thereby granting American Indians the rights of citizens. With [[Standing Bear]], a [[Ponca]] chief on trial, local journalist [[Thomas Tibbles]], Omaha [[Susette LaFlesche]] and [[General Crook]] himself testified on behalf of acknowledging Native American rights. For the first time, a U.S. court had ruled that an Indian was, officially, a person. Standing Bear won the case, securing the right of his tribe to leave their [[Indian Territory]] reservation and return to their Nebraska homelands.&lt;ref name="Bristow, D. 2002"&gt;Bristow, D. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first record of community violence against blacks in Omaha occurred in 1891, when an African American man called [[Joe Coe]] was lynched by a vigilante mob for allegedly raping a [[Caucasian race|white]] girl.&lt;ref name="Bristow, D. 2002"/&gt; Another lynching occurred in 1919 when a white mob stormed the [[Douglas County Courthouse (Omaha)|Douglas County Courthouse]] to take [[Willy Brown]], an African American accused of raping a young white woman. While these incidents terrified the population of African Americans in the community and effectively segregated them from the rest of the city,&lt;ref&gt;(1994) ''Street of Dreams.''

==Early years==
With early 20th century growth in the number of African American migrants recruited by the meatpacking industry, the population doubled from 1910 to 1920. Some groups in the city resisted such changes.  Some public places discriminated against African Americans, although segregation was not legal.  Up to the 1940s and 1950s, many of the city's restaurants were effectively segregated, with signs that stated, "We Don't Serve Any Colored Race."&lt;ref name="Preston-Love"&gt;[[Preston Love]] reported seeing this sign repeatedly in Omaha cafes in the 1940s and 1950s in Bristow, D. (n.d.) [http://www.nebraskalife.com/PrestonLove.asp Swingin' with Preston Love] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216015157/http://www.nebraskalife.com/PrestonLove.asp |date=2007-02-16 }}. ''Nebraska Life.''&lt;/ref&gt;

An early organized effort for civil rights in Omaha was the creation of the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1912, Episcopal minister, Father [[John Albert Williams]] playing the role of first president.&lt;ref&gt;Omaha At a Glance, Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), Tuesday, June 17, 1919, Page: 12&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, leadership and membership were integrated. The chapter has continued.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)[http://www.ketv.com/150thbirthday/3400699/detail.html Timeline: Omaha's 150th Birthday.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091526/http://www.ketv.com/150thbirthday/3400699/detail.html |date=2007-09-29 }} KETV.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Other civil rights organizations soon formed in Omaha, part of the early 20th century spirit of reform that generated many progressive groups.  In 1917, [[George Wells Parker]] founded the [[Hamitic League of the World]] in Omaha. In 1918 the League published his pamphlet ''Children of the Sun.'' The Hamitic League was committed to black [[nationalism]]. Based in New York, Cyril Briggs became editor of their journal, ''The Crusader''.  It later became the journal of the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB).

In the 1920s, the Baptist minister Earl Little founded the Omaha chapter of [[Marcus Garvey|Marcus Garvey's]] [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].  Little was the father of Malcolm, who later named himself [[Malcolm X]] when he became a Black Muslim minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X was [[Malcolm X House Site|born in Omaha]] in 1925, but his family moved away from the city while he was young.

There are reports of [[African Blood Brotherhood]]-related action in Omaha, particularly around the time of the [[Willy Brown]] lynching.  Witnessing the mob rule that overtook the city at the time of the lynching horrified many people.  One of those who was radicalized was [[Harry Haywood]], who went on to become involved with the African Blood Brotherhood. Later Haywood became a leading African American member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]].  He was active from the 1920s to his death in 1981.

In 1927, the first chapter in the [[American West]] of the [[National Urban League|Urban League]] was founded in Omaha. The chapter was organized at a meeting of white and Black citizens at the Y.M.C.A. and its purpose was "the social and economic betterment of Negro residents and improved relationship between races."&lt;ref&gt;"Urban League Formed." ''Evening World-Herald'' 29 Nov. 1927: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Omaha Urban League (now the [http://www.urbanleagueneb.org/ Urban League of Nebraska]) has been led by many prominent African Americans, including [[Whitney Young|Whitney M. Young, Jr.]] and Thomas H. Warren, Sr. Young quickly tripled the membership of the chapter during his tenure in the 1950s and would eventually lead the National Urban League during the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]]. Warren previously served as the first African-American chief of police for the City of Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://invisiblehistory.ops.org/StudentProjects/2012StudentProjects/Police/tabid/180/Default.aspx|title=Police: A Brotherhood of Black and Blue|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Making Invisible Histories Visible|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urban League of Nebraska continues today.

During this period, the [[National Federation of Colored Women]] had five chapters in North Omaha with more than 750 members. They actively conducted a variety of social, political and charitable work throughout the city of Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;Nebraska Writers Project (n.d. ''est 1938) ''[http://www.memoriallibrary.com/NE/Ethnic/Negro/ Negroes in Nebraska]'' Works Progress Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1920, the Colored Commercial Club organized to help blacks in Omaha secure employment and to encourage business enterprises among African Americans.

The [[South Omaha]] Stockyards employed a large portion of the city's African American workers from the South.  Working conditions there were often brutal.  These workers made significant gains after organizing with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the 1920s.  During the Depression of the 1930s, however, they suffered setbacks when major [[packinghouse]]s closed.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, L. and Cottrell, B.J. (1997) ''The Gate City: A History of Omaha.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, a clandestine group called the [[Knights and Daughters of Tabor]] was founded in Omaha.  Also known as the "[[Knights of Liberty]]", it was a secret African-American organization whose goal was "nothing less than the destruction of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.hariam.org/CASTLE/mosesdickson.htm Moses Dickson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927152443/http://www.hariam.org/CASTLE/mosesdickson.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Mildred Brown]] founded The ''[[Omaha Star]]''.  Starting with a circulation of 6,000, it  quickly became the city's only African-American newspaper, featuring positive news, role models and activities throughout the community. The paper strongly supported the local civil rights movement, for which it often featured successes and highlighted the challenges facing blacks in Omaha.  The ''Star'' reported proudly on the career of Captain Alfonza W. Davis, who fought with the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] during [[World War II]]. He was presumed [[Killed In Action]] when his aircraft disappeared over Germany in 1944.

=== Political representation ===
[[Matthew Ricketts|Matthew Oliver Ricketts]], elected from Omaha in 1892, was Nebraska's first African American state legislator,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Q. (1998) In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. p 205.&lt;/ref&gt; but no other black state legislator was elected until 1926. In August 1906, black members of the Omaha community formed a group called the "Progressive League of Douglas County", Williams president, to pressure the county Republicans to include blacks on the legislative ticket, in particular [[Millard F. Singleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Colored League Formed, Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), Tuesday, August 7, 1906 Page: 6&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, North Omaha sent a succession of African Americans to the State Legislature between the 1920s and WWII, starting with [[John Andrew Singleton]] and [[Ferdinand L. Barnett (Omaha)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]] in 1926,  Dr. [[Aaron Manasses McMillan]] (elected in 1928) and followed by [[Johnny Owen (Nebraska)|Johnny Owen]]. In the first Unicameral in 1937 [[John Adams, Jr (Nebraska)|John Adams, Jr]] was elected (he served from 1935-1941) and was followed by his father, [[John Adams, Sr (Nebraska)|John Adams, Sr]], (served from 1949 until his death in 1962). Adams, Sr was a noted minister of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. John A Singleton, John Adams, Jr, John O. Wood, Andrew Stuart, and Harry Anderson formed the Consolidated Negro Political Organization in March 1933 in an effort to organize black political activity in Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;"Negro Club Endorses Hupkins' Candidacy"; Omaha World Herald; Sunday, March 12, 1933; page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, Jr was a lawyer who frequently was involved in Civil Rights cases and, as a legislator, introduced the state's first public housing law and supported other welfare legislation.&lt;ref name="McMorris"&gt;McMorris, Robert, "Charter Member Once Opposed Unicameral", Omaha World Herald; Saturday, August 28, 1982 ; Page: 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1947–1962 ==

In 1947, a group of students developed the [[DePorres Club]]. Founded at [[Creighton University]],&lt;ref&gt;(1992) ''A Street of Dreams.'' Nebraska ETV Network (video)&lt;/ref&gt; this club included African-American high school students and white [[Creighton University]] students who actively sought to fight racial discrimination in housing and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/stories/0801_0400.html Mildred Brown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234655/http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nebraskastudies.org%2F0800%2Fstories%2F0801_0400.html |date=2014-06-06 }} ''Nebraska Studies.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the offices of the ''Omaha Star'' hosted the DePorres Club after Creighton banned them from campus. The club hosted a community center called the Omaha DePorres Center to meet the needs of low-income families.  It eventually started branches in Denver and Kansas City. According to one historian, "Their goals and tactics foreshadowed the efforts of [[civil rights]] activists throughout the nation in the 1960s."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Q. (2007) [http://www.blackpast.org/?q=timelines/african-american-history-american-west-timeline The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed – Timeline.] Seattle: University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early efforts led by the DePorres Club was the 1952–54 Omaha Bus Boycott. [[Mildred Brown]], a leader of the boycott, extolled readers of the ''Omaha Star'' to "Don't ride Omaha's buses or streetcars. If you must ride, protest by using 18 pennies." Focusing on ending the [[Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Company]]'s policy of not hiring black drivers, the boycott was successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nebraskahistory.org/?p=2361 "Omaha’s Bus Boycott of 1952–54"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184031/http://blog.nebraskahistory.org/?p=2361 |date=2012-03-13 }}, [[Nebraska State Historical Society]]. Retrieved 11/30/10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, a group of African American educators in Omaha Public Schools started a professional caucus called Concerned and Caring Educators that continues to this day. The [[Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] preached at Salem Baptist Church in North Omaha late that same year.

==1963–1971==

During the 1960s, community activists liked to gather at North Omaha neighborhood locations, including the [[Fair Deal Cafe]] on North 24th Street and Goodwin's Spencer Street Barbershop at 3116 N. 24th Street, where young [[Ernie Chambers]] was a barber.&lt;ref&gt;"Cutting the path..."&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable activists important to Omaha's African American community during this period included [[Rowena Moore]], [[Lois Mark Stalvey]], and [[Bertha Calloway]].

In 1963, a group of African American ministers from [[North Omaha]] formed a group called the "Citizens Civic Committee for Civil Liberties", or 4CL. The group rallied throughout the city to demand [[civil rights]] for all African Americans through picketing, stand-ins during city council meetings and other efforts.&lt;ref name="A Street of Dreams."&gt;''A Street of Dreams.''&lt;/ref&gt; They set forth the formal agenda for Omaha's civil rights movement, with three main goals to be achieved through state legislation: to ensure equal housing opportunities and equal job opportunities for African Americans, and to secure integrated schools through busing for all African American students. That year local [[Youth activism|youth activists]] were successful in bringing down the color barrier at [[Peony Park]], the city's main amusement park, after protesting at the admission gates for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Hord, B.

According to the [[Nebraska Legislature]], civil rights demonstrations in Omaha in 1963 led to the creation of the Omaha Human Rights Commission.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.unicam.state.ne.us/bluebook/intro/history.pdf History- Earliest records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231141108/http://www.unicam.state.ne.us/bluebook/intro/history.pdf |date=2006-12-31 }}. State of Nebraska Unicameral.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[A Time for Burning|period documentary]], this commission was set up only to placate civil rights activists, and because of that, failed. 4CL and other groups also saw this Commission as a stalling tactic by Omaha's city leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thereader.com/cover.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1140741807&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; Cutting the path to freedom.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929035820/http://www.thereader.com/cover.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1140741807&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; |date=2007-09-29 }} ''The Reader.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous national civil rights leaders made Omaha a stop on their speaking circuits. After Dr. King spoke in 1958, Malcolm X spoke in Omaha in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Cutting the path.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 [[Robert Kennedy]] visited North Omaha during his presidential campaign and spoke at Creighton University in support of Omaha's civil rights activists.

Starting in 1963, the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity (BANTU) was a unique Omaha [[youth activism]] group that organized African American students in the city's high schools. Focusing on [[black power]] and [[self-determination]], BANTU claimed concessions from the Omaha City Council, with Senator [[Edward Danner|Edward R. Danner]] lobbying the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] on their behalf. BANTU maintained a unique relationship with the Omaha chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP).  This may have included being a recruiting group for the BPP.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, A. M. (2006, Sep) The Omaha Black Panther Party and BANTU: Exploitation or a Relationship of Mutual Convenience  Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, NA, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Black Panthers were actively organizing [[Freedom School]]s in Omaha's public housing projects.  They were blamed for starting several of the riots in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;(1992) ''A Street of Dreams.'' (VHS) Nebraska Public Television.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Black Panther leaders David Rice and Edward Poindexter were charged and convicted of the murder of [[Omaha Police Department|Omaha Police]] Officer Larry Minard with a bomb. Their case continues to be controversial, as Omaha Police allegedly withheld exculpatory evidence at trial. Targeted by the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charles E.

''Very Special Agents''. University of Illinois Press (2001) p 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Achievements of the movement in Omaha included the desegregation of city facilities in the late 1950s, the 1964 event of Omahan [[Gale Sayers]] becoming the first African American NFL player to share a room with a white player,&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, G. "[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9557566 Hall of Fame offers plenty of new intrigue], NFL.com website. Accessed 4/27/07."&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1966 production of the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary ''[[A Time for Burning]]'', which tracked the sentiment of 1960s white Omaha towards African Americans. In 1968 [[Marlin Briscoe]], a football star and graduate of a [[Technical High School (Omaha, Nebraska)|local high school]], became the first black quarterback in the [[American Football League]], and in 1970 local barber and law school graduate [[Ernie Chambers]] was elected to the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] as the newest African American state legislator, preceded by other African Americans [[Edward Danner]], John Adams Sr. and his son John Adams Jr. The Negro History Society formally opened the [[Great Plains Black History Museum]] in 1976 with the goal of celebrating African American contributions to the city and region.

While the Omaha [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s did not gain its goals of passage of state laws to ensure equal housing and job opportunities, it did succeed in securing integrated school busing, and employment with the municipal transit company, for example. The movement also was seen as successful in raising awareness of the inequities facing African Americans in Omaha.&lt;ref name="A Street of Dreams."/&gt;

==1972–present==
[[Image:Martin Luther King cornerstone memorial (Omaha, Nebraska).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Photo of [[Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr]] Cornerstone Memorial at the NW corner of 24th and Lake St in [[North Omaha]].]]

The City of Omaha installed the [[Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr]] Cornerstone Memorial at the NW corner of 24th and Lake Streets in 2002.  In 2003, native Omahan Thomas Warren was named the city's first African American [[Chief of police|police chief]]. His advancement could be seen as part of the political progression of African Americans in the city.

In 2005, Ernie Chambers became the longest-serving State Senator in Nebraska history, with more than 32 years of service to his community and state.  Because of a term-limit bill enacted in the Nebraska State Legislature, Chambers was not to be allowed to run for reelection when his term expired in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (April 25, 2005). For the Record. ''Lincoln Journal Star.'' Retrieved on 24 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[West Omaha]] districts' concerns about schools, Senator Chambers proposed a controversial school separation plan for Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature.  He lobbied to create three districts in the city.  Each was to be drawn along geographic boundaries that loosely correlated to the residential (and racial) housing patterns in the city: African Americans in [[North Omaha]], Hispanic/Latinos in [[South Omaha]], and Caucasians in West Omaha. The State Legislature signed [[Omaha Public Schools#Split the District|this plan]] into law in April 2006.

Within a month, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] brought a [[lawsuit]].  It argued that due to Omaha's racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to the historic case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sam Dillon |title=Schools Plan in Nebraska Is Challenged |publisher=New York Times |date=May 17, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/us/17naacp.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cross Examination Debate Association''' ('''CEDA''') ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|d|ə}} {{respell|SEE|də}}) is the largest intercollegiate [[policy debate]] association in the [[United States]]. Throughout the school year, CEDA sanctions over 60 tournaments throughout the nation, including an annual National Championship Tournament that brings together over 175 individual debate teams from across the nation to compete on the basis of research, persuasive speaking, argumentation, and philosophy.

==History==

Founded in 1971 as the Southwest Cross Examination Debate Association, CEDA is now the primary national association promoting policy topic intercollegiate academic debate. In cooperation with the [[National Debate Tournament]] Committee and the [[American Debate Association]], CEDA formulates the annual intercollegiate policy debate topic used in tournament competition throughout the nation.

CEDA acts as a tournament sanctioning agent, providing through its Constitution and By-Laws a framework for normalizing tournament practices and procedures. Throughout the tournament season, CEDA calculates the National Sweepstakes Standings, the national and regional rankings of member institutions based on compiled tournament results.

CEDA also functions as a professional association for scholars and teachers in the field of applied argumentation and debate. In addition to sponsoring scholarly programs on issues of interest to association members at the annual convention of the [[National Communication Association]], CEDA has organized two indigenous scholarly assessment conferences: The 1991 St. Paul 20th Anniversary Assessment Conference, and the 2001 Tahoe Conference on Academic Debate. CEDA and the NDT co-sponsored a third professional conference, The 2009 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090627165615/http://conference.cedadebate.org/node/2 National Developmental Conference] at Wake Forest University. The 2009 Conference was directed by [http://www.wfu.edu/~louden/ Dr. Allan Louden] of Wake Forest University. The conference proceedings were edited by Louden and published by the International Debate Education Association Press as [https://www.amazon.com/Navigating-Opportunity-Policy-Debate-Century/dp/1932716610 Navigating Opportunity: Policy Debate in the 21st Century].

CEDA also publishes [http://cedadebate.org/CAD/index.php/CAD Contemporary Argumentation and Debate: The Journal of the Cross Examination Debate Association], a refereed scholarly journal that serves as the primary outlet for monographs and essays addressing issues related to the theory and practice of academic debate. The journal is edited by Dr. Jennifer Bevan of Chapman University and Dr. Gordon Stables of the University of Southern California.

For a number of years, CEDA employed a two-person team [[value debate]] format. CEDA utilized two topics each year, one governing the Fall Semester and the second governing the Spring Semester. For the Spring 1996 topic, it was voted&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jonathan/debate/ceda-l/archive/CEDA-L-Dec-1995/msg00254.html&lt;/ref&gt; to continue debating the fall topic about Mexico.  Beginning with the 1996-1997 season, however, CEDA has employed a single, year-long [[policy debate]] topic.

In 1996, the NDT and the [[American Debate Association]] agreed to employ the CEDA topic during their seasons, effectively unifying the organizations.

In the 2013 tournament, the winning team from [[Emporia State University]] was criticized for using personal memoirs and [[hip hop|rap music]] to criticize [[white privilege]] during the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/04/traditional-college-debate-white-privilege/360746/|first=Jessica|last=Carew Kraft|date=April 16, 2014|work=[[The Atlantic]]|title=Hacking Traditional College Debate's White-Privilege Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newark.rutgers.edu/news/collegiate-debaters|author=Ferlanda Fox Nixon|title=Collegiate Debaters Win Two National Championships|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this form of debate argue that rhetorical tools utilized by recent championship teams violated the anti-harassment policies of CEDA and the National Debate Tournament and common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/04/20/prepare-for-outrage-far-left-judges-allow-destruction-of-college-debate-clubs-because-racism/ |date=April 20, 2014|author=Soave, Robby|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|title=Prepare for outrage: Far left judges allow destruction of college debate clubs because RACISM}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEDA President Paul Mabrey points to the value of limited actual formal rules in CEDA debate and the ways that a variety of forms of debate raise the educational value of the activity and call these objections "nothing other than thinly-veiled racism."&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pij5Sg4_DY |title=CEDA Announcement Video|publisher=Cross Examination Debate Association|date=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, despite winning the tournament, the winning team from Towson University was criticized by these observers for referencing racial slurs. In the wake of this controversy, CEDA President Paul Mabrey stated in an official CEDA video of that the accusations of poor preparation and incomprehensibility “...[R]epresent the worst of our human bigotry. These attacks on Towson, Oklahoma, and others in our debate community are motivated by racism and fear.”&lt;ref name=C/&gt;

'''Curtis Bernard Gans''' (June 17, 1937 &amp;ndash; March 15, 2015) was an American activist, writer, and expert on American voting patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaiser|first1=Charles|title=1968 in America|date=2012|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802193247|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShNLRq5nC5cC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Curtis+Gans%22+1937&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VUQHVZrcJ5CvoQT8p4GgCQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Curtis%20Gans%22%201937&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Allard K. Lowenstein]], Gans in 1967 started and headed the [[Dump Johnson movement]]. Based on opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], the movement, which was considered quixotic at first, grew strong and was instrumental in setting in motion events which eventually persuaded president [[Lyndon Johnson]] that continuing his campaign to be re-nominated for the presidency by his party would be difficult and divisive and uncertain of success.

==Health care editorial==
David Goldhill's article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' was the cover story for its September 2009 issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biojobblog.com/2009/10/articles/biojobbuzz/health-information-technology-the-next-frontier/ "Health Information Technology: The Next Frontier"] Retrieved October 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that dysfunction in the health care sector in America exists because markets in the health care sector are not being allowed to function properly.  He thus advocates mandatory accounts into which people would pay a minimum percentage of their income every year.  People would receive government coverage for truly catastrophic, unforeseen medical emergencies and procedures, like those costing more than $50,000.  Foreseeable medical procedures, such as pregnancy and end-of-life care, would be paid for from the individual savings accounts. He opposes a single payer system, because he believes it would be influenced by lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/opinion/sunday/the-health-benefits-that-cut-your-pay.html The Health Benefits That Cut Your Pay], By DAVID GOLDHILL, New York Times, February 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published a book on this topic, "Catastrophic Care:  How American Health Care Killed My Father--And How We Can Fix It", released in the United States on January 8, 2013.

He is a self-identified [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].   His book and articles have received praise from [[conservative]] news outlet ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' and the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think-tank]] the [[Cato Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/09/read_david_goldhill_1.asp "Read David Goldhill" at the Weekly Standard] Retrieved October 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/09/28/how-american-health-care-killed-my-father/ “How American Health Care Killed My Father” at CATO] Retrieved October 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Davis–Monthan Air Force Base''' ('''DM AFB''') {{airport codes|DMA|KDMA|DMA}} is a [[United States Air Force]] base located within the city limits approximately {{convert|5|mi|nmi km}} south-southeast of downtown [[Tucson, Arizona]].  
It was established in 1925 as '''Davis-Monthan Landing Field'''.  The host unit for Davis–Monthan AFB is the [[355th Fighter Wing]] (355 FW) assigned to [[Twelfth Air Force]] (12AF), part of [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC).  The base is best known as the location of the [[Air Force Materiel Command]]'s [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]] (309 AMARG), the [[aircraft boneyard]] for all excess military and U.S. government aircraft and aerospace vehicles.

Davis–Monthan Air Force Base is a key ACC installation. The [[355th Fighter Wing]] (355 FW) provides [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] close air support and OA-10 forward air controllers to ground forces worldwide.  The 355 FW is also the host unit, providing medical, logistical, mission and operational support to all assigned units.  The 355 FW is also the sole formal training unit for the A-10 aircraft, providing initial and recurrent training to all U.S. Air Force [[A-10]] and OA-10 pilots, to include those in the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC) and the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG).  The 355th is also ACC's executive agent for [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF]] and [[New START|START]] treaty compliance.

One of the wing's tenant units, the [[55th Electronic Combat Group]] (55 ECG), is a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the [[55th Wing]] (55 WG) at [[Offutt AFB]], Nebraska and is an ACC unit tasked to provide offensive counter-information and electronic attack capabilities in support of U.S. and Coalition tactical air, surface, and special operations forces with its [[EC-130|EC-130H Compass Call]] aircraft and employing the EC-130H in tactical air operations in war and other contingencies worldwide.  The 55 ECG also provides initial and recurrent training to all EC-130H Compass Call pilots, navigators and air crew.

Two other major tenants, the [[563rd Rescue Group]] (structured as a GSU under ACC's [[23d Wing]] at [[Moody Air Force Base]], Georgia), and the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s (AFRC) [[943d Rescue Group|943rd Rescue Group]] (structured as a GSU under AFRC's [[920th Rescue Wing]] at [[Patrick Air Force Base]], Florida), are tasked to provide combat search and rescue (CSAR) and personnel recovery (PR) support worldwide.

Perhaps the most prominent tenant is the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]] (309 AMARG) of the [[Air Force Material Command]] (AFMC).  As the main location for the 309 AMARG, Davis–Monthan AFB is the sole [[aircraft boneyard]] for excess military and U.S. government aircraft and other aerospace vehicles such as ballistic missiles.  Tucson's dry climate and [[alkali soil]] made it an ideal location for aircraft storage and preservation.

==Host Wing units==
[[File:Davis-monthan-afb-main-gate-sign.jpg|thumb|Main Gate sign]]
[[File:Dmafb-1.jpg|thumb|An A-10 in the Arizona sunset]]
The host wing at Davis-Monthan is the [[355th Fighter Wing]], which includes:
* [[355th Operations Group]] (355 OG)
**The 355 OG consists of six squadrons and over 450 personnel employing A-10 aircraft and an [[AN/TPS-75]] radar system. It provides war-fighters with forces for close air support ([[Close air support|CAS]]), air interdiction ([[AI]]), forward air control ([[Forward air control|FAC]]), combat search and rescue ([[Combat search and rescue|CSAR]]), ground-based tactical air control, and airbase operations. It also conducts all formal course directed aircraft initial qualification/ re-qualification training.  All active duty aircraft assigned to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base carry the tail code "DM".

*** [[355th Operations Support Squadron]]
*** 355th Training Squadron
*** 607th Air Control Squadron
* [[355th Mission Support Group]] (355 MSG) - The 355 MSG consists of about 2,000 military and civilian personnel in six diverse squadrons that train, equip and provide agile combat mission support, including civil engineering, communications, contracting, transportation, fuels, supply, deployment readiness, personnel, security forces, and services for immediate worldwide deployment of combat support elements. The group also provides an effective in-garrison support infrastructure and quality of life services for 26 wing and 32 associate units spanning a 60,000-person, {{convert|10,763|acre|km2}} community, one of the largest in Air Combat Command.
* [[355th Maintenance Group]] (355 MXG) - The 355 MXG supports eight flying squadrons, providing organizational and intermediate field level/back shop maintenance for 110 A-10C, and intermediate field level/back shop maintenance for an additional 14 EC-130H, 1 TC-130H, 8 HH-60H, and 6 HC-130J combat-ready aircraft.  The 355 MXG has over 1,700 assigned personnel, ensures quality of on- and off-equipment aircraft maintenance, and executes an annual O&amp;M budget of $72.2M.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dm.af.mil/Units/355thMaintenanceGroup.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
** 355th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
** 355th Component Maintenance Squadron
** 355th Equipment Maintenance Squadron
* [[355th Medical Group]] (355 MDG) - The 355th Medical Group was established in 1955 as the 355th USAF Infirmary at [[McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base|McGhee Tyson AFB]], Tennessee. After several redesignations, it was activated at Davis-Monthan AFB as the 355th Medical Group in 1992.  The 355th Medical Group ensures combat medical readiness of all operational and support units home-based at Davis-Monthan AFB for global contingencies. With an authorized staff of 407 and a resource allocation totaling $26 million, the 355 MDG ensures that warriors at Davis-Monthan AFB are medically fit-to-fight. In addition to training and equipping/manning 25 mobility teams, the 355 MDG also promotes the health and wellness of the Davis-Monthan AFB community by meeting the health care needs of over 54,000 eligible DoD beneficiaries in southern Arizona.

==Associate / Unit-equipped units==
*[[924th Fighter Group]] (924 FG)
The 924 FG of the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC) was reactivated in 2011 and initially assigned to Davis-Monthan AFB as an "associate" unit to the 355 FW flying the A-10 aircraft. As part of the Air Force Reserve Command, it is also a geographically separated unit (GSU) of AFRC's [[944th Fighter Wing]] (944 FW) at [[Luke AFB]], Arizona. Like the 355 FW, the 924 FG currently flies the same Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support aircraft. The 924 FG consists of the following subordinate units:
**[[47th Fighter Squadron]] (A-10C)
**924th Maintenance Squadron
**924th Operational Support Flight

Between October 2013 and March 2014, the 924 FG transitioned from being a "classic" associate unit when it gained 28 A-10 aircraft of its own from [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana. The 924th is now part of the Total Force Enterprise, and is the only unit-equipped both active and classic associate fighter group in Air Force Reserve Command's inventory. With oversight of the 47th Fighter Squadron, 924th MS, and 924th OSF, the group is charged with working with the Regular Air Force's 355th Fighter Wing to functionally integrate with the 355th Operations Group and 355th Maintenance Group to conduct A-10 pilot training at Davis-Monthan AFB.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dm.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/6204/Article/672383/924th-fighter-group.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Other military activities and federal agencies using the base include the Navy Operational Support Center Tucson, a detachment of the [[Naval Air Systems Command]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Air and Marine Operations Tucson Air Branch, and the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. Also located on base is the [[25th Operational Weather Squadron]] [[25 OWS]]. The squadron produces forecasts for the Western United States and is part of the [[1st Weather Group]] (1 WXG) headquartered at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb. The squadron also serves as a training hub for new weather professionals - both enlisted and officers.

==Ancillary support==
The base provides additional active duty support to the [[162d Fighter Wing]] (162 FW) of the [[Arizona Air National Guard]] and the [[Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center]], both located at [[Tucson Air National Guard Base]] at nearby [[Tucson International Airport]], and both of which fly the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C and F-16D Fighting Falcon]], with the latter also operating an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] detachment in concert with the 355 FW at Davis-Monthan AFB.

==History==
[[File:US Navy 040204-N-3122S-002 Aviation Machinist Mate 1st Class Frederick Berger signs a U.S. Navy P-3C Orion, aircraft number 321, assigned to the Tigers^rdquo,of Patrol Squadron Eight (VP-8).jpg|thumb|upright|right|A flight crew from [[VP-8|Patrol Squadron Eight]] ([[VP-8]]) prepare a U.S. Navy [[P-3C Orion]] for storage at the 309 AMARG]]

The base was named in honor of [[World War I]] pilots Lieutenants [[Samuel H. Davis]] (1896&amp;ndash;1921) and [[Oscar Monthan]] (1885&amp;ndash;1924), both Tucson natives.  Davis, who attended the [[University of Arizona]] prior to enlisting in the Army in 1917, died in a Florida aircraft accident in 1921. Monthan enlisted in the Army as a private in 1917, was commissioned as a ground officer in 1918, and later became a pilot; he was killed in the crash of a [[Martin B2]] bomber in [[Hawaii]] in 1924.

===Origins===
In 1919, the Tucson Chamber of Commerce aviation committee established the nation's first municipally owned airfield at the current site of the Tucson Rodeo Grounds. The rapid increase in aviation activities meant a move in 1927 to the site which is now Davis–Monthan Air Force Base. After the City of Tucson acquired land southeast of town for a runway in 1925, [[Charles Lindbergh]], fresh from his nonstop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, flew his "[[Spirit of St. Louis]]" to Tucson in 1927 to dedicate Davis-Monthan Field, then the largest municipal airport in the United States.

Military presence at the field began when Sergeant Simpson relocated his fuel and service operation to the site on 6 October 1927. He kept a log containing names of the field's customers, including Lindbergh, [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Benjamin Foulois]], and [[Jimmy Doolittle]]. Doolittle, awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his 1942 [[Doolittle Raid|Tokyo raid]], was the first military customer at the field on 9 October 1927.  The combination of civil and military operations worked well until the early 1940s, when military requirements began to require the relocation of civil aviation activities.

===World War II===
Davis-Monthan Airport became Tucson Army Air Field in 1940, as the United States prepared for [[World War II]]. The first assigned [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] units were the 1st Bomb Wing, 41st Bomb Group and 31st Air Base Group, activating on 30 April 1941 with Lieutenant Colonel Ames S. Albro Sr. as commanding officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azstarnet.com/news/local/street-smarts-man-who-built-davis-monthan-air-force-base/article_c5ba11d4-d540-511a-b143-c77c8f33501d.html David Leighton, "Street Smarts: Man who built Davis-Monthan Air Force Base among oldest enlisted men ever," Arizona Daily Star, Nov. 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In its military role, the base became known as '''Davis-Monthan Army Air Field''' on 3 December 1941.  [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] leaders then utilized the airfield for heavy bomber operation, sending [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], and [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers, for training and observation missions.

Training at the airfield came to a halt on 14 August 1945, when the Japanese surrendered. Davis-Monthan played a post-war role by housing German [[Prisoner of War|POW's]] from June 1945 to March 1946.  It also served as a separation center, which brought the base populace to a high of 11,614 people in September 1945.

With the end of the war, operations at the base came to a virtual standstill. It was then when the base was selected as a storage site for hundreds of decommissioned aircraft, with the activation of the [[AMARG|4105th Army Air Force Unit]].  The 4105th oversaw the storage of excess B-29s and [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] "Gooney Birds." Tucson's low humidity and [[alkali soil]] made it an ideal location for aircraft storage and preservation, awaiting cannibalization or possible reuse — a mission that has continued to this day.

===Cold War===

===Strategic Air Command===
The [[Cold War|Cold War era]] was ushered in at Davis-Monthan on 21 March 1946, with the installation placed under the claimancy of the recently established [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).  SAC's presence at the base began in the form of the 40th and 444th Bombardment Groups, both equipped with B-29s.  As part of the postwar austerity, these groups were later inactivated, with the personnel and equipment being consolidated into the [[43d Bombardment Group]] in October. On 11 January 1948, with the establishment of the [[United States Air Force]] as independent service four months earlier, the facility was renamed '''Davis–Monthan Air Force Base'''. On 30 June 1948, the Air Force activated the 43rd Air Refueling Squadron, whose KB-29Ms were newly equipped with [[aerial refueling]] equipment purchased from the British firm FRL. The 43rd ARS, along with the 509th ARS at [[Walker AFB]], [[New Mexico]], was the first dedicated air refueling unit in history.

On 2 March 1949, the ''Lucky Lady II'', a [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50A]] of the 43d Bombardment Wing, completed the first nonstop round-the-world flight, having covered {{convert|23452|mi|km}} in 94 hours and 1 minute (249.45&amp;nbsp;mph). ''Lucky Lady II'' was refueled four times in the air by [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|KB-29 tankers]] of the 43d Air Refueling Squadron, which had made only one operational air refueling contact before the mission. For this outstanding flight, the ''Lucky Lady II'''s crew received the [[Mackay Trophy]], given annually by the [[National Aeronautic Association]] for the outstanding flight of the year, and the Air Age Trophy, an [[Air Force Association]] award, given each year in recognition of significant contributions to the public understanding of the air age.

In 1953, the jet age came to Davis-Monthan when SAC units on the base converted to the new [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]].  The [[303d Bombardment Wing]], Medium, was initially established on 27 August 1951, and activated at Davis-Monthan AFB on 4 September 1951.  The wing operated B-29s until January 1952, when it was equipped with KB-29s. On 20 January 1953, the 303d transitioned to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet for its three bomb squadrons, while an additional air refueling squadron equipped with KC-97s was assigned to the wing between 18 February 1953, and 1 February 1956.  A standard SAC Alert Area ramp was constructed in the southeast corner of the base adjacent to the runway and the 303d assumed nuclear alert responsibilities when final conversion and checkout in the B-47 was complete.

In April 1953, the [[Air Defense Command]]'s (ADC) '''15th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' was activated with [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86A Sabre]]s. A year later, the unit transitioned into F-86Ds followed by a transition to F-86Ls in the fall of 1957. In the spring of 1959 the unit received [[F-89 Scorpion|Northrop F-89J]] interceptors which it flew for only a year when it transitioned into [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|McDonnell F-101Bs]]. On 24 December 1964, the 15th FIS was inactivated.

In 1962, the [[Strategic Air Command]]'s [[390th Strategic Missile Wing]] (390 SMW) and its 18 [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] [[ICBM]] sites around Tucson were activated. The 390 SMW was one of only three Titan II missile wings in SAC and represented the heaviest land-based missile and the largest single warhead ever fielded by U.S. strategic deterrent forces.

In July 1963, the '''4028th Strategic Reconnaissance Weather Wing''', equipped with [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] strategic reconnaissance aircraft, began flying global missions from Davis-Monthan. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1963, the [[4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] at [[Laughlin AFB]], Texas, relocated to the base and assumed responsibility for all U-2 operations, emphasizing long-range strategic reconnaissance and intelligence collection.  As a [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) unit, the 4080th was later redesignated the [[100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] and also acquired [[Lockheed DC-130 Hercules]] aircraft for launch and control of Firebee reconnaissance drones that were the precursors of contemporary unmanned aerial systems.  The DC-130s and U-2s remained at the Davis-Monthan until 1976, when the 100 SRW was inactivated, its DC-130s transferred to [[Tactical Air Command]]'s 432d Tactical Drone Group, and its U-2s transferred to SAC's [[9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] (9 SRW) at [[Beale Air Force Base]], [[California]], where U-2 Dragon Lady operations were consolidated with [[SR-71]] Blackbird operations.

On 15 June 1964, Davis-Monthan's [[303d Bombardment Wing]] was inactivated as part of the retirement of the B-47 Stratojet from active service. The year 1964 brought back the combat crew training mission of the World War II years with the '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226224308/http://pirtle.org/4453cctw/ 4453d Combat Crew Training Wing]''' of the [[Tactical Air Command]] equipped with the Air Force's newest and most sophisticated fighter, the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]. In July 1971, the [[355th Fighter Wing|355th Tactical Fighter Wing]], flying the [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair II]] aircraft, was activated at the base and the previously assigned F-4s were moved to [[Luke AFB]], near [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

===Tactical Air Command===
On 1 October 1976, the base was transferred to [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) after 30 years under SAC, with SAC's [[390th Strategic Missile Wing]] becoming a tenant command of the base. It was also that year the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing accepted the first [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]. Since 1979, D-M has been the training location for pilots in the A-10; the base was redesignated the '''355th Tactical Training Wing''' on 1 September 1979.  The organization was later redesignated the '''355th Fighter Wing''' since it includes operational, deployable A-10 squadrons in addition to its CONUS training mission

The 1980s brought several diverse missions to D-M. The headquarters charged with overseeing them was now the '''836th Air Division''', which was activated 1 January 1981. The AD advised Air Force component commanders and land forces on A-10 aircraft tactics, training, employment and readiness, and subordinate units participated in exercises such as [[Red Flag exercise|Red Flag]] and Celtic Echo.

The '''41st Electronic Combat Squadron''' equipped with the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|EC-130H Compass Call]] aircraft, arrived on 1 July 1980, and reported to the [[552d Airborne Warning and Control Wing]]. In 1981 D-M welcomed the '''868th Tactical Missile Training Group''' (866 TMTG). The 868th was the only U.S.-based [[Ground Launched Cruise Missile]] (GLCM) unit and the source of the crews that staffed the forward deployed GLCM wings in [[NATO]] in 1982.

On 1 September 1982, the headquarters of the 602d Tactical Air Control Wing (TAIRCW) and its subordinate [[23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron]] (TASS), a unit responsible for the Air Force's tactical air control system west of the [[Mississippi River]] transferred from [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], Texas, and stood up at D-M, bringing 16 [[Cessna A-37 Dragonfly|OA-37B]] aircraft and numerous new personnel to the base. The 23rd TASS became the Air Force's first [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|O/A-10]] squadron in 1988, providing heavily armed airborne forward air control (FAC) capability for the first time. Unlike all other D-M aircraft at the time, the 23rd TASS fleet's tail flash read "NF", for "Nail FAC"; the squadron's radio call sign was "Nail."

In 1984, as a result of the first series of Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties [[START I]] between the United States and the Soviet Union, SAC began to decommission its Titan II missile system.  In 1982, the 390 SMW began removing its 18 missiles and inactivating the associated sites in preparation for eventual demolition.

In October 1981, President Ronald Reagan announced that, as part of the strategic modernization program, Titan II systems were to be retired by 1 October 1987. Deactivation began at Davis-Monthan on 1 October 1982. During the operation, titled "Rivet Cap", the missiles were removed and shipped to [[Norton AFB]], California for refurbishment and storage. Explosive demolition began at the headworks of missile complex 570-7 on 30 November 1983. In May 1984, the 390 SMW's last Titan II at Davis-Monthan came off alert status. SAC subsequently inactivated the [[390th Strategic Missile Wing]] on 30 June 1984.

One site under the 390 SMW, known both as Titan II Site 571-7 and as Air Force Facility Missile Site 8, was initially decommissioned in 1982.  Located approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of Tucson in [[Sahuarita, Arizona]], it was saved from demolition and turned over to the Arizona Aerospace Foundation, a nonprofit organization which also administers the [[Pima Air and Space Museum]] immediately south of Davis-Monthan AFB.  With a variety of items on loan from the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], including an inert [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile, Site 571-7 is now known as the [[Titan Missile Museum]] and is one of two remaining examples of a Titan II missile site in existence (the other being located at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], California; site 395-C). In 1994, the site was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].

===Post Cold War era===
In the 1990s, the 355 TTW continued to train A-10 crews for assignments to units in the United States, England, and [[Korea]]. During this period, the 602nd Tactical Air Control Wing deployed Airborne Forward Air Controllers in their OA-10 aircraft to [[Operation Desert Storm]], providing nearly 100 percent of this capability to the war.

On 1 October 1991, the 355 TTW was redesignated as the '''355th Fighter Wing''' (355 FW) in tune with the Air Force's Objective Wing philosophy. The 355th Fighter Wing was composed of the 355th Operations Group (355 OG), the 355th Maintenance Group (355 MG), the 355th Medical Group (355 MDG), and the 355th Mission Support Group (355 MSG).

In May 1992, the [[41st Electronic Combat Squadron|41st]] and [[43d Electronic Combat Squadron]]s, flying [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|EC-130E Hercules Compass Call]] arrived. The aircraft carried an airborne battlefield command and control center capsule that provides continuous control of tactical air operations in the forward battle area and behind enemy lines. This capability added yet more strength to the wing's combat capability. The 43rd Electronic Combat Squadron "Bats" are part of the [[55th Wing]] at [[Offut AFB]], [[Nebraska]], but operate out of Davis-Monthan. In addition, the 42d Airborne Command and Control Squadron arrived from [[Keesler AFB]], [[Mississippi]] on 19 July 1994.

On 1 May 1992, senior Air Force leaders implemented the policy of one base, one wing, one boss. The 836 AD and 602 TAIRCW inactivated (the later on June 15, 1992) while the 41 ECS and 43 ECS came under control of the 355 FW.  With the mission diversified, the 355th Fighter Wing was redesignated as the '''355th Wing''' (355 WG).

===Air Combat Command===
On 1 June 1992, Tactical Air Command was inactivated and all aircraft, personnel and installations previously under TAC were transferred to the newly established [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) on the same date.  Following Operation Desert Storm, the 355 WG supported [[Operation Southern Watch]] during deployments to Al Jaber, Kuwait, in 1997 by deploying 24 A-10s, in 1998 by deploying 16 A-10s, and in 1999 by deploying 14 A-10s&amp;mdash;all to ensure compliance of the 33rd parallel southern no-fly zone. The flight and mysterious crash of Captain [[Craig D. Button]] took off from Davis–Monthan Air Force Base on 12 April 1997.

===Global War on Terrorism, 2001-2007===
The attacks on 11 September 2001, led to the initiation of three ongoing missions: [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF), [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] (OIF), and [[Operation Noble Eagle]] (ONE). After Operation Enduring Freedom, eight A-10s from the 355 WG were called to [[Bagram Airfield]], [[Afghanistan]], to fly close air support missions supporting multinational ground forces.

In September 2002, the [[48th Rescue Squadron|48th]], [[55th Rescue Squadron|55th]], and the [[79th Rescue Squadron]]'s (RQS) transferred under control of the 355 WG, equipped with HC-130 aircraft and HH-60 helicopters. At the same time, the 41st and 43d Electronic Combat Squadrons were realigned under the control of the '''[[55th Electronic Combat Group]]''' (55 ECG). While personnel and aircraft remained on Davis-Monthan AFB, operational control of the 55 ECG was assumed by the [[55th Wing]] at [[Offutt AFB]], [[Nebraska]]. Another major wing realignment occurred on 1 October 2003, with the activation of the '''563rd Rescue Group''' (563 RQG) on Davis-Monthan AFB. Control of the 48th, 55th, and 79th Rescue Squadrons (RQS) was passed to the new group with the [[23rd Wing]] (23 WG) at [[Moody Air Force Base]], Georgia assuming operational command of the unit.

In 2003 and 2005, the 354th Fighter Squadron (354 FS) "Bulldogs" deployed on five-month deployments to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. During these deployments, they provided 24-hour presence to reassure the Afghan population as it struggled with its [[emergent democracy]], and provided key support during national elections. While the 2003 deployment saw limited action, the Bulldogs employed over 22,000 rounds of 30&amp;nbsp;mm during 130 troops-in-contact situations during the 2005 deployment. Returning to Afghanistan in April 2007 for another six-month deployment, the 345th again provided 24-hour presence and Close Air Support expertise to coalition forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During this period, insurgent activity level was the highest recorded to date in OEF. The Bulldogs employed an unprecedented number of munitions during this deployment—over 150,000 rounds of 30&amp;nbsp;mm in support of over 400 troops-in-contact situations.

==2007-present==
On 26 April 2007, the 355th Wing was redesignated as the '''355th Fighter Wing''' (355 FW) with only A-10 fighter aircraft assigned. Also in 2007, the 214th Reconnaissance Group (214 RG), an Arizona Air National Guard unit, was activated. Today{{when|date=September 2015}}, the 355 FW is composed of four groups: the 355th Operations Group (355 OG), the 355th Maintenance Group (355 MG), the 355th Mission Support Group (355 MSG), and the 355th Medical Group (355 MDG). Along with their tenant organizations, they make up the 6,000 Airmen and 1,700 civilian personnel at Davis-Monthan AFB.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional.svg|right|thumb|Seal of DINA]]
{{Operation Condor}}
The '''Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional''' ({{lang-en|National Intelligence Directorate}}) or '''DINA''' was the [[Chile]]an [[secret police]] in the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]], and has been called Pinochet's [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/08/08/actualidad/1439057926_849345.html Manuel Contreras, el jefe de la Gestapo de Pinochet] in Spanish online newspaper ''[[El Pais]]'' on 08 August 2015, retrieved on 08 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The DINA was established in November 1973, as a [[Chilean Army]] intelligence unit headed by [[Manuel Contreras|Colonel Manuel Contreras]] and vice-director [[Raúl Iturriaga]]. It was separated from the army and made an independent administrative unit in June 1974, under the auspices of Decree 521.

The DINA existed until 1977, after which it was renamed the [[Central Nacional de Informaciones]] (CNI) (''National Information Center'').

In 2008, the [[Chilean Army]] presented a list of 1,097 DINA agents to Judge Alejandro Solís.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2013/05/23/piden-desafuero-de-diputado-rosauro-martinez-por-asesinato-de-tres-miembros-del-mir-en-1981/ Piden desafuero de diputado Rosauro Martínez por asesinato de tres miembros del MIR en 1981] in Chilean online newspaper ''[[El Mostrador]]'' on 23 May 2013, retrieved on 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== DINA internal suppression and human rights violations ==
Under decree #521, the DINA had the power to detain any individual so long as there was a declared [[state of emergency]]. Such an administrative state characterized nearly the entire length of the Pinochet government. Torture and rape of detainees was common:

{{quote|In some camps, routine sadism was taken to extremes. At [[Villa Grimaldi]], recalcitrant prisoners were dragged to a parking lot; DINA agents then used a car or truck to run over and crush their legs. Prisoners there recalled one young man who was beaten with chains and left to die slowly from internal injuries. Rape was also a reoccurring form of abuse. DINA officers subjected female prisoners to grotesque forms of sexual torture that included insertion of rodents and, as tactfully described in the Commission report, "unnatural acts involving dogs."&lt;ref name="The Pinochet File"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|title=[[The Pinochet File]]: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== DINA censorship of media ==
As of September 11, 1973, the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military dictatorship]] worked with DINA to censor channels, newspapers, and radio transmissions that supported the [[Popular Socialist Union (Chile)|Popular Socialist Union]] and supporters. A decree by the Junta established that all public information would have to be inspected and revised by the Junta before airing, and a couple days later an "Office of Censorship" was created to supervise all media. A lot of newspapers received their work back scribbled out with red ink.

Through coercion, murder, and kidnappings, television outlets masked the truth on the coup d'état as a plan by the [[military of Chile]]. Various international cable news networks were banned by DINA to prevent the news of the forced coup d’etat by the military. Some international networks were convinced to lie by the Junta about social and political aspects of Chile.

The censorship breached particular homes and public services, and on September 23, 1973, DINA sent policemen to register households and institutions. They searched subversive evidence such as books by [[Pablo Neruda]], articles on social sciences, political science, human rights, and those who were rounded up and burned at the [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-09|title=Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Direcci%C3%B3n_de_Inteligencia_Nacional&amp;oldid=94210016|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign involvement ==
The [[United States]] backed and supported the [[Fatherland and Liberty]] which funded and attempted the first coup of Allende’s regime known as [[Tanquetazo]]. The CIA established links after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] however ties were cut after The [[Assassination of Orlando Letelier]] which former CIA agent [[Michael Townley]] was directly tied with which eventually led to the disbanding of The DINA in 1977.

== DINA foreign assassinations and operations==
{{further|Operation Condor|Operation Colombo}}
The DINA was involved in [[Operation Condor]], as well as [[Operation Colombo]]. In July 1976, two magazines in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] appeared and published the names of 119 Chilean [[leftist]] opponents, claiming they had been killed in internal disputes unrelated to the Pinochet regime. Both magazines disappeared after this one and only issue. Judge [[Juan Guzmán Tapia]] eventually asked Chilean justices to lift Pinochet's immunity in this case, called "Operation Colombo", having accumulated evidence that Pinochet had ordered the DINA to plant this disinformation, in order to cover up the "disappearance" and murder by the Chilean secret police of those 119 persons. In September 2005, Chile's Supreme Court ordered the lifting of Pinochet's general immunity from prosecutions, with respect to this case.

===Assassinations of Carlos Prats and Orlando Letelier===
{{Main|Letelier assassination}}
The DINA worked with international agents, such as [[Michael Townley]], who assassinated former Chilean minister [[Orlando Letelier]] in Washington DC in 1976, as well as General [[Carlos Prats]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in 1974.

Michael Townley worked with [[Eugenio Berríos]] on producing [[sarin]] gas in the 1970s, at a laboratory in a DINA-owned house in the district of Lo Curro, [[Santiago de Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenio Berríos, who was murdered in 1995, was also linked with drug traffickers and agents of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050924/pags/20050924223646.html El coronel que le pena al ejército] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312003922/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050924/pags/20050924223646.html |date=2007-03-12 }}, ''[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]'', September 24, 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accounts of daily life in Chile ==
The overwhelming fear by the Chilean people caused them to support Pinochet and his administration. There are few accounts that are disdainful towards DINA because DINA and other agencies that supported Pinochet repressed and dissolved all accounts against his regime. Some writers and journalists that opposed this right-winged regime secretly interviewed people living under DINA. Writers such as [[Patricia Politzer]], interviewed people that suffered. Politzer writes about specific incidents in Chile.

One of the accounts is about a mother of a leftist sympathizer who was a victim of [[forced disappearance]]s in Chile. The mother has never heard nor received any update on her son’s status even after Pinochet was removed from power. Many of those who disappeared or were wrongly murdered were never identified and thousands of leftist sympathizers remain missing. These unsolved disappearances and kidnappings have left thousands searching for their relatives in Chile to this day.

There was minimal restoration and children suffered greatly as well. In another interview by Politzer, she describes the account of woman who was shot with other leftists and managed to survive. She explains that if she would have died at the hands of DINA, her children would have been left behind with no one to watch them. These accounts reveal the inconsideration of DINA and other agencies that answered to Pinochet. Children would be left behind as orphans. All these accounts in [["Fear in Chile"]], by Patricia Politzer captivated and showed what life was like in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear In Chile: Lives Under Pinochet|last=Politzer|first=Patricia|publisher=The New Press|year=2001|isbn=9781565846616|location=New York|pages=3–11 and 141–153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement of DINA by the CNI ==
DINA was replaced by the CNI (Central Nacional de Informaciones) in 1977 and Contreras was replaced by general Odlanier Mena. By that time, DINA had reached its military goals: assassinate the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria]] (MIR) leadership and the main leaders of the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]], the coalition of the parties that had won the 1970 elections. The dissolution of the CNI occurred in 1990 during the [[Chilean transition to democracy]].

After the fall of Pinochet's regime, Contreras was prosecuted in Chile due to crimes against humanity while heading the DINA and sentenced to 12 years in prison for covert kidnappings, a crime that had not been amnestied. However, judge [[Víctor Montiglio]] who had replaced judge [[Juan Guzmán Tapia]] gave amnesty to contreras in 2005.

Finally, on June 30, 2008, Contreras was sentenced to two life-sentences, one for the murder of [[Carlos Prats]] and one for the murder of his wife, Sofía Cuthbert. He also received an additional 20-year sentence for illicit association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-09|title=Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Direcci%C3%B3n_de_Inteligencia_Nacional&amp;oldid=94210016|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activities ==
In an undated letter to [[Augusto Pinochet]], Michael Townley advised him that [[Virgilio Paz Romero]], an anti-Castro Cuban, was taking photographs of British [[prison]]s in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1975 as a DINA assignment. The photographs were to be used by the Chilean government at the [[United Nations]] in New York to discredit the United Kingdom and accuse it of [[human rights violations]]. However they arrived too late to be used, and were finally published in ''[[El Mercurio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch02-08.htm Activities of Virgilio Paz in Northern Ireland during 1975], National Security Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late 2014, in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, the '''William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies,''' a U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Defense http://www.defenselink.mil&lt;/ref&gt; institution for defense and security studies in the Western Hemisphere, has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints allege that the Center knowingly protected a WJPC professor who belonged to the DINA during the dictatorship of Captain General Pinochet, as well as the clandestine participation of Center officials in the 2009 Honduran coup, gross mismanagement, corruption, homophobia, racism, and sexism. "Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive," said [[Sen. Patrick Leahy]], D-Vermont, the author of the "Leahy Law" prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Edwin Andersen [https://www.academia.edu/25856284/Unpunished_U.S._Southern_Command_role_in_09_Honduran_military_coup Unpunished U.S. Southern Command role in '09 Honduran military coup] May 24, 2016, Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marisa Taylor and Kevin G.

During a prayer service at [[Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church]], Roof killed nine people, all [[African Americans]], including [[pastor|senior pastor]] and [[South Carolina Senate|state senator]] [[Clementa C. Pinckney]], and injured one other person. After several people identified Roof as the main suspect, he became the center of a manhunt that ended the morning after the shooting with his arrest in [[Shelby, North Carolina|Shelby]], [[North Carolina]]. He later confessed that he committed the shooting in hopes of igniting a [[race war]].

Three days after the shooting, a website titled ''The Last Rhodesian'' was discovered and later confirmed by officials to be owned by Roof. The website contained photos of Roof posing with symbols of [[white supremacy]] and [[neo-Nazism]], along with a manifesto in which he outlined his views toward [[Black people|blacks]], among other peoples. He also claimed in the manifesto to have developed his white supremacist views after reading about the 2012 [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]] and [[Race and crime in the United States|black-on-white crime]].

On December 15, 2016, Roof was convicted in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]] of all 33 federal charges (including [[hate crime]]s) against him stemming from the shooting; on January 11, 2017, he was sentenced to [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|death]] for those crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dylann Roof Gets Death Penalty For Racially Motivated Charleston Church Shooting|url=http://vanndigital.com/dylann-roof-gets-death-penalty-racially-motivated-charleston-church-shooting/|work=VannDigital|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2017, Roof agreed to plead guilty in [[South Carolina Circuit Court|South Carolina state court]] to all state charges pending against him—nine counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony—to avoid a second death sentence.

==Personal background==
Roof was born in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], to Franklin Bennett (called Bennett) Roof, a carpenter and a construction contractor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flkeysnews.com/news/article79615597.html|title=Charleston shooter Roof left little fingerprint on the Keys|work=flkeysnews|access-date=May 7, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amelia "Amy" Cowles, a bartender. His parents had divorced but were temporarily reconciled at the time of his birth. When Roof was five,&lt;ref name="RoofPast"/&gt; his father married Paige Mann (née Hastings) in November 1999; they divorced after ten years of marriage. Roof has two siblings, an older half sister&lt;ref name="HomeDestroyed" /&gt; and a younger sister, Morgan Roof.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/15/593799322/sister-of-charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-arrested-after-menacing-social-media-po|title=Sister Of Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Arrested After Menacing Social Media Post|work=NPR.org|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett Roof was allegedly verbally and physically abusive toward Mann.&lt;ref name="HomeDestroyed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SuspectLife"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/charleston-suspects-life-troubled-road-radicalization-153608402.html|title=Charleston suspect's life a troubled road to radicalization|work=Yahoo!

According to a 2009 [[affidavit]] filed for Mann's divorce, Roof exhibited "obsessive compulsive behavior" as he grew up, obsessing over germs and insisting on having his hair cut in a certain style.&lt;ref name="SuspectLife"/&gt; When he was in middle school, he exhibited an interest in smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], having once been caught spending money on it.&lt;ref name="RoofPast"/&gt;

In nine years, Roof attended at least seven schools in two South Carolina counties, including [[White Knoll High School]] in [[Lexington, South Carolina|Lexington]], in which he repeated the ninth grade, finishing it in another school. He apparently stopped attending classes in 2010 and, according to his family, dropped out of school and spent his time alternating between playing video games and taking drugs, such as [[Suboxone]].&lt;ref name="RoofPast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/us/charleston-shooting-dylann-roof-troubled-past.html|last1=Robles|first1=Francis|last2=Stewart|first2=Nikita|title=Dylann Roof's Past Reveals Trouble at Home and School|work=The New York Times|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HomeDestroyed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SuspectLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RacialMotivation?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContradictionsMan"/&gt; He was on the rolls of a local [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutheran]] congregation, but it was unclear if he had recently attended.&lt;ref name="HuffPoLutheran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/19/dylann-roof-religion-church-lutheran_n_7623990.html|title=South Carolina Lutheran Pastor: Dylann Roof Was Church Member, His Family Prays For Victims|work=Huffington Post|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the attack, Roof was living alternately in Bennett's and Cowles' homes in downtown Columbia and [[Hopkins, South Carolina|Hopkins]], respectively,&lt;ref name="WhatIf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoofFriend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/06/20/friend-dylann-roof-says-suspect-planned-attack-on-college-charleston/|title=Friend of Dylann Roof says suspect planned attack on College of Charleston|work=FOX News|date=June 20, 2015|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheState.Sharper"/&gt; but was mostly raised by his stepmother Mann.&lt;ref name="SuspectLife"/&gt; For several weeks preceding the attack, Roof had also been occasionally living in the home of an old friend from middle school and the latter's mother, two brothers, and girlfriend.&lt;ref name="DifficultFamily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheState.Sharper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article35836482.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Sharper picture emerges of suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof|work=The State|date=September 19, 2015|accessdate=September 20, 2015|first=Avery|last=Wilks|first2=John|last2=Monk|first3=Harrison|last3=Cahill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article42968508.html|title=Judge grants $25,000 bond for Joey Meek|work=The State|date=November 4, 2015|accessdate=January 2, 2016|first=John|last=Monk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He allegedly spent his time using drugs and getting drunk.&lt;ref name="TheState.Sharper"/&gt; He had been working as a landscaper at the behest of his father, but quit the job prior to the shooting.&lt;ref name="RoofPast"/&gt;

His maternal uncle, Carson Cowles, said that he expressed concern about the [[social withdrawal]] of his then-nineteen-year-old nephew, because "he still didn't have a job, a driver's license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time."&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/south-carolina-massacre-suspect-dylann-roof-had-apparent-interest-in-white-supremacy-20150618-ghrtrg.html|title=South Carolina massacre suspect Dylann Roof had apparent interest in white supremacy|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowles said he tried to mentor Roof, but was rejected and they drifted apart.&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt; According to Mann, Roof cut off all contact with her after her divorce from his father.

A former high school classmate said that despite Roof's racist comments, some of his friends in school were black.&lt;ref name="ContradictionsMan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-charleston-shooter-profile-20150618-story.html|title=Dylann Roof: Racist jokes and black friends -- a man of contradictions|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier contacts with police===
Roof had a prior police record consisting of two arrests, both made in the months preceding the attack. He was investigated on one occasion during this period but without arrest or charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kfor.com/2015/06/18/dylann-storm-roof-arrested-in-north-carolina-according-to-report/|title=Dylann Storm Roof arrested in North Carolina|work=[[KFOR-TV|KFOR]]|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Old|first1=Jason|title=Police: Dylann Roof arrested for trespassing, drug possession at Columbiana Centre|url=http://www.wistv.com/story/29353220/police-dylann-roof-arrested-for-trespassing-drug-possession-at-columbiana-centre|website=WISTV.com|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2015, he was questioned about a February 28 incident at the [[Columbiana Centre]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], in which he entered the mall wearing all-black clothing and asked employees unsettling questions. During the questioning, authorities found a bottle of what was later admitted to be [[Buprenorphine|Suboxone]], a narcotic that is used for treating either chronic pain or opiate-abuse addictions and that is abused as a recreational drug; Roof was arrested for a misdemeanor charge of drug possession. He was subsequently banned from the Columbiana Centre for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/us/on-facebook-dylann-roof-charleston-suspect-wears-symbols-of-white-supremacy.html|title=Dylann Roof, Suspect in Charleston Shooting, Flew the Flags of White Power|date=June 18, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2015, Roof was investigated for loitering in his parked car near a park in downtown Columbia. He had been recognized by an off-duty police officer who investigated his March 2 questioning; the officer then called a colleague to investigate. A police officer conducted a search of his vehicle and found a forearm grip for an [[AR-15]] [[semiautomatic rifle]] and six unloaded [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], all capable of holding 40 rounds. When asked about it, Roof informed the officer that he wanted to purchase an AR-15, but did not have enough money to do so. He was not charged, as it was [[Gun laws in South Carolina|not illegal in South Carolina]] to possess a firearm grip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article25533301.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Was accused SC racial church killer Roof planning bigger death spree?|work=The State|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2015|first=John|last=Monk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/dylann-roof-was-questioned-by-police-in-march-record-shows.html|title=Dylann Roof Had AR-15 Parts During Police Stop in March, Record Shows|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 26, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2015|first=Frances|last=Robles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2015, Roof was arrested again for trespassing on the Columbiana Centre mall's grounds in violation of the ban. The ban was then extended for three additional years.&lt;ref name="TroubledLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContradictionsMan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TroubledPast"/&gt;

According to [[James Comey]], speaking in July 2015, Roof's March arrest was at first written as a [[felony]], which would have required an inquiry into the charge during a firearms [[background check|background examination]]. It was legally a [[misdemeanor]] charge and was incorrectly written as a felony at first due to a data entry error made by a jail clerk. Despite this, Roof would not have been able to legally purchase firearms under a law that barred "unlawful user[s] of or addicted to any [[controlled substance]]," such as the Suboxone, from owning firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/11/dylann-roof-apparently-had-not-been-arrested-for-a-felony-a-month-before-he-went-through-a-gun-purchase-background-check/|title=Dylann Roof apparently had not been arrested for a felony a month before he went through a gun purchase background check|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 11, 2015|accessdate=July 12, 2015|first=Eugene|last=Volokh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/jail-clerical-error-acknowledged-church-shooting-gun-buy-190536334.html|title=Jail clerical error acknowledged in church shooting gun buy|work=[[Yahoo!

On the evening of June 17, 2015, a mass shooting took place at [[Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in downtown [[Charleston, South Carolina]], United States.

===Motivation===
According to a childhood friend, Roof went on a rant about the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]] and the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] that were sparked by the [[death of Freddie Gray]] while Gray was in police custody.&lt;ref name="TroubledPast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/dylann-roof-suspected-charleston-church-shooting-gunman-has-troubled-past-n377686|title=Dylann Roof, Suspected Charleston Church Shooting Gunman Has Troubled Past|work=NBC News|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also often claimed that "blacks were taking over the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dylann-roof-obsessed-trayvon-martin-white-race-article-1.2263647|title=Dylann Roof was obsessed with Trayvon Martin, wanted to save the 'white race': friend|work=The New York Daily News|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015|first=Jason|last=Silverstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof reportedly told friends and neighbors of his plans to kill people, including a plot to attack the [[College of Charleston]], but his claims were not taken seriously.&lt;ref name="RacialMotivation?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/charleston-shooting-racial-motivation-dylann-storm-roof-told-black-neighbor-he-1974050|title=Charleston Shooting Racial Motivation?

One of the friends who briefly hid Roof's gun away from him said, "I don't think the church was his primary target because he told us he was going for the school.

The website also contained an unsigned, 2,444-word manifesto apparently authored by Roof,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dylan Roof: Experts believe Charleston shooting suspect was author of racist manifesto and 'self-radicalised' online|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dylan-roof-experts-believe-charleston-shooting-suspect-was-author-of-racist-manifesto-and-selfradicalised-online-10353971.html|work=The Independent|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015|first=Andrew|last=Buncombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he outlined his opinions, all methodically broken into the following sections: "Blacks", "Jews", "Hispanics", "East Asians", "Patriotism", and "An Explanation":&lt;ref name=Lewis21June&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/20/dylann-roof-fbi-website-manifesto-charleston-shooting|title=Dylann Roof: FBI probes manifesto and website linked to Charleston suspect|work=The Guardian|date=June 21, 2015|accessdate=June 21, 2015|first1=Paul|last1=Lewis|first2=Amanda|last2=Holpuch|first3=Jessica|last3=Glenza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto states that its author was "truly awakened" by coverage of the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]]:

{{quote|I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words "black on white crime" into Google, and I have never been the same since that day.

At this moment I realized that something was very wrong.

The manifesto also mentioned as another source of influence the Northwest Front, a [[Seattle]]-based white supremacist organization infamous for its participation in the 1979 [[Greensboro massacre]].&lt;ref name="PreviewAttractions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/harold-covington-northwest-front-dylann-roof-manifesto-charleston-shooting|title=White supremacist calls Charleston 'a preview of coming attractions'|work=The Guardian|date=June 28, 2015|accessdate=June 28, 2015|first=Sam|last=Thielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to web server logs, Roof's website was last modified at 4:44&amp;nbsp;p.m. on June 17, 2015, when Roof noted, "[A]t the time of writing I am in a great hurry."&lt;ref name=Robles20June /&gt;

According to court documents filed in August 2016, Roof drafted two other manifestos, one in 2015 and the other in jail, recovered from his vehicle and jail cell respectively. He also made a list of churches and a "selection of victims", along with other writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/22/us/dylann-roof-court-documents/|title=Dylann Roof case: New court documents reveal more details, feds say|work=CNN|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2016|first1=Dave|last1=Alsup|first2=Azadeh|last2=Ansari}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostandCourier.Penned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20160822/160829824/feds-self-radicalized-before-attack-dylann-roof-penned-another-manifesto-in-jail|title=Feds: ‘Self-radicalized’ before attack, Dylann Roof penned another manifesto in jail|work=The Post and Courier|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2016|first=Andrew|last=Knapp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/08/23/Dylann-Roof-wrote-racist-manifesto-in-jail-after-Charleston-church-shooting/1891471947009/|title=Dylann Roof wrote racist manifesto in jail after Charleston church shooting|work=UPI|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2016|first=Andrew V.|last=Pestano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapon purchase and FBI lapse===
Roof personally purchased the gun used in the shooting from a retail gun store in West Columbia,&lt;ref name="CNN-Glock41-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/charleston-church-massacre-dylann-roofs-gun-bought-local-store|title=Charleston church massacre: Dylann Roof’s gun bought at local store|last=|first=|date=June 19, 2015|publisher=|work=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; using money given to him on his birthday.&lt;ref name="RoofFriend" /&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on July 10, 2015, that [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[James Comey]] said that Roof "was able to purchase the gun used in the attack only because of lapses in the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|FBI's background-check system]]".&lt;ref name=Nakashima10July&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-accused-charleston-shooter-should-not-have-been-able-to-buy-gun/2015/07/10/0d09fda0-271f-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html?tid=HP_more?tid=HP_more|title=FBI: Breakdown in background check system allowed Dylann Roof to buy gun|work=The Washington Post|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015|first=Ellen|last=Nakashima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One week prior to the shooting, two of his friends tried to hide the gun after Roof claimed he was going to kill people. They returned it to him after the girlfriend of one of the friends, in whose trailer they hid the gun, pointed out he was on [[probation]] and needed to have the gun out of his possession.&lt;ref name="RoofFriend" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/man-accused-of-church-killings-spoke-of-attacking-college/article_0329e2bf-5d5e-5a40-b8a0-f173160142d3.html|title=Man accused of church killings spoke of attacking college|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=June 20, 2015|accessdate=June 20, 2015|first=Mitch|last=Weiss|first2=Michael|last2=Biesecker|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2015/06/20/man-accused-of-church-killings-spoke-of-attacking-college|archive-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior to the shooting===
FBI analysis of Roof's seized cellphone and computer found that he was in online communication with other white supremacists, according to unnamed officials. Although Roof's contacts did not appear to have encouraged the massacre,&lt;ref name=Schmidt3July&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/us/dylann-roof-was-in-contact-with-supremacists-officials-say.html|title=Charleston Suspect Was In Touch With Supremacists, Officials Say|date=July 3, 2015|accessdate=July 3, 2015|first=Michael S.|last=Schmidt|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation was said to have widened to also include other persons of interest.&lt;ref name=Monk2July&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article26200726.html|first=John|last=Monk|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=July 3, 2015|title=EXCLUSIVE: Charges possible against church shooter’s associates|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction by white supremacists===
Although the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] took down its website on June 20 in the immediate wake of negative publicity,&lt;ref name=Lewis21June/&gt; its president, Earl Holt, stated that the organization was "hardly responsible" for Roof's actions.&lt;ref name=Alexander22June/&gt; The organization also issued a statement saying that Roof had some "legitimate grievances" against black people and that the group's website "accurately and honestly report[s] black-on-white violent crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/ccc-dylann-roof-legitimate-grievances|work=Talking Points Memo|last=Thompson|first=Catherine|title=Group That May Have Influenced Charleston Killer: He Had Some 'Legitimate Grievances'|date=June 22, 2015|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Covington]], the founder of the Northwest Front, also condemned Roof's actions, but called the attack "a preview of coming attractions".&lt;ref name="PreviewAttractions"/&gt;

Through analysis of his manifesto, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] alleged that Roof was a reader and commenter on ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'', a white nationalist news website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Kurtis|title=Dylann Roof's manifesto resembles comments on neo-Nazi website, analysis finds|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-dylann-roof-web-20150622-story.html|accessdate=June 30, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its editor Andrew Anglin "repudiated Roof's crime and publicly disavowed violence, while endorsing many of Roof's views."&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Jacob|title=Dylann Roof, 4chan, and the New Online Racism|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/29/dylann-roof-4chan-and-the-new-online-racism.html|accessdate=June 30, 2015|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that while he would have sympathy with a white man shooting criminals, killing innocents including elderly women was "a completely insane act".&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearce|first1=Matt|title=What happens when a millennial goes fascist?

==Manhunt and capture==
The attack was treated as a [[hate crime]] by police, and officials from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) were called in to assist in the investigation and manhunt.&lt;ref name="ChillingCase" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EverythingKnown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3926112/charleston-shooting-latest/|title=Everything We Know About the Charleston Shooting|work=TIME|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10:44&amp;nbsp;a.m., on the morning after the attack, Roof was captured in a traffic stop in [[Shelby, North Carolina]], approximately {{convert|245|mi|km}} from the shooting scene. A .45-caliber pistol was found in the car during the arrest, though it was not immediately clear if it was the same one used in the attack.&lt;ref name="WISTV-RoofCustody-2015"&gt;{{cite news |title= Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof in custody in NC |date= June 18, 2015 |work= [[WIS]] |publisher= WorldNow and WISTV |url= http://www.wistv.com/story/29351540/charleston-shooting-suspect-from-columbia-area |accessdate= June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/us/charleston-south-carolina-shooting/index.html|title=Shooting suspect in custody after Charleston church massacre|work=CNN|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police received a tip-off from a driver, Debbie Dills, from [[Gastonia, North Carolina]].

Roof was arrested and was interrogated by agents of the FBI. He stated that he had been traveling to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when he was arrested in Shelby.

Dylann Roof is the first person in U.S. history to have faced both a state and federal death penalty at the same time. In September 2015, it was announced Roof would face capital punishment in his state prosecution, and in May 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] announced Roof would face capital punishment in his federal prosecution as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/859808/why-dylann-roof-faces-execution-in-both-federal-and-south-carolina-courts/|title=Dylann Roof is the first person in modern US history to face both a federal and state death penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, state prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said that she intended to seek the death penalty for Roof because more than two people were killed in the shooting and others' lives were put at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutor-mulling-death-penalty-discuss-church-slayings-155225037.html|title=Prosecutor: Church shooting suspect to face death penalty|work=Yahoo!

===Federal prosecution===
====Indictment====
Five days after the shooting, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Loretta Lynch]] announced a grand jury had indicted Roof on 33 federal charges: nine counts of using a firearm to commit murder and 24 [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] violations (12 [[hate crime]] charges under the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] and 12 counts under a second hate-crime statute that prohibits using force or threatening the use of force to obstruct a person's [[freedom of religion|free exercise of religious beliefs]]), with 18 of the charges carrying the federal death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;

On July 31, 2015, Roof pleaded not guilty to the federal charges against him at the behest of his lawyer [[David Bruck]]. Roof wanted to plead guilty, but Bruck stated he was not willing to advise a guilty plea until the government indicated whether it wanted to seek the death penalty, as 18 of the 33 charges could carry the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;

On May 24, 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced they would seek the death penalty for Roof. As he was already facing the death penalty in South Carolina, Roof became the first person in U.S. history to face both a federal and state death penalty at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

====Trial preparations====
On June 9, 2016, Roof, through his lawyers, announced that he did not want to be [[Jury trial|tried by a jury]]. If the request was granted, the judge presiding over his case would [[bench trial|hear the case entirely by himself]], determining guilt or innocence and, if Roof is convicted, whether to sentence him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article82920892.html|title=Accused Charleston killer Dylann Roof gambles, wants lone judge|work=Miami Herald|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 10, 2016|first=John|last=Monk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 2016, Roof's lawyers filed a motion arguing that the [[capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal capital punishment laws]] were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/gma/dylann-roofs-lawyers-file-challenge-death-penalty-unconstitutional-074105617--abc-news-topstories.html|title=Dylann Roof's Lawyers File Challenge to Death Penalty, Say It's Unconstitutional|work=Yahoo! GMA|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016|first=Brian|last=McBride}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal prosecutors filed a response on August 22, asking the judge to reject the motion.&lt;ref name="WashPost.Self"/&gt;

On August 23, 2016, federal prosecutors filed court documents announcing their intention to call thirteen expert witnesses at trial, including white supremacy experts who were expected to testify on Roof's "extremist ideology, including a belief in the need to use violence to achieve white supremacy." The documents also indicated the presence of extensive incriminating evidence against Roof. A hearing was set for September 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="Yahoo.Entrenched"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PostandCourier.Penned"/&gt;

Around August 31, 2016, District Judge [[Richard Gergel]] ordered that an ''[[in camera]]'' hearing be held on September 1. The judge was to rule on the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of some "potentially explosive" evidence. Gergel wrote: "This instance is one of those rare cases where Defendant's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to a fair trial outweighs the public's and the press' [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of access. ... This is an unusually sensitive period in this proceeding where highly prejudicial publicity could taint the jury pool and make selection of a fair and impartial jury increasingly challenging." Two Charleston-area media outlets, ''[[The Charleston Post and Courier]]'' and [[WCBD-TV]], unsuccessfully sought to keep the hearing open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=John|title=US Judge Gergel orders rare secret hearing on potentially explosive evidence in Dylann Roof case|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article99027302.html|accessdate=October 1, 2016|publisher=The State|date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2016, federal prosecutors filed a motion seeking to bar Roof's attorneys from asking the jurors for mercy during sentencing should he be found guilty of the charges against him. They argue that the defense will already have the opportunity to present evidence that could sway the jury's opinion for sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/dylann-roof-accused-church-shooter-should-not-ask-jury-mercy-n644101|title=Dylann Roof, Accused Church Shooter, Should Not Ask Jury for Mercy: Feds|publisher=NBC News|date=September 6, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016|first=Erik|last=Ortiz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WACH.Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wach.com/news/local/prosecutors-want-to-use-timeline-exhibit-in-guilt-phase-of-dylann-roofs-federal-trial-09-07-2016|title=Prosecutors want to use timeline exhibit in guilt phase of Dylann Roof’s federal trial|publisher=WACH|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, prosecutors asked for the use of summary charts as evidence for the trial. One of the charts was expected to be a timeline of the case as drafted by the agent responsible for investigating the shooting.&lt;ref name="WACH.Timeline"/&gt;

====Trial and sentencing====
[[File:TerreHauteUSP.jpg|thumb|[[USP Terre Haute]], where Roof is incarcerated]]
On December 7, 2016, Roof's federal trial began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/us/dylann-roof-trial.html|title=Heart-Rending Testimony as Dylann Roof Trial Opens|work=New York Times|last2=Blinder|first2=Alan|last1=Sack|first1=Kevin|date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury consisted of "two black women, eight white women, one white man and one black man".&lt;ref name=ibt20161207a&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/dylann-roof-trial-update-6-things-know-plus-jury-breakdown-ahead-hate-crime-case-2456417 |title=Dylann Roof Trial Update: 6 Things To Know, Plus Jury Breakdown Ahead Of Hate Crime Case|author=Lydia O'Neal|publisher=International Business Times|date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2017|quote=Upon the selection Tuesday of a jury consisting of two black women, eight white women, one white man and one black man, the federal trial has begun for Charleston shooter Dylann Roof.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days into the trial, Roof's confession was played in court, admitting that he had killed the people at the church before chuckling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Press|first1=Associated|title=Dylann Roof's confession shown to jury at Charleston church shooting trial|work=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dylann-roof-confession-fbi-jury-charleston-church-shooting-trial/|accessdate=December 9, 2016|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 2016, after about two hours of deliberation, the jury found Roof guilty on all 33 counts.&lt;ref&gt;

At a court hearing on December 28, 2016, Roof reiterated that he would proceed with the sentencing phase without attorneys, although Judge Gergel repeatedly warned him that it was not in his interests to do so. At the hearing Roof said that he did not plan to call any witnesses or present any evidence at the sentencing phase in order to avoid the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/28/church-shooter-dylann-roof-says-wont-call-witnesses-give-evidence-to-spare-life.html|title=Church shooter Dylann Roof says he won't call witnesses, give evidence to spare life |publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=December 28, 2016|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2017, following a lengthy closed-door competency hearing, Judge Gergel denied a motion, submitted [[under seal]] by Roof's court-appointed counsel, that sought to have Roof declared incompetent.&lt;ref name="BlinderCompetent"&gt;Alan Blinder, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/dylann-roof-charleston-church-killer-is-deemed-competent-for-sentencing.html Dylann Roof, Charleston Church Killer, Is Deemed Competent for Sentencing], ''New York Times'' (January 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tonya Maxwell, [http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2016/12/29/new-competency-hearing-slated-charleston-church-shooter/95964474/ New competency hearing slated for Charleston church shooter], ''Asheville Citizen-Times'' (December 30, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Gergel wrote: "After fully considering all of the evidence presented, the court ruled from the bench that Defendant remains competent to stand trial and to self-represent."&lt;ref name="BlinderCompetent"/&gt;

On January 10, 2017, the jury recommended the death penalty for Roof,&lt;ref name="DeathJury"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/us/dylann-roof-trial/index.html |title=Dylann Roof jury: Death penalty for Charleston church shooter |last=Shah |first=Khushbu |date=January 10, 2017 |access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 11, 2017 Judge Gergel sentenced Dylann Roof to death by lethal injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sack|first1=Kevin|last2=Blinder|first2=Alan|title=Anguish, Rage and Mercy as Dylann Roof Is Sentenced to Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/dylann-roof-sentencing.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=January 26, 2017|page=A version of this article appears in print on January 12, 2017, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Anguish, Mercy and Defiance at Roof’s Sentencing.|date=January 11, 2017|quote=At the close of the nearly five-hour hearing, Judge Richard M.

Until April 21, 2017 Roof was located at the Charleston County Jail; on that day federal authorities took custody of him. On April 22, 2017, Roof arrived at [[USP Terre Haute]], the location of the federal death row for men and the federal execution chamber and where all executions by the federal government take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Byrd, Caitlin|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/church_shooting/dylann-roof-is-now-on-federal-death-row-in-indiana/article_35026d62-276b-11e7-aead-af537dabe8fe.html|title=Dylann Roof is now on federal death row in Indiana|publisher=''[[The Post and Courier]]''|date=April 22, 2017|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-trial proceedings and release of documents====
On May 10, 2017, Judge Gergel denied Roof's motion for a new trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postandcourier.com/ruling-denying-bid-for-new-roof-trial/pdf_8e7596ba-35c8-11e7-a6b9-0380c3b8c11c.html ''United States v.

The psychiatric report showed that Roof stated of the relatives of his victims that he "did not identify with them, he didn't care."&lt;ref name="HawesSmith"/&gt; Ballenger concluded that Roof had "perhaps some [[Autism|Autistic]] traits" and meets the criteria for "[[Social Anxiety Disorder]], probably [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], possible [[Autistic Spectrum Disorder]], a [[Substance use disorder|Mixed Substance Abuse Disorder]], depression by history and a [[Schizoid Personality Disorder]]" but was competent to stand trial.&lt;ref name="MonkRoldán"/&gt;  Ballenger wrote that Roof blocked his attorneys from introducing any evidence of autism or other disorders, as well as various [[delusion]]s,&lt;ref name="HawesSmith"/&gt; at trial because he did not want "any issue to take away from the rationale he had for committing his crimes" because he felt that it would "his reputation was ruined, ... He continues to feel that the only thing that is important to him is to protect his reputation."&lt;ref name="MonkRoldán"/&gt; Roof, who denies having autism,&lt;ref&gt;Drew Tripp, [http://abcnews4.com/news/emanuel-ame-shooting/dylann-roof-likely-had-autism-but-preferred-death-over-that-label-court-records-show Dylann Roof likely has autism, but preferred death over that label, court records show], WCIV (May 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; told Ballenger that he "would rather die" than rely on autism defense, stating "it would ruin me" and "everybody would think I am a weirdo."&lt;ref name="HawesSmith"/&gt; Ballenger concluded that: "all of his decisions in the trial are dominated and driven by his primary racial prejudice and wish to preserve that as the sole rationale for his crimes and to protect his long term image and reputation as someone who has no mental illness."&lt;ref name="HawesSmith"/&gt;

==2016 assault in prison==
On August 4, 2016, Roof was reportedly beaten by a fellow inmate while detained at the Charleston County Detention Center. Roof, who suffered hits and bruising to the face and body, was not seriously injured, and he was allowed to return to his cell after being examined by jail medical personnel. The inmate was identified as 25-year-old African-American Dwayne Marion Stafford, who was awaiting trial on charges of first-degree assault and strong-arm robbery. Stafford was able to exit his unlocked cell, get through a steel cell door with a narrow vertical window, and go down the stairs into the jail's protective custody unit to reach Roof. At the time of the attack, Roof was alone after two detention officers assigned to be with him left, one being on break and the other called away to do another task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/04/us/south-carolina-dylann-roof-beaten/index.html|title=Accused Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof beaten in jail|work=CNN|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2016|first=Steve|last=Visser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20160804/160809747/sheriffs-office-cites-officer-complacency-|title=Sheriff’s Office cites officer complacency|work=Charleston Post Courier|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2016|first1=Angie|last1=Jackson|first2=Melissa|last2=Boughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/deputies-man-accused-church-shooting-assaulted-161523177.html|title=Sheriff: Jail inmate slugs man charged in church massacre|publisher=Yahoo!

An '''Emissions Trading Registry''' is a web-based application that records:

*CO2 allowances and units allocated to and held in operator, person and Government accounts
*The movement of allowances and units between accounts (including allocations, transfers, surrender and cancellations)
*Annual verified emissions of installations
*Annual compliance status of installations.

An account holder can therefore hold, transfer, cancel or acquire EU Allowances (EUAs) and [[Assigned amount units|Kyoto units (e.g. CERs, ERUs, AAUs, RMUs, tCERs and lCERs)]]. Further details regarding each of these unit types can be found in [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/2008-11-12_Guide_to_Allowances_and_Kyoto_Units.pdf A Guide to Using Kyoto Units in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme], available on the [[Environment Agency| Environment Agency’s]] website. In addition, regulators and nominated competent authorities can manage regulated industries (those with legal emissions reduction targets), and monitor national compliance and performance against international emissions reductions obligations.

Computerised registries are key components of the [[EU ETS|EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)]] and wider international emissions trading under the [[UNFCC|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC's)]] [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Under Directive 2003/87/EC, EU Member States were required to put in place a standardised, electronic national registry from 2005, whilst Parties to the Kyoto Protocol were required to put in place a national registry to allow international emissions trading from 2008. The functional requirements of the Registry are determined by the European Commission (through the Registry Regulations) and the UNFCCC secretariat (through various COP / MOP decisions).

All national registries are connected directly to the [[UNFCCC]]’s International Transaction Log (ITL). This transaction log is responsible for checking all transactions to ensure they adhere to the rules of international emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol. The ITL also has a link to the EC’s Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL). This transaction log is responsible for checking all transactions to ensure that they adhere to the rules of the EU ETS.

'''Forrest Brisbin Spaulding''' (May 4, 1892 – December 9, 1965) was an American librarian. He was named in the ''[[American Libraries]]'' article, "100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century" for his contribution to intellectual freedom in writing the [[Library Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, M. (1999). 100 of the MOST IMPORTANT LEADERS WE HAD in the 20TH CENTURY.(library leaders). American Libraries, 30(11), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] who is remembered not only for his contributions to librarianship, but also for the positive influence he had on the communities in which he lived and worked. In a commentary on the play ''The Not So Quiet Librarian'', by Cynthia Mercati, Humanities Iowa writes that "Spaulding's words and his life touched everyone who loved not just books but freedom of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Humanities Welcome (2008). [http://www.uiowa.edu/~humiowa/speakers%20bureau%20meet.html#TMDM "The Not So Quiet Librarian"] Retrieved September 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Forrest Spaulding is remembered for his contributions to librarianship, he began his career as a reporter. The State Library of Iowa biography mentions that while he spent some time as director of  Peru's libraries and museums in 1920, "he was also a correspondent for the [[Associated Press]]. He is noted as saying that his 'efforts to report the news from that country gave him a bitter object lesson in censorship.'"&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;Forrest Spaulding : author, Library Bill of Rights (2008). [Des Moines, Iowa: State Library of Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library Outreach==
Spaulding believed in library outreach and frequently organized traveling libraries, often for military groups.&lt;ref name="hovde"&gt;Hovde, D. M. (1997). YMCA Libraries on the Mexican Border, 1916. Libraries &amp; Culture, 32(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1916, he worked with the YMCA to create collections to send to soldiers on the Mexican border and while these collections were small in number, Spaulding strove to ensure they were broad in topic and felt the items would all return well-used.&lt;ref name="hovde" /&gt;  He served as director for the [[Public Library of Des Moines|Des Moines Public Library]] from 1917-1919 when he left to pursue other interests, among them the library &amp; museum project in Peru. He then returned to serve as the Director of the Des Moines Library from 1927-1952. He created what became known as "the waterfront university" in the basement of the Des Moines Library for unemployed men and others that were struggling during the [[Great Depression|Depression]].&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;  He was an early adopter of new technology regarding library outreach and he put library programs on the air via WHO radio in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  At the heart of Spaulding's convictions regarding human rights and concerns about the threat of censorship was a belief in the power of the written word and an understanding that all people needed to have free and equal access to information.

==Library Bill of Rights==
In 1938, as concerns regarding censorship mounted, Spaulding wrote a library bill of rights. He presented it before the Des Moines library board and it was passed by the board as a proclamation that they would not give in to pressures to censor items from their collection. In the State Library of Iowa's biography ''Forrest Spaulding'' it is noted that in 1940 he was challenged regarding his library's copy of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf''.&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;  "Spaulding responded by saying that, 'if more people had read ''Mein Kampf'', some of Hitler's despotism might have been prevented.'  He maintained that the danger to the United States was not in knowing all about Hitler, but in not knowing all about him. He said 'we should fear the tendency of small minds in these days of stress.'"&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt; Spaulding's library bill was later adopted by the [[American Library Association]] and continues to remain a strong influence to librarianship today.  While the [[Library Bill of Rights]] was amended several times by the [[American Library Association|ALA]] to account for new media and concerns related to age, the original intent remains,&lt;ref name="robbins"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which is, to protect people's right to access information and to use the library.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for Access to Information==
In the article, ''The Librarian's Commitment to the Bill of Rights'', Berninghausen points out that prior to 1939, censorship did not appear to be a concern for most librarians.&lt;ref name="Berninghausen"&gt;Berninghausen, D. K. (1970). The Librarian's Commitment to the Library Bill of Rights. Library Trends, 19(1), 19-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  He found that "very few pieces on censorship in libraries appeared in the index to Library Literature before that time. Some of those few articles actually supported censorship."&lt;ref name="Berninghausen" /&gt; Louise Robbins also mentions in ''Censorship and the American Library'' that there was a lack of initial awareness and support stating that only "7% thought threats to the bill of rights were the most vital problem in libraries today."&lt;ref name="robbins" /&gt;  The bill was a focal point for controversy as was the ALA for adopting it. In putting his convictions into writing and bringing them before the ALA for endorsement, Forrest Spaulding took a stand regarding his convictions in an age when it was, in many ways, personally and politically risky to do so.  As Dean Shaloup says in his article, ''Do you know Forrest Spaulding?'', "this is even more admirable when you consider it was World War II-era  America, when anyone promoting anything other than apple pie, baseball, target shooting and flag waving were thought of as un-American."&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate = September 13, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looking Back, Moving Ahead==
Ann Symons, speaker and former librarian, mentions in a reflective essay on librarianship that she is grateful for his efforts not only for the profession but also as a library patron and notes that "Forrest Spaulding's library was not the library any of us work in today."&lt;ref&gt;Symons, A. (2005). The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same. In N. Horrocks (Ed.), Perspectives, insights &amp; priorities : 17 leaders speak freely of librarianship (pp. 123-130). Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Our society continues to struggle with questions regarding obscenity and controversial ideas. Librarians continue to receive pressure to remove and label items in their collection. Librarians are still occasionally persecuted for standing strong in their convictions to protect the right to read. The ALA's Economic Barriers to Freedom: an interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights begins by stating "a democracy presupposes an informed citizenry."&lt;ref&gt;

  | accessdate = September 23, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Being able to fully explore all sides of an issue is imperative to forming an educated opinion regarding the issue. In advocating for intellectual freedom in the creation of his bill of rights, Forrest Spaulding gave librarians a platform on which to stand as they work to protect every person’s right to access information.

{{History of Madagascar}}
The '''High Transitional Authority''' ([[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]: ''Fitondrana Avon'ny Tetezamita'' (FAT); [[French language|French]]: ''Haute Autorité de Transition'' or HAT) was a provisional executive body that came to power in [[Madagascar]] following the coup that forced [[Marc Ravalomanana]] to leave the country on March 17, 2009 as a result of the [[2009 Malagasy protests]]. It was headed by [[Andry Rajoelina]], who appointed members to the body weeks prior to the handing of executive authority from Ravalomanana to the military, which subsequently gave the authority over to the High Transitional Authority.

The HAT was primarily dominated by members of [[Determined Malagasy Youth]], Rajoelina's party.

On September 17, 2011, a "Roadmap for Ending the Crisis in Madagascar," was signed by opposition leaders that was backed by the [[Southern African Development Community]], or SADC. This resolution aimed at creating a stable government once more, and ending the political crisis that endured in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar: Government|url=http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/madagascar/government|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HAT repeatedly rescheduled the general election,&lt;ref name = indefinitely&gt;{{cite web | title = Madagascar: Rajoelina could throw in the towel of the Malagasy presidential race |work = Indian Ocean Times | url = http://en.indian-ocean-times.com/Madagascar-Rajoelina-could-throw-in-the-towel-of-the-Malagasy-presidential-race_a1797.html | date = 5 August 2013 | accessdate = 11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was held on 20 December 2013, following a first round of presidential elections on 25 October. The presidential elections in December were a runoff between [[Jean Louis Robinson]] and [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]], the top two candidates to emerge from the first round of voting in October. The official results of the second round were announced on 7 January 2014 with Rajaonarimampianina proclaimed the victor with nearly 54% of the vote. This election ended the HAT and restored a regular constitutional government in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=17 January 2014|title=Madagascar Court confirms President-elect|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-madagascar-court-confirms-ex-finance-minister-rajaonarimampianina-president-elect/1832208.html|newspaper=|location=|publisher=Voice Of America|accessdate= 17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government of Omer Beriziky==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2385">'''Instrumentum regni''' (literally, "instrument of monarchy", therefore "of government") is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] perhaps inspired by [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;«''Nullum maius boni imperii instrumentum quam bonos amicos esse''» Tacitus, ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'', IV 7. ("No better instrument of good government than being good friends")&lt;/ref&gt; used to express the exploitation of [[Superstition|religion]] by [[State (polity)|State]] or [[ecclesiastical polity]] as a means of controlling the masses, or in particular to achieve political and [[Temporal power (papal)|mundane]] ends.

== History ==
The concept expressed by the phrase has undergone various forms and has been taken up by several writers and philosophers throughout history. Among these [[Polybius]], [[Lucretius]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Vittorio Alfieri]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi]].

Among these the oldest was undoubtedly the Greek historian Polybius, who in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' says:
{{quote|I believe that it is the very thing which among other peoples is an object of reproach, I mean superstition, which maintains the cohesion of the Roman State. These matters are clothed in such pomp and introduced to such an extent into their public and private life that nothing could exceed it, a fact which will surprise many. My own opinion at least is that they have adopted this course for the sake of the common people. It is a course which perhaps would not have been necessary had it been possible to form a state composed of wise men, but as every multitude is fickle, full of lawless desires, unreasoned passion, and violent anger, the multitude must be held in by invisible terrors and suchlike pageantry. For this reason I think, not that the ancients acted rashly and at haphazard in introducing among the people notions concerning the gods and beliefs in the terrors of hell, but that the moderns are most rash and foolish in banishing such beliefs.|Polybius&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Renaissance]] the concept was taken up by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in his ''[[The Prince]]''.

'''Intelink''' is a group of secure [[intranets]] used by the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. The first Intelink network was established in 1994 to take advantage of [[Internet]] technologies (though not connected to the public Internet) and services to promote intelligence dissemination and business workflow.  Since then it has become an essential capability for the US intelligence community and its partners to share information, collaborate across agencies, and conduct business.  ''Intelink'' refers to the web environment on protected [[top secret]], secret, and [[Classified information in the United States#Unclassified|unclassified networks]].  One of the key features of Intelink is [[Intellipedia]], an online system for collaborative data sharing based on [[MediaWiki]].  Intelink uses [[WordPress]] as the basis of its blogging service.

==Versions on different intranets==

=== Intelink-U===
Intelink-U (Intelink-SBU) is a [[sensitive but unclassified]] (SBU) variant of Intelink which was established for use by U.S. federal organizations and properly vetted state, tribal, and local officials so sensitive information and [[open source intelligence]] could be shared amongst a secure community of interest.  Intelink-U was formerly known as the [[Open Source Information System]] (OSIS).  Intelink-U operates on the [[DNI-U]] network.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/program/disseminate/intelink.htm Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program: Intelink]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/program/disseminate/osis.htm Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program: Open Source Information System (OSIS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409003846/https://fas.org/irp/program/disseminate/osis.htm |date=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IC Consumer's Guide"&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/reports/IC_Consumers_Guide_2009.pdf National Intelligence, a consumer's guide, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524093812/http://www.dni.gov/reports/IC_Consumers_Guide_2009.pdf |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelink-S===
Intelink-S (Intelink-Secret or Intelink-SIPRNet) is the secret-level variant of Intelink which is primarily used by the U.S. Departments of Defense, State, and Justice.  Intelink-S operates on [[SIPRNet]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IC Consumer's Guide"/&gt;

===Intelink-TS===
Intelink-TS (Intelink-SCI) is the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]]'s Intelink which facilitates sharing intelligence products up to the [[Top Secret]]/[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]] (SCI) level.  Intelink-TS operates on [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System|JWICS]].&lt;ref name="IC Consumer's Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress05/bald092105.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Congressional Testimony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410002010/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress05/bald092105.htm |date=2010-04-10 }} Statement of Gary M. Bald Executive Assistant Director National Security Branch Federal Bureau of Investigation Before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary September 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelink-P===
Intelink-P (Intelink-PolicyNet) is run by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] as CIA's sole-source link to the [[White House]] and other high-level, intelligence consumers. Today, Intelink-P is more commonly referred to as CapNet.&lt;ref name="IC Consumer's Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iwar.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.iwar.org.uk/sigint/resources/csi/intel-in-the-internet-era.htm Intelligence in the Internet Era – Studies in Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422052142/http://iwar.org.uk/sigint/resources/csi/intel-in-the-internet-era.htm |date=2007-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelink-C===
Intelink-C (Intelink-Commonwealth) links the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia intelligence communities at the TS/SCI level.  Today, Intelink-C is more commonly referred to by its network name of [[STONEGHOST]].&lt;ref name="IC Consumer's Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iwar.org.uk"/&gt;

==Books and novels==
In 1999 [[Fredrick Thomas Martin]] wrote a book about Intelink, titled ''How U.S. Intelligence Built INTELINK, The World's Largest, Most Secure Network''. It claims to be an inside look at the U.S. intelligence community's worldwide, super-secure intranet, and the never-before-published story of Intelink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topsecretnet.com/ Home Page for Top Secret Intranet: ''How U.S. Intelligence Built INTELINK - The World's Largest, Most Secure Network'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''Rogue Warrior: Task Force Blue'' by [[Richard Marcinko]], the protagonist uses Intelink, during his mission countering domestic terrorism in the United States, and his assassination of a [[Ross Perot]]-like character, who is the architect of a domestic terror network.

In the novel ''Threat Vector'' by [[Tom Clancy]], one of the characters found an exploit in the Microsoft's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]] that allowed him to penetrate the networks of a United States [[defense contractor]] and exploit that penetration to access Intelink-TS.

==References==
&lt;references/&gt;
Intelink itself is also mentioned in several novels written by Andy Mcnab, in particular ''Crisis Four''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11277">The [[crossbow]] often has a complicated legal status due to its potential use for lethal purposes, and its similarities with both [[firearms]] and other [[archery]] weapons. The crossbow is, for technical purposes, often categorized as a firearm by various legal jurisdictions, despite the fact that no combustion is required to propel the projectile.

This is a list of laws concerning [[crossbow]]s by country.

Crossbows are not considered firearms in the United States.

In some nations, such as Canada and the United States, crossbows are not subject to any specific regulation, in most there are laws, which differ widely. Each jurisdiction has its own definition of a crossbow, and in some cases pistol-sized crossbows are treated differently. There may be minimum ages for possession, and sales of both crossbows and bolts may be restricted. Specific rules around hunting use are also common. 

Some jurisdictions require permits and background checks similar to those required for firearms.

==Australia==
Pistol crossbows are strictly controlled in all [[Australia]]n states due to their concealable nature. Crossbows can be bought and owned by adults over 18 years of age, while in most states crossbows can only be owned with a special licence, for instance for members of an official sporting club. Control on transport of crossbows between states has increased to prevent unauthorised use of imported crossbows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausbow.com.au/crossbow.htm Ausbow Industries - Australian crossbow manufacturer and agent for Excalibur crossbow&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122235855/http://www.ausbow.com.au/crossbow.htm |date=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes to laws in Western Australia to prohibit crossbow ownership require applications to legally possess a crossbow by July 2, 2011 before they became illegal to possess and sporting usage is only legal for people currently participating in the sport at the date of the laws introduction and does not apply to or allow for new participants thereafter.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Aboutus/News/ProhibitionofcrossbowsWesternAustraliaPolic/tabid/1816/Default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulgaria==
In [[Bulgaria]] crossbows are not regulated, but their use for fishing and hunting is explicitly prohibited.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], it is legal to own a crossbow and has a similar designation as an airgun. Weapons of a projectile velocity under 500 FPS may be owned by any person 18 years of age or older. No licence is required to purchase a crossbow.  Though older [[Possession and Acquisition Licence|PAL]] cards say that one is allowed to acquire one, the laws designating them as firearms were struck down before they could be implemented.  Crossbows designed to be fired with one hand and crossbows measuring less than 500&amp;nbsp;mm in length are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/faq/index-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting in Canada is regulated at the provincial level, therefore the legality of crossbow hunting vary from province to province.

==Czech Republic==

Crossbows and other mechanical weapons with drawing force under 150N are not regulated. Mechanical weapons above this limit are class D weapons, which means they can be used or owned by person at least 18 years (no license is required), must not be worn visibly, can be used at private places (where is no danger to health or property) and at licensed shooting ranges and at visibly marked places over-sighted by a designated person.

==Denmark==
In [[Denmark]], the creation or import of crossbows without a license is prohibited by Danish law on weapons ([https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=142859 Våbenloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om våben og eksplosivstoffer]), and crossbows are not recognized as legal weapons for hunting.

==Finland==
In [[Finland]], crossbows are banned in hunting. Possession of crossbows and other bows requires no licence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1996/19961374&lt;/ref&gt; In other legal aspects the crossbow is parallel to an [[air gun]].

==Germany==
In [[Germany|German]] law on weapons, crossbows and firearms are equated in their legal status as weapons ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050405083152/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/waffg_2002/anlage_1_74.html WaffG Anlage 1 1.2.2]), but in contrast to guns, acquisition, possession, trade or production of crossbows requires no license ([https://web.archive.org/web/20051125054133/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/waffg_2002/anlage_2_75.html WaffG Anlage 2]). Because of their definition as weapons, but without further restrictions, any crossbows can be used by minors under custody of competent adults. Fishing and hunting with crossbows is prohibited. As a specialty to be noted is that, crossbows do not shoot as per legal definition in Germany, since they don't use expanding gases or similar mechanisms to propel a projectile.

==Netherlands==
In [[the Netherlands]] crossbows are regulated by the "wet weapons en munitie" (law on weapons and ammunition). Crossbows and crossbow bolts are placed in category 4, along with bows, swords, spears, etc. It is legal to possess weapons from this category providing that the individual is over 18. It is not allowed to carry those weapons in public. When transporting, the weapon should be packaged in a way that one has to perform at least 3 actions before the weapon is ready for use (this does not include the steps required to actually load and fire the weapon). Only on special occasions such as [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]] events this is not strictly enforced. Crossbows should be used only for collecting, re-enactment or sportive purposes. Hunting with crossbows (or bows) is strictly prohibited in the Netherlands under [[animal cruelty]] laws.

==Norway==
In [[Norway]], crossbows are considered equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110719233116/http://www.toll.no/templates_TAD/Article.aspx?id=131790&amp;epslanguage=NN Innførsel og utførsel av våpen, Tollvesenet]). Hunting with crossbows is not allowed.

==Poland==
In [[Poland]], crossbows are considered a 'dangerous devices' equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license ([http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20030520451 Dz.U.2003/52/451]). Hunting with crossbows is not allowed ([http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU20050610548/O/D20050548.pdf Dz.U.2005/61/548]).

==Sweden==
In [[Sweden]], crossbows are considered equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license. Hunting with crossbows is not allowed. Swedish law dictates that any weapon that stores its energy, i.e., weapons with a firing mechanism, that produces more than 10 joules at the muzzle are illegal without licence. Thus very weak crossbows are sold in toy stores as well as low powered air rifles (not sold to minors). Sale or possession of normal bows of any strength are regulated in the same way as the previously mentioned weak crossbows and air rifles.

==United Kingdom==
No licence or registration is required to own a crossbow in the United Kingdom. Under the [[Crossbows Act 1987]], crossbows cannot be bought or sold in England, Wales or Scotland by or to those under 18. Possession is also prohibited by those under 18 years old except under adult supervision. The act states that crossbows may be used by persons under 18 years of age only when supervised by a person aged 21 years old or over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1987/cukpga_19870032_en_1 Office of Public Sector Information - Crossbows Act 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar prohibitions for Northern Ireland are made in the Crossbows (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Section 5 of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] prevents their use for hunting birds. In Scotland, section 50 of the [[Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=civic+government&amp;Year=1982&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2191918&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2191981&amp;filesize=4545 Section 50 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; makes it illegal to be drunk in a public place in possession of a crossbow.

Section 44 of the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]] raised the age limit from 17 to 18 in England and Wales, with effect from 1 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section12/chapter_c.html The Crown prosecution Service - Offensive weapons] retrieved 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Parliament made similar changes in section 62 of the [[Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=custodial+sentences&amp;Year=2007&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3326378&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3326473&amp;filesize=1299 Section 62 of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; also with effect from 1 October 2007.

==United States==
It is legal to own a crossbow. Rules regarding hunting with crossbow vary by state. ([http://www.bestcrossbowsource.com/crossbow-hunting-regulations-by-state/ Laws By State])

'''Michigan'''

Any licensed hunter who has obtained a free crossbow stamp can hunt with a crossbow during any season in which a firearm is allowed, for both big and small game, except hunters in the Upper Peninsula may not use a crossbow or a modified bow during the Dec. 1 - Jan. 1 late archery deer season and Dec. 7-16 muzzleloader deer season, unless the hunter is disabled and has a crossbow permit or special permit to take game with a modified bow.
Any licensed hunter may use a crossbow throughout the archery deer season in the Lower Peninsula (Oct. 1 - Nov. 14 and Dec. 1 - Jan. 1) and during the early archery deer season in the Upper Peninsula (Oct. 1 - Nov. 14). Crossbow use is not allowed in the Red Oak Unit during the archery-only bear season (Oct. 5-11) except for certified hunters with a disability.
The DNR may issue a crossbow permit or a special permit to take game with a modified bow to a person with a valid hunting license to take a deer during an open deer season, if the person is certified as having permanent or temporary disability, as defined in Wildlife Conservation Order 5.95, which renders a person unable to use conventional archery equipment. Hunters may use a modified bow where crossbows are legal. A modified bow is a bow, other than a crossbow, that has been physically altered so that it may be held, aimed and shot with one arm. When hunting deer, bear, elk and turkey, crossbow hunters must use only arrows, bolts and quarrels with a broadhead hunting type of point not less than 7/8 of an inch wide with a minimum of 14 inches in length. See Hunter Orange Clothing Requirements.

'''New York'''

Hunting with crossbow is legal to hunt game as of August 2014.

The '''Legaliteti''' ({{lang-sq|Lëvizja Legalitetit}}; {{lang-en|Legality Movement}}) were an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[royalist]] and [[Monarchy|pro-monarchy]] faction founded in
1941.

==History==

The negative action of the [[Albanian Communists]] on the [[Kosovo]] issue alienated a significant number of its adherents from that border region. Following November 1943, Abaz Kupi, until the [[Mukje Agreement]], was a member of the Central Council of the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|NLM]], withdrew with others to form the Legaliteti.&lt;ref name="Edwin E. Jacques"/&gt; Kupi was a respected [[Gheg]] chieftain who had commanded King Zog's troops in [[Durrës]] when the Italians invaded Albania. In the early 1940s, three new political factions emerged within Albania after the Italians were defeated: the Albanian Communists, [[Balli Kombëtar]] (National Front), and Legaliteti (Legality). The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] originally supported the Legaliteti. Being the smallest faction with no significant influence in Albania, the Allies broke aid with the Legaliteti and aided the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], who in turn backed the Albanian communists.&lt;ref name=ref9&gt;{{cite book|title=Tito, Mihailović, and the allies, 1941-1945|author=Walter R. Roberts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43CbLU8FgFsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tito,+Mihailovi%C4%87,+and+the+allies,+1941-1945&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HrILTc7GHpDOvQPom9XtDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the Albanian communists assumed control over Albania at the end of World War II. Most Legaliteti members were executed or had escaped to the west.&lt;ref name=ref9/&gt;

==Legacy==

The monarchist [[Legality Movement Party]] takes its name from the group.

'''Maltenglish''', also known as '''Manglish''', '''Minglish''', '''Maltese English''' or '''Maltingliż''', refers to the phenomenon of [[code-switching]] between [[Maltese language|Maltese]], a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], and [[English language|English]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[West Germanic languages|Germanic]] language.

Both Maltese and English are official languages in [[Malta]], and about 88% of the Maltese people can speak English as a second language. Various Maltese social groups switch back and forth between the two languages, or [[Macaronic language|macaronically]] mix lexical aspects of [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]] while engaging in informal conversation or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasagabaster|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Huguet|editor2-first=Angel|title=Multilingualism in European Bilingual Contexts: Language Use and Attitudes|date=2007|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781853599293|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDodTJ1B5AEC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltenglish can also refer to English [[loanword]]s in the Maltese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palma|first1=Alfred|title=Growing list of Manglish monstrosities|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111127/letters/Growing-list-of-Manglish-monstrosities.395650|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Recent studies have shown that code-switching is practiced by a third of the population in everyday discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brincat|first1=Joseph M.|title=Maltese – an unusual formula|url=http://macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese-print.htm|publisher=MED Magazine – Issue 27|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common areas where code-switching occurs is in part of the [[Districts of Malta#Northern Harbour District|Northern Harbour District]], mainly in the towns of [[Sliema]], [[St. Julian's]], [[Pembroke, Malta|Pembroke]], [[Swieqi]], [[Madliena]], [[San Ġwann]] and [[Kappara]]. These areas are sometimes stereotyped as ''tal-pepé''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leone-Ganado|first1=Philip|title=Exploring a Stereotype: Sliema Girls Say|url=http://www.sundaycircle.com/2012/06/exploring-a-stereotype-sliema-girls-say/|website=Sunday Circle|accessdate=13 March 2015|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Mixed case
|Give mummy a kiss.
|Tiha bewsa 'il-omm.
|Tiha ''kiss'' 'il-''mummy''.
|-
|In a Maltese sentence
|The actor of that film took the limo to meet the director.
|L-attur ta' dak il-film mar jiltaqa' mad-direttur bil-limużin.
|L-''actor'' ta' dak il-film mar jiltaqa' mad-''director'' bil-''limo''.
|-
|In an English sentence
|So tell him I'm coming now, you know, because I can't make it tomorrow.
|Mela għidlu li ġejja issa, ta, għax ma nistax għada.
|''Mela'' tell him I'm coming now, ''ta'', ''għax'' I can't make it tomorrow.
|}

While code switching in English sentences is most predominant in the Northern Harbour District, code switching in a Maltese sentence is much more common throughout the country. This is usually because the Maltese word is not so well known or used. Examples include:
*the Maltese word for a mushroom is ''faqqiegħ'', but most people still tend to call it a ''mushroom'' in Maltese.
*the proper Maltese word for television is ''televiżjoni'' (as derived from Italian), but most people still call it a ''television'', for example ''Rajt film fuq it-television ilbieraħ'' (I saw a film on television yesterday).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9079">'''Mark C. Suchman''' (born 1960) is an American sociologist, Professor in Sociology at [[Brown University]], known for his work on [[Institutional theory]], and particularly on "managing legitimacy."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Ronald K., Bradley R. Agle, and Donna J. Wood. "Toward a theory of stakeholder identification and salience: Defining the principle of who and what really counts." ''Academy of management review'' 22.4 (1997): 853-886.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Howard. ''Organizations evolving.'' Sage, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Suchman obtained his AB in sociology at [[Harvard University]] in 1983 and his MA in sociology in 1985 at [[Stanford University]]. At Stanford he also obtained his PhD in sociology in 1994 with the thesis entitled "On Advice of Counsel: Law Firms and Venture Capital Funds as Information Intermediaries in the Structuration of Silicon Valley", under the supervision of [[W. Richard Scott]].&lt;ref name="CV 2015"&gt;[https://vivo.brown.edu/docs/drrb/1231433309.pdf?nocache=258135168 Mark C. Suchman, CV], at ''brown.edu''. Accessed March 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he holds a JD from [[Yale Law School]] (1989).

Suchman started his academic career as a research assistant under [[Harrison White]] at Harvard in 1982. At Stanford from 1985 to 1989, he was a teaching assistant, subsequently, of  Morris Zelditch, [[Ann Swidler]], Nancy Tuma and Lawrence Wu. In 1993, he started at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] as assistant professor of sociology and law, and was promoted to associate professor in 1998, and full professor in 2003. In 2008, he moved to [[Brown University]], Rhode Island, where he was appointed Professor of Sociology.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt; From 2011 to 2012, he was program director for Social, Human and Organizational Factors and Resources in the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.

Suchman was awarded a [[National Merit Scholarship]] in 1979, a Harvard College Scholarship in 1980 and a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship from 1984 to 1988. He was a [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] Scholar in health policy research at [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1999-2001, and a fellow in residence at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] in 2001-03.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt;

He has chaired the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Sections on the Sociology of Law (2005-2006) and Organizations, Occupations, and Work (2016-2017), and has served on the Board of Trustees of the [[Law and Society Association]] (2005-2008).

== Work ==
=== "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches", 1995===
In his article "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'", Suchman defines legitimacy as "a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."&lt;ref name="Suchman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suchman|first1=Mark|title=Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches|journal=The Academy of Management Review |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=571–610 |doi=10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency. In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

Suchman states three types of legitimacy: 
* pragmatic legitimacy, 
* moral legitimacy, and 
* cognitive legitimacy.

=== Pragmatic legitimacy ===
Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; This is further broken down into three sub-sections: 
* exchange legitimacy, 
* influence legitimacy, and 
* dispositional legitimacy. 
Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;

Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt; This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

=== Moral legitimacy ===
Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, if the constituency  believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Yankelovich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankelovich|first1=Daniel|title=A Crisis of Moral Legitimacy|date=1974|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections:
* consequential legitimacy, 
* procedural legitimacy, 
* structural legitimacy, and 
* personal legitimacy. 
Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brinkerhoff |first1=Derick |title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suchman refers to this organization as being the "right organization for the job."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;

=== Cognitive legitimacy ===
Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;
Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sun |first1=William |last2=Louche |first2=Céline|last3=Pérez|first3=Roland|title=Finance and Sustainability: Towards a New Paradigm? A Post-Crisis Agenda|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|date=2011|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison /&gt; While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison/&gt;

The '''Ministry of Education and Training''' ('''MOET''', {{lang-vi|Bộ Giáo dục và Đào tạo}}) is the [[government ministry]] responsible for the governance of general/academic [[education]] and higher education (training) in [[Vietnam]].  Vocational Education is controlled by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MoLISA).   Ministry offices are located in central [[Ha Noi]], on Co Dai Viet street. In the Vietnamese system, MoET is responsible for the 'professional' performance and regulation of educational institutions under it, but not for ownership or finance, except for the major public universities (VNU, Vietnam National University, in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, fall directly under the Prime Minister's office, not MoET).  Ownership and administrative/financial responsibility for the bulk of educational institutions, including all school-level general education, falls under Provinces or Districts, which have substantial autonomy on many budgetary decisions under the Vietnamese constitution. Some institutions are also controlled by other central ministries, although mainly at higher education levels (senior secondary and colleges).

==Departments==
The Ministry maintains [[provinces of Vietnam|provincial-level]] departments (DoETs, Departments of E&amp;T), under which there are also district offices (BoETs, for Bureau of E&amp;T), and central departments.  Central departments of note include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.moet.gov.vn/?page=2.2 Ministry, Departments]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7010">In [[macroeconomics]], '''multiplier uncertainty''' is lack of perfect knowledge of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] effect of a particular policy action, such as a monetary or fiscal policy change, upon the intended target of the policy. For example, a [[fiscal policy]] maker may have a prediction as to the value of the [[fiscal multiplier]]—the ratio of the effect of a [[government spending]] change on [[GDP]] to the size of the government spending change—but is not likely to know the exact value of this ratio. Similar uncertainty may surround the magnitude of effect of a change in the [[monetary base]] or its growth rate upon some target variable, which could be the [[money supply]], the [[exchange rate]], the [[inflation rate]], or GDP.

There are several policy implications of multiplier uncertainty: (1) If the multiplier uncertainty is [[correlation|uncorrelated]] with additive uncertainty, its presence causes greater cautiousness to be optimal (the policy tools should be used to a lesser extent). (2) In the presence of multiplier uncertainty, it is no longer redundant to have more policy tools than there are targeted economic variables. (3) [[certainty equivalence principle|Certainty equivalence]] no longer applies under quadratic [[loss function|loss]]: optimal policy is not equivalent to a policy of [[expected value of including uncertainty|ignoring uncertainty]].

==Effect of multiplier uncertainty on the optimal magnitude of policy==

For the simplest possible case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brainard |first=William |year=1967 |title=Uncertainty and the effectiveness of policy |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=411–425 |jstor=1821642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; let ''P'' be the size of a policy action (a government spending change, for example), let ''y'' be the value of the target variable (GDP for example), let ''a'' be the policy multiplier, and let ''u'' be an additive term capturing both the linear intercept and all unpredictable components of the determination of ''y''.  Both ''a'' and ''u'' are random variables (assumed here for simplicity to be uncorrelated), with respective means E''a'' and E''u'' and respective variances &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_u&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;y = aP + u.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the policy maker cares about the expected squared deviation of GDP from a preferred value &lt;math&gt;y_d&lt;/math&gt;; then its [[loss function]] ''L'' is [[quadratic loss function|quadratic]] so that the objective function, expected loss, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{E}L = \text{E}(y-y_d)^2 = \text{E}(aP + u - y_d)^2 = [\text{E}(aP + u - y_d)]^2 + \text{var} (aP + u - y_d) = [(\text{E}a)P + \text{E}u - y_d]^2 + P^2 \sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_u.&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality assumes there is no covariance between ''a'' and ''u''. Optimizing with respect to the policy variable ''P'' gives the optimal value ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''opt''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{opt} = \frac{(\text{E}a)(y_d - \text{E}u)}{(\text{E}a)^2 + \sigma^2_a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the last term in the numerator is the gap between the preferred value ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; of the target variable and its expected value E''u'' in the absence of any policy action.  If there were no uncertainty about the policy multiplier, &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_a&lt;/math&gt; would be zero, and policy would be chosen so that the contribution of policy (the policy action ''P'' times its known multiplier ''a'') would be to exactly close this gap, so that with the policy action E''y'' would equal ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, the optimal policy equation shows that, to the extent that there is multiplier uncertainty (the extent to which &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), the magnitude of the optimal policy action is diminished.

Thus the basic effect of multiplier uncertainty is to make policy actions more cautious, although this effect can be modified in more complicated models.

==Multiple targets or policy instruments==

The above analysis of one target variable and one policy tool can readily be extended to multiple targets and tools.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitchell |first=Douglas W. |year=1990 |title=The efficient policy frontier under parameter uncertainty and multiple tools |journal=Journal of Macroeconomics |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=137–145 |doi=10.1016/0164-0704(90)90061-E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case a key result is that, unlike in the absence of multiplier uncertainty, it is not superfluous to have more policy tools than targets: with multiplier uncertainty, the more tools are available the lower expected loss can be driven.

==Analogy to portfolio theory==

There is a mathematical and conceptual analogy between, on the one hand, policy optimization with multiple policy tools having multiplier uncertainty, and on the other hand, [[Modern portfolio theory|portfolio optimization]] involving multiple investment choices having rate-of-return uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;
The usages of the policy variables correspond to the holdings of the risky assets, and the uncertain policy multipliers correspond to the uncertain rates of return on the assets.  In both models, [[mutual fund theorem]]s apply: under certain conditions, the optimal portfolios of all investors regardless of their preferences, or the optimal policy mixes of all policy makers regardless of their preferences, can be expressed as linear combinations of any two optimal portfolios or optimal policy mixes.

==Dynamic policy optimization==

The above discussion assumed a static world in which policy actions and outcomes for only one moment in time were considered.  However, the analysis generalizes to a context of multiple time periods in which both policy actions take place and target variable outcomes matter, and in which time lags in the effects of policy actions exist.  In this dynamic [[stochastic control]] context with multiplier uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chow |first=Gregory P. |year=1976 |title=Analysis and Control of Dynamic Economic Systems |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-15616-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnovsky |first=Stephen |year=1976 |title=Optimal stabilization policies for stochastic linear systems: The case of correlated multiplicative and additive disturbances |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=191–194 |jstor=2296741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnovsky |first=Stephen |year=1974 |title=The stability properties of optimal economic policies |journal=American Economic Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=136–148 |jstor=1814888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a key result is that the "certainty equivalence principle" does not apply: while in the absence of multiplier uncertainty (that is, with only additive uncertainty) the optimal policy with a quadratic loss function coincides with what would be decided if the uncertainty were ignored, this no longer holds in the presence of multiplier uncertainty.

The Front originated as a popular [[social movement]] which used massive [[civil disobedience]]&lt;ref name="LR21_frente_march" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hnlab_marchaElProgreso" /&gt; to support the restoration of Zelaya in replacement of the ''de facto'' President [[Roberto Micheletti]], whose government was perceived as a [[dictatorship]] in existence since 28 June 2009, the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="CEAL_DLCA_frente_about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pidhdd_frente" /&gt; The National Resistance Front pointed to Article 3 of the [[Constitution of Honduras#Constitution of 11 January 1982|1982 Constitution]] as a legal basis for opposing the ''de facto'' government,&lt;ref name="fnge_article3const1982" /&gt; and argued that it constituted the organised expression of Hondurans' right, under that article, to resist a government imposed by armed force.&lt;ref name="fnge_article3const1982"&gt;

After the [[Honduran general election, 2009|2009 general election]] saw [[Porfirio Lobo Sosa]] elected President, the FNRP continued to press for a constituent assembly, and to oppose the government's [[Human rights in Honduras|human rights abuses]]. [[Human Rights Watch]] reported in July 2010 that under Lobo Sosa "at least eight journalists and ten members of the National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP)" had been killed.&lt;ref name="HRW2010_07_29" /&gt; By August 2010 the FNRP had collected half of its target of 1.2m signatures in support of a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 16 August 2010, [http://www.counterpunch.org/reichard08162010.html US Embraces Honduran Thugocracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and composition==

The Front is a wide coalition of workers' organisations, [[Peasant|campesinos]]' organisations and other [[grassroots]] organisations, together with centrist/left-wing political parties and movements that have stated their opposition to the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis|2009 Honduran coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="CEAL_DLCA_frente_about"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Llamamiento del Frente Nacional contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras a la Clase Obrera Mundial| work =| publisher =Centro de Estudios y Apoyo Laboral (CEAL) – Derechos Laborales en Centroamerica| date =2009-08-03| url =http://www.ceal-dlca.org/2009/08/llamamiento-del-frente-nacional-contra.html | doi =| accessdate =2009-08-10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ivkETfGT |archivedate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pidhdd_frente"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Frente Nacional Contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras |language=es | work =| publisher =Plataforma Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo | date =2009-07-12| url =http://www.pidhdd.org/content/view/680/165/ |format =| doi =| accessdate =2009-08-10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ivW4Xv0e |archivedate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FNRP supports a referendum process that should lead to a national [[constituent assembly]].&lt;ref name="FNGE_SanJose_response" /&gt;

==Policies and actions==
Frequent public statements regarding the political and [[human rights]] situation since the coup d'état occurred are made by the National Resistance Front and redistributed by many of the participating or supporting groups, e.g. the [[feminism|women's rights group]] ''Centro de Derechos de Mujeres de Tegucigalpa''.&lt;ref name="awid_frente"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the San José mediation meeting in Costa Rica, the National Resistance Front stated its opposition to immunity for those who had carried out the coup d'état. It also said that it "supports the continuation of [[referendum processes]], which will eventually lead to the convocation of a national [[constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]] and the prior definition of the criteria and requirements for the prospective assembly members."&lt;ref name="FNGE_SanJose_response"&gt;{{cite web

In early August 2009, the National Resistance Front organised a converging national march, composed of many individual marches from different parts of Honduras, with convergence in [[San Pedro Sula]] and [[Tegucigalpa]] on 11 August.&lt;ref name="LR21_frente_march"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As of 9 August, about five thousand marchers who had left [[Colón (department)|Colón]] and [[Atlántida (department)|Atlántida]] on 4 August arrived in [[El Progreso|El Progreso, Yoro]], the town from which ''de facto'' President [[Roberto Micheletti]] originates. About eight thousand marchers from the [[Ocotepeque (department)|Ocotepeque]], [[Lempira (department)|Lempira]], [[Copán (department)|Copán]] and [[Santa Bárbara Department, Honduras|Santa Bárbara]] departments were expected to join with these marchers in San Pedro Sula on 11 August. Thousands of other marchers were expected for the Tegucigalpa convergence. The marchers declared their aims to be the restoration of elected President [[Manuel Zelaya]] and the establishment of a [[constituent assembly]].&lt;ref name="hnlab_marchaElProgreso"&gt;

Also in August 2009, [[TeleSUR]] blamed the "paralysis" of the major sectors of the Honduran economy to the existence of the National Resistance Front.&lt;ref name="telesur_frente"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Resistencia contra el golpe de Estado mantiene paralizada a Honduras| work =| publisher =[[TeleSUR]]| date =2009-08-08

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paralyzed sectors included health, education, and electricity services, not to mention the closing of the four main Honduran airports.

==Attacks against the group==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Two of the leaders of the National Resistance Front, Juan Barahona and {{Interlanguage link multi|Rafael Alegría|fr}}, were briefly detained and later released by police during a demonstration against the coup d'état on 31 July 2009.&lt;ref name="militante_frente_alegria"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 30 members of the National Resistance Front have allegedly been killed since Zelaya's ouster on June 28, 2009. The first alleged death occurred on July 5, 2009 at the Toncontin Airport, when 19-year-old Isis Obed Murillo was shot and killed by the military. Over 4,000 have been allegedly detained. Some have allegedly disappeared and have not been found. One teacher disappeared after a union meeting with witnesses who said he was captured by the police. His body  later appeared covered in cuts in a field. Several alleged killings took place in the middle of the night, including that of union leader and Democratic Unification Party member Roger Bados. A number of people have allegedly suffered injuries from police and military beatings and have been poisoned by tear-gassing. Some organizations around the world have warned that the human rights situation in Honduras continues to rapidly deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;For the most recent and comprehensive study of the human rights situation in Honduras see [http://www.cofadeh.org/html/documentos/segundo_informe_situacionl_resumen_violaciones_ddhh_golpe_estado.pdf Segundo Informe sobre Derechos Humanos en Honduras] by Comité de Familiares de los Detenidos Desaparecidos de Honduras (COFADEH).&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=July 2016}}

Under the presidency of [[Porfirio Lobo Sosa]], [[human rights in Honduras]] have continued to suffer. According to [[Human Rights Watch]] in July 2010, "at least eight journalists and ten members of the National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP) ... have been killed since President Lobo assumed power on January 27, 2010."&lt;ref name="HRW2010_07_29"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], 29 July 2010, [https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/29/honduras-ongoing-attacks-foster-climate-intimidation Honduras: Ongoing Attacks Foster Climate of Intimidation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dame '''Nellie Robinson''', '''DC''', '''MBE''' (1880-1972) was an [[Antigua]]n teacher and school founder who was a pioneer in education. She broke down color and class barriers believing all children should have access to learning. As of 2017, she was the only woman to have received the [[Order of the National Hero (Antigua and Barbuda)|Order of the National Hero]] from the government of [[Antigua and Barbuda]].

==Early life==
Georgiana Ellen Robinson was born on 7 December 1880 in [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John’s]] on the island of [[Antigua]] in the [[West Indies]] to Margaret and George Robinson.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} As the second of eight children, she was raised in the family home on Newgate Street in St John's,{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} until the age of around ten, when she was sent to the United States to study in the American school system. By age thirteen, she was acting as a household helper and [[nanny]] and the following year, she returned to Antigua. To further her education, Robinson enrolled in Coke Memorial College. Though it was a Methodist school and Robinson was Anglican, Coke allowed students of [[Afro-Antiguan and Barbudan|African heritage]], which the elite Anglican schools prohibited, unless the children were of the elite upper class.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}}{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} The school was only operational for about a decade due to the lack of funding available, since the government only provided funds for the Anglican schools.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} When Coke closed, Robinson pursued education on her own, studying for her [[Senior Cambridge]] examination with Mr. D. S. B, Jones. She passed her examination and furthered her studies, obtaining certificates in music and music theory with Mrs. Lamond (née Tull).{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}}

==Career==
When Robinson completed her schooling, she was determined to improve the educational opportunities of black students.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} Her brother, Thomas Oliver Robinson, suggested she found a school herself.{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}} She did so, and named it in remembrance him, as he had recently died of [[typhoid fever]].{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} In 1898, when she was eighteen, Robinson opened the [[Thomas Oliver Robinson Memorial School]] (most often known as TOR or TOR Memorial) for children of all [[Race (human categorization)|race]]s,{{sfn|Spencer|2010}}{{sfn|Johnson|2010}} classes, and faiths—her doors were open to anyone desiring to improve their education and life. In a pioneering move for the time, Robinson admitted [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate children]] and lobbied for the change of official practice barring illegitimate children from secondary school.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}}{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} She established the first coeducational secondary school on the island, successfully challenging the officials which tried to close her school by claiming the teachers were unqualified and that the conditions were unsanitary.{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}}

In the beginning, most of her students were [[mulatto]]s because most blacks could not afford schooling. Only forty years had lapsed since slavery was [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished]]{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}} and [[British colonialism]] imposed class and race inequalities upon [[people of color|people of non-white]] backgrounds.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} As soon as she was financially able to do so, Robinson began funding scholarships for poor, black children. TOR Memorial students were encouraged in both intellectual and artistic pursuits, and the school staged entertainment such as [[musicals]] and [[operettas]]. As the reputation of the school became known, enrollment increased and soon Robinson's classes represented the social spectrum of the country. Sir [[Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott]] recommended that Robinson be given a grant to further the school's educational aims.{{sfn|Quinn|28 September 2010}}

In 1912, Robinson served on the Water Preservation Committee, formed to expand the access to [[Water supply network|piped water]] in the country.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} In 1915, during [[World War I]], Robinson was the only black woman to serve on the Antiguan [[Mobilization#Mobilization in World War I|Mobilization Committee]]. Robinson recruited men to travel to Canada or Britain to enlist, but also lobbied for improvements in the living conditions for men being shipped overseas for service.{{sfn|Foreign and Commonwealth Office|n.d.|p=2}} She was one of the people who helped establish [[The Girl Guides Association of Antigua and Barbuda]] and served as a committee member of the association. In 1935, she was given a commemorative medal at the [[Silver Jubilee]] of [[King George V]] in recognition of her contributions to education and in 1941 she was honored as a Member of [[Order of the British Empire]].{{sfn|TOR Memorial School|2008}} 

In 1950, after having served over sixty years as headmistress of TOR Memorial, Robinson retired, leaving the running of the school to Ina Loving.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1972|p=20}}{{sfn|Quinn|12 October 2010}} She continued to be active, encouraging participation in cultural activities and in the 1950s supported the development of [[Antigua Carnival]].{{sfn|Quinn|5 October 2010}}

==Death and legacy==
Robinson died on 29 April 1972 in St. John's{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} and was buried at the St John’s Public Cemetery.{{sfn|''The Daily Observer''|2011}} Her funeral was attended by the [[Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]] Sir [[Wilfred Jacobs]] and the Premier [[George Walter]].{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1972|p=20}} In 1999, a panel organized by the Professional Organization of Women in Antigua reviewing outstanding contributions from women in Antigua and Barbuda, named Robinson as the Outstanding Woman of the Century.{{sfn|Quinn|5 October 2010}}{{sfn|''The Daily Observer''|2013}} In 2006, at the celebrations for Antigua's twenty-fifth independence anniversary, she was named a Dame Companion of the Order of the National Heroes.{{sfn|Lightfoot|2016}} A decade after she was honored, she is the only woman to be declared a national hero and is recognized, along the other designees with an annual wreathe–laying on their graves.{{sfn|Hillhouse|2011}}{{sfn|''The Daily Observer''|2016}}

[[Logan County, West Virginia]] has a long and colorful history of political scandal and corruption.

==History during previous centuries==
Logan County, where some of the combatants in the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]] were tried and hanged, has been notorious for over a century for political machines that control virtually all aspects of elected office. Allies of candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] once famously asked local political boss Raymond Chafin how much money he wanted so that Kennedy could carry Southern West Virginia in the 1960 Presidential Election, and Chafin replied "thirty five," meaning $3500.  Kennedy's men returned with a suitcase full of $35,000, making it one of the more famous instances of miscommunication in the greasing of political palms in Logan history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n12_v26/ai_15991320/ |title=Just Good Politics: The Life of Raymond Chafin, Appalachian Boss. - book reviews |author=Joe Savage |date=December 1994 |work=BNET |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 sting==
During the 2004 election season in the town of [[Logan, West Virginia]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), in a controversial move, had four-term mayor Thomas Esposito run for the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in order to ferret out corruption in Logan County politics.  Officials in neighboring [[Lincoln County, West Virginia]] were also charged

Esposito was a prominent criminal defense attorney and four-term Mayor of Logan who was directed to buy votes by the FBI and implicate as many local politicians as possible in a Federal probe directed by Assistant U.S. Attorney [[R. Booth Goodwin II]].  In the end, Esposito was directed to pull out of the race before the general election and pleaded guilty to a single charge of [[misprision of a felony]], putatively for [[bribe|bribing]] [[Logan County, West Virginia]] [[magistrate]], Danny Wells, who himself received a nearly eight-year Federal sentence for his own bribery and extortion charges.  Esposito himself was merely disbarred and served two years of [[probation]].  He is considered to have bribed Wells by paying off his $6500 bar tab.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/12/13/150746.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others charged with crimes as a result of the sting===
Other public figures were charged with [[Federal crime in the United States|federal crimes]] and forced to resign.  The following men were implicated in the sting:

*Logan County Clerk Glen Dale "Houn' Dog" Adkins admitted he sold his vote for $500 in 1996.
*Perry French Harvey, Jr., former [[UMWA]] official pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe voters.
*Ernie Ray Mangus was granted immunity against the charge of receiving $1,000 to buy votes in exchange for his cooperation.
*"Big" John Mendez, Sheriff of Logan County, was compelled to resign and is never allowed to run for public office again.
*Lincoln County Circuit Clerk Greg Stowers entered a guilty plea to a federal vote-buying charge in a probe directed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen George.
*Logan police chief Alvin “Chipper” Porter Jr. and Logan VFW president Ernest Stapleton both entered related guilty pleas.

===Voter disenfranchisement controversy===
Although Esposito was a sham candidate controlled by the Federal Government, he received 2,175 votes in his faked bid to be elected to the 19th District of West Virginia's House of Delegates.  Greg Campbell, Perry Harvey's attorney, argued unsuccessfully before District Judge [[David A. Faber]] that Esposito's faked campaign interfered with an election and disenfranchised everyone voting for him.  Judge Faber took thirty minutes to decide that the votes were irrelevant.

The '''Social Contract''' was a 1993 initiative of the provincial [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] government of [[Bob Rae]] to impose [[austerity]] measures on [[civil service]]. The plan imposed a [[wage freeze]] and mandatory unpaid days of leave for civil servants, which became known as '''Rae Days'''.

== History ==
Ontario in the 1990s was in the worst economic [[recession]] since the [[Great Depression]], with a 1993 [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] of $12 billion annually.

Rae requested $2 billion in wage cuts within the civil service, and asked the public sector unions to work together with the government to implement the cuts. When Ontario's two largest unions, the [[Ontario Public Service Employees Union]] (OPSEU) and the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]] (CUPE), both boycotted the talks, the government decided to enact the initiative unilaterally.

== The Social Contract ==
The initiative was mainly based around a forced twelve days of unpaid leave for all civil service workers, including (but not limited to) [[teacher]]s, [[nurse]]s, and [[accountant]]s.  The unpaid days off quickly became known as ''Rae Days'' and are probably the best known aspect of the policy.  The measure excluded workers who earned less than $30,000 annually.&lt;ref name='noregrets'&gt;{{cite news |title=`No regrets' about days that bear his name, Rae says |author=Richard J. Brennan |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/721995---no-regrets-about-days-that-bear-his-name-rae-says |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=6 Nov 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Contract also re-opened [[collective bargaining]] agreements of all public [[trade union|union]]s, and froze the wages of all civil workers.

== Results ==
The Rae Days were successful in their original aims. The government saved $1.95 billion,&lt;ref name='noregrets'/&gt; and prevented public employee layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/news/national/Liberals+does+gently+into+that+good+night/8165179/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative was incredibly unpopular, however, and the labour-allied NDP lost a majority of its union support, including [[Buzz Hargrove]] and the [[Canadian Auto Workers]] Union. Support for the provincial party fell to 6 per cent and contributed greatly to the decimation of the federal NDP in the 1993 federal election. The provincial NDP never recovered their past support by the time the [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995 election]] came around; the Liberal Party was initially the main beneficiary of the opposition to the Social Contract, but, ultimately, it was the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]] that won the election. In that campaign, the NDP was reduced from a [[majority government|majority]] to a [[Third party (Canada)|third party]], a position from which they were not able to recover from until the [[Ontario general election, 2018|2018 election]]. 

The Social Contract affected Rae during his 2006 run for [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|leadership]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].

[[File:Budapest-Terror Museum.jpg|thumb|AVH building]]
The '''State Protection Authority''' ({{lang-hu|Államvédelmi Hatóság}} or ''ÁVH'') was the [[secret police]] of [[Hungary]] from 1945 until 1956. It was conceived as an external appendage of the [[Soviet Union]]'s secret police forces and gained an indigenous reputation for [[Police brutality|brutality]] during a series of [[purge]]s beginning in 1948, intensifying in 1949 and ending in 1953. In 1953 [[Joseph Stalin]] died, and [[Imre Nagy]] (a moderate reformer) was appointed [[Prime Minister of Hungary]]. Under Nagy's first government from 1953 to 1955, the ÁVH was gradually reined in.

==History of the ÁVH==
This is a summary of the organisations acting as [[political police]] between 1945 and 1956.
* 1945: [[Budapest]] Police Main Command Political Department, (''Budapesti Főkapitányság Politikai Rendészeti Osztálya'', '''PRO''')
* 1946: Hungarian State Police State Protection Department, (''Magyar Államrendőrség Államvédelmi Osztálya'', '''ÁVO''')
* 1950: State Protection Authority, (''Államvédelmi Hatóság'', '''ÁVH''')
* 1956: the agency was abolished by the revolutionary government of [[Imre Nagy]].

The subsequent government of [[János Kádár]] did not wish to resurrect the ÁVH under this name after 1956 (Kádár was tortured by the ÁVH in the 1950s), yet it flourished in the system of the Ministry of the Interior (Hungarian BM). This should be considered in the light of the use of the Soviet security apparatus directly in Hungary after the 1956 revolution, and in preparation for the trial of Nagy and "his accomplices". Between 1956 and 1963 Kádár, a natural opportunist, fought an inner party battle against hardline Stalinists, although he accepted the services of many cruel former AVH torturers. Kádár's victory was signalled in 1963 by a general [[amnesty]] for the 1956 revolutionaries, an indication of the absence of a political police. Hungary would go on to be the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country without a formal intelligence service, since all intelligence and espionage functions were vested in the AVH, and later the Ministry of Interior.

Between 1945 and 1952, [[Gábor Péter|Peter Gabor]] (Benjamin Eisenberger) was the absolute leader of the State Protection Authority (Államvédelmi Hatóság), responsible for much cruelty, brutality and many political purges.

==Policy and methods==
While the security apparatus was operating, it supported the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] (MDP) directly, with little reference made to Government norms. This support was primarily through the secret gathering of intelligence, largely through a vast network of [[informant]]s, like the system used by the Ministry for State Security ([[Stasi]]) in the [[German Democratic Republic]].

The investigation network was supplemented with a mechanism of secret arrests, followed by extensive periods of [[torture]] (lasting between 3 and 18 months). When the apparatus had extracted [[Confession (legal)|confessions]] of varying quality from a [[prison]]er, the State's system of [[public procurator]]s and [[court]]s would be called in to make a ruling on the [[sentence (law)|sentence]]. This was the norm of operation for the ÁVH, and was only diverged from in matters of utmost state security; for example, the illegal arrest and indefinite solitary detention of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] operative [[Edith Bone]]. Despite the forced nature of confessions, [[retraction]]s at trial were not considered a danger to the process, due to the obvious threat of continued torture during a recess of the trial.

===1953 Wallenberg show trial preparations in Hungary===
ÁVH actions were not subject to [[judicial review]]. On April 7, 1953, early in the morning, Miksa Domonkos, one of the leaders of the Neologue [[Jewish]] community in Budapest was kidnapped by ÁVH officials to extract "[[Confession (law)|confessions]]".&lt;ref name="InterviewIstvanDomonkos"&gt;[http://www.szombat.org/2006/0602apamatelhurcoltak.htm Interview with István Domonkos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023214416/http://www.szombat.org/2006/0602apamatelhurcoltak.htm |date=2007-10-23 }}, son of Miksa Domonkos who died after the show trial preparations {{hu icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations for a [[show trial]] started in Budapest in 1953 to prove that [[Raoul Wallenberg]] had not been dragged off in 1945 to the Soviet Union but was the victim of [[Rootless cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] [[Zionist]]s. For the purposes of this show trial, two more Jewish leaders – Dr. László Benedek and Lajos Stöckler (a leader of Hungary's Neologue Jews) – as well as two would-be "eyewitnesses" – [[Pál Szalai]] and [[Károly Szabó]] – were arrested and interrogated by torture.

The last people to meet Wallenberg in Budapest were Ottó Fleischmann, Károly Szabó, and Pál Szalai, who were invited to a supper at the Swedish Embassy building in Gyopár street on January 12, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;József Szekeres: Saving the Ghettos of Budapest in January 1945, Pál Szalai "the Hungarian Schindler" {{ISBN|963-7323-14-7}}, Budapest 1997, Publisher: Budapest Archives, Page 74&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, January 13, Wallenberg contacted the Russians. By 1953, Ottó Fleischmann had left Hungary, working as a [[physician]] in [[Vienna]].

On 8 April 1953, Károly Szabó was captured on the street and arrested without any legal procedure. His family had no news of him throughout the following six months. A [[secret trial]] was conducted against him of which no official record is available to date. After six months of interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.

The idea that the "murderers of Wallenberg" were Budapest Zionists was primarily supported by [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungarian Communist]] leader [[Ernő Gerő]] (a non-Jewish Jew born as Ernő  Singer), which is shown by a note sent by him to First Secretary [[Mátyás Rákosi]] (another non-Jewish Jew born as Mátyás Rosenberg).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0442&amp;article=2004-1018-1055-02COSU Kenedi János: Egy kiállítás hiányzó képei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302192222/http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0442&amp;article=2004-1018-1055-02COSU |date=2007-03-02 }} {{hu icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show trial was then initiated in Moscow, following [[Antisemitism and Joseph Stalin|Stalin's anti-Zionist campaign]]. After the death of Stalin and somewhat later execution of KGB chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the preparations for the trial were eventually stopped and the arrested persons were released in fall 1953 under condition that they are not to divulge any part of the arrest. Lajos Stöckler became severely impaired psychologically from torture. Miksa Domonkos spent a week in hospital and died shortly afterwards at home, mainly due to the torture he had been subjected to.&lt;ref name="InterviewIstvanDomonkos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no143/p129.html Hungarian Quarterly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227140333/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no143/p129.html |date=2007-02-27 }} {{hu icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration camps===
Following sentence, [[political prisoner]]s were imprisoned in ÁVH-run [[concentration camp]]s. These camps were mixed and varied. Early camps tended to be cruder and more cruel. In particular, the status of ex-party members varied. In camps prior to 1953 they were more harshly treated than other prisoners. After 1953, ex-party members were a virtual [[aristocracy]] within prisons{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Additionally, prior to 1953 certain camps had as their goal the eventual death of inmates due to overwork and maltreatment{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. In a number of cases, torture was an essential part of camp life and discipline{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Imre Nagy's first government from 1953 to 1955 vastly improved conditions in the camps and halted the efforts to exterminate political prisoners{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===International activities===
The ÁVH also assisted the Soviet sphere security apparatus by staging [[show trial]]s. In two cases, the ÁVH was given the privilege of leading an attack on undesired elements throughout Hungary. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Cardinal [[József Mindszenty]] was tried and imprisoned. In 1949, the ÁVH arrested [[Hungarian Communist Party]] member [[László Rajk]], who was then tried and executed for [[nationalism]] and [[Titoism]] in a show trial that signified to the international communist movement that [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was now a threat. (László Rajk was the man who had organised the ÁVH.)

==The ÁVH in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956==
During the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], elements of the insurgents tracked down and killed both known and suspected ÁVH officers and informants. When the Revolution began, a crowd of some thousand people attacked the police headquarters in [[Budapest]], shouting [[slogan]]s such as "tear down the star!" and "free the prisoners!", referring to the enormous [[red star]] that stood on the building's [[roof]], a symbol of [[communism]] and to the many prisoners kept inside. Fearing for the lives of both himself and his officers, the chief of the police let the crowd into the building, allowing them to take any [[political prisoner]]s they wanted.

During and after the siege of the Hungarian Working People's Party headquarters (in Republic Square, ''Köztársaság tér''), some members of the ÁVH were lynched, a fact later extensively used in party propaganda to back up the claim that the revolution was of a "fascistic, anti-Semitic and reactionary" nature.

===Persecution by József Dudás' militia===
Attacks on the ÁVH only became a significant activity as informal [[truce]]s developed between the student-controlled combat organisations and the Soviet troops in Budapest. Freed from the necessity of immediate combat, the [[József Dudás]] militia planned a series of reprisals against ÁVH officers, informants, and on a few occasions against ordinary Communist-party members caught up in the revolution. József Dudás' militia is often considered a far-right group{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, but others claim he was a communist; either way, his militia's violence is not contested.

On October 29, in the second week of the revolution, the Dudás militia attacked the headquarters of the secret police in Budapest, massacring the ÁVH inside. This event was well documented by both western and eastern journalists and photographers, and constituted the primary evidence against Imre Nagy and other members of his cabinet in the [[White Books]].
[[File:Protesters with body of AVH personnel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Protesters kicking the body of a slain AVH soldier]]
A Western eyewitness said:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;The secret police lie twisted in the gutter [...] the Hungarians will not touch the corpse of an ÁVH man, not even to close the eyes or straighten the neck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Dudás' militia assaulted the building, the surrounding crowd [[lynching|lynched]] a number of ÁVH officers. Highly visible in photographs of this attack are the party's paybooks displayed on to the corpses, demonstrating that ÁVH soldiers received at least 10 times the [[wage]]s of a manual worker.

===Reaction of revolutionary forces to Dudás===
When the students' and workers' councils discovered what the Dudás group was doing, they instituted armed patrols to arrest and detain ÁVH members for their own safety, and for future planned trials. As a result of Dudás' massacres, and the students' policy of arrest, many ÁVH voluntarily turned themselves in to students' or workers' councils to seek protective custody. This was a reflection of the shared student-worker policy of keeping the revolution pure and bloodless. Dudás was sought for arrest by the students' and workers' councils.

===Retaliation===
Unsurprisingly, when the [[Warsaw Pact]] intervened in the revolution to support the government, ÁVH officers carried out brutal [[reprisal]]s against those who had killed their comrades. The ÁVH generally targeted all revolutionaries, and received significant assistance from the Soviet Union's security apparatus, who arrested the Nagy government, General [[Pál Maléter]], and deported thousands of students and workers to the Soviet Union.

==House of Terror==
Shortly after the [[Arrow Cross Party]] left it, the building under the address 60 [[Andrássy Avenue]] became the ÁVH Headquarters. The building is now a museum called ''[[House of Terror|The House of Terror]]'', commemorating the victims of both political systems.

In the United States, the U.S. [[Special Collection Service]] (SCS) contributes to Stateroom. The SCS is jointly operated by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).&lt;ref name="Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach and Holger Stark"/&gt; On 23 November 2013, the Dutch newspaper ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' released a [[top secret]] NSA presentation leaked by [[Edward Snowden]], which shows the presence of SCS operations in numerous U.S. [[diplomatic mission]]s located in the following cities:
[[Athens]] ([[Greece]]), [[Bangkok]] ([[Thailand]]), [[Berlin]] ([[Germany]]), [[Brasília]] ([[Brazil]]), [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]), [[Frankfurt]] ([[Germany]]), [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]), [[Lagos]] ([[Nigeria]]), [[Milan]] ([[Italy]]), [[New Delhi]] ([[India]]), [[Paris]] ([[France]]), [[Prague]] ([[Czech Republic]]), [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]), [[Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]).

In October 2013, reports by former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] led to the revelation of the SCS having systematically wiretapped [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s private cell phone over a period of over 10 years, among other activities to wiretap and systematically record large amounts of European and South American leaders' and citizens' communications.&lt;ref name="spiegel-nsa-spionage-station-berlin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html | title=Cover Story: How NSA Spied on Merkel Cell Phone from Berlin Embassy | author=Spiegel Staff | work=Spiegel Online | date=2013-10-27 | accessdate=2014-03-22 | archivedate=22 March 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OH4UG9f7?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}, pages [https://www.webcitation.org/6OH4c19Wt?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205-2.html 2] and [https://www.webcitation.org/6OH4cdy6k?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205-3.html 3] at archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disclosure by Edward Snowden ==

The existence of Stateroom was revealed in October 2013 by the former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]], who initiated the [[global surveillance disclosure]].&lt;ref name=nzherald/&gt;

{{quote|...These sites are small in size and in number of personnel staffing them.

== Reactions ==

Damien Rogers, former senior adviser to the New Zealand intelligence agency [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] (GCSB) said he was surprised to hear that the "Stateroom" codeword and location of associated sites are being published in the media, because such revelations would cause "anxiety and concern" for the directors of the five intelligence agencies of the [[UKUSA Agreement]].&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11149739 | title=NZ link to Oz spying claims | author=Adam Bennett | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=2013-11-01 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=22 March 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OH4okzSC?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11149739 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicky Hager]], a New Zealand investigative journalist who exposed the '''[[ECHELON]]''' surveillance system, confirmed that such surveillance operations have been conducted by the intelligence agencies of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] for quite some time.&lt;ref name=nzherald/&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Marty Natalegawa]] protested against the surveillance program, and told the media that "such action is not only a breach of security, but also a serious violation of diplomatic norms and ethics, and certainly not in tune with the spirit of friendly relations between nations."&lt;ref name=wannsa/&gt;

The Solomon Islands' Chief of Staff, [[Robert Iroga]], said that the New Zealand Government's actions damaged New Zealand's image as a "friendly government" in the South Pacific.

The '''United Jewish People's Order''' is a [[Jewish secularism|secular]] [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] cultural, political and educational [[fraternal organization]] in [[Canada]]. The UJPO traces its history to the founding of the Jewish Labour League Mutual Benefit Society in 1926.

==History==
===Early history===
After the [[Russian Revolution]] and the creation of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], divisions within the [[Workmen's Circle|Arbeiter Ring]] became increasingly bitter. In Toronto, the pro-[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] women withdrew from the Ring in 1923, forming the Jewish Working Women's League (''Yiddish Arbeiter Froyen Farein'').&lt;ref name=reiter2002&gt;{{cite journal|title=Secular ''Yiddishkait'': Left Politics, Culture, and Community|first=Ester|last=Reiter|journal=[[Labour/Le Travail]]|volume=49|date=Spring 2002|pages=121-146|publisher=Canadian Committee on Labour History|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25149216|jstor= 25149216}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was clear that control of the organization would stay in the hands of those critical of the Revolution, the men also withdrew and formed the Jewish Labour League Mutual Benefit Society in 1926, which became social and intellectual home for Jewish [[Communism|Communists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="The Dresden Story": Racism, Human Rights, and the Jewish Labour Committee of Canada|first=Ross|last=Lambertson|page=48|journal=[[Labour/Le Travail]]|volume=47|date=Spring 2001|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25149113|jstor=25149113|publisher=Canadian Committee on Labour History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Workers' Circle was similarly formed in [[Montreal]] and [[Winnipeg]]. The two organizations merged on 4 October 1945 to form the UJPO.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Secular Organizations|title=Not Written in Stone: Jews, Constitutions, and Constitutionalism in Canada|editor1-first=Daniel J.|editor1-last=Elazar|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Brown|editor3-first=Ira|editor3-last=Robinson|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|date=2003|chapter-url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpg27.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, the UJPO had more than 2,500 members nationwide with branches being established in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Calgary]], and [[Vancouver]], among others. The UJPO's leadership included well-known Jewish Communists and pro-Soviet activists, including [[Sholem Shtern]], [[J. B. Salsberg]], [[Joseph Zuken]], [[Sam Carr]], and [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]].&lt;ref name=srebrnik&gt;{{cite book|title=Jerusalem on the Amur: Birobidzhan and the Canadian Jewish Communist Movement, 1924-1951|first=Henry Felix|last=Srebrnik|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press||year=2008|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/jerusalem-on-the-amur-birobidzhan-and-the-canadian-jewish-communist-movement-1924-1951/oclc/632050111|oclc=632050111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CJPO was active in supporting Jewish settlement in [[Birobidzhan]] through the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|Canadian Biro-Bidjan Committee]].{{r|srebrnik}}

===Cold War era===
The Toronto branch of the UJPO was originally housed in the Jewish Workers' Cultural Centre on Brunswick Avenue, just north of [[Kensington Market]], then for many years in its own building on Christie Street, overlooking [[Christie Pits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joe Salsberg: A Life of Commitment|first=Gerald|last=Tulchinsky|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4426-1432-1|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=HYqBAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; UJPO's headquarters in [[Montreal]] were in the Morris Winchevsky Cultural Centre on de l'Esplanade Avenue from 1947. UJPO Montreal also operated the Morris Winchevsky Yiddish School on Villeneuve Street West and operated [[summer camps]] such as the Nitgedeiget. The UJPO headquarters included, as a unique feature, a second story [[balcony]] with a five-foot-tall [[parapet]] modelled on balconies in Moscow's [[Red Square (Moscow)|Red Square]] from which Soviet leaders would address the crowd below. 

On January 27, 1950, the group's Montreal headquarters were closed under the [[Padlock Law]], with boxes of seized books, files and organizational material carted away by the [[Quebec Provincial Police]]. Following the raid, the building was sold to the [[Farband]], a [[Labour Zionist]] organization, which used the building from 1951 until 1968, with the first floor being occupied by Glatt's, a [[Kosher meat|kosher butcher]] from 1962 until the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Collapsed Mile End building once targeted by anti-communist Padlock Law|first=Stephen|last=Smith|date=19 February 2017|location=Montreal|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/collapsed-mile-end-building-once-targeted-by-anti-communist-padlock-law-1.3990671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zev|last=Moses|website=Third Solitude Series|publisher=[[Museum of Jewish Montreal]]|date=20 April 2012|url=http://thirdsolitude.tumblr.com/post/21450294508/notjustanotherbalcony|title=A balcony under threat in Balconville}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, the UJPO was expelled from the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], not to be re-admitted until 1995.&lt;ref name = "Ester2"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Ester|last1=Reiter|first2=Roz|last2=Usiskin|url=http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05Forum1.htm|title=Jewish Dissent in Canada: The United Jewish People's Order|conference=Forum on Jewish Dissent|publisher=Association of Canadian Jewish Studies|location=Winnipeg|date=30 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After 1955, Sam Carr became active in the UJPO and was elected National Secretary in 1964, a position he would hold until 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=82|title=Ignacy Witczak's Passport, Soviet Espionage and the Origins of the Cold War in Canada|first=Myron|last=Momryk|journal=Polish American Studies|volume=68|number=2|date=Autumn 2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23075179|jstor= 23075179}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the crisis resulting from the release of the [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] in 1956, prominent Party member J. B. Salsberg returned from a trip to the [[Soviet Union]], where he found rampant [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Party-sponsored antisemitism]] and suppression of [[Jewish culture]].&lt;ref name = "Gerald" /&gt; Salsberg's findings were rejected by the [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist Party]] (then known as the [[Labor-Progressive Party|Labour-Progressive Party]]) and led to his suspension from its leading bodies. Ultimately, the crisis resulted in the departure of the UJPO, Salsberg, [[Robert Laxer]] and most of the Party's Jewish members in 1956.&lt;ref name = "Gerald" /&gt;

In 1959 about one third of the UJPO's membership (including long-time leader J. B. Salsberg) left to start a new organization called the [[New Fraternal Jewish Association]], feeling that the UJPO was not critical enough of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Portrait of a Jewish Professional Revolutionary: The Recollections of Joshua Gershman|first=Irving|last=Abella|author-link=Irving Abella|journal=[[Labour/Le Travail]]|volume=2|year=1977|pages=184-213|publisher=Canadian Committee on Labour History|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25139902|jstor= 25139902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following [[World War II]], as the Jewish community moved north along [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]], the UJPO moved in 1960 to its current location at the Winchevsky Centre in the Bathurst and [[Lawrence Avenue|Lawrence]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History: 80 Years Strong|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193145/http://www.winchevskycentre.org/welcome/history.html|archive-date=5 February 2012|url=http://www.winchevskycentre.org/welcome/history.html|website=The Winchevsky Centre|access-date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
In 2011, the [[United Jewish Appeal]] and Canadian Jewish Congress severed their relations with UJPO's Winchevsky Centre in Toronto after the organization hosted a panel discussion featuring [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] activist and Auschwitz survivor [[Hajo Meyer]], a member of the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20810&amp;Itemid=86|title=UJA, CJC sever ties with Winchevsky Centre|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The UJPO has branches in [[Winnipeg]], [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Toronto]] where it operates the Winchevsky Centre, named after the famed Jewish socialist poet [[Morris Winchevsky]]. The Toronto branch sponsors several groups including the [[Morris Winchevsky School]] which holds classes at the Bathurst Street Community Centre, the [[Toronto Jewish Folk Choir]], and [[Camp Naivelt]], a socialist Jewish [[Summer camp|camp]] in [[Brampton, Ontario]].

The party supports the secession of [[Veneto]] from [[Italy]] and is the heir of ''[[Plebiscito.eu]]'', the committee which organised the [[Venetian independence referendum, 2014|2014 Venetian independence referendum]]. The day after the referendum, Busato announced that the separatist process generated by the referendum was to be led by Veneto Yes, which would be transformed "from committee for yes to independence to a political organisation which will defend the results obtained with the declaration of independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venetosi.org/a-tutto-campo/ |title=A TUTTO CAMPO &amp;#124; Veneto Sì, a difesa dell'indipendenza della Repubblica Veneta |publisher=Venetosi.org |date=2014-03-22 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgazzettino.it/NORDEST/PRIMOPIANO/veneto_s_amp_igrave_partito_referendum_veneto_beppe_grillo_indipendenza/notizie/589333.shtml |title=Dopo il referendum, nasce il partito |publisher=Ilgazzettino.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Cutlers''' is one of the ancient [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. It ranks 18th in the [[order of precedence]] of the Companies.

{{coord|51|30.93|N|0|6.056|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title}}

The trade of [[knife]]-making and repairing was formed in the thirteenth century as a guild; the Cutlers' Company received a [[Royal Charter]] in 1416. The Company, like many other City Livery Companies, no longer has a strong connection with its trade, which for the most part relocated north to [[Sheffield]], where a similar association, the [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire]] was established. Thus, the Livery Company remains primarily as a charitable institution. The Company funds and administers a variety of educational initiatives such as scholarships and awards.

[[File:Cutlers' Company, coat of arms, p.4, An Historical Essay on the Livery Companies of London.jpg|thumb|left|Cutlers' Company, coat of arms]]

The Cutlers' Company [[Coat of arms|Arms]] have been in use since 1476. Its current Elephant and Castle [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] was granted in 1622: this features two elephants and three crossed-swords, a helmet and a smaller elephant and castle. The original heraldic [[blazon]] read: ''Shield: "Gules, three pairs of swords in saltire argent, hilts and pommels, or; [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]: An elephant's head couped gules, armed or"''. The elephant probably relates to the ivory used to make the hilts and handles of expensive swords and knives. The elephant and castle crest gave rise to a [[pub]] of the same name on the site of an old cutlers' inn at [[Newington, London|Newington]], [[south London]] which in turn gave its name to the well-known area [[Elephant and Castle]].

The Company's [[motto]] was originally ''Pervenir a bonne foy'', which later became ''Pour parvenir a bonne foy'', an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] phrase meaning ''To succeed through good faith''.

The Company's livery hall is located on a site in Warwick Lane once occupied by the [[Royal College of Physicians]], near [[Newgate|Newgate Street]]. It was designed by T. Tayler Smith, the Company's surveyor, and was opened in 1888. It is a brick building, the façade decorated with a [[terracotta]] [[frieze]] depicting the processes of knife-making by the sculptor [[Benjamin Creswick]], who had worked as a knife-grinder in Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cutlerslondon.co.uk/hall/|title=Cutlers' Hall|author=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=The Worshipful Company of Cutlers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many initiatives were taken in many schools to develop the interest among students to enter Indian politics. The Field of politics is usually a perception that it is not suited to Educated People&lt;ref name="gupte"&gt;Gupte 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and this perception is being changed by many school students who take up the idea of politics as their career and help promoting the cause.

== Importance of Youth in Indian politics ==


In 2004, 50% of the Indian population was aged 30 years or younger; however, only 35 out of 543 [[Lok Sabha]] members (6%) were aged under 35.&lt;ref name="gupte"/&gt; Nevertheless, the [[World Values Survey]] showed that the proportion of people aged 18–24 who identified themselves as "very" or "rather" interested in politics was around 50, an increase of 15% since 1990.&lt;ref name="dna"&gt;"More Indian Youth Interested in Politics" 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

All major political parties have youth and student wings, such as [[Indian Youth Congress]], [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad]], and [[Democratic Youth Federation of India]]

A campaign by [https://youngindiafoundation.org Young India Foundation] has been raising awareness on the importance of youth rights and the essential representation they need in a country with over 670 million people below the age of 25. YIF is also leading in the Age of Candidacy campaign which is working on decreasing the age of candidacy in India from 25 to something lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ageofcandidacy.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of Social Media ==
As per a report by the [[ASSOCHAM | Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham)]], of the approximately Rs 4,000-5,000 Crore total advertisement and publicity spend in 2014 Indian Parliament elections, the digital platforms can expect to garner at least Rs 400-500 Crore.  The target audience are predictably the youth, many of them first-time voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dutta|first=Medha|title=Election 2014 is all about social media|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/lok-sabha-elections-2014/news/Election-2014-is-all-about-social-media/articleshow/33835014.cms|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
