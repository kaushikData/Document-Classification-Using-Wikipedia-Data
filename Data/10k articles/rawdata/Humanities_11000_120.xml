==Summary==
{{plot|date=May 2014}}

===Prologue===
In [[Long Island]] a teenage [[Minae Mizumura]] meets Taro Azuma, another [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrant who works as the chauffeur of one of her father's associates who, unlike [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] and the other immigrants she knows, is poor. [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]]'s father finds him studious and hardworking and hires him as a technician for the [[camera]] company he works for.

Over the years [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] and Azuma encounter each other briefly at company outings and parties. Right before she leaves high school [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] has a moment where she reflects that her life is full of possibility and Azuma's is not. However Azuma does eventually become extremely successful. After becoming a technician who specializes in [[endoscopes]] Azuma begins to sell them and receives increasingly large commissions. When the company tries to cut his commission percentage Azuma leaves and creates his own company.

[[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]]'s family meanwhile enters a period of decline after her father is demoted and her mother leaves him for another man. She and her sister squander their education and youth. Later [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] manages to begin a career for herself as an academic and begins writing novels. She returns to America occasionally where she catches up with old friends and learns of Azuma's rise to success. One year she returns and discovers that he has disappeared and no one has heard anything of him.

In 1998 while teaching at [[Stanford University]], 
[[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] is approached by a young man, Yusuke Kato, who tells her that he met Azuma a few years before he disappeared in [[Karuizawa, Nagano]] where he mentioned he knew the novelist [[Minae Mizumura]]. Yusuke and [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] spend the night discussing Azuma and [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]], who had been struggling with her third novel, decides that Azuma's story would make a perfect novel. She explains to the reader that while she had originally intended to write an [[I Novel]] her work is a [[True Novel]], i.e. a novel that is pure fiction.

===Volume I===
Yusuke Kato is persuaded by a wealthy friend to spend time with him in his vacation cottage in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]]. While traveling through [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] at night he has a bicycle accident in front of an old run-down house. The house is owned by an unfriendly middle-aged man, Taro Azuma, but Kato is persuaded to stay the night by the maid of the house, Fumiko Tsuchiya. The following day he encounters Fumiko again and is taken to the house of three snobbish elderly sisters, Harue, Natsue and Fuyue. The sisters are there to scatter the ashes of Yoko, Natsue's daughter. They hint at their relationship to Taro who they dismiss as the relation of one of the sister's rickshaw drivers. Afterwards, Fumiko invites him back to Taro's house in order to tell him about Taro and his relationship to the sisters.

Fumiko begins the story by telling how she was born in 1937 to poor farmers in [[Saku, Nagano]]. Her early memories are of the extreme poverty suffered during [[World War II]]. As a teenager, she moved to [[Tokyo]] with her uncle Genji "George" who secured her a position as a maid on an American army base. When Fumiko was 17 he contacted wealthy acquaintances in order to try to find her work as a maid in a private household. She was eventually sent to work as a maid and nanny for Natsue and her two young daughters Yuko and Yoko.

Natsue is the middle daughter of the Saegusa family, a snobbish clan descended from wealthy landowners. The family is close to the Shigemitsu family who, despite being financially poorer, are descended from nobility. The two families share adjoining plots of land in [[Tokyo]] as well as in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] where they both vacation. The families celebrate Western ideals over [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] ones with each family having spent significant time in Europe. Each Saegusa sister had once held aspirations of marrying into the Shigemitsu family but the only son, Noriyuki, died during the war.

Fumiko spends her time taking care of Yoko, Natsue's youngest child, who doesn't fit in with the rest of her Saegusa and Shugemitsu members of her generation and who is kept close to home. Shortly after Yoko begins to attend school Roku, an old servant of Yoko's grandfather, invites his nephew and his family to stay with him. The youngest of the nephew's children is Taro. Taro is routinely abused by his family and Fumiko later learns that he is actually the illegitimate child of one of Roku's nieces and was raised by his uncle after his mother died. When local children begin to bully him Yoko joins in, only to be discouraged from doing so by her father. She eventually shows him small kindnesses and he becomes enraptured by her. At the same time Fumiko and Yoko's step-grandmother Mrs. Utagawa conspire to have him work in the Utagawa household so as to spare him the abuse from his aunt.

===Volume II===
Yoko and Taro grow increasingly close throughout the years, encouraged by Mrs. Utagawa, who hides their relationship from Yoko's parents. The only time they spend apart is her vacation months in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]]. Mrs. Utagawa eventually persuades her step-son to build her a villa in [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]]. She takes Taro with her to help around the house, however he is hurt when he visits Yoko in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] and the Saegusas and Shigemitsus treat him as a handyman.

Eventually Mrs. Utagawa dies. Her final wish being that her step-son provide enough money for Taro to go to high school. The family complies with her wishes, however shortly after Yoko's father transfers to a university in [[Sapporo]]. Yoko and Taro stay in sporadic contact throughout the years, aided by Fumiko. When Yoko is eighteen she contacts Taro again and she and Fumiko are surprised to discover that his adoptive family used the money meant for his education as a down payment for a small business. When they finally meet, chaperoned by Fumiko, Yoko is humiliated by Taroâs sullen behaviour but arranges a more clandestine meeting with him. After a few days she is discovered naked in the summer home in [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]], sick with [[pneumonia]]. Yoko's family is humiliated, believing that Taro and Yoko had sex; Yoko later reveals to Fumiko that Taro refused to have sex with her after she told him she would never marry him.

Taro runs away from his adoptive parents to live with Fumiko. He drinks heavily and gives up his plans for education instead focusing his sights on moving to America. Fumiko's uncle Genji helps to secure him a position as a chauffeur in [[New York City]] and Taro leaves, disappearing for fifteen years.

After seven years Yoko marries Masayuki, the only son in the Shigetmitsu family, finally fulfilling the desire of the Shigemitsus and Saegusas to unite through marriage.

Taro eventually comes back into Fumiko and Yokoâs lives when he anonymously buys the old [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] villa and enlists Fumiko to renovate it. Spending a week there on vacation he is hesitant to contact Yoko, but Fumiko intervenes and the two are briefly reunited. Their first meeting is interrupted by a weeping Masayuki. Yoko pledges to stay married to him.

After her second husband dies Fumiko is persuaded by Taro to work for him in [[Tokyo]] and, in her late forties, eventually becomes the career woman she longed to be. Yoko and Taro become lovers with Masayukiâs blessing. Their unconventional relationship works for seven years until the Saegusa sisters stumble upon Taro and Yoko in public. Hatsue confronts Masayuki who in turn fights with Yoko to the point where he says he no longer wishes to be married to her.

Unable to bear the thought of her husband leaving her, Yoko runs away. She is eventually found days later in one of the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] homes that Fumiko failed to search properly. She develops pneumonia and dies although not before forcing Taro to promise her that he will not kill himself before Masayuki dies. A few years later Masayuki develops cancer and dies and he and Yoko's remains are meant to be scattered around the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] which is why Fumiko is there in the present.

As Fumiko's story ends Fuyue arrives at the [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] villa and informs Fumiko that now that both Yoko and Masayuki are dead Taro is leaving her with both the [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] and [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] homes.

Fuyue then drives Yusuke home, but not before revealing that during the period where Taro lived with Fumiko in Tokyo the two became lovers.

Before his vacation ends Yusuke returns to the [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] villa in secret where he watches Fumiko and Taro scatter Yoko and Masayuki's ashes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">In [[law]], an '''acknowledgment''' is a declaration or avowal of one's own act, used to authenticate [[legal instrument]]s, which may give the instrument legal validity, and works to prevent the recording of false instruments or fraudulent executions. Acknowledgement involves a public official, frequently a [[notary public]]. The party executing the legal instrument orally declares that the instrument is his or her act or deed, and the official prepares a certificate attesting to the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossman|first=Elanor L.|title=American Jurisprudence|date=February 2013|publisher=West|edition=2nd|volume=1|at=Â§ 1|chapter=Acknowledgments|id=1 [[Am. Jur. 2d]] ''Acknowledgments'' Â§ 1â2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Acknowledgments'' are distinct from ''[[Jurat (clause) | jurat]]s'', ''[[verification (law)|verification]]s'', and ''attestations''. A jurat differs from an acknowledgement in that a jurat lacks the statement that the instrument is the act or deed of the party executing it. A verification is distinct in that it seeks to verify the factual contents of the instrument, rather than the instrument itself. Finally, an attestation occurs where a third person gives his or her name as a witness to the actual execution of an instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennel|first=John R.|title=Corpus Juris Secundum|date=March 2013|publisher=West|volume=1|chapter=Acknowledgments|at=Â§ 1|id=1 [[C.J.S.]] ''Acknowledgments'' Â§ 1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, acknowledgments only serve [[evidence|evidentiary]] purposes, but some jurisdictions have made acknowledgement a requirement for [[Recording (real estate)|recording]] of instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kennel|2013|at=Â§ 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins''''' is a 2002 book about the origins of [[Mormonism]] by [[Grant H. Palmer]], a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) who is a retired [[Church Educational System]] instructor and [[Institutes of Religion|Institute]] director with a master's degree in history.

Palmer's stated purpose in writing the book was to incorporate recent critical historical and scholarly studies of LDS history in an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] defense of the faith.  He states that his aim is to "increase faith, not diminish it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Palmer|2002|loc=Preface, p. ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the book==
The book concludes that:
*[[Joseph Smith]] mistranslated a number of documents including the [[Book of Abraham]] and that he used the [[King James Bible]] extensively in constructing the [[Book of Mormon]].
*The [[Book of Mormon]] is most likely pieced together from sources that have been established to be available to Smith (King James Bible, local revival evangelism, Smith family biography/dreams, American antiquities; he has later also included the War of 1812 and anti-masonic hysteria to that list); therefore the book is not a translation from ancient golden plates. Regardless, these plates were not used and often not even present during dictation to scribesâinstead Smith translated by looking into a hat with a stone placed in it, and he was in the earlier stages separated from his scribe by a blanket hung between them (and later used other methods to distance those transcribing). 
*DNA evidence demonstrates that the origin of Native Americans is not as claimed in the Book of Mormon.
*The [[King James Bible]] is a source for numerous Book of Mormon stories; many of these stories contain anachronisms and King James translators' errors copied in erroneous form into the Book of Mormon. Palmer asks, "Why would God reveal to Joseph Smith a faulty KJV text?"
*Many theological issues addressed in the [[Book of Mormon]] probably derived from Smith's [[Upstate New York]] religious environment (as opposed to the golden plates he claimed to be translating from).
*There are more parallels between a [[Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#The_Golden_Pot|published story]] by [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] and Smith's account of the angel Moroni's visits than could possibly be coincidence.
*In spite of the LDS Church's current claims, evidence shows that none of the eleven witnesses claimed to have actually seen the physical gold plates. Instead, they reported visualizing them "with spiritual eyes" in a prayer-induced trance state.
*Smith's claim to have been personally ordained by John the Baptist, Peter, James and John as resurrected beings, was not at all what Smith originally claimed.  Instead, this evolved over a number of years from the original claim that didn't involve any beings such as the previously mentioned New Testament figures.
*The LDS Church's official claim that Joseph Smith claimed to have been visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ as two separate beings "is not supported by the historical evidence" either in the number of beings alleged seen or in the year and circumstances as now officially claimed.

Palmer's book suggests that the foundation events were rewritten by [[Joseph Smith]], [[Oliver Cowdery]] and other early church officials. This reworking made the stories more useful for missionary work. Palmer asks, "Is it right to tell religious allegories to adults as if they were literal history?"

==LDS response to Palmer's book==
[[Mormon apologetics|Mormon apologists]] dispute Palmer's claim that his intent is to "increase faith", and instead regard him as a [[skeptic]].  Some speculate that Palmer may be a [[cultural Mormon]], whose [[research]] has led him to believe that the Church is not entirely what it claims to be.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Palmer argues that "[[faith]] needs to be built on truth&amp;mdash;what is, in fact, true and believable".  This statement can be perceived to be in opposition to the methods used by practitioners of what has been termed "faithful history".  Critics of "faithful history" argue that this sort of scholarship often appears to be based on [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], not [[evidence]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Mark Ashurst-McGee]], an LDS member, states that Palmer presents only one side of an issue and only uses evidence that supports his own views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashurst-McGee|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ashurst-McGee, Palmer used the Hurlbut affidavits from [[Eber Dudley Howe|Eber D. Howe's]] book ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'' for the purpose of "overlaying run-of-the-mill treasure lore" onto Joseph Smith's original account of the recovery of the [[golden plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashurst-McGee|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to LDS criticism of Palmer's book==
Responding to five negative reviews of Palmer's book by FARMS (the LDS affiliated [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cobabe|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Priddis states: "Is nothing beyond the reach of sarcasm by FARMS polemicists?" Priddis refers to the book reviews by FARMS as "tabloid scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Priddis |first=Ron |title=A Reply to FARMS and the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute |publisher=Signature Books |url=http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/insider's4.htm |accessdate=2007-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129053628/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/insider%27s4.htm |archivedate=2007-01-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church action against Palmer==
Palmer was [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|disfellowshipped]] from the Church in December 2004. Palmer has been quoted as saying that he still loves the church, and is pleased he wasn't [[Excommunication|excommunicated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Author of Controversial Book Disfellowshipped in Hearing |url=http://kutv.com/topstories/local_story_347162504.html |date=2004-12-12 |publisher=kutv.com |accessdate=2007-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310225725/http://kutv.com/topstories/local_story_347162504.html |archivedate=2007-03-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A disfellowshipped member retains church membership but loses certain privileges.

'''Argentine tango''' is a [[musical genre]] and accompanying [[social dance]] originating at the end of the 19th century in the suburbs of [[Buenos Aires]] &lt;ref name="Denniston-1" /&gt; and [[Montevideo]]. It typically has a [[Time signature|{{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}]] rhythmic [[time signature]], and two or three parts repeating in patterns such as ABAB or ABCAC. Its lyrics are marked by ''[[nostalgia]]'', sadness, and laments for lost love. The [[Orquesta tÃ­pica|typical orchestra]]  has several melodic instruments and is given a distinctive air by the small button [[accordion]] called the [[bandoneon]]. It has continued to grow in popularity and spread internationally, adding modern elements without replacing the older ones. Among its leading figures are the singer and songwriter [[Carlos Gardel]] and composers/performers [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Juan D'Arienzo]], [[Carlos di Sarli|Carlos Di Sarli]], [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], and [[Ãstor Piazzolla]].

==History of tango==
{{main|History of the tango}}
The origins of tango are unclear because little historical documentation from that era exists. However, in recent years, a few tango aficionados have undertaken a thorough research of that history&lt;ref name="Denniston-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denniston|first1=Christine|title=The Hidden History of Tango|url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/|website=The Hidden History of Tango|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so it is less mysterious today than before. It is generally thought that the dance developed in the late 19th century in working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay and was practiced by Uruguayan and Argentine dancers, musicians, and immigrant laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szmYo-voZJEC&amp;pg=PR14 |page=14 |title=Instrumental Tango Idioms in the Symphonic Works and Orchestral Arrangements of Astor Piazzolla. Performance and Notational Problems: A Conductor's Perspective |last=Drago |first=duce menandro the 3rd |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |isbn=0549783237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todobuenosaires.com/buenos_aires/es/tango/historia/origenes.php|title=OrÃ­genes del Tango - Todo Buenos Aires|website=www.todobuenosaires.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Tango music}}
Argentine tango music is much more varied than ballroom tango music. A large amount of tango music has been composed by a variety of different orchestras over the last century. Not only is there a large volume of music, there is a breadth of stylistic differences between these orchestras as well, which makes it easier for Argentine tango dancers to spend the whole night dancing only Argentine tango. The four representative schools of the Argentine tango music are [[Carlos di Sarli|Di Sarli]], [[Juan d'Arienzo|d'Arienzo]], [[AnÃ­bal Troilo|Troilo]] and [[Osvaldo Pugliese|Pugliese]], all four descendent from Italian immigrant families. They are dance orchestras, playing music for dancing. When the spirit of the music is characterized by counterpoint marking, clarity in the articulation is needed. It has a clear, repetitive pulse or beat, a strong tango-rhythm which is based on the 2x4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tango/Caminar.htm |title='Caminar' |publisher=Users.pandora.be |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 strong beats on 4 (dos por cuatro). [[Ãstor Piazzolla]] stretched the classical harmony and counterpoint and moved the tango from the dance floor to the concert stage. His compositions tell us something of our contemporary life and dancing it relates much to modern dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/TANGOkinesis.htm |title=Tango and modern dance' |publisher=Users.pandora.be |date=2007-06-23 |accessdate=2010-03-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502132020/http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/TANGOkinesis.htm| archivedate=May 2, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Argentine tango dancing has historically been danced to tango music, such as that produced by such orchestra leaders as [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], [[Carlos di Sarli]], [[Juan d'Arienzo]], in the '90s a younger generation of tango dancers began dancing tango steps to alternatives to tango music; music from other genres like, "world music", "electro-tango", "experimental rock", "trip hop", and "blues", to name a few. Tango nuevo dance is often associated with alternative music, see [[nuevo tango]], but it can be danced to tango as well.

Argentine tango dancing consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras, and in response to the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. Even though the present forms developed in Argentina and Uruguay, they were also exposed to influences re-imported from Europe and North America. There are records of 18th and early 19th century tango styles in [[Cuba]] and Spain,&lt;ref name=OrtizOrigen&gt;JosÃ© Luis Ortiz Nuevo ''El origen del tango americano"  Madrid y La Habana 1849&lt;/ref&gt; while there is a [[flamenco]] [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance.&lt;ref name=DennistonCouple&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/couple-dancing.html |title=Christine Denniston. 'Couple Dancing and the Beginning of Tango' 2003 |publisher=History-of-tango.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054148/http://www.history-of-tango.com/couple-dancing.html| archivedate= 25 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there is a good deal of confusion and overlap between the styles as they are now danced - and fusions continue to evolve.

Argentine tango is danced in an embrace that can vary from very open, in which leader and follower connect at arms length, to very closed, in which the connection is chest-to-chest, or anywhere in between.

Tango dance is essentially walking with a partner and the music. Dancing appropriately to the emotion and speed of a tango is extremely important to dancing tango. A good dancer is one who transmits a feeling of the music to the partner, leading them effectively throughout the dance. Also, dancers generally keep their feet close to the floor as they walk, the ankles and knees brushing as one leg passes the other.

Argentine tango dancing relies heavily on [[improvisation]]; although certain patterns of movement have been codified by instructors over the years as a device to instruct dancers, there is a "basic step" called "basico". One of the few constants across all Argentine tango dance styles is that the follower will usually be led to alternate feet. Another is that the follower rarely has his or her weight on both feet at the same time. In many modern variations of Argentine Tango, particularly in Europe, teachers of Tango may establish a "basic step" in order to help students to learn and pick up the "feel" of the dance.

{{Howto|date=March 2010}}
Argentine tango is danced counterclockwise around the outside of the dance floor (the "line of dance") and dance "traffic" often segregates into a number of "lanes"; cutting across the middle of the floor is frowned upon. In general, the middle of the floor is where one finds either beginners who lack floor navigation skills or people who are performing "showy" figures or patterns that take up more dance floor space. It is acceptable to stop briefly in the line of dance to perform stationary figures, as long as the other dancers are not unduly impeded. The school of thought about this is, if there is open space in front, there are likely people waiting behind. Dancers are expected to respect the other couples on the floor; colliding or even crowding another couple, or stepping on others' feet is to be avoided strenuously. It is considered rude; in addition to possible physical harm rendered, it can be disruptive to a couple's musicality.

[[Tango (ballroom)|Ballroom tango]] steps were standardized by dance studios. The steps have been relatively fixed in style for decades. However, Argentine tango has been an evolving dance and musical form, with continual changes occurring every day on the social dance floor in Argentina and in major tango centers elsewhere in the world. Argentine tango dance is, still based heavily on improvisation. While there are patterns or sequences of steps that are used by instructors to teach the dance, even in a sequence every movement is led not only in direction but also speed and quality (a step can be smooth, pulsing, sharp, ... etc.). Although Argentine tango evolves mostly on the dance floor, the government of Argentina does host an annual competition of Argentine tango dance in [[Buenos Aires]], attracting competitors from around the world.

[[File:Homer tango embrace close.jpg|thumb|150px|Close embrace]]

===Elements===

====Embrace====
A striking difference between Argentine tango and ballroom tango is in the shape and feel of the embrace. Ballroom technique dictates that partners arch their upper bodies away from each other, while maintaining contact at the hip, in an offset frame.

In Argentine tango, it is nearly the opposite: the dancers' chests are closer to each other than are their hips, and often there is contact at about the level of the chest (the contact point differing, depending on the height of the leader and the closeness of the embrace). In [[close embrace]], the leader and the follower's chests are in contact and they are dancing with their heads touching or very near each other. In open embrace, there can be as much space as desired between the partners, but there should always be complete contact along the embracing arms to give optimum communication. Since Argentine tango is almost entirely improvisational, there needs to be clear communication between partners. Even when dancing in a very open embrace, Argentine tango dancers do not hold their upper bodies arched away from each other; yet, each partner is not always over their own axis, there are even styles that demand a constant leaning against each other. Whether open or closed, a tango embrace is not rigid, but relaxed, like a hug.

[[File:Homer tango cross walk.jpg|thumb|150px|Cross system walk.]]
[[File:Homer tango parallel walk.jpg|thumb|150px|Parallel system walk.]]

====Walking====
One characteristic of Argentine tango is the walk outside of the legs of the follower. The inside walk belongs originally to the American Tango. It is seen in Argentine Tango, but it does not belong to it originally {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Another difference is that the leader may freely step with his left foot when the follower steps with her left foot. In English, this is sometimes referred to as a "crossed" (e.g. "walking in the crossed system") or "uneven" walk in contrast to the normal walk which is called "parallel" or "even."  In ballroom tango, "crossed system" is considered incorrect unless the leader and follower are facing the same direction {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Furthermore, the flexibility of the embrace allows the leader to change his weight from one foot to another while the follower's weight remains unchanged. This is another major difference with ballroom tango, where a weight change by one partner usually leads to a weight change by the other.

The nomenclature originated with the Naveira/Salas "Investigation Group." Early on, they used 'even/uneven' to describe the arrangement of legs in the walk (or turn). By the mid-1990s, they began using 'parallel/crossed' and later 'normal/crossed'. In dance the changing of feet is named ''contrapaso'', or "contra-step". This change can be made off or on the normal beat.

==== Figures ====
{{main|Figures of Argentine tango}}
Unlike the majority of social dances, Argentine tango does not have a basic step; instead is a completely improvised dance combining various elements in a spontaneous manner, as determined by the lead.
To be able to improvise, the dancer needs to learn the lead and implementation of the different single elements of Tango, so they can be produced later by leading appropriately in space and music.
The elements are just a few as ''caminar'' (walk), ''cruce'' (cross), ''ochos'' (figure-eight), ''ganchos'' (leg hooks), ''giros'' (turns), ''contragiros'' (turns in the other direction), ''sacadas'' (displacements), ''boleos'' (this expression comes from boleadoras, balls linked with cords, thrown to hunt animals),  ''llevadas de pie'' (moving foot by foot), ''cortes'' (cuts), and ''quebradas'' (breaks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangofolklore.com/tango/modules.php?name=mlContent&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=86|title=Tangofolklore - 21|first=|last=Tangofolklore|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangofolklore.com/tango/modules.php?name=mlContent&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=64|title=Tangofolklore - Libro, autora Nicole Nau|first=|last=Tangofolklore|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known and simple combinations are called ''figura bÃ¡sica'' (basic figures), especially when they contain just one element. Some of the elements are named as a figure.

[[File:Homer tango cabeceo.JPG|thumb|150px|Cabeceo]]

====CÃ³digos and yeta====
Argentine tango developed set of codes and superstitions throughout its history.

''1. The Invitation to Dance''

An invitation to dance is traditionally done by âcabeceÃ³,â a head nod by one dancer met with eye contact. It is done during a cortina or early in the tanda. The advantage of the cabaceo is that it allows for unwanted dances to be avoided, and prevents any embarrassment that comes with a rejected dance.

''2. How many songs do I dance with my partner?''

Argentine tango is danced in sets of songs, known as a âtanda.â A tanda is a set of three to four songs of one type of music- either tango, vals or milonga. If you accept a dance, you are expected to finish all of the songs with that partner. âBreaking the tandaâ is viewed as incredibly rude, and it should not be done. Dancing two or more tandas with the same person is usually not done. It implies interest in your partner, and is seen as a flirtatious act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tangoconcepts.com/blog/2008/02/different-types-of-tango.html|title=TangoScene:  Argentine Tango Dance by Florentino Guizar: Different Types of Tango|website=www.tangoconcepts.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''3. When does the tanda end? ''

After three to four songs, the tanda is flowed by a âcortinaâ (curtain). It is traditionally a non-tango song that lasts approximately a minute. During this time the dancers return to their seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tangology101.com/main.cfm/title/General-Milonga-Etiquette/id/74|title=General Milonga Etiquette|website=Tangology 101|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it is frowned upon to dance to the music of a cortina.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tangomuse.com/TangoManners.html|title=Tango Manners|last=herreman|first=tine|website=www.tangomuse.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''4. Give Priority To Those Currently Dancing''

Never walk across the dance floor while people are dancing. When you get up to meet your dance partner, move to the outside edge of the dance floor. It is important to be mindful of those already dancing.

''5. The Right Of Way On The Dance Floor''

Entering the line of dance in a crowded dance floor can be tricky. It is important to establish eye contact with the dancer approaching at your left before you enter the line of dance to avoid collision.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latangoacademy.com/blog/2015/8/18/tango-etiquette-on-the-dance-floor|title=Tango Etiquette On The Dance Floor|work=Los Angeles Tango Academy {{!}} Dance Classes|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''6. Distance Between Couples''

Always be mindful of the distance between you and your partner, and the couple ahead of you. Do not dance too closely to the couple ahead of you, or there could be a collision if they make a turn. Conversely, do not allow that distance to become too large. Never move backwards into the space of the couple behind you.

''7. When The Dance Floor Becomes Crowded''

It is important to adapt your movements to the size of the crowd dancing. In a crowded social setting, the followerâs feet should largely remain on the floor in order to avoid hitting anyone. Minimize large sweeping steps to avoid possibly hit another couple.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''8. Small Talk''

It is frowned upon to talk whilst dancing. Small talk is appropriate in between songs, or if you are sitting and not dancing.

''9. Feedback/ teaching''

It is not appropriate to give or receive feedback during Milongas. Correcting someone during this time takes away from the mutual enjoyment of the dance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; PrÃ¡cticas and classes provide opportunities for this type of interaction.

''10. Yetas''

Somewhat related is "yeta"  - superstitions. For example, one doesn't dance to the well known tango "[[Adios Muchachos]]" as it is (falsely) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/130/The-last-tango-that-Gardel-sang/|title=The last tango that Gardel sang|last=Arancio|first=Salvador Arancio|website=todotango.com|access-date=4 April 2016|quote=And next, his last tango and, consequently, the answer for the question that originated this chronicle: âTomo y obligoâ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed the last one sung by [[Carlos Gardel]] before his untimely accident leading to his death.

''Argentine Tango Etiquette today:''

While many of the cÃ³digos largely remain unchanged, the dance continues evolve alongside modernity. In the history of Argentine tango, dancing two or more tandas with the same person was usually not done as it was seen as a flirtatious act. This is one âruleâ that is seen as more flexible in the modern era. This is especially true in smaller communities of tango dancers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, tango has adapted to ever-changing fashion styles, and more casual clothing for men and women are accepted, although many make an effort to dress up for Milongas. The music played for cortinas is distinct, and cannot be confused with tango music. In Buenos Aires it is traditionally not acceptable to dance to cortinas. In the United States it is merely awkward to dance to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Vals and milonga ====
Argentine tango dancers usually enjoy two other related dances: [[vals (dance)|vals]] (valsecito criollo argentino, vals porteÃ±o, vals tango) and [[Milonga (dance)|milonga]].

Music for the vals is in 3/4 time. Tango dancers dance the vals in a rather relaxed, smooth flowing dancing style in contrast to [[Viennese Waltz]] where the dancers often take 3 steps per measure and turn almost constantly. Experienced dancers alternate the smooth one-beat-per-measure walk with some double time steps (often incorrectly called syncopated walks), stepping on one- two- or (rarely) all three beats in a measure. Vals dancing is characterized by absence of pauses; continual turns (giros) in both directions are not done as in ballroom quick waltz, although turns are sometimes introduced for variety.

[[Milonga (music)|Milonga]], in 2/4 time, has a strongly accented beat, and sometimes an underlying "[[Contradanza|habanera]]" rhythm. Dancers avoid pausing, and often introduce double time steps (incorrectly called syncopation and more appropriately called ''traspies'') into their walks and turns. Milonga dancing uses the same basic elements as tango, with a strong emphasis on the rhythm, and figures that tend to be less complex than some danced in other varieties of tango. Some tango instructors say that tango steps should not be used in milonga and that milonga has its own special rhythm and steps, which are quite different from tango.

[[Milonga (dance event)|Milonga]] is also the name given to clubs and events specially for dancing tango. This double meaning of the word milonga can be confusing unless one knows the context in which the word "milonga" is used. People who attend milongas are known as ''[[milonguero]]s''.

===Styles of Argentine tango dance===

==== Tango canyengue ====

Tango canyengue is a rhythmic style of tango that originated in the early 1900s and is still popular today. It is one of the original roots styles of tango and contains all fundamental elements of traditional Argentine tango. In tango canyengue the dancers share one axis, dance in a closed embrace, and with the legs relaxed and slightly bent. Tango canyengue uses body dissociation for the leading, walking with firm ground contact, and a permanent combination of on- and off-beat rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tangocanyengue.org |title=TangoCanyengue.org |publisher=TangoCanyengue.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302084509/http://www.tangocanyengue.org/ |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main characteristics are its musicality and playfulness. Its rhythm is described as "incisive, exciting, provocative".&lt;ref&gt;JosÃ© SebastiÃ¡n Tallon ''El tango en su etapa de musica prohibida'' 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''canyengue'' is of African origin. It came into use to describe the tango rhythm at the time of the first so-called '[[Orquesta tÃ­pica|orquestas tÃ­picas]]' (including [[bandoneÃ³n]], violin and piano).&lt;ref&gt;Athus Espindola, ''Diccionario del Lunfardo'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading exponents of tango canyengue:
* Romolo Garcia (deceased)
* El Negro Celso (deceased)
* Rodolfo Cieri (deceased) and Maria Cieri
* Luis Grondona
* Marta Anton (deceased) and 'El Gallego' Manolo Salvador
* Roxina Villegas and Adrian Griffero
* Ernest Williams and Maricela Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams/Wilson|first1=Ernest/Maricela|title=Canyengue danced by Ernest Williams and Maricela Wilson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJN3n1CVq20|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Omar and Monica Ocampo

==== Tango orillero ====

Tango orillero refers to the style of dance that developed away from the town centers, in the outskirts and suburbs where there was more freedom due to more available space on the dance floor. The style is danced in an upright position and uses various embellishments including rapid foot moves, kicks, and even some acrobatics, though this is a more recent development.

==== Salon tango ====

''Tango Salon'' does not refer to a single specific way of dancing tango. Rather, it is literally tango as it is danced socially in the salons (dance halls) of [[Buenos Aires]]. Salon tango was danced throughout the Golden Era of Argentine Tango (1935â1952) when [[Milonga (place)|milongas]] (tango parties) were held in large dance venues and full tango orchestras performed. Salon tango is often characterized by slow, measured, and smoothly executed moves, never moving against the line-of-dance, and respecting the space of other dancers on the floor around them. The emphasis is on precision, smoothness, musicality, good navigation, and following the ''cÃ³digos'' (tango etiquette) of the salons. The couple embraces closely, with some variants having a flexible embrace, opening slightly to make room for various figures and closing again for support and poise. The walk is the most important element, and dancers usually walk 60%-70% of the time during a tango song.

When tango became popular again after the end of the Argentine military dictatorships in 1983, this style was resurrected by dancers from the Golden Era:

* Carlitos (Carlos) and Rosa Perez. The legendary teacher couple at Club Sunderlad, Buenos Aires. Almost all World Tango Championship winners have taken lessons from them.
* Carlos EstÃ©vez "PetrÃ³leo" â 
* Gerardo Portalea â 
* Jose "El Turco" Brahemcha
* Jose "Lampazo" Vazquez â 
* Luis "Milonguita" Lemos â 
* Miguel Balmaceda â 
* Mingo and Esther Pugliese
* Osvaldo Cartery â  and Luisa "Coca" InÃ©s
* Toto Faraldo
* Pedro "Tete" Rusconi â 
* RamÃ³n "Finito" Rivera â 
* Virulazo â 
* In the milongas at Club Sin Rumbo, Sunderland, Club Glorias Argentinas, Salon El Pial and Salon Canning.

One variant of ''Tango Salon'' is the [[Villa Urquiza]] style, named after the northern barrio of [[Buenos Aires]] where the clubs Sin Rumbo and Sunderland are located. Some argentinian dancers or couples who were or are current practitioners and teach the Villa Urquiza style of tango are:

* El Chino Perico (one of the old milongueros)
* MarÃ­a and [[Carlos Rivarola]]
* The Dispari family with Jorge Dispari and Marita 'La Turca' and their daughters Samantha Dispari and [[Geraldine Rojas]] with their respective couples, Santiago Fina and [[Ezequiel Paludi]].
* [[Miguel Angel Zotto]] and [[Milena Plebs]] 
* AndrÃ©s Laza Moreno
* Osvaldo Zottoâ  and Lorena Ermocida
* The Rodriguez family with Jorge and Liliana RodrÃ­guez their daughter Malena, and son Javier RodrÃ­guez.
* The MissÃ© family (Andrea MissÃ© â , SebastiÃ¡n MissÃ© with Andrea Reyero, [[Gabriel MissÃ©]] and Stella MissÃ©)
* Carlos Perez and Rosa Forte
* FabiÃ¡n Peralta
* AdriÃ¡n and Amanda Costa. Teaching in Europe. They live in France as of 2014. Studied under Jorge Dispari and Marita 'La Turca'.
* JosÃ© Luis GonzÃ¡lez (CL) and Paulina CazabÃ³n (CL). They live in Chile as of 2015 and tour in Europe (mainly France).
* Juan Martin Carrara (UY) and Stefania Colina (UY). They live in Uruguay as of 2015 and tour in Europe
* Carlos Rodriguez de Boedo (AR) and Brigita UrbietytÄ (LT). They live in Kaunas, Lithuania as of 2015 and teach mostly in Baltic and eastern countries.
* Chiche NuÃ±ez (AR). He lives in Berlin, Germany as of 2015.
* Alper ErgÃ¶kmen and Selen SÃ¼rek. They live in Ankara, Turkey as of 2015 and teach mostly in Europe.
* Ney Melo. He lives in US as of 2015.

==== "Estilo milonguero" (tango apilado/confiteria style; estilo del centro de Buenos Aires) ====
{{Main|Milonguero style}}
This is a close-embrace style named by [[Susana Miller]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Susana Miller"&gt;[http://laacademiatango.com/content/quienes-somos Susana Miller], Susana Miller - director of La Academia de Tango&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal for crowded dance floors, it is danced chest-to-chest, knees relaxed, back straight, with the partners leaning - or appearing to lean - slightly toward each other to allow space for the feet to move. The center line of the leader's and follower's spines are directly in front of each other, requiring that each dancer turn their head to their left slightly to find space over their partner's right shoulder. The follower's left arm reaches directly up over the leader's shoulder without resting any body weight on the leader's shoulder.  The leader's left hand and the follower's right hand clasp in the same manner as other styles of Argentine Tango, with elbows pointed down (contrasting with elbows up and pointed back as in [[Tango (ballroom)|ballroom tango]]), with little or no pressure applied by the arms or hands.  The leader's right arm is held high across the follower's shoulder blades to help facilitate the upper chest connection, to avoid pulling the follower's lower torso and hips in toward the leader, thus allowing more flexibility of movement in the mid and lower spine and better extension of the follower's legs. In the case of followers that are not tall enough to place their head over the leader's shoulder, it is recommended that the follower's head be turned to the right and touch the left side of the head to the leader's chest, and the follower's left arm may wrap around the outside right arm (although this is generally not preferred as it limits the leader's flexibility of movement, and is a danger on crowded dance floors to have the follower's elbow sticking out). It is generally not recommended for a leader to dance milonguero style with a follower that is too tall for the leader to see over the follower's shoulder since it would be very difficult to navigate around the dance floor.

A style of [[Carlos Espinoza (dancer)|Carlitos Espinoza]] can be considered a modern development of tango milonguero.&lt;ref name="Carlitos-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Noelia HURTADO &amp; Carlitos ESPINOZA|url=http://www.tangoelement.org/node/12|website=Tango Element|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tango nuevo ====
{{main|Nuevo tango}}
Starting in the 1990s in [[Buenos Aires]], the ''Tango Investigation Group'' (later transformed into the ''[http://www.cosmotango.com Cosmotango]'' organization) founded by [[Gustavo Naveira]] and [[:es:FabiÃ¡n Salas|FabiÃ¡n Salas]]&lt;ref&gt;http://tangodynamics.com/about_fabian_salas&lt;/ref&gt; applied the principles of dance [[kinesiology]] from [[modern dance]] to analyze the physics of movement in Argentine tango.  Taking what they learned from this analysis they then began to explore all the possibilities of movement within the framework of Argentine Tango. From the work of these founders of the ''Tango Nuevo'' movement, there was shift in all styles of tango away from teaching what to dance toward teaching how to dance.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Homer tango linear voleo.jpg|Linear boleo
File:Homer tango volcada close.jpg|Volcada lead in closed embrace
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Though widely referred to as a tango style outside of [[Argentina]], ''Tango Nuevo'' is not considered a style of dancing tango by the founders of the movement.  It refers only to the method of analysis and teaching developed through the application of the principles of dance kinesiology to Argentine Tango.  In 2009, [[Gustavo Naveira]] published an essay ''New Tango'' in which he states, ''"There is great confusion on the question of the way of dancing the tango: call it technique, form, or style. The term ''tango nuevo'', is used to refer to a style of dancing, which is an error. In reality, tango nuevo is everything that has happened with the tango since the 1980s. It is not a question of a style... The words ''tango nuevo'' express what is happening with tango dancing in general; namely that it is evolving."''&lt;ref&gt;Tango, A History of Obsession, Virginia Gift, 2008, {{ISBN|1-4392-1462-X}}  (self published, appeared first in 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, as the [[Gustavo Naveira]] and other founders of the ''Tango Nuevo'' movement have said, all styles of tango, which have now been influenced by the analysis of the dance, are all ''Tango Nuevo''.

Despite the insistence by the founders of the ''Tango Nuevo'' movement that it is not a single style, it has become an accepted term by many that it is a separate and distinct style of tango. Practitioners of ''tango nuevo'' are [[Gustavo Naveira]], [[Norberto Esbrez|Norberto "El Pulpo" EsbrÃ©s]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cVlfJQipDY FabiÃ¡n Salas], [[SebastiÃ¡n Arce]], [[Mariana Montes]], [[Mariano FrÃºmboli|Mariano 'Chicho' FrÃºmboli]], [[LucÃ­a Mazer]], [[Eugenia Parrilla]]. All of these dancers have highly individual styles that cannot be confused with each other, yet are all referred to by many as the ''tango nuevo'' style.

==== Tango traditional ====
A very pure and early form of tango, on base as walking rhythmically, not on the beat but with rhythm.

==== Tango con corte y quebrada ====
Tango which adds cortes and quebradas, cuts and breaks. The quebradas later on has been put in a more esthetic style (estilizar) and are today known as poses de tango, Tango Positions.

==== Tango de fantasÃ­a ====
This style mostly evolved over the 1940-1950 time span. The term Tango de FantasÃ­a refers to music, dance, and dresses; it tries to codify a tango form different from the traditional one. Dancers added little sits and fast footwork&amp;nbsp;â doing fantasies, as some people called it. The related men's suit with a white border is named traje de fantasÃ­a. In music, Osmar HÃ©ctor Maderna's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/maderna.html todotango.com]&lt;/ref&gt; was referred to as Tango de FantasÃ­a due to his arrangements which included fancy solos. During the same time period, people used to refer to the non-traditional Argentinian folklore by a similar expression: Folklore de ProjecciÃ³n.

====Show tango====
[[File:Tango-Show-Buenos-Aires-01.jpg|thumb|200px|A tango show in Buenos Aires]]
Show tango, and Tango de Escenario (stage tango) is a more theatrical form of Argentine tango developed to suit the stage.

In theory, all styles can be performed on stage, but the movement has to take stage elements into accounts, such as diagonals, centres, fronts, placement of lights, etc. Often, show tango routines includes embellishments, acrobatics, and solo moves that would be impractical on a social dance floor.  Stage tango can be partially improvised, but in order for the general choreography to fit the set stage, some parts need to be rehearsed as a set routine.

Stage Tango still has to be led like it is led in all other Tango styles; otherwise the couple is missing the main ingredient of the dance, namely, the typical intimate connection; this connection becomes visible only when the leader and follower enter their roles &amp;nbsp;â whether the show is choreographed or not.

Tango on stage should not be confused with Tango de ''Fantasia'' or tango acrobatico, which is a particular style of tango that is only suitable for stage dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Nau-Klapwijk: ''Tango Dimensionen'', Kastell Verlag GmbH 1999, {{ISBN|978-3-924592-65-3}}&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Nau-Klapwijk: ''Tango, un baile bien porteÃ±o'', Editorial Corregidor 2000, {{ISBN|950-05-1311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
Argentine tango dancing in the UK began in the early 1990s in response to the hugely popular internationally touring shows "Forever Tango" and "Tango Argentino". Enthusiastic Anglo-Argentine milonguero (dance hall tango dancer) Andrew Potter who had followed "Forever Tango" to London and stayed for its extensive run, got together with some Londoner friends to start the city's first ever tango milonga (tango dance party/hall) in The London Welsh Centre at 157,Grays Inn Road, known as "Tango The Argentine Way" which would pack out every Friday night. From that moment, the tango dances and classes proliferated throughout the Capital and then throughout the rest of the UK.

===USA===
In 1985, the French dance show ''Tango Argentino'' transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totango.net/copes.html |title=Keith Elshaw. 'Juan Carlos Copes' |publisher=Totango.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428061755/http://www.totango.net/copes.html |archivedate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cast members gave classes to a number of students, including [[Robert Duvall]]. [[Paul Pellicoro]] provided a dance center for the performers to teach new students. At the same time, Danel and Maria Bastone were teaching tango in New York, and Orlando Paiva was offering tango classes in [[Los Angeles]]. For further lessons, Duvall sought out Nestor Ray, a dancer who Duvall had seen perform in the documentary film ''Tango mio''.

In 1986, Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher visited [[San Francisco]], coming from [[La Paz, Entre RÃ­os]] and [[Buenos Aires]] aboard a cruise ship where they were dancing tango and [[chacarera]] professionally. Al and Barbara Garvey took tango classes from them as well as from Jorge and Rosa Ledesma from [[Quilmes, Buenos Aires]]; all in the style of choreographed show tango. In 1987, the Garveys traveled to Buenos Aires to discover the traditional improvisational social dance style at a large milonga (Centro Akarense) filled with older dancers in [[Villa Urquiza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg01622.html Tango List.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207044345/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg01622.html |date=2006-02-07 }} Barbara Garvey. ''Re: [TANGO-L] Going to Bs As (Detecting sham and incompetent Teachers)'' June 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning home to [[Fairfax, California]], the Garveys continued tango lessons and began organizing milongas around the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. They co-founded the Bay Area Argentine Tango Association (BAATA) and published a journal.

In 1986, Brigitta Winkler appeared in her first stage performance, ''Tangoshow'' in [[Montreal]]. Though based in Berlin, Winkler traveled often to teach at tango festivals in North America throughout the following two decades. Winkler was a seminal influence of Daniel Trenner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nov 6th 2008 1:30PM by Kelly Wilson |url=http://members.aol.com/btango5/bio.htm |title=Brigitta Winkler bio |publisher=Members.aol.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montreal's first tango teachers, French-born Lily Palmer and her Argentine friend, Antonio Perea, offered classes in 1987.

The Dinzelbachers settled in San Francisco in 1988, in response to the demand for tango teachers following a visit to San Francisco by the touring production of ''Tango Argentino''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inscenes.com/noraint1.htm |title=George A. Nicol. 'Interview with Nora Dinzelbacher' |publisher=Inscenes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher taught a core group of students who would later become teachers themselves, including the Garveys, Polo Talnir and Jorge Allende.

In 1989, the Dinzelbachers were invited to [[Cincinnati]] by Richard Powers, to introduce and teach Argentine tango at a weeklong dance festival. The following year, Powers moved his festival to [[Stanford University]] and asked the Dinzelbachers back. Unfortunately, Raul Dinzelbacher, 40 years old, collapsed and died at the end of the third day of the festival. Nora Dinzelbacher was devastated but threw herself into her work, forming a dance performance troupe and teaching. She asked a student, George Guim, to become her assistant. They taught at a week-long dance festival in [[Port Townsend, Washington]].

Throughout 1990, Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' played in eight West Coast cities, increasing viewer's interest in learning the tango. [[Carlos Gavito]] and his partner [[Marcela Duran]] invented a dramatically different tango embrace in which both dancers leaned forward against each other more than was traditionally accepted. Gavito's ultimate rise to fame came from this starring appearance in ''Forever Tango''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totango.net/gavitowork.html |first=Keith |last=Elshaw |title=Carlos Gavito 1942&amp;ndash;2005 |publisher=totango.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123095227/http://www.totango.net/gavitowork.html |archivedate=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Richard Powers asked Nora Dinzelbacher to help him transform "Stanford Dance Week" into "Stanford Tango Week". The two produced the popular annual festival until the University abruptly cancelled it after its 1997 run. In 1998, with Bob Moretti, a retired USAF Lt. Col. and one of her students, Nora began a new festival in the same vein: "Nora's Tango Week", held in [[Emeryville, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batango.com/spotlight/noras_profile.php |title=BA Tango.

In the first half of 1994, Barbara Garvey's BAATA mailing list grew from 400 to 1,400 dancers. Garvey places the critical mass of the San Francisco Bay Area's tango resurgence at this point. The number of regional milongas went from three per month to 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02019.html Tango List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095543/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02019.html |date=2011-07-20 }} Barbara Garvey.

''Forever Tango'' returned to the United States late in 1994, landing in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], then San Francisco, where it ran for 92 weeks. From there the show went to New York where it became the longest-running tango production in Broadway history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2000/03/24/features/story1.html |title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin, March 24, 2000.

In June 1995, Janis Kenyon held a tango festival at [[Northwestern University]]. Kenyon had attended Stanford Tango Week in 1993, where she met Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves. The pair were invited to teach at Kenyon's 1995 [[Chicago]] event. The next year, Kenyon moved her festival to [[Columbus, Ohio]], where she featured Osvaldo Zotto. In February 1997, Clay Nelson (a two-time attendee at Stanford Tango Week) organized his first ValenTango festival in [[Portland, Oregon]]; "Tango Fantasy on Miami Beach" was formed by Jorge Nel, Martha Mandel, Lydia Henson and Randy Pittman as [[Florida]]'s first tango festival; and the Portland October Tangofest was launched, again by Clay Nelson. 1999 saw a split in Miami: Nel and Mandel scheduled their "United States Tango Congress" to open a month prior to the Tango Fantasy event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtuar.com/tango/articles/2007/oldest_fest.htm |title='Oldest Tango Festival' Randy of Miami, March 23 and 26, 2007 |publisher=Virtuar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Trenner has been credited with bringing improvisational social Argentine tango to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg00833.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031104063641/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg00833.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-11-04 |title=Daniel Trenner Tribute |publisher=Pythia.uoregon.edu |date=2003-04-24 |accessdate=2010-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Garveys, he first went to Buenos Aires in 1987, where he went to a milonga in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] and saw the traditional improvisational style being danced. Trenner was introduced to Miguel and Nelly Balmacera, a couple who would become his first tango teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=daniel trenner :: tango |url=http://www.danieltrenner.com/daniel/ar_tango.html |title=Daniel Trenner.

and Mingo Pugliese. He made video tapes of the lessons he took and translated the Spanish instruction into English. In the late 1980s, Trenner brought his newfound appreciation of traditional tango back to New York and conducted classes. In 1991, Trenner began working with Rebecca Shulman in performing and teaching tango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-manhattan.com/main_frame.php?cf=./content_teacher_display.php&amp;ins_id=36 |title=Dance Manhattan. 'Rebecca Shulman' |publisher=Dance-manhattan.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Shulman would go on to be a co-founder and director of TangoMujer in New York and Berlin.) In 1995, Trenner taught for ten weeks in [[Colorado]], followed by some 15 of those students accompanying him to Buenos Aires. Out of this experience, "Tango Colorado" was formed by Tom Stermitz and other tango aficionados from [[Denver]], [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], and a twice-yearly tango festival was organized in Denver. Trenner had planted the seed and moved on. In this way, Trenner has been called the [[Johnny Appleseed]] of tango.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02013.html Tom Stermitz.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095552/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02013.html |date=2011-07-20 }} ''Re: [TANGO-L]; Revival of Tango in North America / Pellicoro Book'', July 25, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the popular ABC series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 8)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' announced that the Argentine tango would be added to the list of dances for its eighth season, following the initiative by its British parent show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' the previous year.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

There are numerous tango festivals in the United States: Seattle Tango Magic, Denver Memorial Day, Portland Valentango in Portland, Oregon, Denver Tango Festival in Denver, Colorado, Boston Tango Festival in Boston.

The performer is instructed to press their body against a wall in various positions; Nauman says that it "may become a very erotic exercise".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Nauman, ''[http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/manuals/artists/n/N001/N001A_text.html Body Pressure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222153/http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/manuals/artists/n/N001/N001A_text.html# |date=2007-09-27 }}'', 1974.

'''Carapax''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Carapax first appeared in ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' (vol. 1) #1 (June 1986), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Paris Cullins]]. Carapax is featured as the archenemy of Blue Beetle.

==Fictional character biography==
Conrad Carapax was an [[archaeologist]] who had once been the rival of [[Blue Beetle|Dr. Daniel Garrett]], the man who became the original Blue Beetle. He went to Pago Island alone in search of whatever it was that Garrett was searching for when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead he found the top-secret [[laboratory]] of Dr. [[Jarvis Kord]], uncle of [[Ted Kord]], the second Blue Beetle. In the lab he found a gleaming [[robot]] standing silently in the corner of the huge chamber, having come back online when it had sensed his approach. Donning a strange [[helmet]] he found in the [[wikt:wreckage|wreckage]], Carapax attempted to activate the robot, but the machinery malfunctioned, zapping Carapax where he stood. Although his body had died, Carapax's mind was transferred to the robot at the instant of his [[death]]. He was now an Indestructible Man trapped on Pago Island.

He murdered the crew of the ship that had brought Lieutenant Max Fisher to Pago Island to investigate the death of Dan Garrett, hoping to use the vessel to escape. However, the Blue Beetle had followed Fisher to Pago to protect the island's secret. He saved Fisher's life and therefore came into direct conflict with Carapax.  He used his ship, the Bug, to sink the ship, and when Carapax tried to commandeer the Bug itself, he was sent hurtling into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where he sank without a trace. Unfortunately for the Beetle, Carapax simply walked along the ocean bottom until he surfaced in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He and the Beetle battled again, but this time, the Beetle fired a missile through a crack in Carapax's outer shell, igniting his power source and blowing up his body from the inside.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, Carapax was approached by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], but he refused Neron's offer of power in exchange for his soul.

After the Blue Beetle's death, Carapax confronted [[Superman]] and the new [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. His body had been rebuilt by [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrials]] and provided with a new power source.  Firestorm had to be persuaded not to vaporize Carapax's supposed armor by Superman for a very good reason - he '''''was''''' the robot, not a living being trapped inside it.

Carapax later returned, steam-powered and capable of withstanding any and all technological attacks, as part of a group formed to take out the new Blue Beetle, [[Jaime Reyes]]. Carapax is defeated when Jaime makes a crack in his shoulder, and throws one of his own missiles into it.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Beetle'' (vol. 8) #35 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Carapax has a high degree of protection from physical and energy attacks, super human strength, agility and endurance. He is able to fire miniature missiles.

==In other media==
===Miscellaneous===
* Carapax appears in issue #1 of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' (which is based on ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''). He is seen fighting Batman and [[Aquaman]] until he is defeated by them.

[[File:Rice &amp; Barton's Big Gaiety Spectacular Extravaganza Co. - Gaiety Dancers.png|Theatrical poster from 1900 showing an early chorus line.|thumb|upright=1.35]]
A '''chorus line''' is a large group of [[dancer]]s who together perform [[synchronization|synchronized]] routines, usually in [[musical theatre]]. Sometimes, [[singing]] is also performed.

Chorus line dancers in [[Broadway musicals]] and [[revue]]s have been referred to by slang terms such as ''ponies'', ''gypsies'' and ''twirlies''.  Ballet uses the term [[corps de ballet]].  A ''chorus girl'' or ''chorine'' is a female performer in a chorus line (or in a [[choir|chorus]]), and the word "chorine" is not to be confused with [[chlorine]].

[[Cognitive science]] and [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] have played an important role in providing empirical research into the [[writing process]] and serving the teaching of composition. As composition theories, there is some dispute concerning the appropriateness of tying these two schools of thought together into one theory of [[Composition studies|composition]]. However, their empirical basis for research and ties to the process theory of composition and cognitive science can be thought to warrant  some connection.

==Theoretical construct==
The cognitive theory of composition (hereafter referred to as âcognitive theoryâ) can trace its roots to psychology and cognitive science. [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s and [[Jean Piaget]]'s contributions to the theories of cognitive development and developmental psychology could be found in early work linking these sciences with composition theory (see [[Ann E. Berthoff]]).  [[Linda Flower]] and [[John Hayes (cognitive scientist)|John Hayes]] published âA Cognitive Process Theory of Writingâ in 1981, providing the groundwork for further research into how thought processes influence the writing process.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] theories of composition found their roots in the debate surrounding [[grammar]]'s importance in composition pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, Patrick. "Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar." [[College English]] 47.2 (1985): 105-127. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, such as [[Janet Emig]], [[Patrick Hartwell]], [[Martha J. Kolln]], Robert Funk, [[Stephen Witte]], and [[Lester Faigley]] continued this line of thought around the same time that a cognitive theory of composition was being developed by Flower and Hayes. These scholars, like scholars researching cognitive-oriented composition theory, focused on research providing insight into the writing process, but were also committed to providing pedagogical advancements addressing deficiencies, trends, and insights gained from their linguistic research.

==Research==

===Cognitive Theory===
A cognitive theory is focused on gaining insight into the writing process through the writerâs thought processes. Composition theorists have attacked the problem of accessing writersâ thoughts in various ways. Flower and Hayesâ  essay, âA Cognitive Process Theory of Writingâ sought to outline the writerâs choice-making throughout the writing process, and how those choices constrained or influenced other choices down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365-387. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on capturing the cognitive processes of writers during the writing process through note-taking or speaking aloud,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Anne M., and Barbara M. Sitko. Hearing Ourselves Think: Cognitive Research in the College Writing Classroom. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while some early research by Birdwell, Nancrow, and Ross was done with computers to record writersâ keystrokes during the writing process.

===Applied Linguistics===
Linguistic composition theory has traditionally focused on sentence and paragraph-level composition, with the goal of providing instructors insights into the way students write at various proficiency levels. Stephen Witte and Lester Faigley&lt;ref&gt;Faigley, Lester, and Stephen P. Witte. "Coherence, Cohesion, and Writing Quality." College Composition and Communication 32.2 (1981): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized detailed [[syntactic]] analysis to redefine the importance of [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] and [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in judging writing quality. Paul Rodgers&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Paul Jr. C. "A Discourse-centered Rhetoric of the Paragraph." College Composition and Communication 17.1 (1966): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Braddock&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, Richard. "The Frequency and Placement of Topic Sentences in Expository Prose." Research in the Teaching of English 8.3 (1974): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on paragraph structure, in separate studies, in order to dispel common misjudgments about the importance of traditional paragraph structure.

Applied linguistics, specifically [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL/ESL]] studies, has played a large role in development linguistic theories of composition. Liz Hamp-Lyonsâ research in ESL/EFL [[writing assessment]] is valuable in informing ESL composition pedagogy. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei. "Composition Studies and ESL Writing: A Disciplinary Division of Labor." College Composition and Communication 50.4 (1999): 699-721.&lt;/ref&gt;  has illustrated the deficiency in ESL composition research, and recent compilations by Matsuda and others&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei, Michelle Cox, and Jay Jordan. Second-language Writing in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook. New York: Bedford / St. Martin's, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to bridge the gap between ESL instruction and composition theory by presenting pedagogical, theoretical, and assessment frameworks in the ESL composition classroom.

==Pedagogy==
Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition are heavily tied to [[process theory]]. Cognitive and linguistic theories have been instrumental in providing respected empirical research to the field of [[Composition studies|composition theory]], but tend to stay away from making pedagogical suggestions. Instead, research in these fields is typically intended to inform process theory by providing data analysis regarding the writing process, and by bringing scientific research to the field.

The body of water on the left is the [[Aegean Sea]], while the one on the upper right is the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Dardanelles is the tapered waterway running diagonally between the two seas, from the northeast to the southwest. The long, narrow upper peninsula on the northern shores of the strait is [[Gallipoli]] ({{lang-tr|Gelibolu}}), and constitutes the banks of the continent of Europe, while the lower peninsula is [[Troad]] ({{lang-tr|Biga}}) and constitutes the banks of the continent of [[Asia]]. The city of [[Ãanakkale]] is visible along the shores of the lower peninsula, centered at the only point where a sharp outcropping juts into the otherwise-linear Dardanelles.]]
[[File:Dardanelles map2.png|thumb|250px|Close-up topographic map of the Dardanelles.]]

The '''Dardanelles''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ÉËr|d|É|Ë|n|É|l|z}}; {{lang-tr|Ãanakkale BoÄazÄ±}}, {{lang-el|ÎÎ±ÏÎ´Î±Î½Î­Î»Î»Î¹Î±|translit=Dardanellia}}), also known from [[Classical Antiquity]] as the '''Hellespont'''
({{IPAc-en|Ë|h|É|l|áµ»|s|p|É|n|t}}; {{lang-grc-gre|á¼Î»Î»Î®ÏÏÎ¿Î½ÏÎ¿Ï}}, ''Hellespontos'', literally "Sea of [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]]"), is a narrow, natural [[strait]] and internationally significant waterway in northwestern [[Turkey]] that forms part of the continental boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and separates [[Anatolia|Asian Turkey]] from [[East Thrace|European Turkey]]. One of the world's narrowest straits used for [[International waterway|international navigation]], the Dardanelles connects the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and  [[Mediterranean Sea]]s, while also allowing passage to the [[Black Sea]] by extension via the [[Bosphorus]]. The Dardanelles is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, and {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}} at its narrowest point abreast the city of [[Ãanakkale]].

Most of the northern shores of the strait along the [[Gallipoli]] Peninsula ({{lang-tr|Gelibolu}}) are sparsely settled, while the southern shores along the [[Troad]] Peninsula ({{lang-tr|Biga}}) are inhabited by the city of Ãanakkale's urban population of 110,000.

Together with the [[Bosphorus]], the Dardanelles forms the [[Turkish Straits]].

==Name==

The contemporary Turkish name ''Ãanakkale BoÄazÄ±'', meaning "Ãanakkale Strait", is derived from the [[Ãanakkale|eponymous midsize city]] that adjoins the strait, itself meaning "Pottery Fort"âfrom ''Ãanak'' (pottery) + ''Kale'' (Fortress)âin reference to the area's famous pottery and ceramic wares, and the landmark Ottoman fortress of Sultaniye.

The English name ''Dardanelles'' is an abbreviation of ''Strait of the Dardanelles''. During Ottoman times there was a castle on each side of the strait. These castles together were called the ''Dardanelles'',&lt;ref&gt;David van Hoogstraten and Matthaeus BrouÃ«rius van Nidek, ''Groot algemeen historisch, geografisch, genealogisch, en oordeelkundig woordenboek'', Volume 5, Amsterdam/Utrecht/The Hague 1729, p. 25, s.v.

The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] name {{lang|grc|á¼Î»Î»Î®ÏÏÎ¿Î½ÏÎ¿Ï}} (''Hellespontos'') means "Sea of Helle", and was the ancient name of the narrow strait. It was variously named in classical literature ''Hellespontium Pelagus'', ''Rectum Hellesponticum'', and ''Fretum Hellesponticum''. It was so called from [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, who was drowned here in the mythology of the [[Golden Fleece]].

==Geography==

As a [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] [[waterway]], the Dardanelles connects various seas along the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Near East]], and [[Western Eurasia]], and specifically connects the [[Aegean Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Marmara further connects to the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Bosphorus]], while the Aegean further links to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Thus, the Dardanelles allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].

The strait is located at approximately {{coord|40|13|N|26|26|E|}}.

===Present morphology===

The strait is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, and {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}} at its narrowest point at [[Nara Burnu]], abreast [[Ãanakkale]].&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Chart at GeoHack-Dardanelles, Map Tech&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major currents through the strait: a [[surface current]] flows from the Black Sea towards the Aegean Sea, and a more saline [[subsurface current|undercurrent]] flows in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=RozakÄs|first1=ChrÄstos L.|title=The Turkish Straits|date=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9024734649|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJc7HWhF-K8C|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dardanelles is unique in many respects. The very narrow and winding shape of the strait is more akin to that of a river. It is considered one of the most hazardous, crowded, difficult and potentially dangerous waterways in the world. The currents produced by the tidal action in the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara are such that ships under sail must await at anchorage for the right conditions before entering the Dardanelles.

==History==

As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Dardanelles has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of hostilities in modern history, notably the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the Dardanelles during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].

===Ancient Greek, Persian, Roman, and Byzantine eras (pre-1354)===

====Greek and Persian history====
The ancient city of [[Troy]] was located near the western entrance of the strait, and the strait's Asiatic shore was the focus of the [[Trojan War]]. Troy was able to control the marine traffic entering this vital waterway. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army of [[Xerxes I of Persia]] and later the Macedonian army of [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other's lands, in 480 BC and 334 BC respectively.

[[Herodotus]] tells us that, circa 482 BC, Xerxes I (the son of [[Darius the Great|Darius]]) had two [[pontoon bridge]]s built across the width of the Hellespont at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]], in order that his huge army could cross from Persia into [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. This crossing was named by [[Aeschylus]] in his tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' as the cause of divine intervention against Xerxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119043049/http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html |archivedate=19 November 2003 |df=dmy-all }}; the play.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herodotus (vv.34), both bridges were destroyed by a storm and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had those responsible for building the bridges beheaded and the strait itself whipped. [[The Histories of Herodotus]] vii.33â37 and vii.54â58 give details of building and crossing of [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]]. Xerxes is then said to have thrown [[fetters]] into the strait, given it three hundred lashes and branded it with red-hot irons as the soldiers shouted at the water.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Peter ''The Greco-Persian Wars'' (London 1996) 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus commented that this was a "highly presumptuous way to address the Hellespont" but in no way atypical of Xerxes. (vii.35)

[[Harpalus (engineer)|Harpalus the engineer]] eventually helped the invading armies to cross by lashing the ships together with their bows facing the current and, so it is said, two additional anchors.

From the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, was drowned at the Dardanelles in the legend of the [[Golden Fleece]]. Likewise, the strait was the scene of the legend of [[Hero and Leander]], wherein the lovesick Leander swam the strait nightly in order to tryst with his beloved, the priestess Hero, and was drowned in a storm.

====Byzantine history====

The Dardanelles were vital to the defence of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.

Also, the Dardanelles was an important source of income for the ruler of the region. At the [[Istanbul]] Archaeological Museum a marble plate contains a law by the [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I]] (491â518 AD), that regulated fees for passage through the customs office of the Dardanelles. Translation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Whoever dares to violate these regulations shall no longer be regarded as a friend, and he shall be punished. Besides, the administrator of the Dardanelles must have the right to receive 50 golden Litrons, so that these rules, which we make out of piety, shall never ever be violated... ... The distinguished governor and major of the capital, who already has both hands full of things to do, has turned to our lofty piety in order to reorganize the entry and exit of all ships through the Dardanelles... ... Starting from our day and also in the future, anybody who wants to pass through the Dardanelles must pay the following: &lt;br /&gt;
â All wine merchants who bring wine to the capital (Constantinopolis), except [[Cilicia]]ns, have to pay the Dardanelles officials 6 [[follis]] and 2 [[sextarius]] of wine. &lt;br /&gt;
â In the same manner, all merchants of olive-oil, vegetables and lard must pay the Dardanelles officials 6 follis. Cilician sea-merchants have to pay 3 follis and in addition to that, 1 keration (12 follis) to enter, and 2 keration to exit.&lt;br /&gt;
â All wheat merchants have to pay the officials 3 follis per modius, and a further sum of 3 follis when leaving.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 14th century the Dardanelles have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks.

===Ottoman era (1354â1922)===

The Dardanelles continued to constitute an important waterway under the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire]], starting with the [[Fall of Gallipoli|conquest of Gallipoli]] in 1354.

Ottoman control of the strait continued largely without interruption or challenges until the 19th century, when the Empire started [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|its decline]].

====Nineteenth century====
Gaining control or special access to the strait became a key foreign policy goal of the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russiaâsupported by [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Dardanelles Operation]]â[[Battle of the Dardanelles (1807)|blockaded the straits]] in 1807. Following the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828â1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828â29]], in 1833 Russia pressured the Ottomans to sign the [[Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi]]âwhich required the straits to be closed to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia's request. That would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea.

That treaty alarmed the losers,{{clarify|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--it is unclear who the losers are. The Ottomans?--&gt; who were concerned that the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions could conflict with their own possessions and economic interest in the regions. At the [[London Straits Convention]] in July 1841, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]] pressured Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime. The United Kingdom and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to attack the [[Crimean Peninsula]] during the [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856) âbut this was done as allies of the Ottoman Empire. That convention was formally reaffirmed by the [[Congress of Paris]] in 1856, following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War. It remained technically in force into the 20th and 21st centuries.

====World War I====
{{Main article|Occupation of Constantinople|Chanak Crisis}}
{{Main article|Gallipoli Campaign}}

In 1915 the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] sent a massive invasion force of British, Indian, Australian, New Zealand, French and Newfoundland troops to attempt to open up the straits. In the [[Gallipoli campaign]], Turkish troops trapped the Allies on the beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula. The campaign did damage to the career of [[Winston Churchill]], then the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], who had eagerly promoted the unsuccessful use of [[Royal Navy]] sea power to force open the straits. [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]], later founder of the [[Republic of Turkey#Republic era|Republic of Turkey]], served as a commander for the Ottomans during the land campaign.

The Turks mined the straits to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them, but in minor actions, two submarines, one British and one Australian, did succeed in penetrating the minefields. The British one sank an obsolete Turkish [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] off the [[Golden Horn]] of Istanbul. [[Ian Hamilton (British Army officer)|Sir Ian Hamilton]]'s [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] failed in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, and its withdrawal was ordered in December 1915, after eight months' fighting. Total Allied deaths included 43,000 British and Irish, 15,000 French, 8,700 Australians, 2,700 New Zealanders, 1,370 Indians and 49 Newfoundlanders. Total Turkish deaths were around 60,000.

Following the war, the 1920 [[Treaty of SÃ¨vres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. The Ottoman Empire's non-ethnically Turkish territories were broken up and partitioned among the Allied Powers, and Turkish jurisdiction over the [[Turkish Straits|straits]] curbed.

===Turkish republican and modern eras (1923âpresent)===
After the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following a lengthy campaign by Turks as part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] against both the Allied Powers and the Ottoman court, the [[Republic of Turkey]] was created in 1923 by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], which established most of the modern sovereign territory of Turkey and restored the [[Turkish Straits|straits]] to Turkish territory, with the condition that Turkey keep them demilitarized and allow all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely.

As part of its national security strategy, Turkey eventually rejected the terms of the treaty, and subsequently remilitarized [[Turkish Straits|the straits]] area over the following decade. Following extensive diplomatic negotiations, the reversion was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] in July 20, 1936. That convention, which is still in force today, treats the straits as an international shipping lane while allowing Turkey to retain the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea states.

During [[World War II]], through February 1945, when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations. Turkey declared war on Germany in February 1945, but it did not employ any offensive forces during the war.

In July 1946, the [[Soviet Union]] sent a note to Turkey proposing a new rÃ©gime for the Dardanelles that would have excluded all nations except the Black Sea powers. The second proposal was that the straits should be put under joint Turkish-Soviet defence. This meant that Turkey, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania would be the only states having access to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles. The Turkish government however, under pressure from the United States, rejected these proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Cabell, Phillips, The Truman presidency : the history of a triumphant succession (New York 1966), 102 - 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, thus affording its straits even more strategic importance as a commercial and military waterway.

In more recent years, the [[Turkish Straits]] have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits.

== Crossings ==

=== Maritime ===

The waters of the Dardanelles are traversed by numerous passenger and vehicular ferries daily, as well as recreational and fishing boats ranging from dinghies to yachts owned by both public and private entities.

The strait also experiences significant amounts of international commercial shipping traffic by [[Cargo ship|freighters]] and [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]].

=== Land ===

At present, there are no vehicular crossings across the strait. However, as part of planned expansions to the Turkish National Highway Network, the Turkish Government is considering the construction of [[Ãanakkale Suspension Bridge|a suspension bridge]] between [[SarÄ±Ã§ay]] (a district of [[Ãanakkale Province]]) on the Asian side, to [[Kilitbahir]] on the European side, at the narrowest part of the strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bosphorus Technical Consulting Corporation |url=http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html |archivedate=2013-11-06 |website=www.botek.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106053434/http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, construction of the [[Ãanakkale 1915 Bridge]] between the cities of [[Gelibolu]] and [[Lapseki]] started.

=== Subsea ===

2 [[submarine cable]] systems transmitting electric power at 400 kV voltage bridge the Dardanelles to feed west and east of Istanbul. They have their own landing stations in Lapseki and SÃ¼tlÃ¼ce. The first, situated in the northeast quarter portion of the strait, has been energised in April 2015 and leads 2 [[Gigawatt|GW]] via 6 phases 400 kV AC 3.9 km far thru the sea. The second, somewhat in the middle of the strait, has been still under construction in June 2016 and has quite similar data.

Both subsea power lines cross 4 optical fibre data lines laid earlier along the strait.&lt;ref&gt;GÃ¼lnazi YÃ¼ce: [http://hro-cigre.hr/downloads/SEERC_CD/papers/topic_2/2-03_presentation.pdf Submarine Cable Projects (2-03)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043054/http://hro-cigre.hr/downloads/SEERC_CD/papers/topic_2/2-03_presentation.pdf |date=9 April 2018 }} presented at First South East European

== In popular culture ==
English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Lord Byron]] (1788â1824) swam across the Dardanelles on 3 May 1810, and recorded it in his poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lord-byron-swims-the-hellespont |website=www.history.com |series=THIS DAY IN HISTORY |title=Lord Byron swims the Hellespont - May 03, 1810 - HISTORY.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307192340/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lord-byron-swims-the-hellespont |archivedate=7 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.turkey|title=The day I swam all the way to Asia|first=Matt|last=Barr|date=29 September 2007|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230200248/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.turkey|archivedate=30 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ãanakkale]], located along the southern shores of the strait, is the finishing point every year for an organised swim across the Dardanelles, which kicks off from [[Eceabat]]. This event emulates the swim in 1810 by [[Lord Byron]], who was himself emulating the legendary swim by Leander in the story of [[Hero and Leander]].

The shores of the strait are also the site of ancient [[Troy]]. The "wooden horse" from the 2004 movie ''[[Troy (movie)|Troy]]'' is exhibited on the seafront.

The Dardanelles is also the site of two notable maritime accidents in Turkish naval history, when two generations of the submarine '''TCG Dumlupinar''' were struck by tankers on their way back from naval missions. The [[TCG DumlupÄ±nar (1950)|first incident]] resulted in the deaths of 96 sailors, while the [[TCG DumlupÄ±nar (S339)|second incident]] had no fatalities.

Due to the importance of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in many countries' histories, the Dardanelles also features prominently in many documentaries and films about [[World War I]].

The Dardanelles is mentioned in the song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xamDprXBtBg No place like London] from the movie [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]. The song is written and composed by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and sung by [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Jamie Campbell Bower]]. Jamie's character Anthony sings, "I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders, from the Dardanelles to the mountains of Peru...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letssingit.com/sweeney-todd-feat.-benjamin-magnuson-diana-dimarzio-and-michael-cerveris-lyrics-no-place-like-london-h54qr7m|title=Sweeney Todd feat. ... - No Place Like London Lyrics|website=LetsSingIt|access-date=2016-06-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805025534/http://www.letssingit.com/sweeney-todd-feat.-benjamin-magnuson-diana-dimarzio-and-michael-cerveris-lyrics-no-place-like-london-h54qr7m|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

"Bow Down to Washington", the fight song of the [[University of Washington]], references the Dardanelles in the lyrics: "Our boys are there with bells, their fighting blood excels, it's harder to push them over the line than pass the Dardanelles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.washington.edu/music/specialcollections/bow-down-to-washington |website=www.lib.washington.edu |title=Bow Down to Washington â UW Libraries |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130135010/http://www.lib.washington.edu/music/specialcollections/bow-down-to-washington |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary''' ({{lang-fr|Parc national des oiseaux du Djoudj}}) lies on the southeast bank of the [[Senegal River]] in [[Senegal]], in northern [[Biffeche]], north east of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|St-Louis]]. 

It provides a range of [[wetland]] habitats which prove very popular with [[bird migration|migrating]] [[bird]]s, many of which have just crossed the [[Sahara]]. Of almost 400 species of birds, the most visible are [[pelican]]s and [[flamingo]]s. Less conspicuous are the [[aquatic warbler]]s migrating here from [[Europe]]; for these, the park is the single most important wintering site yet discovered [http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2007/02/aquatic_warbler_senegal.html]. A wide range of [[wildlife]] also inhabits the park, which is designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. The site was added to the [[list of World Heritage in Danger]] in 2000 due to the introduction of the invasive [[giant salvinia]] plant, which threatens to choke out the park's native vegetation. However it was removed from the list in 2006.

==Environmental issues==
[[Image:DjoudjNASA.jpg|left|thumb|At left, the drought of September 1979; at right, the floods of November 1999]]Since operation of the [[Diama Dam]] on the Senegal River began in 1988, experts have observed a lowering of the water level, [[desalinization]], and [[silting]]. The changes pose a threat to the fauna and flora. There has been in particular a proliferation of [[typha]]s and [[phragmite]]s. To the left, satellite photos take by NASA in 1979 (before construction of the dam) and 1999 (afterwards) give evidence of the significant impact on the region's ecosystem.

In 2006, though no cases of [[avian flu]] had been reported in Senegal, a monitoring program was put into effect.

'''Don Pedro Jaramillo''', was a [[curandero]], faith healer, and [[folk saint]] from the South Texas Valley region. He is known as "the healer of Los Olmos creek and "el mero jefe" ({{lang-en|the real chief}}) of the curanderos.&lt;ref name="Buying0872"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buying the Wind: Regional Folklore in the United States |first=Richard M. |last=Dorson |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=August 1972 |isbn=0-226-15862-4 |pages=418, 419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mexican0507"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mexican-American Folklore |first=John |last=West |publisher=August House |date=May 2007 |isbn=0-87483-059-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women1097"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Pioneers in Texas Medicine |first=Elizabeth |last=Silverthorne |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-89096-789-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Don Pedro"&gt;{{cite book|title=Healing with Herbs and Rituals: A Mexican Tradition|first= Eliseo  |last=Torres |publisher=UNM Press |year=2006 |isbn=0826339611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Jaramillo was born in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], [[Mexico]] to [[PurÃ©pecha people|PurÃ©pecha]] Indian parents,&lt;ref name="Women1097" /&gt; and died at an unknown age in [[Starr County, Texas]] in 1907. Jaramillo first came to notice when he arrived at the Los Olmos ranch near [[Falfurrias, Texas]] and he announced he was a curandero and began treating the Mexican families in the region. At the height of his career, families from as far away as [[New York City]] would travel to seek help from Jaramillo.&lt;ref name="Buying0872" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mexican0507" /&gt;

Jaramillo's story as a curandero begins when he was suffering from a nose ailment and as a cure, daubed his nose with mud at the edge of a pool. Three days of this self-prescribed treatment cured the ailment, however it left Jaramillo with an identifying scar on his nose. On the third night of this treatment, Jaramillo believes he heard a voice telling him [[God]] had given him the power to heal. Testing such power, he prescribed a tepid bath to his master which healed his ailment.&lt;ref name="Buying0872" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Women1097" /&gt;

The first accounts of his cures and powers were collected and printed in 1934 in Spanish, they were later in 1951 translated to English.,&lt;ref&gt;

There is a shrine at his burial site on FM Highway 1418, in Falfurrias, and also a state historical marker. The Texas State historical marker was dedicated in 1971 and is the first in Texas to be written in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;

==Themes==
In many of Jaramillo's treatments the number nine plays a prominent role. For example, he would often prescribe treatments to be taken for nine consecutive nights, or in quantities of nine. There are also stories of people who did not follow his instructions, or changed his prescription, and then failed to recover; in these tellings, only those who followed his treatments exactly as prescribed achieved complete recovery. Jaramillo's cures were often miraculous in nature, even to the point of curing paralysis.&lt;ref name="Buying0872" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mexican0507" /&gt;

Water has also been identified as a central theme in Jaramillo's cures, often requiring the ailing person to drink water for a specified length of time, or bathing in water a certain number of days.&lt;ref name="Mexican0507" /&gt;
The top cures he prescribed were all involving water and bathing.

Some of the tales portray Pedro Jaramillo as [[clairvoyant]]. He would know inherently if someone was lying about an illness or ailment. In one story he knew of a conversation that took place without him present. In Mexican culture, Jaramillo is displayed prominently in adorning homes in the form of paintings and statues.&lt;ref name="Buying0872" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mexican0507" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seman, J.K.

[[Image:St Stephen's Church (1).JPG|thumb|right|300px|St Stephen's Church in St Albans, the legal owner of the Dunkeld Lectern]]

The '''Dunkeld Lectern''' is a [[mediaeval]] [[lectern]] which was one of the most prized possessions of [[St. Stephen's Church, St. Albans|St Stephen's Church]], [[St Albans]].  The 150&amp;nbsp;kg brass reading desk stood approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;metres high and took the form of a large [[eagle]] with outspread wings with the bird perched on an orb supported by a turned shaft - an [[eagle lectern]].  Engraved on the orb was a [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription - ''Georgius Creichton Episcopus Dunkeldensis'' (translation: 'George Creichton Bishop of Dunkeld').  [[George Crichton]] was abbot at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in [[Edinburgh]] from 1515 to 1522, and it is believed that he was presented the lectern to the Abbey on being made [[Bishop of Dunkeld]] by [[Pope Alexander VI]]. The lectern was plundered by English invaders in 1544, lost (and recovered) in the [[English Civil War]], and stolen by a group of Scottish nationalists in 1984. On two occasions the lectern was hidden in a [[Grave (burial)|grave]].  It remains the subject of dispute.

==History==

In the autumn of 1543 [[Scotland]] and [[England]] signed two agreements which are often referred to as "The [[Treaties of Greenwich]]".  The first guaranteed peace between the two countries for a fixed period of time and the second affirmed that an [[arranged marriage]] would take place between [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward of England]], the son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], soon after her tenth birthday.

At the beginning of 1544 the relationship between England and Scotland began to worsen as it had done so many times before. The Scots reneged on the treaties which drove Henry VIII into a fury.  His response was swift and brutal. He directed the commander-in-chief of the English army, the [[Earl of Hertford]] to "... put all to fyre and sworde, burne Edinborough town... [so it] may remayn forever a perpetuel memory of the vengeance of God... for their [the Scots] faulsehode and disloyailtye... over throwe the castle, sack Holyrod house".

In May 1544, the English army arrived by [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|boat to destroy Edinburgh]]. The army landed near the port of [[Leith]] from whence it marched on [[Edinburgh]].  The invaders pillaged and laid waste the town, and the surrounding areas and villages, excepting only the castle.  They destroyed [[Holyrood Abbey]] and carried off much of its property as plunder.  Henry hoped his aggression would force the Scots to accept the marriage treaty.

The Earl of Hertford was accompanied to Edinburgh by [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Sir Richard Lee]] who was a military engineer - a destroyer and builder of fortifications.  His services to the English crown for his work in Scotland (and elsewhere) was formally recognised in 1544 when he was knighted and appointed Surveyor of the King's Works.  He was granted the ground covered by St Albans monastery (but not the church which was bought by the townspeople), [[Sopwell Priory]], and the rectorship of [[St. Stephen's Church, St. Albans|St Stephen's church]].

This fact, when taken with circumstantial evidence, suggests it was probably at this time the Holyrood Abbey lectern found its way into this Hertfordshire church, with the other Scottish plunder of Sir Richard Lee.

===English Civil War===

In 1642 the [[English Civil War]] began and St Albans became a Parliamentarian stronghold.  Parliament passed new laws which authorised the destruction of religious images and articles.  In response many religious items and artefacts were hidden by Anglican clergy from their Puritan prosecutors.  In August 1643 more draconian measures were introduced and continuity of the St Stephen's parish registers is broken perhaps hinting at the turbulent nature of those times.

It was during this period of national upheaval that the lectern disappeared.  Who removed it and exactly why remains a mystery to this day. Over 100 years were to pass before the lectern came to light once more.

In 1748 the Montagu family tomb in the chancel of St Stephen's church was opened up for an interment and the lectern was found lying in the grave. It was retrieved and brought back into the use.

==Scottish requests for return==

Since the eighteenth century Scottish academics, clergy and Scottish patriots have sought the return of the lectern.  A review of the history of the lectern in the newspaper ''[[Scottish Guardian|The Scottish Guardian]]'' dated 2 May 1879, finished with a plea for readers to find a way to "... secure the lectern for our new Cathedral in Edinburgh.  Who will take up the matter?"

In November 1879 an approach from the [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] was rebuffed by the vicar of St Stephen's, the Rev Marcus R. Southwell.  In December of that year he wrote to the Lord Provost, sent his best wishes and expressed the "utmost repugnance to parting with the Crichton lectern."  The Dean of the [[Order of the Thistle]] and Chapel Royal fared no better in 1914.  Nor did further approaches made by Edinburgh corporation in 1931 and 1936.

===Attempted theft===

One day in 1972 the lectern was found lying in pieces halfway down the nave of the church.  Intruders were disturbed in the course of their nefarious activities, but did not leave empty handed, taking with them three small lions from the base which supported the lectern.

===Return===

In 1982 the lectern returned to Scotland for the first time in over 400&amp;nbsp;years.  Permission was given by the [[Church of England]] for the lectern to appear in ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns'' - an exhibition of mediaeval Scottish art at the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.  Its appearance at the exhibition caused a great deal of upset and letters to the press demanded that it should remain in Scotland but when the exhibition ended the Dunkeld lectern was returned to St Stephen's church.

In the past 150&amp;nbsp;years or so, the clergy and academics have not succeeded in resolving the issue to the satisfaction of some of the Scots people.  In November 1984 a group of individuals broke into the church and removed the lectern.  The Scottish group "[[Siol nan Gaidheal]]" (Seed of the Gael) contacted the press and reported they had the lectern.  They provided a 'hostage' photograph and wrote '... This piece of our heritage is here to stay... patriotic Scots have asked for the eagle to be returned... to its rightful home.  English arrogance won the day... all requests were refused.'

In the 15 years since the lectern disappeared the rights and wrongs of the matter have been debated on television and in the press many times.  Representatives of the established churches of Scotland and England met on many occasions and invested much effort and time to resolve the matter.  Dialogue between all parties was nurtured and helped by the activities of Inverness Press and Journal reporter Mr John Vass.  He worked closely with the vicar Revd John Pragnell, Mr David Maxwell, Convenor of the Church of Scotland's Artistic Committee, and Mr David Caldwell of the Royal Museum of Scotland to get the lectern returned for permanent display in Scotland.

===Criminal endeavour prevails===

Over the years Mr Vass received a number of anonymous communications from those who held the lectern.  The "kidnappers" laid down two conditions before the Dunkeld lectern would be released.  These were that it was to stay in Scotland, and that no action would be taken to find and prosecute those responsible.  St Stephen's parish made an offer that should the lectern be forthcoming, the parish would see that it was returned to Scotland.

In recognition of this promise, St Margaret's church, Barnhill, Dundee offered St Stephen's church a Victorian eagle lectern to replace the one removed in 1984.  This Victorian lectern was a replica of the Dunkeld one.  The "Siol nan Gaidheal" failed to respond positively.  The Church of Scotland decided to proceed and present St Stephen's with the Barnhill lectern before the Revd J. Pragnell moved to his new parish.  The St Stephen's vicar had been pivotal in the efforts to bring about a satisfactory conclusion of this matter since he arrived in the parish in 1991.

==Current whereabouts==

In 1999 the Dunkeld Lectern mysteriously turned up in an Edinburgh arts centre after being missing for 15&amp;nbsp;years.  It is believed that it had been hidden in a Highland grave for the intervening period.  It has since been moved to the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and is on a three-year loan.  A permanent loan agreement is being negotiated between the National Museums of Scotland and the church of St Stephen's, still the legal owner of the Dunkeld Lectern.

[[Image:Temple-solaire-abousir.jpg|thumb|250px|The sun temple of Nyserre Ini at [[Abusir]]]]
'''Egyptian Sun Temples''' were Ancient [[Egyptian temple]]s to the sun god [[Ra]]. The term has come to mostly designate the temples built by six or seven [[pharaohs]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] during the [[Old Kingdom]] period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=Michael|date=January 1999|title=Abu Gurob (Ãgypten) (German)|url=|journal=Antike Welt|volume=30|pages=306â307}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sun temples would make a reappearance a thousand years later under Akhenaten in the New Kingdom with his building of the [[Karnak temple|Karnak Temple]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLUjtPDyu-IC&amp;pg=PT200&amp;lpg=PT200&amp;dq=v+dynasty+sun+temples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=etZXub3hOX&amp;sig=HySDVdIql7P8XqpmoM4BimePBgE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTp9Wz1o7UAhVs54MKHVzKBeQQ6AEIVzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=v%20dynasty%20sun%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Egyptian Mythology, A to Z|last=Remler|first=Pat|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438131801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth Dynasty sun temples were built in two localities, [[Abu Gorab]] and [[Abusir]], both within {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} of each other and around {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of modern-day Cairo. They may have been modeled after an earlier sun temple in [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Six or seven temples are thought to have been built, but only two have been uncovered: [[Sun temple of Userkaf|that]] of [[Userkaf]] and that of [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Robert G Morkot, ''The Egyptians: An Introduction''. pp. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The six kings associated with having built sun temples are: [[Userkaf]], [[Sahure]], [[Neferirkare]], [[Neferefre|Reneferef]] or [[Neferefre]], [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]], and [[Menkauhor Kaiu|Menkauhor]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Djedkare Isesi]], the eighth king of the 5th Dynasty, seems to have abruptly stopped the building of sun temples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The uncovered temple of Nyuserre near the village of [[Abu Gorab]] still holds impressive remains, in particular the central altarpiece which includes a well-preserved sacrificial altar composed of a number of alabaster parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The two found sun temples (thus far) are so destroyed that excavators rely mostly on the hieroglyphic signs in the templesâ names in order to reconstruct the shape of a characteristic Egyptian sun temple features like the [[Obelisk making technology in ancient Egypt|obelisk]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, ruins suggest that these were open air worship structured instead of enclosed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Mythology and Factual Basis Behind V Dynasty Sun Temples  ==
According to a tale from Middle Kingdom period, "Tale of Djedi and the Magicians", the first few kings of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] were triplets and the actual progeny of the sun god [[Ra]]. There appears to be some truth behind this myth: not only were the second and third kings of the fifth dynasty brothers,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but these rulers also started an unusually strong devotion to [[Ra]] that lasted throughout the V and VI Dynasties.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|last=Bard|first=Kathryn|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=0-415-18589-0|location=|pages=85â87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery of V Dynasty Sun Temples ==
The sun temples meaning and evolution is ingrained into both the architectural and religious history of the Old Kingdom, specifically the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt]] and [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first sun temple was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuzzolo|first=Massimiliano|date=2010|title=The V Dynasty Sun Temples Personnel. An overview of titles and cult practise through the epigraphic evidence|jstor=41060769|journal=Studien zur AltÃ¤gyptischen Kultur|volume=39|pages=289â312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these temples discovered was Niuserre's. The second excavated was [[Userkaf]]'s. Study of these type of temples did not really start until the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuzzolo|first=Massimiliano|date=2007|title=The Sun Temples of the Vth Dynasty: A Reassessment|jstor=25157803|journal=Studien zur AltÃ¤gyptischen Kultur|volume=36|pages=217â247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function of V Dynasty Sun Temples  ==

Debate exists as to what exactly the functions of these temples were, since they seem to have been for more than just royal funerary purposes, unlike [[Egyptian pyramids]], but nevertheless seem to have been part of the cultic worship of kingship, since it was essential for each king to have a personal temple.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the scholar Massimiliano Nuzzolo, during the V and VI Dynasties, "The Pharaoh appears to have acquired a new socio-religious meaning as 'sun-king' and 'sun god'".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This correlates well with the fact that these sun temples are the first found instances of Egyptian monarchs dedicating large structures made from stone entirely separate from funerary pyramids.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The V Dynasty Sun Temples: Importance and Different Temples ==
Due to the fact that there are six to seven different names of sun temples mentioned in primary sources from this period, it is suggested there is at least six different temples.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there is no specific term for sun temple in ancient Egyptian.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The temples were also a source of great wealth and importance in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The founder of the Fifth Dynasty, [[Userkaf]], built the first temple to Ra in Abusir, a few kilometers North of the necropolis of [[Saqqara]], where he had built [[Pyramid of Userkaf|his pyramid]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In total, the following temples were built:
* ''Nekhenre'', "The fortress of Re", built by Userkaf
* ''Sekhetre'', "The field of Re", built by [[Sahure]]
* ''Setibre'', "The favourite place of Re", built by [[Neferirkare Kakai]]
* ''Hetepre'', "The offering place of Re", built by [[Neferefre]]
* Conjectural: ''Hotepibre'', "Satisfied is the heart of Re", started by [[Shepseskare]] 
* ''Shesepibre''  "Joy of the heart of Re", built by [[Nyuserre Ini]]
* ''Akhetre'', "The horizon of Re", built by [[Menkauhor Kaiu]].
Only the solar temples of Userkaf and Nyuserre have been discovered today. Nyuserre's temple contains a large catalogue of inscriptions and reliefs from this king's reign.

==Structure of V Dynasty Sun Temples ==
The sun temples were built on the west bank of the Nile and like pyramids had one way in and one way out.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Each sun temple seems to have had three main sections:  First, there appears to have been a small valley temple near a canal or cultivation site; second, a short causeway led up to the desert from the previously mentioned small valley temple; to the desert plateau stood the third and most important part, the sun temple proper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In educational contexts, examples of desired student behaviour which gamification can potentially influence include attending class, focusing on meaningful learning tasks, and taking initiative.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L2013&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Borys|first1=Magdelena|last2=Laskowski|first2=Maciej|title=Implementing game elements into didactic process: A case study|conference=Management, Knowledge and Learning International Conference|date=19â21 June 2013 |location=Zadar, Croatia |pages=819â824 |url=http://www.toknowpress.net/ISBN/978-961-6914-02-4/papers/ML13-326.pdf |isbn=9789616914024 |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishable from [[Game Based Learning|game-based learning]], gamification of learning does not involve students in designing and creating their own games, or in playing commercially produced [[video games]]. Within game-based learning initiatives, students might use ''[[Gamestar Mechanic]]'' or ''[[GameMaker]]'' to create their own video game, or play ''[[Minecraft]]'', for example, where they explore and create 3D worlds. In these examples, along with games such as ''Surge'' for [[PlayStation]] and ''[[Angry Birds]]'', the learning agenda is encompassed within the game itself.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

Some authors contrast gamification of learning with game-based learning, claiming that gamification occurs only when learning happens in a non-game context, such as a school classroom, and when a series of game elements is arranged into a system or "game layer" which operates in coordination with the learning in that regular classroom.&lt;ref name=2012W /&gt; Others include games that are created to induce learning.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp (2012), p. 200: "result of the brainstorming process ... is the creation of a gamification design document outlining the design of the game ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game elements that can facilitate learning ==
Some elements of games that may be used to motivate learners and facilitate learning include:
* Progress mechanics (points/badges/leaderboards, or PBL's)
* [[Narrative]] and characters 
* Player control
* Immediate feedback
* Opportunities for collaborative problem solving
* Scaffolded learning with increasing challenges
* Opportunities for mastery, and leveling up
* Social connection

When a classroom incorporates the use of some of these elements, that environment can be considered "gamified". There is no distinction as to how many elements need to be included to officially constitute gamification, but a guiding principle is that gamification takes into consideration the complex system of reasons a person chooses to act, and not just one single factor.&lt;ref name=2012W /&gt; Progress mechanics, which need not make use of advanced technology, are often thought of as constituting a gamified system&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; However, used in isolation, these points and opportunities to earn achievements are not necessarily effective motivators for learning.&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; Engaging video games which can keep players playing for hours on end do not maintain players' interest by simply offering the ability to earn points and beat levels. Rather, the story that carries players along, the chances for players to connect and collaborate with others, the immediate feedback, the increasing challenges, and the powerful choices given to players about how to proceed throughout the game, are immensely significant factors in sustained engagement. Business initiatives designed to use gamification to retain and recruit customers, but do not incorporate a creative and balanced approach to combining game elements, may be destined to fail.&lt;ref name=Gartner2012&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Pettey |first1=Christy |last2=van der Meulen |first2=Rob |date=27 November 2012 |title= Gartner Says by 2014, 80 Percent of Current Gamified Applications Will Fail to Meet Business Objectives Primarily Due to Poor Design |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2251015 | publisher=Gartner, Inc. |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in learning contexts, the unique needs of each set of learners, along with the specific learning objectives relevant to that context must inform the combination of game elements to shape a compelling gamification system that has the potential to motivate learners.&lt;ref name=2013H&amp;S&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Huang |first1=Wendy Hsin-Yuan |last2=Soman |first2=Dilip |date= 10 December 2013 |title= A Practitionerâs Guide To Gamification Of Education |url= http://inside.rotman.utoronto.ca/behaviouraleconomicsinaction/files/2013/09/GuideGamificationEducationDec2013.pdf |series=Research Report Series Behavioural Economics in Action |publisher=Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of game elements which operates in the classroom is explicit, and consciously experienced by the students in the classroom. There is no hidden agenda by which teachers attempt to [[coercion|coerce]] or trick students into doing something. Students still make autonomous choices to participate in learning activities. The progress mechanics used in the gamified system can be thought of as lighting the way for learners as they progress,&lt;ref name=AmyJo /&gt; and the other game mechanics and elements of game design are set up as an immersive system to support and maximize students' learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Hamari|first1=J.|last2=Koivisto |first2=J. |last3=Sarsa |first3=H. |title=Does gamification work?

Game designer [[Jane McGonigal]] characterizes video game players as urgent optimists who are part of a social fabric, engaged in blissful productivity, and on the lookout for epic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGonigal|first=Jane|title=Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9780143120612}}&lt;/ref&gt; If teachers can successfully organize their classrooms and curriculum activities to incorporate the elements of games which facilitate such confidence, purpose and integrated sense of mission, students may become engrossed in learning and collaborating such that they do not want to stop. The dynamic combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators is a powerful force&lt;ref name=RD2000 /&gt; which, if educational contexts can adapt from video games, may increase student [[motivation]], and student learning.

Some of the potential benefits of successful gamification initiatives in the classroom include:

Referring to how video games provide increasingly difficult challenges to players, game designer [[Amy Jo Kim]] has suggested that every educational scenario could be set up to operate this way.&lt;ref name=AmyJo&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|title=Smart Gamification|url=http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/smart-gamification|publisher=SlideShare|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|title=The Player's Journey|conference=Gamification 2013|publisher=University of Waterloo Stratford Campus |date=20 December 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82m29j1JhWI|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game mechanic which involves tracking players' learning in the game, and responding by raising the difficulty level of tasks at just the right moment, keeps players from becoming unnecessarily frustrated with tasks that are too difficult, as well as keeps players from becoming bored with tasks that are too easy. This pacing fosters continued engagement and interest which can mean that learners are focused on educational tasks, and may get into a state of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], or deeply absorbed in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|title=Finding Flow: The psychology of engagement with everyday life|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465024117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Three key ways in which a classroom, [[course (education)|course]], or unit can be gamified are through changing the language, adapting the [[Grading (education)|grading]] process, and modifying the structure of the learning environment. With regard to language, instead of referring to academic requirements with the typical associated terms, game-like names may be used instead. For example, making a course presentation might be referred to as "embarking on a quest", writing an exam might be "defeating monsters", and creating a prototype might be classed as "completing a mission". In terms of grading, the grading scheme for a course might be adapted to make use of [[Experience point|experience points (XP)]] as opposed to letter grades. Each student can begin at level one with zero points; as they progress through the course, completing missions and demonstrating learning, they earn XP. A chart can be developed to illustrate how many XP is required to earn a letter grade. For example, earning 1500 XP might translate to a C, while 2000 would earn a B, and 2500, an A. Some teachers use XP, as well as health points (HP) and knowledge points (KP) to motivate students in the classroom, but do not connect these points with the letter grades students get on a report card. Instead these points are connected with earning virtual rewards such as badges or trophies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The structure of a course or unit may be adapted in various ways to incorporate elements of gamification; these adaptations can affect the role of the student, the role of the teacher, and role of the learning environment. The role of a student in a gamified environment might be to adopt an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] and a game name with which they navigate through their learning tasks. Students may be organized into [[team]]s or [[guild]]s, and be invited to embark on learning quests with their fellow guild members. They may be encouraged to help other guild members, as well as those in other guilds, if they have mastered a learning task ahead of others. Students tend to express themselves as one of the following game-player types; player (motivated by extrinsic rewards), socialiser (motivated by relatedness), free spirt (motivated by autonomy), achiever (motivated by mastery) and philanthropist (motivated by purpose).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gameification: A Simple Introduction and a Bit More|last = Marczewski|first = Andrej|publisher = Self-published on Amazon Digital Services|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the teacher is to design a gamified application, embedding game dynamics and mechanics that appeal to the target group (i.e. students) and provide the type of rewards that are attractive to the motivation of the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/5632 |title = Designing Gamification in the Right Way|last = Kim|first = Bohyun|date = 2015|journal = Library Technology Reports |volume=51 |issue=2 |access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important teachers know their students so they are able to best design a gamififed program that not only interests the students but also one in which matches the specific learning goals that hit on elements of knowledge from the curriculum.&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; The teacher also needs to responsibly track student achievements with a web-based platform, such as [[Open Badges]], the WordPress plug-in GameOn or an [[online spreadsheet]]. The teacher may also publish a [[leaderboard]] online which illustrates the students who have earned the most XP, or reached the highest level of play. The teacher may define the parameters of the classroom "game", giving the ultimate learning goal a name, defining the learning tasks which make up the unit or the course, and specifying the rewards for completing those tasks. The other important role of the teacher is to provide encouragement and guidance for students as they navigate the gamified environment.

The role of a gamified learning environment may be structured to provide an overarching narrative which functions as a context for all the learning activities. For example, a narrative might involve an impending [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]] attack which can be fended off or a murder mystery which can be solved, ultimately, through the process of learning. Learning is the focus of each gamified system. Sometimes the narrative is related to the content being learned, for example, in the case of a disease outbreak which can be stopped through learning biology. In some cases the narrative is unrelated, as in a case of music students who learn to play pieces as the means to collectively climb up to the top of a mountain, experiencing various challenges and setbacks along the way. Other ways in which gaming elements are part of the role of the learning environment include theme music played at opportune times, a continuous feedback loop which, if not instantaneous, is as quick as possible, a variety of individual and collaborative challenges, and the provision of choice as to which learning activities are undertaken, how they will be undertaken, or in which order they will be undertaken.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

== Corporate learning ==
Learning and training employees in corporates and organizations can be applied to improve performance, employee satisfaction, align employee with mandatory protocols, and [[on-the-job training]]. Corporate learning has significantly changed in the past two decades. Similarly to formal education institutions, corporates and organizations now realize that effective learning can no longer be limited to the classroom. Different methods to deliver content are constantly introduced in the market as well as new ways to track employees in their learning path. 
Gamification for corporate learning is used to improve the employee experience and achieve better knowledge retention rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELearning and Enterprise Gamification - The Perfect Match|url=http://www.gameffective.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Learning-White-paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These applications often feature the same common gamification elements â points, badges, leaderboards, animations, and different game narratives. Content is delivered to employees using [[microlearning]] to achieve better learning, while tracking systems can help managers see where specific employees are struggling. 
Gamified corporate learning can be achieved using a separate learning system â LMS (learning management system), or it can be embedded inside commonly used software, to achieve on the spot training and be featured in an employeeâs daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BERSIN|first1=JOSH|title=The Disruption of Digital Learning: Ten Things We Have Learned|url=http://joshbersin.com/2017/03/the-disruption-of-digital-learning-ten-things-we-have-learned/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Without adding extra gaming elements to the classroom, schooling already contains some elements which are analogous to games.&lt;ref name=L&amp;H2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=J.|last2=Hammer |first2=J. |title=Gamification in education: What, how, why bother?|journal=Academic Exchange Quarterly|year=2011|volume=15 |issue=2 |url=http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516005227/http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-16}}{{unreliable source?|reason=Academic Exchange Quarterly is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review, if any|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1700s, school has presented opportunities for students to earn marks for handing in assignments and completing exams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reisner|first=Edward H.|title=Nationalism and Education since 1789: A Social and Political History of Modern Education|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032694006|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pierson |first=George |title=C.

Knopf|location=New York|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are a form of reward points. Since the early 1900s, with the advent of [[psychoanalytic theory]], reward management programs were developed and can still be seen in schools. For example, many teachers set up reward programs in their classrooms which allow students to earn free time, school supplies or treats for finishing homework or following classroom rules.&lt;ref name=2011D /&gt;

While some have criticized the term "gamification" then, as simply a new name for a practice that has been used in education for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirk|first1=Terry|last2=Harris |first2=Christopher|title=It's all fun and games in the library|journal=Knowledge Quest|year=2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=8â9|url=http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/knowledgequest/docs/GuestEdColumn_SeptOct2011.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; gamification does not refer to a one-dimensional system where a reward is offered for performing a certain behaviour. The gamification of learning is an approach which recently has evolved, in coordination with technological developments, to include much larger scales for gameplay, new tools, and new ways to connect people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=RughiniÅ|first=RÄzvan|title=Gamification for productive interaction: Reading and working with the gamification debate in education|conference=Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)|year=2013|issn=2166-0727|publisher=IEEE|location=Lisboa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term gamification, coined in 2002, is not a one-dimensional reward system. Rather, it takes into consideration the variety of complex factors which make a person decide to do something; it is a multifaceted approach which takes into consideration psychology, design, strategy, and technology.&lt;ref name=2012W&gt;{{cite book|last1=Werbach|first1=Kevin|last2=Hunter|first2=Dan|title=For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1613630235}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the popularization of the term "gamification" is that current advancements in technology and, in particular, mobile technology have allowed for the explosion of a variety of gamification initiatives in many contexts. Some of these contexts include the [[Starbucks]] and [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] loyalty programs, location-based check-in applications such as [[Foursquare]], and mobile and web applications and tools that reward and broadcast healthy eating, drinking, and exercise habits, such as [[Fitocracy]], [[BACtrack]] and [[Fitbit]]. These examples involve the use of game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards to motivate behavioural changes and track those changes in online platforms. The gamification of learning is related to these popular initiatives, but specifically focuses on the use of game elements to facilitate student engagement and motivation to learn. It is difficult to pinpoint when gamification, in the strict sense of the term, came to be used in educational contexts, although examples shared online by classroom teachers begin appearing in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Effectiveness ==
The research of DomÃ­nguez and colleagues about gamifying learning experiences suggests that common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but their findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher. The researchers concluded that gamification in e-learning platforms seems to have the potential to increase student motivation, but that it is not trivial to achieve that effect, as a big effort is required in the design and implementation of the experience for it to be fully motivating for participants. On the one hand, qualitative analysis of the study suggests that gamification can have a great emotional and social impact on students, as reward systems and competitive social mechanisms seem to be motivating for them. But quantitative analysis suggests that the cognitive impact of gamification on students is not very significant. Students who followed traditional exercises performed similarly in overall score than those who followed gamified exercises. Disadvantages of gamified learning were reported by 57 students who did not want to participate in the gamified experience. The most frequent reason argued by students was 'time availability'. The second most important reason were technical problems. Other reasons were that there were too many students and that they had to visit so many [[web page]]s and applications at the university that they did not want to use a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DomÃ­nguez |first1=AdriÃ¡n |last2=Saenz-de-Navarrete |first2=Joseba |last3=de-Marcos |first3=Luis |last4=FernÃ¡ndez-Sanz |first4=Luis |last5=PagÃ©s |first5=Carmen |last6= MartÃ­nez-HerrÃ¡iz |first6=JosÃ©-Javier |title=Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes |journal=Computers &amp; Education |year=2013|volume=63 |pages=380â392 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field where serious games are used to improve learning is health care. Petit dit Dariel, Raby, Ravaut and Rothan-Tondeur investigated the developing of serious games potential in nursing education. They suggest that few nursing students have long-term exposure to home-care and community situations. New pedagogical tools are needed to adequately and consistently prepare nurses for the skills they will need to care for patients outside acute care settings. Advances in information and communications technologies offer an opportunity to explore innovative pedagogical solutions that could help students develop these skills in a safe environment. Laboratory simulations with high fidelity mannequins, for example, have become an integral element in many health care curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petit dit Dariel|first1=Odessa J.|last2=Raby |first2=Thibaud |last3=Ravaut|first3=FrÃ©dÃ©ric |last4= Rothan-Tondeur|first4=Monique |title=Developing the Serious Games Potential in Nursing Education|year=2013|journal=Nurse Education Today|volume=33|issue=12|pages=1569â1575|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2012.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent systematic review found evidence suggesting that the use of simulation mannequins significantly improved three outcomes integral to clinical reasoning: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking and the ability to identify deteriorating patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapkin|first1=Samuel|last2=Levett-Jones|first2=Tracy |last3=Bellchambers|first3=Helen |last4=Fernandez|first4=Ritin |title=Effectiveness of Patient Simulation Manikins in Teaching Clinical Reasoning Skills to Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Systematic Review|journal=Clinical Simulation in Nursing|volume=6|issue=6|year=2010|pages=e207âe222|doi=10.1016/j.ecns.2010.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of Mouaheb, Fahli, Moussetad and Eljamali an American version of a serious game was investigated: [[Virtual U]]niversity. Results showed that learning using this serious game has educational values that are based on learning concepts advocated by constructivist psycho-cognitive theories. It guarantees intrinsic motivation, generates cognitive conflicts and provides situated learning. The use of Virtual University allowed the researchers to identify the following key points: from its playfulness combined with video game technologies, the tool was able to motivate learners intrinsically; the simulation game also recreates learning situations extremely close to that of reality, especially considering the complexity, dynamism and all of the interrelations and interactions that exist within the university system. This is a major educational advantage by encouraging 1) an intense interaction that generates real cognitive or socio-cognitive conflicts, providing a solid construction of knowledge; 2) an autonomy in the learning process following a strong metacognitive activity; 3) an eventual transfer of acquired skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouaheb|first1=Houda|last2=Fahli|first2=Ahmed |last3=Moussetad|first3=Mohammed |last4= Eljamali |first4=Said |title=The Serious Game: What Educational Benefits?|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|year=2012|pages=5502â5508|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.465|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281202201X|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Gamification of learning has been criticized for its use of extrinsic motivators, which some teachers believe must be avoided since they have the potential to decrease intrinsic motivation for learning (see [[overjustification]]). This idea is based on research which emerged first in the early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=Edward|title=Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1971|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105â111|doi=10.1037/h0030644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=Edward|last2=Koestner|first2=Richard |last3=Ryan|first3=Richard M. |title=Extrinsic Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation in Education: Reconsidered Once Again|journal=Review of Educational Research|year=2001|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1â27|doi=10.3102/00346543071001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has been recently made popular by [[Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pink|first=Daniel|title=Drive: the surprising truth about what motivates us|year=2009|publisher=Riverhead|isbn=9781594484803}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers may not acknowledge that extrinsic motivators are already at work in a typical classroom, or they may wish to minimize extrinsic motivation.

Some teachers may criticize gamification for taking a less than serious approach to education. This may be a result of the historical distinction between work and play which perpetuates the notion that the classroom cannot be a place for games, or a place for fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Keith|title=Work and Leisure in Industrial Society|journal=Past and present|year=1964|volume=30|issue=1|pages=50â66|doi=10.1093/past/30.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz Colby|first1=Rebecca|last2=Colby|first2=Richard|title=A Pedagogy of Play: Integrating Computer Games into the Writing Classroom|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3|pages=300â312|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2008.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game play has also suffered under misconceptions of being easy, irrelevant to learning, and applicable only to very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rieber|first=Lloyd P.|title=Seriously Considering Play: Designing Interactive Learning Environments Based on the Blending of Microworlds, Simulations, and Games |journal=Educational Technology Research and Development |year=1996 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=43â58 |doi=10.1007/bf02300540}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative impressions of play may translate into suspicions regarding the value of game elements which promote fun and a sense of playfulness within a learning context.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

Teachers who criticize the gamification of learning might feel that it is not worth their time to implement gaming initiatives, either because they themselves are stretched thin with the number of responsibilities that they already have,&lt;ref name=L&amp;H2011 /&gt; or because they fear that the curriculum might not be covered if any time is spent dedicated to anything other than engagement with that curriculum. Gamification of learning has been also criticized as ineffective for certain learners and for certain situations. It should be noted that proponents of gamification have never claimed that gamification is such a panacea, recognizing that it is not an appropriate strategy to motivate every learner in every circumstance{{Citation needed|reason=Please elaborate on types of learners and circumstances in which gamification may not be an appropriate strategy.|date=March 2017}}.&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; Videogame theorist [[Ian Bogost]] has criticized gamification for its tendency to take a simplistic, manipulative approach which does not reflect the real quality of complex, motivational games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|title=Gamification is Bullshit|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/gamification_is_bullshit.shtml|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational scenarios which purport to be gamification, but only make use of progress mechanics such as points, badges and leaderboards are particularly susceptible to such criticism.

'''Governor's Comedy Club''' is an [[United States|American]] [[comedy club]] in [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on [[Long Island]]. It was more than 30 years old as of 2015. It hosts a variety of comedians from local talent, to national headliners such as [[Kevin James]], [[Nick DiPaolo]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], and [[Gilbert Gottfried]].

It has two sister clubs also on Long Island: The Brokerage Comedy Club &amp; Vaudeville Cafe (opened in 1980) in [[Bellmore, New York|Bellmore]] and McGuire's in [[Bohemia, New York|Bohemia]]. In 2017, Governor's opened "The Lil' Room", which is a smaller and intimate 60-seat showroom located within Governor's of Levittown, separate from the club's main showroom. They also opened a summer-only showroom inside the Memory Motel in [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]].

Governor's also had a former club, [http://www.gatewaycomedy.com/ Gateway], located in [[Medford, New York|Medford]]; Gateway had closed temporarily but has since re-opened (now based out of the Clarion Hotel in [[Ronkonkoma, New York|Ronkonkoma]]), though not run by the Governor's group.

They all hold Comedy Classes, which train up and coming comedians on comedy writing and performance styles, resulting in a "Graduation Show" at either the Governor's, Brokerage or McGuire's clubs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1640">'''Henchir-Baldia''' is an archaeological site and locality in southern [[Tunisia]]. The stone ruins are tentatively associated with Bladia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0323.htm  Bladia] at gcatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[civitas]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Byzacena]] during the [[Roman Empire]]. It was a [[Catholic]] bishopric.

Bladia was the seat of the Diocese of Bladia&lt;ref&gt;[[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae , (Leipzig, 1931), p.  464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Antonio Morcelli, ''Africa Christiana'', Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), pp.  103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; (in Latin : Dioecesis Bladiensis) a home suppressed and [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Mesnage, ''L'Afrique chrÃ©tienne'', (Paris, 1912), pp.  183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; that is suffragn to the [[Archdiocese of Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Audollent, v.  Bladia in ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de GÃ©ographie ecclÃ©siastiques'', vol. IX, 1937, coll.  55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Very little is known of the ancient town. Two [[bishop]]s are known from here, The Catholic Potentiometer, who participated in the [[Council of Carthage (411)]]&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Latina'' , vol.XI, col.  1281.&lt;/ref&gt; and an unnamed [[Donatist]] bishop of Bladia. The conference proceedings have not recorded his name.

Today Bladia survives as a [[titular bishop]]ric,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2b71.html   Bladia] at www.catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  the current titular bishop is [[Eduardo Vieira dos Santos]], of [[San Paolo]].

'''''Julien, ou La vie du poÃ¨te''''' (''Julien, or The Poetâs Life'') is a poÃ¨me lyrique or [[opera]] by [[composer]] [[Gustave Charpentier]]. The work is devised in a prologue and four acts and uses a [[French language|French]] [[libretto]] by the composer. ''Julien'' is a sequel to Charpentier's ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'' (1900) and describes the artistic aspirations of Louiseâs suitor Julien. The opera premiered in [[Paris]] at the [[OpÃ©ra-Comique]] on 4 June 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and performance history==
Like ''Louise'', ''Julien'''s plot is somewhat autobiographical and requires many characters and chorus roles, with the main female lead portraying four smaller characters in addition to the role of Louise. The opera integrates elements of an earlier piece, ''La Vie du PoÃ¨te'', a symphony-drama of 1888â1889. The chorus consists largely of ''filles du rÃªve'' (girls of the dream), [[fairy|fairies]], and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]] as well as various men's roles, mainly different kinds of working class men. Charpentier described how, except for the prologue, "Louise and the various characters who surround Julien are not so much real people as an exteriorized realization of their inner souls". 

The opera was not well received at its premiere, although it did gain the admiration of [[Gabriel FaurÃ©]] who admired its [[expressionism|expressionist]] qualities.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Richard Langham Smith: "Julien", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed February 19, 2009), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from two productions in 1914, one of which was at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York City]] with [[Geraldine Farrar]] and [[Enrico Caruso]] in the main roles, it had not been revived until 3 December 2000 when it had its German premiere. The production at the [[Theater Dortmund]] was directed by [[John Dew (director)|John Dew]] and conducted by [[Axel Kober]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[LibÃ©ration]]'' (5 December 2000).

Retrieved 5 September 2014 {{fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no full-length recordings of the opera. However Julien's aria "La voix de la nuit" sung by [[Maurice Dutreix]] appears as the final track on the 1935 abridged recording of ''Louise'' (re-released in 2003 on [[Naxos Records]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|53707572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Gustave Charpentier by Edgar Boutry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Portrait of Charpentier by [[Edgar-Henri Boutry]], painted in Rome in 1888]]
:Time: 19th century
:Place: Initially in Rome; then several others

'''Prologue'''

''Enthousiasme ("Filled with enthusiasm")''

Julien, as a [[Prix de Rome]] winner, is studying in [[Rome]] at the [[Villa Medici]]. This resembles the life of Charpentier as he too was a Prix de Rome winner. However, after this point, the opera moves from the real world into the imagination until the final [[Tableau vivant|tableau]], set in [[Montmartre]], returns the plot to reality.

'''Act 1'''

''Au pays du rÃªve ("In dreamland")''

It contains three settings: the Holy Mountain, followed by a setting in the Accursed Valley, and lastly the Temple of Beauty.

'''Act 2'''

This takes place in the Slovakian countryside and follows Julien as he experiences doubts in creating his artwork.

'''Act 3'''

''Impuissance'' ("Impotence")''

This is located in Brittany's wild countryside.

'''Act 4'''

''Ivresse ("Intoxication")''

Set in Montmartre, it closes in the [[Place Blanche]] with the sudden appearance of the Temple of Beauty.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

'''Karl Reinhold''' (1834â1880) was a [[Germans|German]] [[physician]] and [[Albanologist]] from [[Kingdom of Hannover]]. He was born in [[GÃ¶ttingen]], and worked as the physician-in-chief in the [[Greek Navy]], after Prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] of [[Bavaria]] became King of the newly constituted [[Kingdom of Greece]]. There, he came into contact with the [[Arvanite]] sailors, especially from the islands of [[Poros]] (Arv. ''Porjea''), [[Hydra island|Hydra]] (Arv. ''Nidhra'') and [[Spetsai]] (Arv. ''Petsa''). He collected a large corpus of folklore material (tales, folksongs, riddles, translations of the [[Bible]] and ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' from his informant Vasilis Sakellaris (ÎÎ±ÏÎ¯Î»Î·Ï Î£Î±ÎºÎµÎ»Î»Î¬ÏÎ·Ï), an Arvanite Orthodox priest from Poros. In 1855 he published a small volume of the materials he collected, under the name ''Noctes Pelasgicae vel Symbolae ad cognoscendos Dialectos Graeciae Pelasgicae collatae cura Dr. Caroli Henrici Theodori Reinhold''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/~bmkabash/Fiedler/EINF-ALB.20070524.BKTT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031113656/http://www.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/~bmkabash/Fiedler/EINF-ALB.20070524.BKTT.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/search/?store_query=1&amp;display_mode=overview&amp;search_help=list&amp;dtab=m&amp;search_type=simple&amp;search_help=&amp;display_mode=overview&amp;wf_step=init&amp;show_hidden=0&amp;number=10&amp;keep_number=&amp;cclterm1=&amp;cclterm2=&amp;cclterm3=&amp;cclterm4=&amp;cclterm5=&amp;cclterm6=&amp;cclterm7=&amp;cclterm8=&amp;cclfield1=&amp;cclfield2=&amp;cclfield3=&amp;cclfield4=&amp;cclfield5=&amp;cclfield6=&amp;cclfield7=&amp;cclfield8=&amp;cclop1=&amp;cclop2=&amp;cclop3=&amp;cclop4=&amp;cclop5=&amp;cclop6=&amp;cclop7=&amp;isp=&amp;search_coll&amp;#91;metadata&amp;#93;=1&amp;stored_cclquery=&amp;skin=&amp;rss=0&amp;cclfield1=term&amp;search_coll&amp;#91;metadata&amp;#93;=1&amp;cclterm1=Reinhold#]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Reinhold's death, some of his notes fell in the hands of [[Gustav Meyer]], who published them in his ''Albanesische Studien'' (1883â1896). His transcriptions and grammatical notes (463 pages) were published in Tirana, Albania (2005).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ardian Klosi|Klosi, Ardian]] (ed.): NetÃ«t Pellazgjike tÃ« Karl Reinholdit: tekste tÃ« vjetra shqipe tÃ« GreqisÃ«; {{ISBN|9994371819}}'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=QbRhAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Karl+Heinrich+Theodor+Reinhold%22&amp;cd=5]&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Reinhold's efforts, the Hydra/Poros dialect is one of the best-documented dialects of [[Arvanitika]], an endangered language facing extinction.

'''John Kenneth Major''' [[Royal Institute of British Architects|ARIBA]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], popularly known as '''Ken Major''' (21 October 1928 â 25 July 2009) was an [[architect]], [[author]] and world authority on [[industrial archaeology]], particularly [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s and [[animal engine|animal powered machines]].&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windmillworld.com/news/current.htm |title=Ken Major 1928â2009 |publisher=Windmill World |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Intl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagelink.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/heritage-link-update-no-31.pdf |title=HERITAGE LINK UPDATE No 31 â 15 September 2003 |publisher=Heritage Link |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727093031/http://www.heritagelink.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/heritage-link-update-no-31.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cobham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobhamheritage.org.uk/History_SkiltonsYard.html |title=Skilton's Yard |author=David Taylor |publisher=Cobham Conservation &amp; Heritage Trust |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402125401/http://www.cobhamheritage.org.uk/History_SkiltonsYard.html |archivedate= 2 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an author, he was known as '''J Kenneth Major'''.

==Early life==

Ken Major was born in [[Reading, Berkshire]] on 21 October 1928.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6787679.ece |title=Kenneth Major: heritage architect and author |publisher=The Times |accessdate=8 August 2009 | location=London | date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Katharine May Major (nÃ©e Ridge) and John William Major. He was christened John Kenneth Major but owing to a number of John Majors in the family he was generally referred to as Ken.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millsarchivetrust.org/images/uploads/documents/8485.doc |title=JOHN KENNETH MAJOR |author=John Kenneth Major |publisher=Mills Archive |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major attended the Boy's Grammar School at [[Leigh, Lancashire|Leigh]], [[Lancashire]], where his father was the [[Head teacher|headmaster]], from 1939 to 1945. He then attended a school in Kendal until 1946. Major was interested in ancient buildings from an early age. He recalled cycling to [[Winwick, Cheshire|Winwick]] [[St Oswald's Church, Winwick|church]] aged 8 to see the carved pig (symbolic of a legend about the church being relocated to a pre-Christian site) there.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

==Higher education==

Owing to the high number of demobbed ex-servicemen, Major was unable to gain a place at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] where his results would have enabled him to study [[mathematics]]. He was able to obtain a place at King's College, [[Durham University]] in Newcastle upon Tyne where he studied [[architecture]] under the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts regime]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

During his time at King's College, Major switched from design to repair. He visited [[Florence]], [[Italy]] where he studied the repair of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance buildings]] damaged in the [[Second World War|war]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; In 1952, he applied for and obtained the Lethaby Scholarship from the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] (SPAB).&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

==Career==
===Professional===
On completing his Scholarship in April 1953, Major was appointed as an architect at the Planning Department of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], [[London]]. In April 1954, he married Helen Lawrence after a four-year courtship. They both had an interest in ancient building and in 1958 the purchase of a [[Lambretta]] [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] enabled them to travel further afield.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; In 1956, Major joined [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] where his work involved the design of bus garages.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In May 1961, Major visited the [[Hudson River]] to research the construction of a [[watermill]] at [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]]. As the original settlers of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and Sleepy Hollow had come from [[East Anglia]], measured drawings of [[Woodbridge Tide Mill]] were prepared to assist the restoration.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

On his return from the [[United States]], Major joined architect and [[goldsmith]] [[Louis Osman]] as his assistant. His main work while with Osman was the restoration of [[List of Grade I listed buildings in Dorset|Ranston House]], [[Iwerne Courtney]], [[Dorset]]. In July 1963, Major joined Morgan and Branch, architects. He was involved in the redevelopment of [[Doncaster]] town centre including a new [[Movie theater|cinema]] for [[Associated British Cinemas|ABC]] and a new [[library]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

After this, Major then joined [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith Borough Council]] where he was in charge of the building of the [[White City, London|White City]] scheme. The scheme was cancelled and Major joined [[Westminster City Council]] where he was in charge of a scheme at Lisson Green, which was in limbo after the [[Ronan Point]] disaster. Following this, Major was in charge of the redevelopment of parts of [[Westbourne Grove]] where 101 properties formerly owned by [[Peter Rachman]] were repaired and converted to make them suitable for use by council tenants. Major later took charge of Westminster City Council's maintenance team. In 1975, Major was appointed Assistant City Architect to Westminster City Council. In 1984 his department was closed by the Council and Major commenced practice on his own account.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

Initial work in private practice involved finishing off various schemes from Westminster City Council.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; Major was involved in the restoration of the [[waterwheel]] ({{convert|36|ft|m|2}} diameter and {{convert|2|ft|9|in|m|2}} wide) at [[Painshill Park]], [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], [[Surrey]]. Other work included the repair of [[Stainsby Mill]], [[Doe Lea]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Gelli Groes]] mill, [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] and [[Thornhaugh|Sacrewell Mill]], [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]], [[Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; As well as mills, Major was involved in conservation and restoration of a number of [[church (building)|churches]]. Other buildings Major was involved with include Churchgate House, [[Cookham]], Berkshire and a 13th-century cottage at [[Mowsley]], [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

===Molinological===

In 1963, [[Rex Wailes]] invited Major to assist him in carrying out a survey of mills in [[Berkshire]]. Following this, the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Wiltshire]] were covered. Major also conducted a survey of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]], listing all artefacts surviving and producing a map at a scale of 2 inches to the mile (1:31,680). The resulting map was {{convert|18|ft|m|2}} long.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

In 1964, Major met JoÃ£o Miguel dos Santos SimÃµes who was at that time trying to get the various individual mill societies together. This led to the formation of [[The International Molinological Society]] in 1973,&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; of which Major was a founder member.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Major became chairman in 1977 and remained in that position until 1993. In 1970, Major's first book, ''Mills of the Isle of Wight'' was published. The publishing in 1978 of ''Animal-Powered Engines'' marked the first in-depth study of that subject.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

Apart from his work for the SPAB, Major was also an advisor for other national heritage organisations, such as [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref name=Ullesthorpe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ullesthorpewindmill.org.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=2 |title=Ullesthorpe Windmill| publisher=Ullesthorpe Windmill Project |accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and other bodies concerned with mill preservation. He was also a founding trustee of the [[Mills Archive|Mills Archive Trust]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

==Death==

Major died on 25 July 2009 after a short illness. His funeral took place on 6 August 2009 at Reading Crematorium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">The '''Lagar Velho 1''', also known as  or the '''Lagar Velho boy''', and '''Lapedo child''' is a complete prehistorical skeleton found in [[Portugal]], believed to be a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] that had a [[Neanderthal]] parent and an anatomically modern human parent.

In 1998, this discovery of an early [[Upper Paleolithic]] human burial at [[Abrigo do Lagar Velho]], by the team led by pre-history archeologist JoÃ£o ZilhÃ£o, provided evidence of early modern humans from the west of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The remains, the largely complete skeleton of an approximately 4-year-old child, buried with pierced shell and red [[ochre]], is dated to ''ca.'' 24,500 years [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name="Duarte1999" /&gt; The [[Human cranium|cranium]], [[human mandible|mandible]], [[dentition]], and [[postcrania]] present a mosaic of European early [[modern human]] and [[Neanderthal]] features.&lt;ref name="Duarte1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.13.7604 |author=Duarte |year=1999 |title=The early Upper Paleolithic human skeleton from the Abrigo do Lagar Velho (Portugal) and modern human emergence in the Iberian Peninsula |publisher=[[PNAS]] |volume=96 |issue=13 |pages=7604â7609 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/13/7604.full |accessdate=2009-06-21 |pmid=10377462 |last2=MaurÃ­cio |first2=J |last3=Pettitt |first3=PB |last4=Souto |first4=P |last5=Trinkaus |first5=E |last6=Van Der Plicht |first6=H |last7=ZilhÃ£o |first7=J |pmc=22133 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This (morphological) mosaic indicates admixture between late archaic and early modern humans in Iberia, refuting hypotheses of complete replacement of the Neanderthals by early modern humans and underlining the complexities of the cultural and biological processes and events that were involved in modern human emergence.&lt;ref name="Duarte1999" /&gt;

This was contested by several scientists including Prof. Dr. C.P.E. Zollikofer of the [[University of Zurich]] who concluded the skeleton does not reveal Neanderthal affinities.&lt;ref name="UniversitÃ¤t ZÃ¼rich"&gt;[http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/~zolli/res_db/lv.htm ifi.uzh.ch] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110718041614/http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/~zolli/res_db/lv.htm |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, genetic work from a decade later have shown that there has indeed been [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|instances of admixture between Neanderthals and modern humans]], bringing the hybrid hypothesis back within the realm of the possible.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18869-neanderthal-genome-reveals-interbreeding-with-humans.html?full=true newscientist.com]; Callaway, E. (2010): Neanderthal genome reveals interbreeding with humans. ''[[New Scientist]] online'', May 6th, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica of the skeleton and a reconstruction of the boy's face, made by American anthropologist Brian Pierson, can be seen in the Interpretation Centre of the Lagar Velho. There are plans to build a museum of archeology at the Convent of St. Augustine, the city of [[Leiria]], which houses the original skeleton.

Currently, there are over 20 million immigrant women residing in the United States. The [http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigrant-women-united-states-portrait-demographic-diversity American Immigration Council] states that the majority of these immigrant women come from Mexico, meaning that the main demographic of immigrant women in the U.S. are Latina. As the fastest growing minority group in America, Latinas are becoming primary influencers in education, economics and culture in American society and the consumer marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latina Power Shift|url=http://www.fronterasdesk.org/sites/default/files/field/docs/2013/08/Nielsen_Latina_Report_2013_.pdf|website=Fronteras Desk|publisher=Nielson|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of a Latina ==

The word Latina is the feminine form of the word Latino, and represents strictly the female population of this ethnic group. The word Latino is short for LatinoAmericano, which translates to Latin American. It was originally adopted in the US for the purpose of additional categorization of the population in the United States Census. It is important to note that Latino/a is an ethnic category, and one that encompasses various racial groups. Latinas are women of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central American, South American, or Spanish origin. Though Brazil is part of Latin America, it is not a Spanish-speaking country, and is excluded from the category of Latinos by the United States Census office.

== History of Latina Migration  ==
[[File:MexicaliBraceros,1954.jpg|thumb|A group of men entered in the [[Bracero program|Bracero Program]]]]
'''1970âPresent'''

The 1970s marked the first decade in which a gender shift occurred in Mexican migration.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, W.A. and A. Marcelli Enrico, 2000, "The changing profile of Mexican migrants to the United States: new evidence from California and Mexico." IZA Discussion paper No. 220. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iza.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, more single women and more families began to migrate along with the working males who had already been migrating for several decades. This difference in gender migration is largely attributed to the difference in Latino and Latina work opportunities in the United States. Prior to the 1970s, the majority of the Latino migratory work was agriculturally based.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42560.pdf|title = Mexican Migration to the United States: Policy and Trends|last = Rosenblum|first = Marc|date = July 7, 2012|journal = Congressional Research Service|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the end of the [[Bracero program|Bracero]] program, the United States policy on migration within the hemisphere shifted from encouraging primarily working males to migrate. Beginning with the [[Watershed 1965 amendment|Watershed amendment]] of 1965, the United States shifted their policy to encourage the migration of whole families by issuing less visas to unskilled single men and more visas to families.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This marked the beginning of a large increase in Latina migration. While men typically migrate at a young age concentration of 18-25, females migrate at generally consistent rates at all age groups. This signals a difference in motives for female migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Moving north: Different factors influencing male and female Mexican migration to the United States|last = Canudas-Romo|first = Vladimir|date = 2004|journal = The Population Research Institute|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Latinos almost always migrate to the United States in search of work, Latina migration follows a pattern heavily tied to family life.

Likewise, the early waves of the Cuban migration were primarily families. After they [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] failure, many [[middle class]] Cuban families sought escape from the newly communist Cuba in the United States. 1961 and 1962 were marked by full family Cuban immigration. Thus, many Cuban women found themselves in the United States as a result of their family.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Origins and Destinies|last = Pedraza|first = Silvia|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 264â278}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the ability for Cubans to immigrate with their families became limited as a result of strained [[US Cuba relations|US-Cuba relations]]. This led to Cubans use of flotillas in order to make it to the southern coast of Florida.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reasons For Latina Migration  ==
While the primary reason for immigration into the United States for Latinas is economic improvement, the betterment of family life remains an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2013/05/10/gender-and-undocumented-immigrant-experiences/|title = Gender and Undocumented Immigrant Experiences|date = May 10, 2013|accessdate = |website = Latino Decisions|publisher = |last = Guillen-Woods|first = Blanca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latina women also migrate with their families in an effort to seek refuge from violence and political instability in their native countries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-na-border-stats-20151114-story.html|title = LA Times|last = Hennessy-Fiske|first = Molly|date = November 15, 2015|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent events in [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]], [[Guatemalan Civil War|Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]] the number of Latinas entering the United States with families has nearly doubled in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Likewise, many Latina women identified their primary reason for immigration was to reunite with family already in the United States.

== Health ==
The [[Hispanic paradox]] refers to the medical research indicating that Latino immigrants enter the United States with better health, on average, than the average American citizen, but lose this health benefit the longer they reside in the United States. It is important to note that this health paradox affects both male and female populations of Latinos.  Likewise, immigrant Latina women are found to have a lower infant mortality rate than U.S. born women. This has been explained by the tendency for Hispanic women to continue breastfeeding for a longer amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;Page, R. L. "Differences in Health Behaviors of Hispanic, White, and Black Childbearing Women: Focus on the Hispanic Paradox." ''Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences'': 300-12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] does not cover non-citizens nor does it cover immigrants with less than 5 years of residency. As a result, Latino immigrants struggle to gain health care once they enter the United States.  Non-citizen Latinos often avoid hospitals and clinics for fear of deportation, leading to an increased risk of preventable diseases such as tuberculosis and Hepatitis in this population.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Liete, Paula, Adela Angoa, Xochitl Castaneda, and Emily Felt. "Health Outcomes of Mexican Immigrant Women in the United States." ''Migrationpolicy.org''. 2 Apr. 2013. Web. 15 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Latino health deteriorates as this population assimilates into unhealthy lifestyles associated with lower socioeconomic American populations.

== Latina Women in the Workforce ==
Immigration to the United States offers new economic prospects for Latina women. While many Latina women work outside the home in their countries of origin, their efforts in the U.S. often yield more economic benefits. The Institute of Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame comments on this idea with Mexican women in mind, claiming that "much of the work that women do in the United States generates more income than it would in Mexico, allowing women to be much more financially independent." This financial independence allows these women more freedom to act as the head of household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knapp|first1=Jenna|title=Ms.|url=https://latinostudies.nd.edu/assets/95245/original/3.3_gender_migration.pdf|website=Institute for Latino Studies|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though economic conditions in the U.S. are often better for these immigrants than in the countries from which they came, they are nowhere near those that men and even women of other ethnicities enjoy. Latina women make disproportionately less money than their male and non-Hispanic white counterparts. These disparities in wage and job availability leave this portion of the United States population more vulnerable to poverty and its implications. Though it is common knowledge that women in the United States make less than their male counterparts, this wage gap further varies by ethnicity.  On average, Latina women make 55 cents to the dollar when compared to white, non-Hispanic males while white women make 78.1 cents to the same dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Mareshah|title=Fact Sheet: The State of Latinas in the United States|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/report/2013/11/07/79167/fact-sheet-the-state-of-latinas-in-the-united-states/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy between white and Latina women continues further. The number of [[working poor]] Latina women is more than double that of white women, and poverty rates for Latinas are nearly triple those of white women.&lt;ref name="Latina Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Mareshah|title=Fact Sheet: The State of Latinas in the United States|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/report/2013/11/07/79167/fact-sheet-the-state-of-latinas-in-the-united-states/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination of this wage gap, on average, equates to: 194 more weeks of food for a Latina's family, more than 17 more months of mortgage and utility payments, nearly 27 more months of rent, or 12,342 additional gallons of gas.&lt;ref name="wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Latinas and the Wage Gap: Fact Sheet|url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness/fair-pay/latinas-wage-gap.pdf|website=|publisher=National Partnership Organization|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These wage gaps in the workforce affect Latinas at every socioeconomic status, not just the [[working class]].  Latina women are the most likely group to be paid at or below the minimum wage, with 5.7% of wage and salary workers earning this amount. Of [[women in the workforce]] with advanced degrees (master's, professional, and doctoral degrees), Latinas earn the lowest median weekly earnings of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earnings by Demographics|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/demographics.htm#race|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite discrimination in the workforce, Latina participation is on the rise. From 1970 to 2007 Latinas have seen a 14% increase in labor force participation, which the Center for American Progress calls "a notable rise." &lt;ref name="Latina Fact Sheet"/&gt;

Of the Latinas participating in the labor force, 32.2% work in the service sector, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This percentage is significantly higher than that of white women, who fall at 20%.  Conversely, Latinas are underrepresented in various other sectors of the labor force, particularly as business owners.  However, Latina entrepreneurship has grown immensely since the start of the 21st century. In 2011, 788,000 Latinas ran their own businesses, representing a 46% increase from 2006.  Comparatively, female business owners as a whole only increased by 20% during this same time period.&lt;ref name=BLS&gt;{{cite web|title=Labor Force Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/race_ethnicity_2012.pdf|website=BLS Report|publisher=United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
In the United States, female employment has become an increasingly important determinant of family economic well-being, especially among disadvantaged populations such as Latinas.  Female employment offers these women more autonomy, the chance to support themselves without relying on a spouse.

=== Domestic Abuse &lt;ref name="domestic abuse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olarte|first1=Alberto|title=Battered Latina Immigrants: Barriers and Interventions|url=http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/Libraries/VAWC/Olarte_colloquium_presentation.sflb.ashx|website=Rutgers School of Social Work|publisher=Rutgers University|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
This autonomy is particularly important considering some researchers believe that Latinas may be particularly vulnerable to domestic violence issues. These domestic abuse struggles result from a combination of violent partners and bureaucratic complications of the US immigration system. Domestic issues among immigrants are potentially exacerbated by language barriers, economic dependence, low levels of education and income, poor knowledge of services, undocumented status, lack of a support system, and the immigration experience in general. According to the Rutgers School of Social Work, around 17% of Latina immigrants are victims of Domestic Violence. This violence can manifest in different ways, and is often difficult to diagnose when it the result of verbal threats rather than physical abuse. Oftentimes, it is threats of deportation that influence Latina women to keep silent about their situation.

=== Latina Family Values and Structure ===
Because the Latina ethnicity encompasses a large variety of people, including people of various races from various countries, it is difficult to define the Latina Family experience in a simple way.  To do so would oversimplify this population and result to stereotyping, as the experience of Latinas is just as nuanced as the women who comprise this ethnic group. There is a significant lack of literature on the home life experience of Latina women and how it may change with immigration to the United States.

==== Family Life in Countries of Origin ====
Patterns of female family structure are found to be similar in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and tend to be more matrifocal. Conversely, Mexican and Costa Rican women are often migrating from a patriarchal husband-wife system, with just 13% and 22% of households headed by women in these countries, respectively. Puerto Rico lies somewhere between these two systems, sharing aspects of both patriarchal and matrifocal systems.  According to a study published by the National Institute of Health, these patterns correspond with relatively low female participation in the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massey|first1=Douglas|last2=Fischer|first2=Mary|last3=Capoferro|first3=Chiara|title=International Migration and Gender in Latin America|pmc=3051285|pmid=21399742|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00387.x|volume=44|journal=Int Migr|pages=63â91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Latina Power in the United States ====
For Mexican and Costa Rican women in particular, life in the United States represents a significant shift in opportunities for family life, as higher wages allow women the ability to be more autonomous. In a 2013 Nielson study in the United States, Latinas said they were primary or joint decision makers in the household, giving input in categories such as grocery shopping, insurance, financial services, electronics, and family care. Additionally, the Latina population is increasingly becoming "primary wage earners and influencers" in the modern Hispanic United States Household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latina Power Shift|url=http://www.fronterasdesk.org/sites/default/files/field/docs/2013/08/Nielsen_Latina_Report_2013_.pdf|website=Frontera Desk|publisher=Nielson Holdings Global Information and Measurement Company|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

=== Latina Immigrants' Current Levels of Education ===
The [http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigrant-women-united-states-portrait-demographic-diversity American Immigrant Council's] research states that in 2012 Latina immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic had the lowest education level when compared to other countries. However, women had higher education rates than the Latino male immigrants, as shown in the American Immigration Council's [http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/figure5_0.png chart]. For example, 6.2% of female immigrants in Mexico have bachelor's degrees as compared to the 5.0% of male immigrants in 2012. 14% of the women immigrants from the Dominican Republic have bachelor's degrees compared to the 12% of Dominican men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Immigrant Women in the United States: A Portrait of Demographic Diversity {{!}} Immigration Policy Center|url = http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigrant-women-united-states-portrait-demographic-diversity|website = www.immigrationpolicy.org|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent [http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-reform-2015-more-hispanics-us-schools-theyre-struggling-keep-1827574 article] from the International Business Times, Latino immigrant students are falling behind in academic achievements and graduation rates compared to other students. Moreover, these statistics apply to Hispanics that have not recently migrated to the United States, implying that the American education system is not meeting the needs of Latino students as a population. The [http://www.iwpr.org/ Institute for Women's Policy Research] shows in a study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organizations Working with Latina Immigrants: Resources and Strategies for Change â IWPR|url = http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/organizations-working-with-latina-immigrants-resources-and-strategies-for-change/|website = www.iwpr.org|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, that Latina immigrants residing in Phoenix, Northern Virginia, and Atlanta all have a lower high school completion rates when compared to their male Latino immigrant counterparts. Latinas also fall behind Latino immigrants in their likelihood to attend 1â4 years of college. However, in Northern Virginia and Atlanta a higher percentage of Latina women complete 5+ years of college than Latino men do.  Latina immigrants also lack a "substantial amount" of English proficiency, as discovered in IWPR's 2008 research. This language barrier plays a significant role in the Latina educational experience and progress.

=== Education Services for Latina Immigrants in the United States ===
Currently, there are limited resources for Latina immigrants in the United States. As explained in Motivations of Immigration, many women come to the United States for a better education, among other factors. The [http://www.iwpr.org Institute for Women's Policy Research] explains the workings of organizations aimed to support the struggles of Latina immigrants. The IWPR&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Immigrants: Fear, Education, and Economics {{!}} FemChat|url = http://www.iwpr.org/blog/2011/04/19/women-immigrants-fear-education-and-economics/|website = www.iwpr.org|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that growing organizations are currently providing English tutors and access to education. Programs specifically for Latina (and Latino) immigrants now use an adaptation tactic of teaching, rather than an [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] ideology to help this population adjust to American life. Programs like these include [http://casa-latina.org/programs Casa Latina Programs], providing education on English, workers' rights, and the consumer culture of America.

== Social Issues ==
While Latina women face a multitude of issues in immigrating into the United States, perhaps the most significant ones revolve around basic human rights. All too often, illegal Latina immigrants are unable to avoid human abuse because of lack of protection from the law. As a result, Latinas endure a severely unequal migratory experience when compared to their male counterparts.

'''Human Trafficking'''

Human trafficking disproportionately affects women. In the United States, an estimate of at least ten thousand people are forced into labor through such a process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Trafficking: Modern Enslavement of Immigrant Women in the United States|url = https://www.aclu.org/human-trafficking-modern-enslavement-immigrant-women-united-states|website = American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the category of women, immigrant women are the ones who are targeted and pulled in more easily. Due to their lack of knowledge of their new surroundings, the English language, and vulnerability to work, these women are more easily tricked, or coerced, into these businesses.  These women come into the United States looking for improved employment or educational opportunities, making them much more vulnerable to coercion and false job opportunities offered by traffickers. Additionally, many immigrant women do not understand their rights, or are faced with threats of deportation. Much of this trafficking is hard to detect, as it is not usually visible to the public or governmental eye.

'''Dealing With Social Issues'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Latina Leaders Courageously Fight to End Violence Against Women|url = http://www.latinorebels.com/2014/03/25/latina-leaders-courageously-fight-to-end-violence-against-women/|website = Latino Rebels|accessdate = 2015-12-14|first = Jen|last = Wilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various Latina women involved in organizations and programs that aim to aid Latina women affected/victimized by human trafficking or domestic abuse. Some of these influential women include Maria Jose Fletcher, Laura Zarate, Rosie Hidalgo, Olga Trujillo, Susan Reyna.

In Florida, Maria Jose Fletcher is the founder and co-director of VIDA Legal Assistance, a not-for-profit legal organization whose purpose is to provide legal support for the immigrant women who have been victims of violent crimes. This organization acknowledges and aims to solve the issue of fear of deportation that plagues the Latina community and makes it fearful of reporting such crimes.

Laura Zarate is the co-founder of the organization of [http://www.arte-sana.com/statistics_violence_latinas.htm Arte Sana], which translates to "Art Heals." This Latina-lead organization was founded in Austin, Texas and serves the purpose of addressing sexual violence.

Rosie Hidalgo has used her position as a former attorney in New York City and her current role as the Director of Public Policy for Casa de Esperanza and the National Latin@ Network to help fight domestic violence issues. She was influential in the fight for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. She has also been awarded for her work on domestic abuse and immigration reform.

Susan Reyna is the executive director of M.U.J.E.R. (Mujeres Unidas en Justicia, EducaciÃ³n, y Reforma), which is an organization that provides services to farmworker families. This organization also helps victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.

== Immigrant Culture within America ==

=== Mexican Influence in Literature ===
Immigrants have influenced today's culture in America through their practices, art, literature, and more. Latina immigrants have influenced American literature dating back to the 19th century. Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton was the first Mexican immigrant to write a novel in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Panorama of Latino Art|url = http://www.nps.gov/history/heritageinitiatives/latino/latinothemestudy/arts.htm|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her literary works gave Latina women in the United States a new voice by delving into race, gender, and [[Social class|class]] of the times. This set the tone for many Latino and Latina immigrants to create works in American society.

=== Cuban Influence in the Arts ===
[[File:Celia Cruz 1.jpg|thumb]]
Cuban culture has made its way into America thanks to many refugees and their talents. [[MarÃ­a Irene FornÃ©s|Maria Irene Fornes]], a Cuban immigrant to the United States, created plays that focused on feminism and poverty. Her success in the 1960s gave Latina immigrants a presence in off-Broadway productions. Another Cuban immigrant, [[Ana Mendieta]], created sculptures, performances, and many other art mediums that focused on themes of women, life experiences, and earth. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009, which emphasizes her success in her artistic fields and connection to life experiences. Celia Cruz, born in Havana, Cuba, was famous for her Cuban-inspired salsa music and many Latin and American Grammy's. Celia immigrated to the US in the early 1960s against Castro's wishes. Not only was she famous for her vocals, but she made many Hollywood appearances, resulting in a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. By having such a wide, diverse audience, she left her mark on America's pop culture as a female Cuban immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.biography.com/people/celia-cruz-40369#commercial-success-|title = Biography.com|date = |accessdate = |website = Celia Cruz Biography|publisher = A&amp;E Television Networks|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Celia, [[Gloria Estefan]] was born in Cuba and is arguably the most famous Cuban American singer to date. Her Latin music flooded American radio stations and television features, bringing Latina presence into American pop culture.

'''''Le Mondain''''' (''The Worldling'' or ''The Man of the World'') is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] poem written by French [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] writer and philosopher [[Voltaire]] in 1736. It [[Satire|satirises]] Christian imagery, including the story of [[Adam and Eve]], to defend a way of life focused on [[Hedonism|worldly pleasure]] rather than the promised pleasure of a religion's [[afterlife]]. It opposes [[Morality and religion|religious morality]] and especially the teaching of [[original sin]]. Its points echo Voltaire's prose works ''Lettres philosophiques'' and ''Remarques sur Pascal''. Voltaire noted a trend against using poetic forms to make philosophical arguments, and wrote ''Le Mondain'' in deliberate opposition to this trend.&lt;ref name="ocv_intro"&gt;"Introduction" in ''Le Mondain'' Critical edition by Haydn T. Mason, in ''Åuvres complÃ¨tes de Voltaire'', Volume 16 ([[Voltaire Foundation]], Oxford) {{ISBN|0729407942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The poem is set in the [[Garden of Eden]] but, contrary to the teaching of original sin, Eden is not portrayed as a paradise from which man would be expelled, but a state of barbarity. Adam's nails are described as long and dirty since no-one has yet invented a tool to trim or clean them. The implication is that the world we experience is hence not a prison into which we have been thrown as punishment.&lt;ref name="hont"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFNHyh9WY3AC|chapter =The early Enlightenment debate on commerce and Luxury|first=Istvan|last=Hont|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought|editor-last=Goldie|editor-first=Mark|editor-last2=Wokler|editor-first2=Robert|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521374224|pages=413â414|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the poem's closing line says, "Le paradis terrestre est oÃ¹ je suis" ("The earthly paradise is where I am.")

== Reaction ==
Line 22 of the poem, "Le superflu, chose trÃ¨s-nÃ©cessaire" ("The superfluous, a very necessary thing"), became a common catch-phrase.&lt;ref name="ocv_intro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hont" /&gt;

Responding to hostile reactions in 1737, Voltaire wrote a poem in the same style, ''DÃ©fense du Mondain ou l'apologie du luxe'' ("Defense of the Worldling or an Apology for Luxury").&lt;ref name="hont" /&gt; The themes of the two are somewhat different; ''Le Mondain'' focusing on the personal benefits of worldly pleasure, while the ''DÃ©fense'' talks about the social benefits of seeking pleasure.&lt;ref name="ocv_intro" /&gt;

The French dramatist [[Alexis Piron]] wrote a poem in response, ''L'Antimondain,'' in 1738.&lt;ref name="ocv_intro" /&gt;

The poem's publication caused a scandal which led to Voltaire fleeing in 1738 from [[Cirey-sur-Blaise]] in France to [[Brussels]], where he spent three months before returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Voltaire, FranÃ§ois Marie Arouet de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marta Andreasen''' (born 26 November 1954) is an Argentine-born Spanish accountant, employed in January 2002 by the [[European Commission]] as Chief Accountant,&lt;ref name=laidbare&gt;Andreasen, Marta: ''Brussels Laid Bare'', pg. 20. St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and notable for raising concerns about flaws in the commission's accounting system which she felt left the commission vulnerable to potential fraud. Elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 election]], she defected to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in February 2013.&lt;ref name='BBCFeb'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21555727|title=UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen defects to Conservatives|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lost her seat in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Henley |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-27572317 |title=UKIP gains seats and share in South East EU vote |publisher=BBC News |date=2014-05-26 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
She qualified in 1977 as a [[certified public accountant]] in Buenos Aires, then worked for five years as an [[auditor]] at [[Pricewaterhousecoopers]]. From 1982 on she worked as a finance and administration manager, then as a regional finance director at various companies, such as [[Rockwell Automation]] and [[Lotus Development]], mostly in Spain. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==OECD==
She joined the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1998, where she reported serious problems with its accounting system, raised her concerns with the management and suggested ways of reforms. After initial resistance, [[Arthur Andersen]] were assigned for an outside analysis.{{clarify|date=August 2012}} In August 2000, their report described the OECD's internal accounting systems as outdated and inadequate. Andreasen, however, was suspended from her job for 15 months. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

''[[Accountancy Age]]'' stated in October 2003 that Andreasen's spell at the OECD ended with "her bid to take the organisation to the European Court of Justice claiming her human rights had been violated as she had not been given a 'fair trial' following allegations of racism, and that she raised 'undue doubts' and unsupported 'alarmist allegations' in relation to OECD accounts." 
 
The OECD never confirmed allegations of racism were part of the cause for her suspension. Andreasen had already dismissed those in ''Accountancy'' magazine in October 2000 ("Andreasen claims allegations against her emerged only after she had raised concerns about the accounts").

==Brussels==
In January 2002 she began her new job in Brussels as Chief Accountant&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, Marta: ''Brussels Laid Bare'', page 10. St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ("budget execution director and accounting officer"), the first professional accountant hired.&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, Marta: ''Brussels Laid Bare'', page 31. St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns over EU's accounting===
Andreasen criticised the EU's accounting system for being open to fraud.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Andreasen, Marta: Brussels Laid Bare, St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She raised her criticisms and proposals for overdue improvements and changes internally, but made no progress with her superior. She then submitted her report to the [[Commissioner]] [[Michaele Schreyer]] and the Commission President [[Romano Prodi]]. She again received no answers and so approached members of the [[EU Parliament]]âs [[Budget Control Committee]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

She, consequently, refused to sign off the 2001 [[European Commission]] accounts. In the discharge procedure in 2003 the Commission promised comprehensive reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.euabc.com/word/43 ''Marta Andreasen'' entry] in the euabc.com (somewhat dated)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.justresponse.net/DougalWatt16Sep02.html The Marta Andreasen and Fabra Valles cases: an exclusive JUST Response report from the Dougal Watt Dossier â Mismanagement and Corruption in Europe]'' â Letter from [[Robert Dougal Watt]], Auditor, European Court of Auditors, to [[Michel HervÃ©]], Secretary General, European Court of Auditors, 16 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage the media began to investigate and to report. Andreasen went public with her concerns on 1 August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Becky Barrow: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1403393/Im-not-a-politician-just-a-bean-counter-says-Andreasen.html "I'm not a politician â just a bean-counter, says Andreasen"]. ''The Daily Telegraph''. 2 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacking===
Andreasen was fully suspended from her job by the Commission in May 2002 (for "violating Articles 12 and 21 of staff regulations, failure to show sufficient loyalty and respect").

In 2007 Andreasen became the Treasurer of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), which is committed to withdrawing the United Kingdom from the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7030970.stm UKIP prepares for battle over EU]'', BBC News, 5 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 elections to the European Parliament]] she was elected as a UKIP [[member of the European Parliament]] for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] and immediately joined the Parliament's influential [[Committee on Budgetary Control]], although the [[European People's Party]] group blocked her bid to become a vice-chair of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2246504/andreasen-fails-bid-budget Andreasen fails in bid for EU budget committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725092717/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2246504/andreasen-fails-bid-budget |date=25 July 2009 }}, ''Accountancy Age'', 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, she resigned from her post as Treasurer of UKIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marta Andreasen, UKIP's treasurer and Brussels whistleblower, resigns|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6825234.ece|publisher=The Times|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Andreasen announced her intention to apply for the vacant position of Director-General of the [[European Anti-fraud Office]] (OLAF),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2261409/whistle-bower-seeks-head-eu Whistleblower seeks to head EU anti fraud unit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082359/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2261409/whistle-bower-seeks-head-eu |date=19 June 2010 }}, ''Accountancy Age'', 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no subsequent report that she had actually sent in such an application.

After what she considered a disappointing election result for UKIP in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2011|local elections of May 2011]], Andreasen called for her leader [[Nigel Farage]] to resign. The party responded that it had made gains in the election and that her statement "displays what one might perhaps charitably call a naivety in its analysis of the UK electoral scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13348940 | work=BBC News | title=Call for UKIP's Nigel Farage to resign as double act turns sour | date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a TV interview, Farage himself responded that Andreasen was out of touch and "didn't know what she was talking about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Junius |url=http://juniusonukip.blogspot.com/2011/05/ukip-marta-andreasen-threatens-legal.html |title=UKIP: Marta Andreasen threatens legal action against Nigel Farage |publisher=Juniusonukip.blogspot.com |date=2011-05-28 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, she told [[RTÃ Radio 1]]'s ''[[Morning Ireland]]'' that the Irish government's nomination of [[Kevin Cardiff]] to the [[European Court of Auditors]] should be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1107/finance.html "Kevin Cardiff nomination questioned by MEP"], ''[[RTÃ News]]'', 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, she defected from UKIP to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], describing leader [[Nigel Farage]] as "a Stalinist" who was "anti-women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21555727 | work=BBC News | title=UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen defects to Conservatives | date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She lost her seat at the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 election]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3908">In July 1827, the inmates of the [[King's Bench Prison]], in Borough, South London, devised an amusement to pass the time which gained the attention of the general public. It was proposed that they should elect a member to represent "Tenterden" (a slang name for the prison) in Parliament. Three candidates were put up, one of whom was Lieutenant Meredith, an eccentric naval officer.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}
{{quote|... As I approached the unfortunate, but merry, crowd, to the last day of my life I shall ever remember the impression... baronets and bankers, authors and merchants, painters and poets... dandies of no rank in rap and tat-ters... all mingled in indiscriminate merriment, with a spiked wall, twenty feet high, above their heads...|[[Benjamin Haydon]].{{sfn|Percy|Timbs|1828|p=194}} }}

All the characteristics of a regular election were parodied. Addresses from the candidates to the 'worthy and independent electors' were printed and posted up around the prison; contending parties wrote broadsheets &amp; sang songs attacking their opponents; there were processions with flags and music, to take the several candidates to visit the several "Collegians" (i. e., prisoners) in their rooms; speeches were made in the courtyards, full of grotesque humour; a pseudo "high-sheriff" and other "election officers" were chosen to oversee the proceedings "properly"; and the electors were invited to "rush to the poll" early on Monday morning, the 16th of July.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

The turnkeys (guards) of the prison entered into the fun. While these preliminary plans were engaging attention, a creditor happened to enter the prison; and seeing the prisoners so exceedingly joyous, declared that such a kind of imprisonment for debt could be no punishment; and he therefore liberated his debtor. Whether owing to this singular result of prison-discipline (or indiscipline), or an apprehension of evils that might follow, Mr. Jones, marshal of the prison, put a stop to the whole proceedings on the morning of the 16th. Apparently the proceedings were halted violently, exasperating the prisoners. They resented the language used towards them, and opposed the treatment to which they were subjected; until a squad of Foot-guards, with fixed bayonets, forcibly drove some of the leaders into a filthy "black-hole" or place of confinement.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}
{{quote|The three candidates, and other persons who were active in the election, were for some time kept in close confinement, and a sergeant's guard was introduced, and remained in the prison all night. The result was pacific; but the conduct of the marshal has been much censured and threatened with a parliamentary investigation.|Benjamin Haydon.{{sfn|Percy|Timbs|1828|p=196}} }}

The election occurred while [[Benjamin Haydon]] was in prison for the second time. He produced the picture of the ''Mock Election'', and sold it to King [[George IV]] for Â£500.

'''Multicultural and diversity management''' is the ârecognition and valorization of individual differencesâ. "The concept of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] encompasses acceptance and respect. It means understanding that each individual is unique, and recognizing our individual differences. These can be along the dimensions of [[race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[socioeconomic status]], age, physical abilities, [[Religion|religious beliefs]], [[Politics|political beliefs]], or other ideologies. It is the exploration of these differences in a safe, positive, and nurturing environment. Moreover, it is about understanding each other and moving beyond simple [[Toleration|tolerance]] to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity in each individual"(Patrick and Kumar, 2012). As seen from a US perspective, âDiversity managementâ is supposed to represent a break from legislated equality concepts such as equal opportunity and affirmative action (Thomas, 1990 ; Thomas and Ely, 1996).

== History of diversity management ==
Diversity management should be understood as a historically situated concept. Diversity management as a concept appeared and gained momentum in the USA in the mid-1980s. At a time when President Ronald Reagan threatened to dismantle equality and affirmative action laws in the USA in the 1980s, equality and affirmative action professionals employed by US firms along with equality consultants, engaged in establishing the argument that a diverse workforce should be seen as a competitive advantage rather than just as a legal constraint. Basically, their message was : do not promote diversity because it is a legal mandate, but because it is good for business (Kelly and Dobbin, 1998). From then on, researchers started to test a number of hypotheses on the business benefits of diversity and of diversity management, known as the business case of diversity.

The presence of diversity management in the workplace has been depicted as the existence of conceptual and operational policies and programs within the organizations that ensure that the various groups that exists in the societal spectrum are able to effectively participate in the various levels that exists in the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=|date=|title=Is diversity management related to financial performance in family firms? performance has created the relevance for this concept|url=|journal=Family Business Review|volume=28|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Undertaken up to the present day provides only modest support to the proposal, that workforce diversity per se brings business benefits with it. Therefore, this idea remains open to debate and further research. In short, whether diversity pays off or not depends on environmental factors, internal or external to the firm. Dwyer, Richard &amp; Chadwyck (2003) found that the effects of gender diversity at the management level are conditional on the firm's strategic orientation, the organizational culture and the multivariate interaction among these variables. SchÃ¤ffner, Gebert, SchÃ¶ler, &amp; Kirch (2006) found that if the firmâs culture incorporates the normative assumption or belief that diversity is an opportunity, then age diversity becomes a predictor of team innovativeness, but not otherwise. Kearney &amp; Gebert (2006) found that diversity in age, nationality, and functional background, have a positive effect on team innovativeness in a high transformational leadership context, but no effect in a low one. A curvilinear relationship between diversity and performance was identified by Richard, Barnett, Dwyer, &amp; Chadwick (2004). Kochan, Bezrukova, Ely, Jackson, Joshi, Jehn et al. (2003), found few positive or negative direct effects of diversity on performance. In the cases that came under their scrutiny, a number of different aspects of the organizational context or group processes moderated the diversity-performance relationship. Failing to manage diversity properly or developing diversity per se leads to only mixed results (Bell &amp; Berry, 2007; Klein &amp; Harrison, 2007). Overall research suggests that diversity needs to be properly managed if any business benefits are to be reaped. If properly managed, diversity likely will hold its business promises. This does not preclude that diversity at all levels of society should be a goal 'per se'. Beyond business benefits, research should pay more attention to societal benefits attached to the promotion of more inclusive and diverse workforces.

'''Ofelia Schutte''' (born 1945) is Professor Emerita of Philosophy at the [[University of South Florida]], where she had served as Professor of Philosophy since 2004, and as Professor of Women's Studies (and chair of the department) from 1999 until 2004.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Ofelia Schutte: September 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/ofeliaschutteseptember2013|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schutte is recognized by many as a senior Latina feminist philosopher, who has played a crucial role in launching the field of Latin American Philosophy within the United States.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

==Education and career==
Schutte received her bachelor's in English from [[Barry College]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Schutte|first=Ofelia|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://philosophy.usf.edu/faculty/data/oschutte_cv.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving her bachelor's, she went on to receive a master's degree in English from the [[University of Miami]] in 1969, a master's degree in philosophy from [[Miami University]] in 1970, and a doctorate in philosophy from Yale University in 1978, with her focus being the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[German philosophy]] following [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

While working towards her degrees, Schutte served as an instructor of philosophy and English at [[Miami University]]. After receiving her docorate, she accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Humanities at the [[University of Florida]], transitioning to Philosophy one year later.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1984, and full professor in 1994.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; After a 20-year teaching career at the University of Florida, in 1999 Schutte moved to the [[University of South Florida]], where she chaired the Women's Studies Department.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; In 2004, Schutte left the Women's Studies department, and became Professor of Philosophy.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In 2012, she received [[Professors in the United States#Professor Emeritus and Emerita|emerita]] status.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In addition to her university appointments, Schutte has served in a number of other professional roles, including chairing the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s Committee on Hispanics/Latinos,&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; and in a large number of editorial roles, including being associate editor and board member of [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]] between 1990 and 2006 (and continuing as an advisory board member since,) serving on the advisory board of the Cuadernos de Filosofia at the University of Buenos Aires since 2007, being a member of the editorial board of [[Teaching Philosophy]] from 2006 to 2011, and being a member of the editorial board of [[Mora: Revista del Area Interdisciplinaria de Estudios de la Mujer]] since 1995, and being a member of [[Journal of the Argentine Society of Women in Philosophy]]'s between 1989 and 2000.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas==
Including feminist and pro-Latino/Latina ideas in her work, Schutte has been described as an "unwavering" defender of feminist and Latina philosophy in the modern discourse, and has been acknowledged as a leader in feminist Latina philosophy. Some of her research was conducted as a [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study|Bunting scholar]] and a [[Fulbright scholar]].&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; One of her goals is to examine [[marginalization|marginalized]] populations without attempting to engage in [[cultural assimilation]]. She has posited that all intercultural interaction is inherently incommensurate to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Border Communities and Royce: The Problem of Translation and Reinterpreting Feminist Empiricism |last = Bardwell-Jones |first = Celia T |journal = Journal of Speculative Philosophy: A Quarterly Journal of History, Criticism, and Imagination |volume = 22 |issue = 1 |date = 1 January 2008 |pages = 12â23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Schutte's first publications were a feminist interpretation of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: her dissertation, which shared a title with her first book, ''[[Beyond Nihilism: Nietzsche Without Masks]]''.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; In this book, she agrees with Nietzsche's efforts to deconstruct [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and rejects [[nihilism]] as part of a dualist philosophy. However, she criticizes the political implications Nietzsche writes into his work.&lt;ref name="MartÃ­n-Alcoff"/&gt; Her second book, ''[[Cultural Identity and Social Liberation in Latin American Thought]]'', discussed the interaction of activist movements and the progressive philosophies behind them in 20th century Latin America.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; It was instrumental in bringing Latin American philosophy and thought to the United States. She was also one of the first philosophers to publish on Latin America in the United States, shortly behind [[Jorge Gracia]].&lt;ref name="MartÃ­n-Alcoff"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Schutte's Nietzschean Postcolonial Politics |last = MartÃ­n-Alcoff |first = Linda |journal = Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy |volume = 19 |issue = 3 |pages = 144â156 |date = Summer 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pergamon Museum''' ({{lang-de|Pergamonmuseum}}) is situated on the [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]]. The building was designed by [[Alfred Messel]] and [[Ludwig Hoffmann (architect)|Ludwig Hoffmann]] and was constructed over a period of twenty years, from 1910 to 1930. The Pergamon Museum houses monumental buildings such as the [[Pergamon Altar]], the [[Ishtar Gate]] of Babylon, the [[Market Gate of Miletus]] reconstructed from the ruins found in [[Anatolia]], as well as the [[Mshatta Facade]].

The museum is subdivided into the antiquity collection, the Middle East museum, and the museum of Islamic art. It is visited by approximately 1,135,000 people every year{{fact|date=December 2017}}, making it the most visited art museum in Germany (2007), and is one of the [[list of largest art museums| largest]] in the country.{{update inline|date=December 2017}}

== Origin ==
[[File:Berlin - Pergamonmuseum - Altar 01.jpg|left|450px|thumb|Pergamon Altar]]
By the time the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum on Museum Island (today the [[Bodemuseum]]) had opened in 1904, it was clear that the edifice was not large enough to host all of the art and archaeological treasures being excavated under German supervision. Excavations were underway in the areas of ancient [[Babylon]], [[Uruk]], [[Assur]], [[Miletus]], [[Priene]] and [[ancient Egypt]], and objects from these sites could not be properly displayed within the existing German museum system. [[Wilhelm von Bode]], director of the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum, initiated plans to build a new museum nearby to accommodate ancient architecture, German post-antiquity art, and Middle Eastern and Islamic art.

Alfred Messel began a design for the large three-wing building in 1906. After his death in 1909 his friend Ludwig Hoffman took charge of the project and construction began in 1910, continuing during the [[World War I|First World War]] (1918) and the great inflation of the 1920s. The completed building was opened In 1930.

The Pergamon Museum was severely damaged during the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|air attacks on Berlin]] at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Many of the display objects had been stored in safe places, and some of the large exhibits were walled in for protection. In 1945, the [[Red Army]] collected all of the loose museum items, either as war booty or, ostensibly, to rescue them from looting and fires then raging in Berlin. Not until 1958 were most of the objects returned to [[East Germany]]. Significant parts of the collection remain in [[Russia]].  Some are currently stored in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The return of these items has been arranged in a treaty between Germany and Russia but, as of June 2003, is blocked by Russian restitution laws.

* The [[Ishtar Gate]] and the Processional Way, [[Babylon]]
* The [[Mshatta Facade]]
* The Meissner fragment from the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

===Antiquity Collection ''(Antikensammlung)''===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-12947-0003, Berlin, Bodemuseum, Pergamonmuseum.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Museum Island]] with Pergamon Museum and [[Bode Museum]] (1951).]]
The collection goes back to the [[prince-elector]]s, or ''KurfÃ¼rsten'', of [[Brandenburg]], who collected objects from antiquity; the collection began with an acquisition to the collection by a Roman archaeologist in 1698. It first became accessible (in part) to the public in 1830, when the [[Altes Museum]] was opened. The collection expanded greatly with the excavations in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Samos Island|Samos]], [[Pergamon]], [[Miletus]], [[Priene]], [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Didyma]].

This collection is divided between the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum.

The collection contains sculpture from the archaic to Hellenistic ages as well as artwork from Greek and Roman antiquity: architecture, sculptures, inscriptions, mosaics, bronzes, jewelry and pottery.

The main exhibits are the Pergamon Altar from the 2nd century BC, with a 113 meters (371&amp;nbsp;ft) long sculptural frieze depicting the struggle of the gods and the giants, and the Gate of Miletus from Roman antiquity.

As Germany was divided following the Second World War, so was the collection. The Pergamon Museum was reopened in 1959 in [[East Berlin]], while what remained in [[West Berlin]] was displayed in Schloss Charlottenburg.

{{anchor|Islamic art}}

===Islamic Art Museum ''(Museum fÃ¼r Islamische Kunst)''===
{{further|Islamic art}}

When the Bode Museum was opened in 1904, a section for Islamic art was created and later included in the Pergamon Museum (1950).

Besides Islamic artwork from the 8th to the 19th century ranging from Spain to India, the main attraction is the [[Mshatta facade]], which originates from an unfinished early Islamic desert palace located south of Amman in present-day [[Jordan]]. It was a gift from the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]. Parts of the eastern portion of the facade and the ruins of the structure of which it formed a part remain in Jordan.

Another unique exhibition is the Aleppo room.  This area of the museum features a reception room from a broker's home in Aleppo, Syria, that was commissioned during the Ottoman Period.&lt;ref name="Hagedorn"&gt;Annette Hagedorn "Aleppo Room" in Discover Islamicart Art. Place: Museum With No Frontiers, 2010.[http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;39;en]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Art Museum also regularly hosts temporary exhibitions of modern art from the Islamic world, such as the 2008 ''Turkish Delight'' (contemporary Turkish design) and ''Naqsh'' (Gender in Iranian Art and Society).

In 2008 part of the Keir Collection of [[Edmund de Unger]], formerly housed in his home in [[Ham, Surrey]], was placed on long-term loan to the Museum for an initial period of 15 years. One of the most important post-war private collections of Islamic art, it covers the entire Islamic world from medieval times to the eighteenth century and includes carpets, textiles, illuminated manuscripts, bookbindings, ceramics, metalware and rock crystal objects.

===The Middle East Museum ''(Vorderasiatisches Museum)''===
[[File:Assarhaddon Berlin 012008.jpg|thumb|[[Victory stele of Esarhaddon]]]]
{{main|Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin}}

The Middle East Museum exhibition displays objects found by German archeologists and others from the areas of [[Assyria]]n, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Babylonia]]n culture. Additionally there are historical buildings, reliefs and lesser cultural objects and jewelry.

The main display is the [[Ishtar Gate]] and the Processional Way of [[Babylon]] together with the throne room facade of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].

The Vorderasiatisches Museum also displays the Meissner fragment from the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

== Plans ==
The comprehensive plan for Museum Island includes an expansion of the Pergamon Museum, with connections to the [[Neues Museum]], [[Bodemuseum]], [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] and a new visitor centre, the [[James Simon Gallery]]. 

An architectural competition in 2000 was won by [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]] from [[Cologne]]. The Pergamon Museum will be redeveloped according to his plan, which controversially proposes large alterations to buildings unchanged since 1930. The current entrance building in the Court of Honor will be replaced with a fourth wing, and an underground walk (''ArchÃ¤ologische Promenade'', archeologic walk) will connect four of the five museums. &lt;ref name="musislpergamon"&gt;Masterplan Museumsinsel - A Projection into the Future "Pergamonmuseum" [https://www.museumsinsel-berlin.de/en/buildings/pergamonmuseum/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of September 2014 the museum is partially closed for renovation. The hall containing Pergamon Altar will remain closed to the general public. Initially the reopening was scheduled for 2019. &lt;ref name="artnet2014"&gt;Alexander Forbes "Berlinâs Pergamon Museum to Close until 2019, Joining Neue Nationalgalerie in Renovations" in "artnet news" on 19. February 2014. [https://news.artnet.com/art-world/berlins-pergamon-museum-to-close-until-2019-joining-neue-nationalgalerie-in-renovations-1520]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 it was revealed that the renovation would not be finished before 2023 and estimated project costs would almost double to 477 million euros. Two [[Pumping station|pump houses]] built in the ground during the initial construction between 1910 and 1930 had been discovered causing rising costs and delays. At least 60 million euros of the increased costs are directly due to the fact that construction costs had risen since the original estimate 10 years ago. Also it was announced that a temporary exhibition space will be built opposite Museum Island, a short distance from Pergamon Museum. It will house a [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] of the ancient city by the Berlin-based artist [[Yadegar Asisi]], a [[3D reconstruction]] of the famous Pergamon altar by the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] Institute for [[Computer Graphics]] Research and parts of the altar including the [[Pergamon_Altar#The_Telephus_frieze|Telephos Frieze]]. The temporary building is scheduled to open in the spring of 2018. &lt;ref name="dw2016"&gt;Stefan Dege "Berlin's Pergamon Museum will spend next eight years without its famous altar" at "Deutsche Welle" on 10.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Political Economy''' in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Most anthropologists moved away from modes of production analysis typical of structural Marxism, and focused instead on the complex historical relations of class, culture and hegemony in regions undergoing complex colonial and capitalist transitions in the emerging world system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161â85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161â85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Economy was introduced in American anthropology primarily through the support of [[Julian Steward]], a student of [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]]. Stewardâs research interests centered on âsubsistenceâ â the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at [[Columbia University]].  At this time, Columbia saw an influx of [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s who were attending school thanks to the [[GI Bill]]. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Eleanor Leacock]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Stanley Diamond]], Robert Manners, [[Morton Fried]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert F. Murphy]], and influenced other scholars such as [[Elman Service]], [[Marvin Harris]] and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161â85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutcgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=146â7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlins' work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161â85"/&gt;

More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==Theory==

===Cultural materialism===
{{main|Cultural materialism (anthropology)}}
Cultural materialism is a research orientation introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968 (''The Rise of Anthropological Theory''),&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |date=2001a |origyear=1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0132-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KySLTMqBFI2IvgOjtY0Y&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy. Indeed, it is said to be the most enduring achievement of that work.&lt;ref name=Margolis&gt;{{citation |year=2001 |last=Margolis |first=Maxine L |authorlink=Maxine Margolis |contribution=Introduction |editor=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |series=2001a |origyear=1968 |page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris subsequently developed a defense of the paradigm in his 1979 book ''Cultural Materialism''.&lt;ref name=Harris2001b&gt;{{citation |date=2001b |origyear=1979 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=Cultural Materialism: the Struggle for a Science of Culture |edition=Updated |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0134-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22materialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=meSKTIetFMu8cZOwyMkE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Harris, cultural materialism "is based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bpxv&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris' approach was influenced by but distinct from Marx. Harris' method was to demonstrate how particular cultural practices (like the Hindu prohibition on harming cattle) served a materialistic function (such as preserving an essential source of fertilizer from being consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars &amp; witches; the riddles of culture|year=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic behavior has a cultural side which indicates that the works of anthropologists is relevant to economics. The Motivation behind cultural materialism is mainly to show that cultures adapt to the environment they're produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Materialism and Institutional Economics|last=Jackson|first=William|publisher=Review of Social Economy|year=1996|isbn=|location=University of York|pages=225â227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural Marxism===
{{main|Structural Marxism}}
Structural Marxism was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and anthropologists outside France during the 1970s. French structuralist Marxism melded Marxist political economy with [[Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss|Levi-Strauss]]'s [[Structuralism|structural]] methodology, eliminating the human subject, dialectical reason and history in the process. Structural Marxists introduced two major concepts, mode of production and social formation, that allowed for a more prolonged and uneven transition to capitalism than either dependency or World systems theory allowed for.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161â85"/&gt; A [[mode of production]] consisting of producers, non-producers and [[means of production]], combined in a variety of ways, formed the deep structure of a "social formation." A social formation combined (or "articulated") several modes of production, only one of which was dominant or determinant. Primary anthropological theorists of this school included [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Claude Meillassoux]], Emmanuel Terray and Pierre-Philippe Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Chris Hann]]|first=[[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]]|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=73â4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s. In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural materialism===
Critical influences on Structural Marxism, primarily from the British Marxist historical tradition, included [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school was more interested in class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had little to say about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=172|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The anthropology of pre-capitalist societies ==
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumbnail|Dobe !Kung men lighting a fire.]]
{{main|Original affluent society}}
As anthropologists embraced "mode of production" analysis in the 1950s, they struggled to adapt its evolutionary model to the groups that they had traditionally worked with. While Marxist analysis was developed to account for capitalist society and its class dynamics, it had little to say about "pre-capitalist" societies, other than to define them by what they were not.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"/&gt; One of the first attempts to theorize [[Hunter-gatherer]] society was [[Marshall Sahlins]] ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972) which overturned nineteenth century ideas that characterized life in such societies as "nasty, brutish and short". Sahlins demonstrated that actual existing hunter-gatherers lived in "the original affluent society"; their needs were met with relatively little work leaving them with far more leisure time than western industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard B. Lee|Richard B. Lee's]] work amongst the [[ÇKung people|Dobe !Kung]] of Botswana provided a detailed case study of the argument, even in one of the most hostile desert environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Richard B.|title=The Dobe Ju/'hoansi 3rd edition|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth Thomson|location=Belmont CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of Sahlins' book applies Chayanov's theories to develop a theory of a "Domestic mode of production." Given the argument of the "original affluent society" that many of these societies had abundant resources, Sahlins argued that the limit on production was the amount of labour available. Young families with many dependent children had to work harder, whereas older families with mature children and many workers worked much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durrenberger|first=Paul|title=A Shower of Rain: Marshall Sahlins's Stone Age Economics Twenty-five years later|journal=Culture &amp; Agriculture|year=1998|volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=103â4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final sections developed a theory of reciprocity discussed above.

An alternate model of the Domestic Mode of Production was developed by Eric Wolf, who rejected the evolutionary implications of Sahlins' model and argued that this mode of production should be viewed as the product of developing colonial trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131â44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several collections addressing the question of mode of production analysis in classless societies came out in this period, including "''The Anthropology of Pre-Capitalist Societies''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joel Kahn|first=Joseph Llobera|title=The Anthropology of Pre-capitalist Societies|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Marxist Analysis and Social Anthropology''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice Bloch ed.|title=Marxist analysis and Social Anthropology|year=1975|publisher=Tavistock|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the state==
{{main|State formation}}
Political economists such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of [[Lewis H. Morgan]], and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

==Colonialism and imperialism==
[[File:Rhodes and Africa from Cairo to Cape Town.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cecil Rhodes, driving force of British imperialism in Africa]]

===Articulated modes of production===
The articulation of modes of production within a single formation was meant to account for the influence of colonialism on lineage modes of production, primarily in the African context. According to Hann and Hart, the short lived success of the theory was that

&lt;blockquote&gt;it produced a version of structural-functionalism at once sufficiently different from the original to persuade English-speakers that they were learning Marxism and similar enough to allow them to retain their customary way of thinking, which had been temporarily discredited by its role in the administration of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World-systems theory and dependency theory===
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}
Dependency Theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency Theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency Theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency Theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency Theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

Both versions of Dependency Theory were critiqued throughout the 1970s for the static historical accounts they provided. Their influence was slowly replaced by more dynamic and historically sensitive versions, such as Eric Wolf's "Europe and the People Without History."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=167|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Wolf and ''Europe and the people without history''===
{{main|Europe and the people without history}}
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumbnail|left|16th-century Portuguese (blue) and Spanish (white) trade routes]]
"Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades.  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American South and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127â9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-WorldContext.png|thumbnail|Maritime Fur Trade, 1790-1840.]]
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131â2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfree labour and slavery==
Liberal and neo-liberal market-based societies are predicated upon the concept of "free labour" - workers enter a labour market freely, and enter into contractual relations with employers voluntarily. "Unfree labour" - otherwise known as bond labour, debt bondage, debt peonage, and slavery, are thought to be archaic forms that will be eliminated with capitalist development. Anthropologists working in a wide variety of current situations have documented that the incidence of bonded labour is much greater than capitalist ideology would lead us to expect.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brass|first=Tom|title=Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labour: Case Studies and Debates|year=1999|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=349â51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Brass argues that unfree labour is not an archaic holdover in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"/&gt;

An early study of debt bondage was [[Ann Laura Stoler]]'s ''Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979'' (1985). Stoler examined the tobacco plantations of the Deli Maatschappij, one of the most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoler|first=Ann|title=Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Breman extended this analysis of the "Coolie regulation" (which allowed for indentured labour) to the Dutch mining industry in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breman|first=Jan|title=Taming the Coolie Beast : Plantation Society and the Colonial Order in Southeast Asia|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery is but one form of unfree (or bound) labour. Structural Marxists sought to theorize it as a mode of production. Claude Meillassoux has refined this approach in his study of pre-colonial African slavery. He analyzed the military and aristocratic systems that organized the capture of slaves and situated it within the politics of the merchants who organized the trade in slaves. His work focuses on the forces at play within a kinship organized polity that define slaves culturally as "anti-kin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Claude|title=The Anthropology of Slavery: The Womb of Iron and Gold|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant studies and agrarian change==

{{main|Alexander Chayanov}}

===Simple commodity production and the peasantry===
{{main|Simple commodity production}}
Simple commodity production (also known as "petty commodity production") is a term coined by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe productive activities under the conditions of what Marx had called the "simple exchange" of [[commodities]], where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The use of the word "simple" does not refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many ''different'' relations of production, ranging from [[self-employment]] where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of [[slavery]], [[peonage]], [[indentured labour]], and [[serfdom]].

===Capitalist transitions and agrarian change===
{{main|Anthropology of development}}
Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Columbia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Columbian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The Genesis of Capitalism Amongst a South American Peasantry: Devil's Labor and the Baptism of Money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130â155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasant wars of the twentieth century===
Written in 1969 by [[Eric Wolf]], ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century'', is a comparative view of the [[peasant]] [[revolution]]s of [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Algeria]], and [[Cuba]].

===The moral economy of the peasant===
The concept of a [[moral economy]] was first elaborated by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was developed further in anthropological studies of other peasant economies. Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to âset the priceâ of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional âfair priceâ was more important to the community than a âfreeâ market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentalitÃ© using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]
The concept was widely popularized in anthropology through the book, "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Rabia sign.svg|thumb|110px|right|''R4BIA'' sign]]

'''Rabaa or Rabbi'ah sign''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|r|ÉË|b|(|i|)|É|,_|Ë|r|Ã¦|-|,_|-|b|ÉË}}; {{IPA-arz|ËÉ¾ÉbÊÉ|lang}}; sometimes stylized as '''R4BIA''') or, less commonly, '''Rab3a''', is a [[hand gesture]] and a sign that first appeared in late August 2013, thought to be originated from [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/what-this-hand-gesture-means-for-egypts-future/279730/|title=What This Hand Gesture Means for Egypt's Future|last=Zelinsky|first=Nathaniel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in [[social media]] and protest marches in [[Egypt]]. It is used by the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] and its supporters in [[Egypt]] in the wake of the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'Ã©tat|overthrow]] of [[Mohamed Morsi]], which occurred after [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|anti-government protests]] calling for his removal.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; On July 9, 2014, a Brotherhood-affiliated organization declared August 14, the day when the sit-ins were dispersed, "World Rabia Day," in an attempt to garner support across numerous countries.&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2014/07/09/rabia-platform-declares-august-14-world-rabia-day |title= Rabia Platform Declares August 14 'World Rabia Day' |date= 9 July 2014 |accessdate= 15 August 2014 |work= Daily Sabah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign is named after the [[Rabaa al-Adawiya Square]] in [[Nasr City]], [[Cairo Governorate]], which surrounds the [[Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque]], where a sit-in was held by the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Morsi's inauguration. The sit-in lasted for about forty days before it was [[August 2013 Cairo sit-ins dispersal|dispersed]] by security forces, leading to clashes that resulted in 638 deaths, of which 43 were police officers.

Supporters state that the gesture is used to express solidarity with what they call "the thousands wounded, killed and burnt by the Egyptian Army" during the dispersal of their sit-in. The origin of the sign is unknown.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.voanews.com/content/egyptians-defiant-over-rabaa-symbol/1800249.html |title= Egyptians Defiant Over Use of 'Rabaa' Symbol |work= [[Voice of America]] |date= 29 November 2013 |accessdate= 13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Morsi Government allege that the sign implies indirect support for terrorism, due to the sign's use being mostly limited to persons supportive of the Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist organization by Egypt. On the other hand, supporters of the Brotherhood, whether inside or outside Egypt, believe the gesture represents freedom and persistence. They also deny any association with terrorism.&lt;ref name="voa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurier"&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6MST5IK5X |title= "Wir sind jetzt offiziell Terroristen": Die Jagd auf die MuslimbrÃ¼der |date= 28 December 2013 |accessdate= 7 May 2014 |work= {{lang|de|[[Kurier]]}} |url= http://kurier.at/politik/ausland/wir-sind-jetzt-offiziell-terroristen-die-jagd-auf-die-muslimbrueder/42.876.782 |archivedate= 7 January 2014 |first= {{lang|de|Karoline}} |last= {{lang|de|Krause}} |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian and non-Egyptian politicians, mostly supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood, are regularly seen making the Rabia gesture, which is identical to one common gesture for the number [[4 (number)|four]]. Among these politicians is Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]].&lt;ref name="worldbulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="habermonitor"/&gt;

The sit-ins comprised individuals supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were demanding the reinstatement of Morsi.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

===Sit-in dispersal===

On August 14, the [[Egyptian National Police]] dispersed the sit-in in Rabaa and a smaller one in Nahda. Initially, the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Interior Ministry]] had intended to peacefully evacuate the protesters with little to no force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-12/world/41299580_1_security-forces-anti-morsi-protesters-cairo|title=Pro-Morsi sit-ins gain strength, prompt Egypt to postpone dispersal to avoid bloodshed|newspaper=Washington Post|date=12 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz6EgEi8|archivedate=19 August 2013|accessdate= 12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dispersal resulted in violent clashes, which led to deaths among both sides.

[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]] alleged that the protesters at Rabaa owned dangerous weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://today.almasryalyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=392516 |title=ar:Ø¨ÙØ§Øº Ø±Ø³ÙÙ: Ø£Ø³ÙØ­Ø© ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙØ© ÙÙØ±Ø¨Ø© ÙÙ Ø³ÙØ±ÙØ§ ÙÙ "Ø±Ø§Ø¨Ø¹Ø© ÙØ§ÙÙÙØ¶Ø©"  |first1= Mohamed Talaat |last1= Dawoud |first2= Amro |last2= el-Tahamy |date= 6 August 2013 |accessdate= 15 August 2014 |work= [[Al-Masry Al-Youm]] |language= Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Human Rights Watch]] claimed that only firearms were observed, rather rarely, and that the protesters were â³overwhelmingly peaceful to be attacked in such a disproportionate and premeditated lethal way."&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/12/egypt-rab-killings-likely-crimes-against-humanity |title= Egypt: Rabaa Killings Likely Crimes against Humanity |date= 12 August 2014 |accessdate= 15 August 2014 |work= [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official death toll, according to the [[Egyptian Health Ministry]], was 638 deaths, of which 595 were protesters, and 3,994 injured, in addition to 43 police officers dead.&lt;ref name="ManarMohsen"&gt;{{cite news |first= Manar |last= Mohsen |url= http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/08/16/health-ministry-raises-death-toll-of-wednesdays-clashes-to-638 |title= Health Ministry raises death toll of Wednesday's clashes to 638 |work= [[Daily News Egypt]] |date= 16 August 2013 |accessdate= 12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/86476/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-forensic-team-says-August-raid-on-proMors.aspx |title= Egyptian forensic team says August raid on pro-Morsi camps killed 398 |date= 14 November 2013 |accessdate= 13 April 2014 |work= [[Al-Ahram|Ahram Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/dozens-killed-egypts-day-rage/story?id=19978145 |title= Dozens More Killed on Egypt's 'Day of Rage' |date= 16 August 2013 |accessdate= 25 February 2014 |work= [[ABC News]] |first= Molly |last= Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]], along with affiliated organizations, such as the [[Anti-Coup Alliance]] and the [[National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy]] claimed that 2,600 protesters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-14/hundredskilled-in-egypt-violence-fracturing-government.html |title= Egypt Brotherhood Torches Building as Death Toll Rises |work= [[Bloomberg News]] |date= 16 August 2013 |accessdate= 18 August 2013 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz6RQBHf |archivedate= 19 August 2013 |first1= Salma |last1= El Wardany |first2= Mariam |last2= Fam |first3= Ola |last3= Galal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the dispersal, violence occurred across Egypt, as retaliation against the security forces who dispersed the sit-ins.

In the 2014 report, [[Human Rights Watch]] said at least 1,150 demonstrators were killed in the dispersal, which, the organization said, probably amounts to "[[crimes against humanity]]."&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

==Appearance of the sign==

[[File:R4bia sign used in solidarity with victims of Rabaa crackdown 23-Aug-2013.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Rabia sign in a protest march, August 23, 2013.]]

After the [[August 2013 Rabaa massacre|sit-ins dispersal]], the Rabaa sign emerged widely in [[social media]] and protest marches in Egypt. Various reports place its origin in Turkey, not Egypt, and later performed by the [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] [[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/what-this-hand-gesture-means-for-egypts-future/279730/|title=What This Hand Gesture Means for Egypt's Future|last=Zelinsky|first=Nathaniel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the sign stemmed from the "Rabaa Al-Adawiya"  Mosque, located in Cairo, Nasr City. Rabaa(Ø±Ø§Ø¨Ø¹Ø©) is the Arabic word for "the 4th" which is believed to have influenced the 4 fingered raising gesture. The Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque and its surrounding streets, is where the Muslim Brotherhood members were protesting against the removal of the then Egyptian President Morsi, before they were violently removed by the Egyptian military.

===Meaning===

The sign is used as part of the protests against the government.

The colors used in the graphical sign, the yellow and black, respectively resemble the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], and the [[Kiswah]] of the [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref name="r4bia.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.r4bia.com/en/content/how-did-r4bia-emerge |title= How Did R4bia Emerge|publisher=R4bia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===

The namesake of the sign is the [[Rabaa al-Adawiya Square]] in [[Nasr City]], [[Cairo Governorate]], where Brotherhood affiliates held a sit-in. The square is named after the Muslim saint [[Rabia Al-Adawiyya]]. The name ''Rabia'' in Arabic means 'fourth' (singular feminine), hence the four-fingered hand gesture.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r4bia.com"/&gt;

===Gesture===

The gesture is identical to a gesture for the [[4 (number)|number four]], and is made by raising four fingers of either hand (preferably the right hand) and folding the thumb.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/115243/rabaa-sign-becomes-the-symbol-of-massacre-in-egypt |title= 'Rabaa sign' becomes the symbol of massacre in Egypt |date= 18 August 2013 |accessdate= 7 July 2014 |work= Worldbulletin News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Politics===

[[File:Erdogan gesturing Rabia.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan|ErdoÄan]] performing the Rabaa gesture.]]

The Rabia sign and gesture has influenced certain political and social levels among, both in [[Egypt]] and in particular, Turkey. The President of [[Turkey]], [[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan|ErdoÄan]], and his supporters, has been seen in several conferences and speeches making Rabia gestures.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="habermonitor"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.habermonitor.com/en/haber/detay/erdogan-salutes-r4bia/162341 |title= Erdogan salutes R4BIA |work= {{lang|tr|Haber MonÄ±tÃ¶r'de}} |date= 17 August 2013 |accessdate= 7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor of [[Istanbul]], [[Kadir TopbaÅ]], announced days after the dispersals in August 2013 at an opening ceremony of the [[DÃ¶rtyol]] Square in the district of [[Esenler]], that he wanted to rename it to âRabia Square.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dtj-online.de/fener-star-und-polat-alemdar-solidarisieren-sich-mit-agyptischem-volk-2896 |title= Fener-Star und Polat Alemdar solidarisieren sich mit Ã¤gyptischem Volk |date= 19 August 2013 |accessdate= 7 May 2014 |work= {{lang|de|Deutsch TÃ¼rkisches Journal}} |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/24552617.asp |title= Esenler DÃ¶rtyol, Rabia MeydanÄ± olsun |date= 20 August 2013 |accessdate= 7 May 2014 |work= {{lang|tr|[[HÃ¼rriyet]]}} |first= {{lang|tr|EyÃ¼p}} |last= {{lang|tr|Serbest}} |language= Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian [[kung fu]] champion Mohamed Youssef was wearing a T-shirt with the Rabia sign on it after winning the gold medal at the 2013 Kung Fu World Championship in [[Russia]]; this led to harsh criticism in anti-Brotherhood media and a subsequent one-year ban by the national kung fu federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/egypt-kung-fu-champion-suspended-pro-morsi-t-shirt |title= Egypt kung fu champion suspended for wearing pro-Mohamed Morsi T-shirt |first= Patrick |last= Kingsley |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 29 October 2013 |accessdate= 13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian [[Association football|soccer player]] [[Ahmed Abd El-Zaher]] also celebrated one of his goals by making the Rabia gesture, which led to his subsequent suspension from the 2013 [[FIFA Club World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/middle-east-in-turmoil/egyptian-footballer-ahmed-abdel-zaher-suspended-for-pro-morsi-salute/story-fn7ycml4-1226758723844 |title= Egyptian footballer Ahmed Abdel Zaher suspended for pro-Morsi salute |work= [[The Australian]] |date= 13 November 2013 |accessdate= 13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 2013, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] was designated a [[terrorist organization]] in Egypt.

German journalist Thorsten Gerald Schneiders claimed that "[t]he [Rabia sign] is already out of the Islamist spectrum, and has no relation with Islamic radicalism. Its meaning has extended to protesting against dictatorship and tyranny in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6MST5IK5X |title= R4BIA-SYMBOL: "EIN SKANDAL IST ES NICHT" |url= http://prenzlauerberg-nachrichten.de/alltag/_/r4abia-islam-salsabil-kein-skandal-171437.html |date= 15 January 2014 |accessdate= 7 May 2014 |work= {{lang|de|Prenzlauer Berg Nachrichten}} |archivedate= 15 January 2014 |first= {{lang|de|Christiane}} |last= {{lang|de|Abelein}} |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6MeKFCha7 |title= R4BIA - ZEICHEN HAT BEDEUTUNGSERWEITERUNG ERFAHREN - Teil 2 von "Ein Skandal ist das nicht" |url= http://www.prenzlauerberg-nachrichten.de/_/r4abia-zeichen-hat-bedeutungserweiterung-erfa-171438.html |date= 15 January 2014 |accessdate= 7 May 2014 |work= {{lang|de|Prenzlauer Berg Nachrichten}} |archivedate= 15 January 2014 |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to America, Khalidi spent two years teaching at [[Columbia University]] before joining the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1987, where he spent eight years as a professor and director of both the [[Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago|Center for Middle Eastern Studies]] and the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name ="Wolf"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gulf War]], while teaching at Chicago, Khalidi emerged "as one of the most influential commentators from within Middle Eastern Studies".&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Martin, Ivory Towers on Sand, Washington, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, 2001, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 he joined the faculty of Columbia University, where he currently serves as the [[Edward Said]] Professor of Modern Arab Studies.

==Academic work==
Khalidi's research covers primarily the [[History of the Middle East|history of]] the modern [[Middle East]]. He focuses on the countries of the southern and [[eastern Mediterranean]], with an eye to the emergence of various national identities and the role played by external powers in their development. He also researches the impact of the press on forming new senses of community, the role of education in the construction of political identity, and in the way narratives have developed over the past centuries in the region.&lt;ref name = "MEICV"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} Michael C. Hudson, director of the [[Center for Contemporary Arab Studies]] at Georgetown, describes Khalidi as "preeminent in his field".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22577-2004May12.html "The Knowledge That Doesn't Equal Power"], By Philip Kennicott. ''The Washington Post'', 5/13/2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] in 1994 and is currently the editor of the ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucpressjournals.com/journal.asp?j=jps&amp;jDetail=editorial University of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011182701/http://ucpressjournals.com/journal.asp?j=jps&amp;jDetail=editorial |date=2007-10-11 }} ''Journal of Palestine Studies'' current editorial staff. (retrieved January 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Khalidi's scholarly work in the 1990s focused on the historical construction of nationalism in the Arab world. Drawing on the work of theorist [[Benedict Anderson]] who described nations as "[[imagined communities]]", he does not posit primordial national identities, but argues that these nations have legitimacy and rights. In ''Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness'' (1997), he places the emergence of Palestinian national identity in the context of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and British colonialism as well as the early [[Zionism|Zionist effort]] in the [[Levant]]. ''Palestinian Identity'' won the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America|Middle East Studies Association]]'s top honor, the [[Albert Hourani Book Award]] as best book of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mesa.wns.ccit.arizona.edu/excellence/hourani_winners_list.htm Albert Hourani Book Award Recipients, 1991-2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815195159/http://mesa.wns.ccit.arizona.edu/excellence/hourani_winners_list.htm |date=2007-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His dating of the emergence of Palestinian nationalism to the early 20th century and his tracing of its contours provide a rejoinder to Israeli nationalist claims that Palestinians had no collective claims prior to the 1948 creation of Israel. His signature work, ''Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness'' (Columbia University Press, 1997), argues that Arabs living in Palestine began to regard themselves as a distinct people decades before 1948, "and that the struggle against Zionism does not by itself sufficiently explain Palestinian nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i26/26b00601.htm or http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/marxism/2009-March/045483.html ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]''] "Rashid Khalidi's Balancing Act: The Middle-East scholar courts controversy with his Palestinian advocacy" by Evan R. Goldstein March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, Khalidi also describes the late development, failings and internal divisions within the various elements of the Palestinian nationalist movement.

In ''Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints and America's Perilous Path in the Middle East'' (2004), Khalidi takes readers on a historical tour of Western involvement in the Middle East, and argues that these interactions continue to have a [[colonialism|colonialist]] nature that is both morally unacceptable and likely to backfire. Khalidi's book, ''Sowing Crisis'', places the [[United States]] approach to the Middle East in historical context. He is sharply critical of U.S. policies during the [[Cold War]], writing that Cold War policies "formulated to oppose the Soviets, consistently undermined democracy and exacerbated tensions in the Middle East".&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i26/26b00601.htm] and [http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/marxism/2009-March/045483.html] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' "Rashid Khalidi's Balancing Act: The Middle-East scholar courts controversy with his Palestinian advocacy" by Evan R. Goldstein March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalidi has written, "It may seem hard to believe today, but for decades the United States was in fact a major patron, indeed in some respects ''the'' major patron, of earlier incarnations" of radical, militant Islam, in order to use all possible resources in waging the [[Cold War]]. He adds, "The Cold War was over, but its tragic sequels, its toxic debris, and its unexploded mines continued to cause great harm, in ways largely unrecognized in American discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, Rashid. ''Sowing crisis: the Cold War and American dominance in the Middle East''. 2009, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and Israeli Ambassador to the United States [[Michael Oren]] has stated that "Khalidi is mainstream" because "the stream itself has changed. The criteria for scholarship have become very political."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi's Balancing Act: The Middle-East scholar courts controversy with his Palestinian advocacy, Evan Goldstein, ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', March 6, 2009 [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i26/26b00601.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Palestinian Identity''===
''Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness'' (1997), is Khalidi's most influential and most widely cited book. In ''Palestinian Identity,'' Khalidi demonstrates that a Palestinian national consciousness had it origins near the beginning of the twentieth century. Khalidi describes the Arab population of British Mandatory Palestine as having "overlapping identities", with some or many expressing loyalties to villages, regions, a projected nation of Palestine, an alternative of inclusion in a [[Greater Syria]], an Arab national project, as well as to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism'', Michael Provence, University of Texas Press, 2005, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Palestinian Identity'' was the first to demonstrate substantive [[Palestinian nationalism]] in the early Mandatory period. Khalidi writes, "Local patriotism could not yet be described as nation-state nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, Palestinian Identity. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalidi emphasized in his work that the Palestinian identity had been fundamentally fluid and changing, woven from multiple "narratives" due to individual and family experiences. He described the identity as organically developed due to the challenges of peasants forced from their homes due to Zionist immigrant pressure, but with [[Palestinian nationalism]] also being far more complex than merely an anti-Zionist reaction. Praise for his book appeared in the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', with reviewer [[William B. Quandt]] viewing the work as "a major contribution to historical understanding of Palestinian nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/52996/william-b-quandt/palestinian-identity-the-construction-of-modern-national-conscio | title=Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness| journal=Foreign Affairs| issue=May/June 1997| date=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalidi also documents active opposition by the Arab press to [[Zionism]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Army of Shadows, Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917â1948]],'' [[Hillel Cohen]] University of California Press, 2008, p. 275, n.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to ''The Iron Cage''===

====Praise====
In a review of Khalidi's ''The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood'', for ''[[Middle East Policy]]'', Philip Wilcox praised "Khalidi's brilliant inquiry into why Palestinians have failed to win a state of their own" calling the book "a welcome antidote to the propaganda and mythology that still dominate American discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=Philip C.|journal=Middle East Policy|date=5 April 2007 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=142â176|title=Spring 2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4967.2007.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]] said the book "brilliantly analyses the structural handicap which hobbled the Palestinians throughout 30 years of British rule".&lt;ref name=GnIB&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Ian|title=Divided loyalties: Ian Black wades into the troubled history of the Middle East with four books on Palestine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/17/politics|accessdate=2012-10-15|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', Jonathan Shainin wrote that "''The Iron Cage'' is a patient and eloquent work, ranging over the whole of modern Palestinian history from World War I to the death of Yasser Arafat."&lt;ref name=SnJS&gt;{{cite news|last=Shainin|first=Jonathan|title=Nation Building|url=http://www.salon.com/2006/12/18/khalidi/|accessdate=2012-10-15|newspaper=Salon|date=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', [[L. Carl Brown]] wrote that "Khalidi's book is no exercise in victimology. He is tough on the British, the Israelis, and the Americans, but he is scarcely less hard-hitting in appraising the Palestinians". He went on to praise the final chapter's "excellent critique" of the development of the [[PLO]]'s positions towards Israel and the [[Two-state solution]].&lt;ref name=FPLBrown&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=L.

====Criticism====
''New York Times'' columnist [[Clyde Haberman]] said of Khalidi's book ''The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood'': "But he makes this more than an exercise in self-pity by refusing to let the Palestinians themselves off the hook. If they indeed live in an iron cage, well, Khalidi says, they helped mold the bars themselves" and asks "When he talks about repressive Israeli measures having been 'sometimes imposed on the pretext of security,' critics are bound to ask: What pretext? How many suicide bombings of cafes and pizza shops does it take before a country has a right to end them by any method that seems to work?" &lt;ref name = "Haber"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Efraim Karsh]] said about the same book "One would have hoped that after 80 years of stubborn adherence to the 'one-state solution' and an equally adamant rejection of the 'two-state solution,' which have resulted in Palestinian statelessness, all but the most fanatically self-deluded would grasp the root causes of the Palestinian debacle â not least a historian purporting to redress the 'continuing refusal to look honestly at what has happened in this small land over the past century or so.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/iron-illusions-of-rashid-khalidi/45182/ | title=The Iron Illusions of Rashid Khalidi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==

Khalidi has written dozens of scholarly articles on Middle East history and politics, as well as op-ed pieces in many U.S. newspapers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} He has also been a guest on radio and TV shows including ''[[All Things Considered]]'', ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', ''[[Morning Edition]]'', ''[[Worldview (radio show)|Worldview]]'', ''[[The News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'', ''[[Charlie Rose]]'', and ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', and has appeared on the [[BBC]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[France Inter]] and the [[Voice of America]]. He served as president of the American Committee on Jerusalem, now known as the [[American Task Force on Palestine]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Views on IsraeliâPalestinian conflict===

Khalidi has written that the establishment of the state of Israel resulted in "the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|uprooting]] of the world's oldest and most secure Jewish communities, which had found in the Arab lands a tolerance that, albeit imperfect, was nonexistent in the often genocidal, Jew-hating Christian West." Regarding the proposed [[two-state solution]] to the IsraelâPalestinian conflict, Khalidi has written that "the now universally applauded two-state solution faces the juggernaut of Israel's actions in the occupied territories over more than forty years, actions that have been expressly designed to make its realization in any meaningful form impossible." However, Khalidi also noted that "there are also flaws in the alternatives, grouped under the rubric of the [[one-state solution]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080526/khalidi Palestine: Liberation Deferred] by Rashid Khalidi, ''The Nation'', May 8, 2008 (retrieved October 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He supports the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement.&lt;ref name="BDS"&gt;{{cite news|title=40 Columbia University professors sign BDS petition|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/03/01/news-opinion/united-states/40-columbia-profs-sign-bds-petition|accessdate=2 February 2017|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding American support for Israel, Khalidi stated in an interview, "every other single place on the face of the earth is in support of the Palestinians, yet all of them together aren't a hill of beans compared to the United States and Israel, because the United States and Israel can basically do anything they please. They are the world superpower, they are the regional superpower."&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429164850/http://www.sonic.net/~doretk/Issues/01-03-SPR/thecrisis.html |date=April 29, 2008 |title="The Crisis of our Times - Nationalism, Identity, and the Future of Israel-Palestine" }}, Interview with Rashid Khalidi, ''North Coast Xpress'', Spring 2001.

A ''[[New York Sun]]'' editorial criticized Khalidi for stating that there is a legal right under international law for Palestinians to resist Israeli occupation.&lt;ref name = "NYSunRoR"&gt;{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a speech given to the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]], Khalidi said, "[k]illing civilians is a war crime. It's a violation of international law. They are not soldiers. They're civilians, they're unarmed. The ones who are armed, the ones who are soldiers, the ones who are in occupation, that's different. That's resistance."&lt;ref name = "NYSunRoR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The [http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=355 ADC transcript of Khalidi's speech] has been edited, and has sections missing. Thus, it cannot be used for verification.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sun'' editorial argued that by failing to distinguish between Palestinian combatants and noncombatants, Khalidi implies that all Palestinians have this right to resist, which it claimed was incorrect under international law.&lt;ref name = "NYSunRoR" /&gt; In an interview discussing this editorial, Khalidi objected to this characterization as incorrect and taken out of the context of his statements on international law.&lt;ref name = "NYSunRoR"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalidi has described discussions of Arab restitution for property confiscated from the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|Jewish refugees]] from Middle Eastern and North African countries after the creation of [[Israel]] as "insidious", "because the advocates of Jewish refugees are not working to get those legitimate assets back but are in fact trying to cancel out the debt of Israel toward Palestinian refugees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision, Columbia University president [[Lee Bollinger]] spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: "The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts."&lt;ref name = "PurnickNYT" /&gt;

===2008 U.S. presidential campaign===

Consequent to publication by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' of an article about Obama's attendance at a 2003 farewell dinner for Khalidi, their relationship became an issue in the campaign.&lt;ref name = "LAT-041008"&gt;{{cite news

'''Roman Charity''' (Latin '''''Caritas romana'''''; Italian '''''CaritÃ  Romana''''') is the [[Exemplum|exemplary story]] of a woman, Pero, who secretly [[breastfeeding|breastfeeds]] her father, Cimon, after he is incarcerated and sentenced to death by starvation. &lt;ref&gt;"Iconographical sources of nursing and nursing gestures in Christian cultures," [http://www.darkfiber.com/pz/chapter3.html Darkfiber.com], last visited 29 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The story is recorded in ''[[Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium]]'' (Nine Books of Memorable Acts and Sayings of the Ancient Romans)&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 5.4.7&lt;/ref&gt; by the ancient Roman historian [[Valerius Maximus]], and was presented as a great act of ''[[pietas]]'' (i.e., filial piety) and Roman honour. A painting in the [[Pietas (goddess)|Temple of Pietas]] depicted the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beagon, ''The [[Pliny the Elder|Elder Pliny]] on the Human Animal:'' [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' Book 7'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 314 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrP5hEO5qCgC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=%22The+theme,+of+a+woman+giving+her+milk+to+an+aged+parent%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20theme%2C%20of%20a%20woman%20giving%20her%20milk%20to%20an%20aged%20parent%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among Romans, the theme had mythological echoes in [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s breastfeeding of the adult [[Hercules]], an [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan myth]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Thomson de Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), pp. 83â84.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghent relief.jpg|left|thumb|''Mammelokker'', [[Belfry of Ghent]]]]

The story of Cimon is predated, however, by an almost identical story recorded by Roman historian Valerius Maximus, later retold by Pliny the Elder (23-79), of a jailed plebeian woman who was nursed by her daughter.&lt;ref name="Yalom (2013)"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yalom |first=Marilyn |author-link=Marilyn Yalom |title=Roman Charity |date=April 10, 2013 |newspaper=[[New York Times Book Review]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/books/review/roman-charity.html |access-date=March 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180318232011/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/books/review/roman-charity.html |archive-date=March 18, 2018 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians note that Renaissance and Baroque depictions have more incestuous overtones.{{r|Yalom (2013)}}

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, many European artists depicted the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. [http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=135448 Cimon and Pero: "Roman Charity." Jean-Baptiste Greuze.], last visited 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] is known to have painted several versions. [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] artist [[Caravaggio]] also featured the scene in his work from 1606, ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] depictions tended to be more subdued.&lt;ref&gt;Shearer West, "Guide To Art." Bloomsbury, 1996 [http://www.bloomsbury.com/ARC/detail.asp?EntryID=98329&amp;bid=1, Bloomsbury.com], accessed 29 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The original legend does not mention Pero's child. This element was introduced in the 17th century in order to prevent an interpretation that there was something incestuous about the deed. At the same time the inclusion of the infant added a new level of meaning to the story as the three figures would represent the three generations and could therefore also be interpreted as an allegory of the three ages of man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kmska.be/en/collectie/highlights/CimonenPero.html JerÃ´me Duquesnoy (attributed to Artus Quellinus the Elder), ''Caritas Romana''] at the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Antwerp]]&lt;/ref&gt; A small annex to the [[Belfry of Ghent]] dating from 1741, included a sculpture of Roman Charity poised high above the front doorway.  It is referred to as 'mammelokker', which translates from Dutch as 'breast sucker'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artoria.be/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Engelse-flyer.pdf The Belfort of Gent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century a fictional account of Roman Charity was presented in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;Steinbeck, John. [https://archive.org/download/grapesofwrath030650mbp/grapesofwrath030650mbp.pdf ''The Grapes Of Wrath''.] New York: Viking Press, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the novel, Rosasharn (Rose of Sharon) nurses a sick and starving man in the corner of a barn. The 1969 painting ''[[Partisan Ballad]]'' by [[Mai Dantsig]] also echoes Roman Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artrusse.uk/collection/artwork/partisan-ballade|title=Partisan ballade 1969 |publisher=Art Russe| accessdate =10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1973 surrealist film ''[[O Lucky Man!]]'' also contains a scene of Roman Charity when the protagonist is starving and a vicar's wife nurses him rather than let him plunder the food gathered for an offering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070464/synopsis?ref_=tt_stry_pl&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ronald Reagan Freedom Award''' is the highest civilian honor bestowed by the private [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation]].  The award is given to "those who have made monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide."&lt;ref name="The Ronald Reagan Freedom Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/programs/cpa/awards.asp |title=The Ronald Reagan Freedom Award |accessdate=2007-02-24 |publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016075344/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/programs/cpa/awards.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until her death, the award was given by Former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] on behalf of her husband, who died in June 2004.  The award was first given in 1992, by President [[Ronald Reagan]] himself, as well as in 1993, but in 1994 Mrs. Reagan presented the award instead of her husband. Ronald Reagan had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] a few months before, and was not able to attend the ceremony.

In order to receive the award, the potential recipient must "have made monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide," as well as "embody President Reagan's lifelong belief that one man or woman truly can make a difference."&lt;ref name="The Ronald Reagan Freedom Award"/&gt;

== Recipients ==
Former President [[George H. W. Bush]], who was awarded the medal on February 6, 2007, which would have been Ronald Reagan's 96th birthday, remarked, "I wish I had a little Ronald Reagan in me when it came to communicating with the American people. Had I been blessed with my predecessor's remarkable skill, who knows? I might still be employed." On a more serious note, he said later in the speech: "Working with Ronald Reagan was one of the greatest joys of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020700141.html |title=Ex-President Bush Receives Reagan Award |accessdate=2007-02-24 |date=February 7, 2007 |last=Nguyen |first=Daisy |work=[[The Washington Post]] |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush served as Reagan's [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] for the eight years that Reagan was [[President of the United States|President]].  
 
On September 17, 2008, the award was presented to former Soviet dissident [[Natan Sharansky]] by former first lady Nancy Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/sep/18/from-soviet-gulag-to-reagan-honor/ |title=From Soviet gulag to Reagan honor |accessdate=2008-09-18 |work=The Ventura County Star |last=Collins |first=Michael |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918062408/http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/sep/18/from-soviet-gulag-to-reagan-honor/ |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scriptorium''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-scriptorium.ogg|s|k|r|Éª|p|Ë|t|ÉËr|i|É|m}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|scriptorium|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European [[monasteries]] devoted to the writing, copying and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] of manuscripts by monastic [[scribe]]s.

== The functional outset ==
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|This late 15th-century miniature of [[Jean MiÃ©lot]] (died 1472)&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 
depicts the author at work: perhaps his ''Miracles de Nostre Dame'', in which this miniature appears.]]

When monastic institutions arose in the early 6th century (the first European monastic writing dates from 517), they defined European literary culture and selectively preserved the literary history of the West. Monks copied Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible and the commentaries and letters of early Church Fathers for missionary purposes as well as for use within the monastery.

In the copying process, there was typically a division of labor between the monks who readied the parchment for copying by smoothing and chalking the surface, those who ruled the parchment and copied the text, and those who illuminated the text. Sometimes a single monk would engage in all of these stages to prepare a manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Shailor, ''The Medieval Book'', (Toronto: U Toronto Press, 1991), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators of manuscripts]] worked in collaboration with scribes in intricate varieties of interaction that preclude any simple understanding of monastic manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Aliza Muslin-Cohen, ''A Medieval Scriptorium: St. maria Magdalena de Frankenthal'' series WolfenbÃ¼ttler Mittelalter Studien (Wiesbaden) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the monasteries provided a valuable medium of exchange.
Comparisons of characteristic regional, periodic as well as contextual styles of [[handwriting]] do reveal social and cultural connections among them, as new hands developed and were disseminated by travelling individuals, respectively what these individuals represented, and by the examples of manuscripts that passed from one cloister to another. 
Recent studies follow the approach, that ''scriptoria'' developed in relative isolation, to the extent that the [[Paleography|paleographer]] is sometimes able to identify the product of each writing centre and to date it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;
McKitterick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 13th century secular workshops developed,&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 
where professional scribes stood at writing-desks to work the orders of customers, and during the [[Late Middle Ages]] the praxis of writing was becoming not only confined to being generally a monastic or regal activity. However, the practical consequences of private workshops, and as well the invention of the [[printing press]] vis-a-vis monastic ''scriptoria'' is a complex theme.&lt;ref&gt;
for example, cf. De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The physical scriptorium==

Much as medieval libraries do not correspond to the exalted sketches from [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Name of the Rose,â&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/library-or-labyrinth/ "Library or labyrinth" Irene OâDaly. January 11, 2013 (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
it seems that ancient written accounts, as well as surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations do not invariably attest to the evidence of scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/pondering-the-physical-scriptorium/ "Pondering the physical scriptorium" Jenneka Janzen. January 25, 2013 by medievalfragments (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scriptoria in the physical sense of a room set aside for the purpose perhaps mostly existed in response to specific scribal projects; for example, when a monastic (and) or regal institution wished a large number of texts copied.

References in modern scholarly writings to 'scriptoria' typically refer to the collective written output of a monastery, 
somewhat like the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] in the early regal times is taken to refer to a specific fashion of modelling formulars, 
but especially traditional is the view that scriptoria was a necessary adjunct to a library, as per the entry in du Cange, 1678 'scriptorium'.&lt;ref&gt;

===San Giovanni Evangelista, Rimini===
At this church whose patron was [[Galla Placidia]] (died 450), paired rectangular chambers flanking the apse, accessible only from each aisle, have been interpreted as paired (Latin and Greek) libraries and perhaps scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Charlotte Smith, "The Side Chambers of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna: Church Libraries of the Fifth Century" ''Gesta,'' '''29'''.1 (1990): 86â97)&lt;/ref&gt; The well-lit niches .5 meter deep, provisions for [[hypocaust]]s beneath the floors to keep the spaces dry, have prototypes in the architecture of Roman libraries.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mackowiecka, ''The Origin and the Evolution of the Architectural Forms of the Roman Library'' (Warsaw) 1978, noted by Smith 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassiodorus and the Vivarium===
The monastery built in the second quarter of the 6th century under the supervision of [[Cassiodorus]] at the Vivarium near [[Squillace]] in southern Italy contained a scriptorium, for the purpose of collecting, copying, and preserving texts.

Cassiodorus' description of his monastery contained a purpose-built scriptorium, with self-feeding{{clarify|date=February 2016}} oil lamps, a [[sundial]], and a [[water-clock]]. The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, as well as the necessary ink wells, penknives, and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, at the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|end of the Roman Empire]], he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts. In the end, however, the library at the Vivarium was dispersed and lost, though it was still active around 630.&lt;ref name=JNormanVivarium&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Jeremy|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium (Circa 560)|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=204|website=HistoryofInformation.com|publisher=Jeremy Norman &amp; Co., Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
The scriptoria of the [[Cistercian]] order seem to have been similar to those of the Benedictines. The mother house at [[CÃ®teaux]], one of the best-documented high-medieval scriptoria, developed a severe "house style" in the first half of the 12th century. 
The 12th-century scriptorium of [[CÃ®teaux]] and its products, in the context of Cistercian scriptoria, have been studied by Yolanta ZaÅuska, ''L'enluminure et le scriptorium de CÃ®teaux au XIIe siÃ¨cle'' (Brecht:CÃ®teaux) 1989.

== Institutions ==
In [[Byzantium]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] learning maintained importance and numerous monastic 'scriptoria' were known for producing Bible/Gospel illuminations, along with workshops that copied numerous classical and Hellenistic works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that one such monastic community was that of [[Mount Athos]], which maintained a variety of illuminated manuscripts and ultimately accumulated over 10,000 books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Benedictines===
Cassiodorus' contemporary, [[Benedict of Nursia]], allowed his monks to read the great works of the pagans in the monastery he founded at [[Monte Cassino]] in 529. The creation of a library here initiated the tradition of Benedictine scriptoria, where the copying of texts not only provided materials needed in the routines of the community and served as work for hands and minds otherwise idle, but also produced a marketable end-product. Saint [[Jerome]] stated that the products of the scriptorium could be a source of revenue for the monastic community, but Benedict cautioned, "If there be skilled workmen in the monastery, let them work at their art in all humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 57, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch57 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Benedictine monasteries, the writing room was actually a corridor open to the central quadrangle of the [[cloister]].&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/03script.html#location OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The space could accommodate about twelve monks, who were protected from the elements only by the wall behind them and the vaulting above. Monasteries built later in the Middle Ages placed the scriptorium inside, near the heat of the kitchen or next to the [[calefactory]]. The warmth of the later scriptoria served as an incentive for unwilling monks to work on the transcription of texts (since the charter house was rarely heated).

====St. Gall====
The Benedictine [[Plan of St. Gall]] is a sketch of an idealised monastery dating from 819â826, which shows the scriptorium and library attached to the northeast corner of the main body of the church; this is not reflected by the evidence of surviving monasteries. Although the purpose of the plan is unknown, it clearly shows the desirability of scriptoria within a wider body of monastic structures at the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Murray, ''After Rome's Fall,'' (Toronto: University Toronto Press, 1998), pp. 262, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
There is evidence that in the late 13th century, the Cistercians would allow certain monks to perform their writing in a small cell "which could not... contain more than one person".&lt;ref&gt;George Haven Putnam, ''Books and their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), 405.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were called scriptoria because of the copying done there, even though their primary function was not as a writing room.

===Carthusians===
The [[Carthusian]]s viewed copying religious texts as their missionary work to the greater [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]; the strict solitude of the Carthusian order necessitated that the manual labor of the monks be practiced within their individual cells, thus many monks engaged in the transcription of texts. In fact, each cell was equipped as a copy room, with parchment, quill, inkwell, and ruler. Guigues du Pin, or Guigo, the architect of the order, cautioned, "Let the brethren take care the books they receive from the cupboard do not get soiled with smoke or dirt; books are as it were the everlasting food of our souls; we wish them to be most carefully kept and most zealously made."&lt;ref&gt;C.H.Lawrence, ''Medieval Monasticism'', Ed.2 (London &amp; New York: Longman, 1989) 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Orthodox church===

====The Resava====

After the establishment of [[Manasija]] Monastery by [[Stefan LazareviÄ]] in the early 15th century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox [[Balkans]]. One of the most famous scholars of the so-called School of Resava was Constantine the Philosopher /Konstantin Filozof/, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school (Stefan LazareviÄ).

====RaÄa====
During the Turkish invasions of the Serbian lands (which lasted from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 19th centuries) the monastery was an important centre of culture. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced by monk-scribes, mostly Serbian liturgical books and Old Serbian ''Vita.'' [[hagiographies]] of kings and archbishops.

Numerous scribes of the Serbian Orthodox Church booksâat the term of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th centuriesâwho worked in the [[RaÄa monastery]] are named in Serbian literature â "The RaÄans". . Among the monk-scribes the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor RaÄanin, [[Kiprijan RaÄanin]], [[Jerotej RaÄanin]], [[Teodor RaÄanin]] and [[Gavril StefanoviÄ VencloviÄ]]. These are well-known Serbian monks and writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval ([[Late Middle Ages]]) and [[Baroque]] periods in art, architecture and literature in particular.

==Monastic rules==

===Cassiodorus' ''Institutes''===
Although it is not a monastic rule as such, [[Cassiodorus]] did write his ''[[Institutes]]'' as a teaching guide for the monks at Vivarium, the monastery he founded on his family's land in southern Italy. A classically educated Roman convert, Cassiodorus wrote extensively on scribal practices. He cautions over-zealous scribes to check their copies against ancient, trustworthy [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplars]] and to take care not to change the inspired words of scripture because of grammatical or stylistic concerns. He declared "every work of the Lord written by the scribe is a wound inflicted on Satan", for "by reading the Divine Scripture he wholesomely instructs his own mind and by copying the precepts of the Lord he spreads them far and wide".&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, Institutes, I, xxx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Cassiodorus did include the classical texts of ancient Rome and Greece in the monastic library. This was probably because of his upbringing, but was, nonetheless, unusual for a monastery of the time. When his monks copied these texts, Cassiodorus encouraged them to amend texts for both grammar and style.&lt;ref&gt;James O. O'Donnell, ''Cassiodorus,'' University of Californian Press, 1979. Postprint online (1995), [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html Upenn.edu], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Benedict===
The more famous monastic treatise of the 7th century, Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]], fails to mention the labor of transcription by name, though his institution, the monastery of [[Montecassino]], developed one of the most influential scriptoria, at its acme in the 11th century, which made the abbey "the greatest center of book production in South Italy in the High Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1999:3; the scriptorium is fully examined in Francis Newton, ''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058â1105'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Here was developed and perfected the characteristic "Cassinese" [[Beneventan script]] under [[Desiderius of Montecassino|Abbot Desiderius]].

The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] does explicitly call for monks to have ready access to books during two hours of compulsory daily reading and during [[Lent]], when each monk is to read a book in its entirety.&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 48, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch48 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus each monastery was to have its own extensive collection of books, to be housed either in [[armarium]] (book chests) or a more traditional library. However, because the only way to obtain a large quantity of books in the [[Middle Ages]] was to copy them, in practice this meant that the monastery had to have a way to transcribe texts in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Haven Putnam, ''Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative translation of Benedict's strict guidelines for the oratory as a place for silent, reverent prayer actually hints at the existence of a scriptorium. In Chapter 52 of his Rule, Benedict's warns: "Let the oratory be what it is called, and let nothing else be done or stored there".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 52, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch52 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''condatur'' translates both as ''stored'' and ''to compose or write,'' thus leaving the question of Benedict's intentions for manuscript production ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/07script.html#rules OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commentaries on the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] describe the labor of transcription as the common occupation of the community, so it is also possible that Benedict failed to mention the scriptorium by name because of the integral role it played within the monastery.

====Saint FerrÃ©ol====
Monastic life in the [[Middle Ages]] was strictly centered around [[Liturgy of the Hours|prayer]] and manual labor. In the early Middle Ages, there were many attempts to set out an organization and routine for monastic life. [[Charles Forbes RenÃ© de Montalembert|Montalembert]] cites one such sixth-century document, the Rule of [[FerrÃ©ol of UzÃ¨s|Saint FerrÃ©ol]], as prescribing that "He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861â1879) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; As this implies, the labor required of a [[scribe]] was comparable to the exertion of agriculture and other outdoor work. Another of Montalembert's examples is of a scribal note along these lines: "He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour, but although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861â1879) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
An undated Cistercian ordinance, ranging in date from 1119â52 (ZaÅuska 1989) prescribed ''literae unius coloris et non depictae'' ("letters of one color and not ornamented"), that spread with varying degrees of literalness in parallel with the Cistercian order itself, through the priories of Burgundy and beyond.

In 1134, the Cistercian order declared that the monks were to keep silent in the scriptorium as they should in the [[cloister]].

==Books and transcription in monastic life==

Manuscript-writing was a laborious process in an ill-lit environment that could damage one's health. One prior complained in the tenth century:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''Only try to do it yourself and you will learn how arduous is the writer's task. It dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits your chest and belly together. It is a terrible ordeal for the whole body''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Greer, Germaine. ''The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work''. Tauris Parke, 2001. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The director of a monastic scriptorium would be the ''armarius'' ("provisioner"), who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process. However, the armarius had other duties as well. At the beginning of Lent, the armarius was responsible for making sure that all of the monks received books to read,&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"/&gt; but he also had the ability to deny access to a particular book. By the 10th century the armarius had specific liturgical duties as well, including singing the eighth [[responsory]], holding the lantern aloft when the abbot read, and approving all material to be read aloud in church, chapter, and [[refectory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fassler, Margot E., "The Office of the Cantor in Early Western Monastic Rules and Customaries," in ''Early Music History'', 5 (1985), pp. 35, 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Vivarium c. 540â548, '''Cassiodorus''' wrote a commentary on the Psalms entitled ''Expositio Psalmorum'' as an introduction to the Psalms for individuals seeking to enter the monastic community. The work had a broad appeal outside of Cassiodorus' monastery as the subject of monastic study and reflection.

Abbot '''[[Johannes Trithemius]]''' of Sponheim wrote a letter, ''De Laude Scriptorum'' (In Praise of Scribes), to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz in 1492 to describe for monks the merits of copying texts. Trithemius contends that the copying of texts is central to the model of monastic education, arguing that transcription enables the monk to more deeply contemplate and come to a more full understanding of the text. He then continues to praise scribes by saying "The dedicated scribe, the object of our treatise, will never fail to praise God, give pleasure to angels, strengthen the just, convert sinners, commend the humble, confirm the good, confound the proud and rebuke the stubborn".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons he gives for continuing to copy manuscripts by hand, are the historical precedent of the ancient scribes and the supremacy of transcription to all other manual labor. This description of monastic writing is especially important because it was written after the first printing presses came into popular use. Trithemius addresses the competing technology when he writes, "The printed book is made of paper and, like paper, will quickly disappear. But the scribe working with parchment ensures lasting remembrance for himself and for his text".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"/&gt; Trithemius also believes that there are works that are not being printed but are worth being copied.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuscript-Alexander-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|[[John White Alexander]], Manuscript Book mural (1896), Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]

In his comparison of modern and medieval scholarship, '''James J. O'Donnell''' describes monastic study in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''[E]ach Psalm would have to be recited at least once a week all through the period of study. In turn, each Psalm studied separately would have to be read slowly and prayerfully, then gone through with the text in one hand (or preferably committed to memory) and the commentary in the other; the process of study would have to continue until virtually everything in the commentary has been absorbed by the student and mnemonically keyed to the individual verses of scripture, so that when the verses are recited again the whole phalanx of Cassiodorian erudition springs up in support of the content of the sacred text''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James O. |last=O'Donnell |title=Cassiodorus |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979 |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap5.html |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, the monks of the Middle Ages came to intimately know and experience the texts that they copied. The act of transcription became an act of meditation and prayer, not a simple replication of letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12710">'''The Environmental Provisions of Oslo II Accords'''

The [[Oslo II Accord]], also known as the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip or more simply Oslo II, established provisions and policies on the environment in six distinct articles within the first appendix of Annex III, "Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs." The key areas addressed are agriculture, [[environmental protection]], forests, nature reserves, parks, and [[Water in Palestine|water]] and sewage.

== Context within Agreement ==
The accords contain seven Annexes which specify the agreements on a certain topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement On The West Bank and The Gaza Strip Annex III |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/the%20israeli-palestinian%20interim%20agreement%20-%20annex%20iii.aspx#app-12|accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annex III lays out the arrangements for the management of various spheres of civil affairs. Under this Annex, the powers and responsibilities for management of these areas are transferred from the Israeli military government and the Civil Administration to the Palestinian side. Part of the civil affairs are the provisions on the environment.

== Contents ==

=== Article 1: Agriculture ===
Article 1 first names all the aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to veterinary services and livestock management, water for irrigation, grazing and farming, and policies relating to raising and marketing crops. Irrigation water is mentioned and linked to Article 40 on water and sewage, and forestry is dealt with in greater detail in Article 14 on forests. Both sides should cooperate to conduct studies and research collecting scientific data for the development of the agriculture sector. Agriculture Relations such as trade between both sides are mentioned under [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Peace/Guide/Pages/THE%20ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN%20INTERIM%20AGREEMENT%20-%20Annex%20V.aspx Annex V] (Economic Relations).

=== Article 12: Environmental Protection  ===
Article 12 is divided into Section A on the âTransfer of Authorityâ and Section B on âCooperation and Understandingsâ.

Section A expresses mutual Israeli and Palestinian recognition of the importance of environmental protection and the need for a sustainable approach to using natural resources, and determines the transfer of power to the Palestinian side.

Section B reviews various joint measures in protecting the environment relating to policy on natural resources, industrial development, avoiding damages to the environment, addressing pollution, waste and discharge regulations and biodiversity. 
In particular, mentioned measures are promoting public awareness on environmental issues, adopting international standards on global (ozone layer) and regional concerns (protection of [[endangered species]], restriction of trade, preservation of forests and nature reserves) and implement [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Impact Assessments]] (EIA). Schedule 2 lists 12 areas for which Environmental Impact Assessments should be prepared (e.g. power plants, quarries, treatment plants, disposal sides, air- and seaports and major roads).
Additionally Israel recognizes the unsatisfactory situation of the environment in the West Bank and obligates itself to assist in improving it. Both parties agree on improving scientific, technical and political cooperation concerning the environment. An Environmental Experts Committee for environmental cooperation and understandings shall be established on both sides.

=== Article 13: Fishery ===

This article identifies the licensing and permits for all aspects of the fishing industry along the Gaza Strip, and refers to security restrictions in a separate article (Article XIV).

=== Article 14, 25, 26: Forests; Nature Reserves; Parks ===

Management of forests, parks, and nature reserves will be transferred to the Council whose responsibilities will include preservation, administration, prevention of damage, and establishment of new resources (i.e. parks, reserves, and forests). Article 14 specifically affirms the Palestinian administration's right to plant new forests, whether in the interest of environmental protection or for landscaping purposes. Article 25 (Nature Reserves) addresses the enforcement and regulation of hunting and ban on hunting species that are protected and/or endangered. All three articles identify areas for cooperation between both sides. Areas for cooperation include protection, data gathering and scientific research, and ecological services such as managing fires and pest control.The management of forests, parks, and nature reserves is linked to concerns, such as desertification and erosion, which are addressed in Article 12 (Environmental Protection).

With respect to Area C, each article affirms the eventual transfer of responsibility for the application of the many provisions to Palestinian administration, except in the case of certain issues which are to be deferred until the permanent status negotiations. Israeli and Palestinian actors are to coordinate all activities with the potential to alter the condition of each sphere and which will occur within Area C, excluding settlements and military zones.

=== Article 40: Water and Sewage ===

The agreement rests on good-will and at its core is the principle of Israeli recognition of Palestiniansâ rights to water in the West Bank. The main principles address developing additional water, coordinating management of water resources and wastewater systems, treating influent for eventual reuse, and ensuring water quality and the prevention of harm. Powers and responsibilities in the domain of water and sewage in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be transferred to the Palestinian Council, while the question of infrastructure ownership is deferred until the permanent status negotiations. The final principle (paragraph 25) relates to the Gaza Strip and maintains the status quo on already existing provisions and agreements relating to the water resources and sewage systems in the area; schedule 11 reviews these arrangements.

==== Water Supply ====

The section includes an estimation of future water needs for Palestinians (70-80 mcm/yr).  Israel is committed to providing a total of 9.5 mcm of water per year to major Palestinian cities including Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Salfit, Nablus, Jenin, and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians are to be responsible for providing these areas with the additional supply of 19.2 mcm per year, which may be drawn from the Eastern Aquifer. Schedule 10 enumerates precise allowances for extractions and use of water from the Eastern, North-Eastern, and Western Aquifers.

==== Management and Cooperation (Joint Water Committee) ====

Israel and Palestinian administration are to cooperate in the exchange of data and in identification of sites for construction of new wells. [[IsraeliâPalestinian Joint Water Committee|The Joint Water Committee]] is formed to handle all water and sewage issues in the West Bank, including the following responsibilities: the joint management and protection of water resources and sewage systems; handling information exchange, regulation and monitoring, and the resolution of water and sewage conflict. The JWC will act to review all development projects in all their stages and determine whether to issue approval for their implementation. The role and obligations of the Joint Water Committee (Article 40, paragraph 15) are further expanded in Schedule 8.  Schedule 9 expands on supervision and enforcement mechanisms (Article 40, Paragraph 17), and addresses water purchases and cost. Paragraph 20 sets forth additional areas for cooperation between various committees with respect to economics and regional development.

==== Protection and Prevention of Harm and Contamination ====

Paragraphs 21 through 23 dictate that both sides should endeavor to prevent any harm, pollution, or contamination of the quality of water resources within their respective areas as well as within that of the otherâs. Paragraph 24 also mandates that both sides will be responsible for compensating the other for âany unauthorized use of or sabotage to water and sewage systems situated in the areas under its responsibility which serve the other side (Article 40, paragraph 24).â

== Current situation ==
The Oslo II accords is the latest agreement between Israel and Palestine concerning the environment. In negotiations and discussions between Israel and  Palestine, the parties mainly refer to this judicial framework. However its actual relevance remains unclear.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desk Study on the Environment in the Occupied Palestinian Territories|url=http://www.unep.org/download_file.multilingual.asp?FileID=105|publisher=UNEP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some provisions like the Environmental Impact Assessments have never been implemented. As one example of temporary cooperation the bilateral environmental committee can be mentioned. It worked until 2000 and managed in this time several trans boundary problems concerning hazardous waste. Although the environmental negotiations that took place within the framework of the Oslo Accords can be seen as a significant milestone for environmental cooperation, many objectives were never achieved. This outcome can be attributed to four main factors: Israeli security concerns, territorial disputes, logistical ambiguities and Palestinian institutional constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alleson,Levin,Brenner,Said Al Hmaidi|title=Peace and Pollution: An Examination of PalestinianâIsraeli Trans-Boundary Hazardous Waste Management 20 Years after the Oslo Peace Accords|journal=Journal of Peace-building &amp; Development|date=2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=15â29|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/.U43qDdIW0rU|accessdate=6/3/2014|doi=10.1080/.U43qDdIW0rU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Committee]] is an example of still working cooperation. But it is not fulfilling its original purpose of a joint water governance institution. The Committee is now said to be an Israel dominated body that mainly rejects Palestinian requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Troubled Waters - Palestinians denied fair access to water|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/027/2009/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=June 2014|pages=33â40.|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Current disputes between Israel and Palestine are often addressing untreated waste water flow into opponent streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TAL|first1=Alon|last2=al Khateeb|first2=Nader|last3=Akerman|first3=Hila|last4=Diabat|first4=Mousa|title=Israeli/Palestinian transboundary stream restoration and management: lessons for the future|journal=International Journal of River Basin Management|date=2010|volume=8|issue=2|pages=207â213|doi=10.1080/15715124.2010.491797|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15715124.2010.491797#.U4zpvCh-f3A|accessdate=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Since the Oslo II accords have been declared to be an interim agreement many aspects remain vague. A following agreement is needed which settles important details. In particular the unsolved dispute about water supply needs to be addressed. Both sides accuse each other for agreement violations. From the Palestinian side Israel does not keep their promise to recognize Palestinian water rights. Israel on the other hand sees Palestinian well drilling without permission as a violation of Oslo II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Palestinian Cooperation on Water Issues|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/me02767.pdf|publisher= The Knesse Research and Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Prison - A Book With A Soundtrack''''' (or simply '''''The Prison''''') is Michael Nesmith's seventh solo album of his post-[[Monkees]] career and his first to be released under his own record label, [[Pacific Arts]]. It includes a novella meant to be read while listening to the album as its "soundtrack". In 1994 Nesmith recorded a companion novella/album entitled ''[[The Garden (Michael Nesmith album)|The Garden]]''.  According to Nesmith's website (Videoranch), a third installment titled ''The Ocean'' has been released and completes the Infinitia trilogy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videoranch.com/html/frnezfaq.html Videoranch website FAQs.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Prison'' and ''The Garden'' were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch.

==Critical reception==
[[Allmusic]] called ''The Prison'' "a brilliant multimedia concept marrying the personal and inner visual experience of Michael "Papa Nez" Nesmith's novella with the aural medium of an equally original soundtrack." [[Robert Christgau]] called it a "ghastly boxed audio-allegory-with-book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Michael+Nesmith Robert Christgau mention of The Prison.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remixes==
"The Prison" was dramatically remixed by Michael Nesmith for CD release on "Rio Records" in 1990, and again in 2007 on "Edsel Records". Some changes on both remixes include the removal or addition of drum machines, extra reverb on vocals (in the case of the 2007 remix, a new or alternate lead vocal track in places), and many other changes. &lt;BR&gt;Although the iTunes download of "The Prison" is credited in the iTunes store as the 1990 remix, it is actually the 2007 remix. As of September 2013, the original mix that appeared on vinyl has not been officially released on CD.

'''Third gender''' or '''third sex''' is a concept in which individuals are categorized, either by themselves or by society, as neither [[man]] nor [[woman]]. It is also a social category present in [[gender systems|societies]] that recognize three or more [[gender]]s. The term ''third'' is usually understood to mean "other"; some [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[Sociology|sociologists]] have described&lt;!--

Not all cultures have strictly defined gender roles.&lt;ref name=LeBow&gt;LeBow, Diana, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlegel&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', in ''Quarterly Journal of Ideology: "A Critique of the Conventional Wisdom"'', vol.

In different cultures, a third or fourth gender may represent very different things. To [[Native Hawaiians]] and [[Tahitians]], ''[[MÄhÅ«]]'' is an intermediate state between man and woman, or a "person of indeterminate gender".&lt;ref name="vargas2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llosa |first1=Mario Vargas |authorlink1=Mario Vargas Llosa |title=The men-women of the Pacific |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/men-women-pacific |website=tate.org.uk |publisher=[[Tate Britain]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WpIsllud?url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/men-women-pacific |archivedate=6 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[Navajo|DinÃ©]] of the Southwestern US acknowledge four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man.&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; The term "third gender" has also been used to describe [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s of [[India]]&lt;ref name="agrawal1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/006996697031002005 |title=Gendered Bodies: The Case of the 'Third Gender' in India |year=1997 |last1=Agrawal |first1=A. |journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=273â297}}

While found in a number of non-Western cultures, concepts of "third", "fourth", and "some" gender roles are still somewhat new to mainstream western culture and conceptual thought.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, R. Jon and Richard L. Warms 2011 Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. New York, McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is most likely to be embraced in the modern [[LGBT]] or [[queer]] subcultures, or in ethnic minority cultures that exist within larger Western communities such as the [[Indigenous peoples of North America|North American Indigenous]] cultures that have roles for [[Two Spirit]] people.&lt;ref name=Estrada&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estrada | first1 = Gabriel S | year = 2011 | title = Two Spirits, NÃ¡dleeh, and LGBTQ2 Navajo Gaze | url = http://nativeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Two-Spirits-Nadleeh-and-Navajo-LGBTQ2-Gaze.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Indian Culture and Research Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 167â190 | doi=10.17953/aicr.35.4.x500172017344j30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/fashion/08SPIRIT.html?_r=0|title=A Spirit of Belonging, Inside and Out|journal=The New York Times|date=8 Oct 2006|accessdate=28 July 2016|last1=Leland|first1=John}} "'The elders will tell you the difference between a gay Indian and a Two-Spirit,' [Criddle] said, underscoring the idea that simply being gay and Indian does not make someone a Two-Spirit."&lt;/ref&gt; While mainstream western scholars, notably anthropologists who have tried to write about Native American and South Asian "gender variant" people, have often sought to understand the term "third gender" solely in the language of the modern [[LGBT]] community, other scholars â especially Indigenous scholars â stress that their lack of cultural understanding and context has led to widespread misrepresentation of third gender people.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html |title=Asia and the Pacific â ANU |publisher= |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/bitstream/handle/123456789/7281/URN_NBN_fi_jyu-2005460.pdf?sequence=1|title=ANCESTORS OF TWO-SPIRITS: REPRESENTATIONS OF NATIVE AMERICAN THIRD-GENDER MALES|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pember&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2016/10/13/two-spirit-tradition-far-ubiquitous-among-tribes/|title='Two Spirit' Tradition Far From Ubiquitous Among Tribes|publisher=[[Rewire (website)|Rewire]]|first=Mary Annette |last=Pember |date=Oct 13, 2016|accessdate=Oct 17, 2016 |quote= Unfortunately, depending on an oral tradition to impart our ways to future generations opened the floodgates for early non-Native explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists to write books describing Native peoples and therefore bolstering their own role as experts.

The community of third gender may also face discrimination from within the gay community. Despite having been legalized in the majority of South Asia, sexual minorities in Sri Lanka are hesitant to fight for third gender rights as departing from the traditional binary gender concept might make it harder to push through other aspects of LGBT rights.  It's notably that the island's two neighboring Indian states were among the first in the post-colonial world to legally recognize third gender.

Since at least the 1970s, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] have described [[gender role|gender categories]] in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; At the same time, [[Feminism|feminists]] began to draw a distinction between (biological) [[sex]] and (social/psychological) [[gender]]. Contemporary [[gender studies|gender theorists]] usually argue that a two-gender system is neither innate nor universal. A sex/gender system which recognizes only the following two social [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] has been labeled "[[heteronormative]]".{{By whom|date=May 2018}}

Anthropologist Michael G. Peletz believes our notions of different types of genders (including the attitudes toward the third gender) deeply affect our lives and reflects our values in society. In Peletz' book, "Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia", he describes:&lt;ref name=Gender&gt;{{cite book|last=Peletz|first=Michael G.|title=Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia|year=2007|publisher=Association for Asian Studies|location=Michigan|isbn=9780924304507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For our purposes, the term "gender" designates the cultural categories, symbols, meanings, practices, and institutionalized arrangements bearing on at least five sets of phenomena: (1) females and femininity; (2) males and masculinity; (3) Androgynes, who are partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex/gender, as well as intersexed individuals, also known as hermaphrodites, who to one or another degree may have both male and female sexual organs or characteristics; (4) transgender people, who engage in practices that transgress or transcend normative boundaries and are thus by definition "transgressively gendered"; and (5) neutered or unsexed/ungendered individuals such as eunuchs.}}

=== Intersex people and third gender ===

[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sex and gender distinction]] is not universal, and Peletz's description of gender as designating biological variations as well as cultural practices is not unique. In a study of arguments that intersex people fit into a third gender classification, intersex scholar [[Morgan Holmes]] argues that much analysis of a third sex or third gender is simplistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=July 2004 |title=Locating Third Sexes |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |journal=Transformations Journal |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1444-3775 |accessdate=2014-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110091545/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a 'third sex' portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two.

The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and thirdly it is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population but it is, instead, about self-determination.&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people and third gender ===
Gender may be organized differently in different cultures. In some non-Western cultures, gender is not binary and one can cross freely between male and female. This is seen as a mediation between the spirit and mundane worlds.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.132&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a positive and is almost revered in many Eastern cultures, whereas in Western culture, people who donât conform to [[heteronormative]] ideals are often seen as sick, disordered, or insufficiently formed.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid" /&gt;

To the Indigenous [[MÄhÅ«]] of Hawaii, it is an intermediate state between man and woman, or to be a "person of indeterminate gender";&lt;ref name="vargas2015" /&gt; While the traditional [[Navajo|Dineh]] of the Southwestern US acknowledge four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man.&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; The term "third gender" has also been used to describe [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s of South Asia&lt;ref name="agrawal1997" /&gt; who have gained legal identity, [[fa'afafine]] of Polynesia, and [[Albanian sworn virgins|sworn virgins]] of the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

In Africa{{Vague|date=August 2018}}, a woman can be recognized as a âfemale husbandâ who enjoys all of the privileges of men and is recognized as such, but whose femaleness, while not openly acknowledged, is not forgotten either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=E Mark|last2=Marchesani|first2=Robert B|title=Saints and Rogues: Conflicts and Convergence in Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-71804-8|page=135|chapter=Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s, of India, are one of the most recognized and socially accepted groups of third genders. This may be a result of the notion of [[reincarnation]], which reduces not only gender categorization but also sex and species, allowing for more fluid and mutable categorization. There are countless other cultures in which the third gender is seen as an intermediate being rather than as a movement from one conventional sex to the other, either male to female or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, Sally, and Tam Sanger. Transgender Identities: Towards a Social Analysis of Gender Diversity. New York: Routledge, 2010. Print. p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Because of both peer and parental pressure, those growing up with the most ambiguous appearances had the most troubled childhoods and difficulties later in life. Sell also discovered similarities between the third genders of the East and those of the West. Nearly half of those interviewed were healers or in the medical profession. A majority of them, again like their Eastern counterparts, were artistic enough to make a living from their abilities. The capacity to mediate between men and women was a common skill, and third genders were oftentimes thought to possess an unusually wide perspective and the ability to understand both sides.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a" /&gt; A notable result of Sell's study is that 93% of the third genders interviewed, again like their Eastern counterparts, reported âparanormalâ-type abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, some Western societies have begun to recognize genderqueer or non-binary identities. Some years after Alex MacFarlane, Australian [[Norrie May-Welby]] was recognized as having unspecified status.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/03/16/2010-03-16_no_sex_for_me_please_extranssexual_briton_is_first_legally_genderless_person.html "No sex for me, please!

The [[Open Society Foundations]] published a report, ''License to Be Yourself'' in May 2014, documenting "some of the world's most progressive and rights-based laws and policies that enable trans people to change their gender identity on official documents".&lt;ref name=License&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jack |author-link= |title= License to Be Yourself |year=2014|publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |location=New York |isbn=9781940983103 |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/license-be-yourself | accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating:
{{quote|
From a rights-based perspective, third sex / gender options should be voluntary, providing trans people with a third choice about how to define their gender identity. Those identifying as a third sex / gender should have the same rights as those identifying as male or female.}}

The document also quotes [[Mauro Cabral]] of [[Global Action for Trans Equality]]:
{{quote|
People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned to a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker.}}

The report concludes that two or three options are insufficient: "A more inclusive approach would be to increase options for people to self-define their sex and gender identity."&lt;ref name="License" /&gt;

=== Third gender and sexual orientation ===
[[Image:Thirdsex bookcover 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of Artemis Smith's 1959 [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novel ''The Third Sex'']]

Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; terms such as "third gender" trace back to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duc, AimÃ©e 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E. Wayne |title=The Social Studies Curriculum: Purposes, Problems, and Possibilities |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6909-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4qFMqjxte9IC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980â1981 FallâWinter; 6(1â2): pp. 103â1&lt;/ref&gt;

One such term, [[Uranian]], was used in the 19th century to a person of a third sexâoriginally, someone with "a female psyche in a male body" who is sexually attracted to men. Its definition was later extended to cover [[homosexual]] [[gender variant]] females and a number of other sexual types. It is believed to be an [[English language|English]] adaptation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Urning'', which was first published by activist [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] (1825â95) in a series of five booklets (1864â65) that were collected under the title ''Forschungen Ã¼ber das RÃ¤thsel der mannmÃ¤nnlichen Liebe'' ("Research into the Riddle of Man-Male Love"). Ulrich developed his terminology before the first public use of the term "homosexual", which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] (1824â82). The word Uranian (''Urning'') was derived by Ulrichs from the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Aphrodite Urania]], who was created out of [[Uranus (mythology)|the god Uranus' testicles]]; it stood for homosexuality, while Aphrodite Dionea (''Dioning'') represented heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmkaylor.com Michael Matthew Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde'' (Brno, CZ: Masaryk University Press, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian activist [[Anna Rueling]] used the term in a 1904 speech, "What Interest Does the Women's Movement Have in Solving the Homosexual Problem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAny0qfa6qsC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Finding Out: An Introduction to LGBT Studies|first1=Deborah T.|last1=Meem|first2=Michelle|last2=Gibson|first3=Michelle A.|last3=Gibson|first4=Jonathan|last4=Alexander|date=28 May 2018|publisher=SAGE|via=Google Books|isbn=9781412938655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the West is trying to reinterpret and redefine ancient third-gender identities to fit the Western concept of [[sexual orientation]]. In ''Redefining [[Fa'afafine]]: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa'', Johanna Schmidt argues that the Western attempts to reinterpret fa'afafine, the third gender in Samoan culture, make it have more to do with sexual orientation than gender. She also argues that this is actually changing the nature of fa'afafine itself, and making it more "homosexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html|title=Intersections: Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa|website=intersections.anu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Samoan fa'afafine said, "But I would like to pursue a master's degree with a paper on homosexuality from a Samoan perspective that would be written for educational purposes, because I believe some of the stuff that has been written about us is quite wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa Johanna Schmidt]; Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context; Issue 6, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity'', Will Roscoe writes that "this pattern can be traced from the earliest accounts of the Spaniards to present-day ethnographies. What has been written about berdaches reflects more the influence of existing Western discourses on gender, sexuality and the Other than what observers actually witnessed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity] Will Roscoe  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226235121/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Towle and Morgan:

{{quote|Ethnographic examples [of âthird gendersâ] can come from distinct societies located in Thailand, Polynesia, Melanesia, Native America, western Africa, and elsewhere and from any point in history, from Ancient Greece, to sixteenth century England to contemporary North America. Popular authors routinely simplify their descriptions, ignoring...or conflating dimensions that seem to them extraneous, incomprehensible, or ill suited to the images they want to convey (484).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html The Great Third Gender Debate; BELOW THE BELT, theory-q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222350/http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western scholars often do not make a distinction between people of the third gender and males; they are often lumped together. The scholars usually use gender roles as a way to explain sexual relations between the third gender and males. For example, when analyzing the non-normative sex gender categories in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], Peter A. Jackson says it appears that within early Buddhist communities, men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and were thought to be [[hermaphrodite]]s. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures]

Some writers suggest that a third gender emerged around 1700 AD in [[England]]: the male [[sodomy|sodomite]].&lt;ref name="Trumbach"&gt;Trumbach, Randolph. (1998) ''Sex and the Gender Revolution. Volume 1: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London''. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1998. (Chicago Series on Sexuality, History &amp; Society)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these writers, this was marked by the emergence of a [[subculture]] of [[effeminate]] males and their meeting places ([[molly house]]s), as well as a marked increase in hostility towards effeminate or [[homosexual]] males. People described themselves as members of a third sex in Europe from at least the 1860s with the writings of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1300/J082v06n01_10 | title=The "Third Sex" Theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs | year=1981 | last1=Kennedy | first1=Hubert | journal=Journal of Homosexuality | volume=6 | pages=103â111 | pmid=7042820 | issue=1â2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in the late nineteenth century with [[Magnus Hirschfeld]],&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, the term "third sex" was a common descriptor for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the [[gay liberation]] movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the term fell out of favor among [[LGBT communities]] and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern [[transgender]] movement and [[queer theory]] has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sell |first1= Ingrid |year=2001 |title=Not man, not woman: Psychospiritual characteristics of a Western third gender |journal= [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages= 16â36 }} (Complete doctoral dissertation: Sell, Ingrid. (2001). ''Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman.'' (Doctoral Dissertation, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology). UMI No. 3011299.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern identities that cover similar ground include [[pangender]], [[bigender]], [[genderqueer]], [[androgyne]], [[intergender]], "other gender" and "differently gendered".

=== Third gender and feminism ===

In [[German Empire#Wilhelmine era|Wilhelmine Germany]], the terms ''drittes Geschlecht'' ("third sex") and ''Mannweib'' ("man-woman") were also used to describe [[feminist]]s â both by their opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=407320 | pages=582â599 | last1=Wright | first1=B.

In the 1899 novel ''Das dritte Geschlecht'' (''The Third Sex'') by Ernst Ludwig von Wolzogen, feminists are portrayed as "neuters" with external female characteristics accompanied by a crippled male [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

==History==

===Mesopotamia===
[[Image:Sumerian creation myth.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone tablet from 2nd millennium BC Sumer containing a myth about the creation of a type of human who is neither man nor woman.]]
In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], among the earliest written records of humanity, there are references to types of people who are not men and not women. In a [[Sumer]]ian [[creation myth]] found on a stone tablet from the [[second millennium BC]], the goddess [[Ninmah]] fashions a being "with no male organ and no female organ", for whom [[Enki]] finds a position in society: "to stand before the king". In the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] myth of [[Atra-Hasis]] (ca. 1700 BC), Enki instructs [[Nintu]], the goddess of birth, to establish a âthird category among the peopleâ in addition to men and women, that includes demons who steal infants, women who are unable to give birth, and priestesses who are prohibited from bearing children.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stephen O., and Roscoe, Will (1997). ''Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature.'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Babylonia]], [[Sumer]] and [[Assyria]], certain types of individuals who performed religious duties in the service of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] have been described as a third gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1062813 | accessdate=2 April 2011 | pages=195â230 | last1=Roscoe | first1=W. | title=Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion | volume=35 | issue=3 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=1996 | url=http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html | doi=10.1086/463425}} Roscoe identifies these temple staff by the names ''kalÃ»'', ''kurgarrÃ»'', and ''assinnu''.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[sacred prostitute]]s or [[Hierodule]]s, performed ecstatic dance, music and plays, wore masks and had gender characteristics of both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen, Martti (1998).

He described the ''kulu'u'' as effeminate and the ''kurgarru'' as [[transvestism|transvestite]]. In addition, he defines another kind of gender-variant prostitute, ''sinnisÄnu'', as (literally) "woman-like".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Inscribed pottery shards from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000â1800 BCE), found near ancient [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (now [[Luxor]], [[Egypt]]), list three human genders: ''tai'' (male), ''sá¸«t'' ("sekhet") and ''hmt'' (female).&lt;ref&gt;Sethe, Kurt, (1926), ''Die Aechtung feindlicher FÃ¼rsten, VÃ¶lker und Dinge auf altÃ¤gyptischen TongefÃ¤Ãscherben des mittleren Reiches,'' in: Abhandlungen der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-Historische Klasse, 1926, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sá¸«t'' is often translated as "eunuch", although there is little evidence that such individuals were castrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/egypt.htm The Third Gender in Ancient Egypt], Faris Malik.

References to a third sex can be found throughout the texts of India's three ancient spiritual traditions â [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Amara Das (2004). ''Tritiya Prakriti (People of the Third Sex): Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity and Intersex Conditions through Hinduism'' (XLibris Corporation, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} [[Jainism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11609126 | year = 1996 | last1 = Zwilling | first1 = L | last2 = Sweet | first2 = MJ | title = "Like a city ablaze": The third sex and the creation of sexuality in Jain religious literature | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 359â84 | journal = Journal of the History of Sexuality |jstor=4629615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhism]]&lt;ref name="Jackson10996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jackson |first1= Peter A. |date=April 1996 |title=Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures |journal =  Australian Humanities Review  | hdl = 1885/41884}}&lt;/ref&gt; â and it can be inferred that [[Vedic culture]] recognised three genders. The [[Vedas]] (c. 1500 BCâ500 BC) describe individuals as belonging to one of three categories, according to one's nature or [[prakrti]]. These are also spelled out in the [[Kama Sutra]] (c. 4th century AD) and elsewhere as ''pums-prakrti'' (male-nature), ''stri-prakrti'' (female-nature), and ''tritiya-prakrti'' (third-nature).&lt;ref&gt;Alternate transliteration: ''trhytÃ®yÃ¢ prakrhyti''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts suggest that third sex individuals were well known in premodern India and included male-bodied or female-bodied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1353/sex.2001.0018 | title=Hidden in History: Female Homoeroticism and Women of a "Third Nature" in the South Asian Past | year=2001 | last1=Penrose | first1=Walter | journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality | volume=10 | pages=3â39 [4] |quote=distinct social and economic roles once existed for women thought to belong to a third gender.

A third sex is discussed in ancient [[Hindu law]], medicine, [[linguistics]] and [[astrology]]. The foundational work of Hindu law, the [[Manu Smriti]] (c. 200 BCâ200 AD) explains the biological origins of the three sexes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed, a female child by the prevalence of the female; if both are equal, a third-sex child or boy and girl twins are produced; if either are weak or deficient in quantity, a failure of conception results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manu Smriti]], 3.49. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu03.htm Text online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indian linguist [[PataÃ±jali]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the [[PataÃ±jali]] who was the author of the ''[[Yoga sutras]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; work on [[Sanskrit]] grammar, the [[MahÄbhÄá¹£ya]] (c. 200 BC), states that Sanskrit's three [[grammatical genders]] are derived from three natural genders. The earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar, the [[Tolkappiyam]] (3rd century BC) refers to hermaphrodites as a third "neuter" gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In [[Vedic astrology]], the nine planets are each assigned to one of the three genders; the third gender, ''tritiya-prakrti'', is associated with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]] and (in particular) [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. In the [[Puranas]], there are references to three kinds of [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s of music and dance: [[apsaras]] (female), [[gandharva]]s (male) and [[kinnar]]s (neuter).

The two great [[Sanskrit]] [[epic poem]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;Lord [[Arjuna]] takes a "vow of eunuchism" to live as the third sex for a year: "O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of the neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of the bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my [[Scarification|cicatrized]] arms with bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and [[conch]]-bangles on my wrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king, appear as one of the third sex, Vrihannala by name. And living as a female I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner apartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the women of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and in musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the various excellent acts of men..." [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15475 Mahabharata (Virata-parva)], Translated by Ganguli, Kisari Mohan. [[Project Gutenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; indicate the existence of a third gender in ancient Indic society. Some versions of [[Ramayana]] tell that in one part of the story, the hero [[Rama]] heads into exile in the forest. Halfway there, he discovers that most of the people of his home town [[Ayodhya]] were following him. He told them, "Men and women, turn back", and with that, those who were "neither men nor women" did not know what to do, so they stayed there. When Rama returned from exile years later, he discovered them still there and blessed them, saying that there will be a day when they, too, will have a share in ruling the world.

In the Buddhist [[Vinaya]], codified in its present form around the 2nd century BC and said to be handed down by oral tradition from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself, there are four main sex/gender categories: males, females, ''ubhatobyaÃ±janaka'' (people of a dual sexual nature) and ''[[Pandaka|paá¹á¸aka]]'' (people of non-normative sexual natures, perhaps originally denoting a deficiency in male sexual capacity).&lt;ref name="Jackson10996" /&gt; As the Vinaya tradition developed, the term ''paá¹á¸aka'' came to refer to a broad third sex category which encompassed intersex, male and female bodied people with physical or behavioural attributes that were considered inconsistent with the natural characteristics of man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3176712 | pages=89â115 | last1=Gyatso | first1=J. | title=One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender, Monasticism, and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle | volume=43 | issue=2 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=2003 | doi=10.1086/423006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is often portrayed in the West, sex with male (specifically receptive oral and anal sex) was the gender role of the third gender, not their defining feature. Thus, in ancient India, as in present-day India, the society made a distinction between a third gender having sex with a man, and a man having sex with a man. The latter may have been viewed negatively, but he would be seen very much as a man (in modern western context, as 'straight'), not a third gender (in modern western context 'gay').&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures], compiled by Peter A. Jackson; quote: "it appears that among the early Buddhist communities men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and thought to be hermaphrodites. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', written around the 4th century BC, Aristophanes relates a creation myth involving three original sexes: female, male and androgynous. They are split in half by Zeus, producing four different contemporary sex/gender types which seek to be reunited with their lost other half; in this account, the modern heterosexual man and woman descend from the original androgynous sex. The myth of [[Hermaphroditus]] involves heterosexual lovers merging into their primordial androgynous sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/symposium.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive â Symposium by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=June 2016}}

Other [[creation myth]]s around the world share a belief in three original sexes, such as those from northern Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter A. (1995) ''Kathoey: The third sex.'' In Jackson, P., "Dear Uncle Go: Male homosexuality in Thailand." Bangkok, Thailand: Bua Luang Books&lt;br&gt;See also: Peltier, Anatole-Roger (1991). ''Pathamamulamuli: The Origin of the World in the Lan Na Tradition''. Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books. The Yuan creation myth in the book is from Pathamamulamuli, an antique Buddhist palmleaf manuscript. Its translator, Anatole-Roger Peltier, believes that this story is based on an oral tradition which is over five hundred years old.

Many have interpreted the "[[eunuch]]s" of the Ancient Eastern Mediterranean world as a third gender that inhabited a [[liminality|liminal]] space between women and men, understood in their societies as somehow neither or both.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tougher, ed., (2001) ''Eunuchs in Antiquity and Beyond'' (London: Duckworth Publishing, 2001).&lt;br&gt;Ringrose, Kathryn M. (2003). ''The Perfect Servant: Eunuchs and the Social Construction of Gender in Byzantium.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Historia Augusta]], the eunuch body is described as a ''tertium genus hominum'' (a third human gender),&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia Augusta]], ''[[Severus Alexander]]'' xxiii.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 77 BC, a eunuch named Genucius was prevented from claiming goods left to him in a [[will (law)|will]], on the grounds that he had voluntarily mutilated himself (''amputatis sui ipsius'') and was neither a woman or a man (''neque virorum neque mulierum numero'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], (7.7.6).&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have argued that the eunuchs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] were understood in their time to belong to a third gender, rather than the more recent interpretations of a kind of emasculated man, or a metaphor for [[chastity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hester |first1= J.

And elsewhere: "The Lord Himself opened the kingdom of heaven to eunuchs and He Himself lived as a eunuch. The apostle [Paul] also, following His example, made himself a eunuch..."&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian also noted the existence of a third sex (''tertium sexus'') among heathens: "a third race in sex... made of male and female in one."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'', 1.20.4. [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian06.html Text online].&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been referring to the [[Galli]], "eunuch" devotees of the [[Phrygia]]n goddess [[Cybele]], who were described as belonging to a third sex by several [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "Both sexes are displeasing to her holiness, so [the gallus] keeps a middle gender (''medium genus'') between the others." [[Prudentius]], Peristephanon, 10.1071-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In old Israel there were:
*''Zachar'': male
*''Nekeva'': female
*''[[Androgynos]]'': both male and female genitalia (eternal doubt of legal gender)
*''[[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]]'': genitalia concealed by skin (unknown gender, unless skin removed)
*''Aylonit'': Barren female. Female genitalia, barren.
*''Saris'': castrated or naturally infertile male (often translated as "eunuch")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/Classical_Jewish_Terms_for_Gender_Diversity.pdf] Classic Jewish terms for Gender Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Gender_Diversity_In_Halacha.pdf] Gender Diversity in Halakha&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

====Mesoamerica====

The ancient [[Maya civilization]] may have recognised a third gender, according to historian Matthew Looper. Looper notes the androgynous [[Maize]] Deity and masculine [[Lunar deity|Moon goddess]] of [[Maya mythology]], and iconography and inscriptions where rulers embody or impersonate these deities. He suggests that the third gender could also include two-spirit individuals with special roles such as healers or [[divination|diviners]].&lt;ref&gt;Looper, Matthew G. (2001). ''Ancient Maya Women-Men (and Men-Women): Classic Rulers and the Third Gender'', In: "Ancient Maya Women", ed. Traci Ardren. Walnut Creek, California: Alta Mira, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and archaeologist Miranda Stockett notes that several writers have felt the need to move beyond a two-gender framework when discussing prehispanic cultures across [[mesoamerica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40025092 | pages=566â578 | last1=Stockett | first1=M.

Austin, TX: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that the [[Olmec]], [[Aztec]] and [[Maya peoples]] understood "more than two kinds of bodies and more than two kinds of gender." Anthropologist Rosemary Joyce agrees, writing that "gender was a fluid potential, not a fixed category, before the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica. Childhood training and ritual shaped, but did not set, adult gender, which could encompass third genders and alternative sexualities as well as "male" and "female." At the height of the Classic period, Maya rulers presented themselves as embodying the entire range of gender possibilities, from male through female, by wearing blended costumes and playing male and female roles in state ceremonies." Joyce notes that many figures of mesoamerican art are depicted with male genitalia and female breasts, while she suggests that other figures in which chests and waists are exposed but no sexual characteristics (primary or secondary) are marked may represent a third sex, ambiguous gender or androgyny.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A.

====Inca====
Andean Studies scholar Michael Horswell writes that third-gendered ritual attendants to ''chuqui chinchay'', a [[jaguar]] deity in [[Incan mythology]], were "vital actors in Andean ceremonies" prior to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonisation]]. Horswell elaborates: "These ''quariwarmi'' (men-women) [[shaman]]s mediated between the symmetrically dualistic spheres of Andean cosmology and daily life by performing rituals that at times required same-sex erotic practices. Their transvested attire served as a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead. Their shamanic presence invoked the androgynous creative force often represented in Andean mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Horswell, Michael J. (2006).

{{quote|And in each important temple or house of worship, they have a man or two, or more, depending on the idol, who go dressed in women's attire from the time they are children, and speak like them, and in manner, dress, and everything else they imitate women.

''Sex and Conquest.'' Cornell University Press: Ithaca. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Illiniwek====
Historically, the [[Illinois Confederation|Indigenous people of Illinois]] have decided the gender of their members based on their childhood behavior. If a male child used tools considered to be "women's tools", such as a spade or ax instead of a bow, they were considered to be third gender, feminine men. The modern, [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] term for this role is "[[Two-Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Joyce. 2000. Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesosamerica. University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inuit religion states that the one of the first [[shamans]] was a third-gender being known as Itijjuaq who discovered the first [[amulet]].&lt;ref name="inuit-third-gender"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=D'Anglure |first1=Bernard |title=The 'Third Gender' of the Inuit |journal=Diogenes |date=November 2005 |volume=52 |issue=4 |page=138 &lt;!-- |pages=134-144 --&gt; |doi=10.1177/0392192105059478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

George, Quote: Siva: The Hermaphrodite

The Lord [[Shiva]] is the underlying neutral and changeless reality, the undifferentiated absolute Consciousness, who is the foundation of every change and becoming. The hermaphrodite reality is one which is independent of all distinctions of male and female, the phenomenal and the non-phenomenal, and yet forms the basis of all such distinctions. The Puranas speak of Lord Shiva as the Hermaphrodite reality, though distinctionless within Himself, letting the distinctions of the manifold world spring up from Him. The Puranic thinkers interpreted and represented this hermaphrodite aspect of the Lord Siva in various ways. One such symbol expression is the figure of His Sakti. Another such symbol is the Phallus *(the male reproductive part) and the Yoni (the female reproductive part). A third, a more anthropomorphic metaphor, is that of the union between Siva and His many consorts, such as, Parvati, Uma and others. All these symbolisms express the truth that the variety of this universe stems from the lord Siva through his Sakti. To explain this point very picturesquely, the Puranas apply the mythological story of creation by way of the sexual union between Prajaapati and his daughter to Siva who, by His eternal union with His Sakti creates the world. The Puraanas also use another more sacrificial symbollism to expound the hermaphrodite characteristic of Shiva, according to which the male principle is represented as Fire, the devourer of the offering, and the female principle is the Soma, the devoured offering. In this symbolism, the hermaphrodite is the embodiment of the cosmic sacrifice, through which the universe emerges from the Lord Siva.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the [[common era]], male cults devoted to a goddess that flourished throughout the broad region extending from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[South Asia]]. While [[galli]] were missionizing the Roman Empire, [[Gala (priests)|kalÅ«]], kurgarrÅ«, and assinnu continued to carry out ancient rites in the temples of Mesopotamia, and the third-gender predecessors of the hijra were clearly evident. It should also be mentioned of the eunuch priests of Artemis at Ephesus; the western Semitic qedeshim, the male "temple prostitutes" known from the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic texts of the late second millennium; and the keleb, priests of Astarte at Kition and elsewhere. Beyond India, modern ethnographic literature document gender variant shaman-priests throughout [[Southeast Asia]], [[Borneo]], and [[Sulawesi]]. All these roles share the traits of devotion to a goddess, gender transgression and receptive anal sex, ecstatic ritual techniques (for healing, in the case of kalÅ« and Mesopotamian priests, and fertility in the case of hijra), and actual (or symbolic) castration. Most, at some point in their history, were based in temples and, therefore, part of the religious-economic administration of their respective city-states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion] by Will Roscoe&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trotula''' is a name referring to a group of three texts on women's medicine that were composed in the southern Italian port town of [[Salerno]] in the 12th century. The name derives from a historic female figure, [[Trota of Salerno]], a [[physician]] and [[medical writer]] who was associated with one of the three texts. However, "Trotula" came to be understood as a real person in the Middle Ages and because the so-called ''Trotula'' texts circulated widely throughout [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], from Spain to Poland, and Sicily to Ireland, "Trotula" has historic importance in "her" own right.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans. ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Trotula'' texts: genesis and authorship==
In the 12th century, the southern Italian port town of [[Salerno]] was widely reputed as "the most important center for the introduction of Arabic medicine into Western Europe".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Benton, "Trotula, Women's Problems, and the Professionalization of Medicine in the Middle Ages," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 59, no. 1 (Spring 1985), 330-53, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In referring to the [[School of Salerno]] in the 12th century, historians actually mean an informal community of masters and pupils who, over the course of the 12th century, developed more or less formal methods of instruction and investigation; there is no evidence of any physical or legal entity before the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conditions of Women'', ''Treatments for Women'', and ''Womenâs Cosmetics'' are usually referred to collectively as ''The Trotula''. They cover topics from childbirth to cosmetics, relying on varying sources from [[Galen]] to oral traditions, providing practical instructions. These works vary in both organization and content. ''Conditions of Women'' and ''Womenâs Cosmetics''  circulated anonymously until they were combined with ''Treatments for Women'' sometime in the late 12th century. For the next several hundred years, the ''Trotula'' ensemble circulated throughout Europe, reaching its greatest popularity in the 14th century. More than 130 copies exist today of the Latin texts, and over 60 copies of the many medieval vernacular translations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.  Part II: The Vernacular Texts and Latin Re-Writings,â ''Scriptorium'' 51 (1997), 80-104; Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.  Part I: The Latin Manuscripts,â ''Scriptorium'' 50 (1996), 137-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Liber de sinthomatibus mulierum'' ("Book on the Conditions of Women") ===
The ''Liber de sinthomatibus mulierum'' ("Book on the Conditions of Women") was novel in its adoption of the [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|new Arabic medicine]] that had just begun to make inroads into Europe. As Green demonstrated in 1996, ''Conditions of Women'' draws heavily on the gynecological and obstetrical chapters of the ''Viaticum'', [[Constantine the African]]'s Latin translation of Ibn al-Jazzar's Arabic ''Zad al-musafir'', which had been completed in the late 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âThe Development of the ''Trotula'',â ''Revue dâHistoire des Textes'' 26 (1996), 119-203.  See also Gerrit Bos, âIbn al-JazzÄr on Womenâs Diseases and Their Treatment,â ''Medical History'' 37 (1993), 296-312; and Gerrit Bos, ed. and trans., ''Ibn al-Jazzar on Sexual Diseases and Their Treatment'', The Sir Henry Wellcome Asian Series (London: Kegan Paul, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic medicine was more speculative and philosophical, drawing from the principles of Galen. Galen, as opposed to other notable physicians, believed that menstruation was a necessary and healthy purgation.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen asserted that women are colder than men and unable to âcookâ their nutrients; thus they must eliminate excess substance through menstruation. Indeed, the author presents a positive view of the role of menstruation in women's health and fertility: "Menstrual blood is special because it carries in it a living being. It works like a tree. Before bearing fruit, a tree must first bear flowers. Menstrual blood is like the flower: it must emerge before the fruitâthe babyâcan be born."&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Another condition that the author addresses at length is suffocation of the womb; this results from, among other causes, an excess of female semen (another Galenic idea). Seemingly conflicted between two different theoretical positionsâone that suggested it was possible for the womb to "wander" within the body, and another which saw such movement as anatomically impossibleâthe author seems to admit the possibility that the womb rises to the respiratory organs.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues discussed at length are treatment for and the proper regimen for a newly born child. There are discussions on topics covering menstrual disorders and uterine prolapse, chapters on childbirth and pregnancy, in addition to many others.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), pp. 17-37, 70-115.&lt;/ref&gt; All the named authorities cited in the ''Liber de sinthomatibus mulierum'' are male: Hippocrates, Oribasius, Dioscorides, Paulus, and Justinus.

=== ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") ===
''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") is the only one of the three ''Trotula'' texts that is actually attributed to the Salernitan practitioner [[Trota of Salerno]] when it circulated as an independent text. However, it has been argued that it is perhaps better to refer to Trota as the "authority" who stands behind this text than its actual author.&lt;ref&gt;On Trota's relationship to the text of the ''De curis mulierum'', see Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The author does not provide theories related to gynecological conditions or their causes, but simply informs the reader how to prepare and apply medical preparations. There is a lack of cohesion, but there are sections related to gynecological, andrological, pediatric, cosmetic, and general medical conditions. Beyond a pronounced focus on treatment for fertility,&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a range of pragmatic instructions like how to ârestoreâ virginity, as well as treatments for concerns such as difficulties with bladder control and cracked lips caused by too much kissing. In a work stressing female medical issues, remedies for men's disorders are included as well.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), pp. 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''De ornatu mulierum'' ("On Womenâs Cosmetics") ===
''De ornatu mulierum'' ("On Women's Cosmetics") is a treatise that teaches how to conserve and improve women's beauty. It opens with a preface (later omitted from the ''Trotula'' ensemble) in which the author refers to himself with a masculine pronoun and explains his ambition to earn "a delightful multitude of friends" by assembling this body of learning on care of the hair (including bodily hair), face, lips, teeth, mouth, and (in the original version) the genitalia. As Green has noted, the author likely hoped for a wide audience, for he observed that women beyond the Alps would not have access to the spas that Italian women did and therefore included instructions for an alternative steam bath.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âThe Development of the Trotula,â ''Revue dâHistoire des Textes'' 26 (1996), 119-203, at p. 140.  The text of the original preface can be found in Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The author does not claim that the preparations he describes are his own inventions. One therapy, by a Sicilian woman, he claims to have personally witnessed, and he added another remedy on the same topic (mouth odor) which he himself endorses. Otherwise, the rest of the text seems to gather together remedies learned from empirical practitioners: he explicitly describes ways that he has incorporated "the rules of women whom I found to be practical in practicing the art of cosmetics."&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; But while women may have been his sources, they were not his immediate audience: he presented his highly structured work for the benefit of other male practitioners eager, like himself, to profit from their knowledge of making women beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six times in the original version of the text, the author credits specific practices to Muslim women, whose cosmetic practices are known to have been imitated by Christian women on Sicily. And the text overall presents an image of an international market of spices and aromatics regularly traded in the Islamic world. Frankincense, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and galangal are all used repeatedly. More than the other two texts that would make up the ''Trotula'' ensemble, the ''De ornatu mulierum'' seems to capture both the empiricism of local southern Italian culture and the rich material culture made available as the Norman kings of southern Italy embraced Islamic culture on Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The âTrotulaâ: A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), pp. 45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Medieval legacy of the ''Trotula'' ==
The ''Trotula'' texts are considered the "most popular assembly of materials on women's medicine from the late twelfth through the fifteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''The 'Trotula{{'}}'', p. xi.  See also Monica H. Green, âMedieval Gynecological Texts:  A Handlist,â in Monica H. Green, ''Womenâs Healthcare in the Medieval West: Texts and Contexts'' (Aldershot:  Ashgate, 2000), Appendix, pp. 1-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearly 200 extant manuscripts (Latin and vernacular) of the ''Trotula'' represent only a small portion of the original number that circulated around Europe from the late 12th century to the end of the 15th century. Certain versions of the ''Trotula'' enjoyed a pan-European circulation. These works reached their peak popularity in Latin around the turn of the 14th century. The many medieval vernacular translations carried the texts' popularity into the 15th century and, in Germany and England, the 16th.

===Circulation in Latin===
All three ''Trotula'' texts circulated for several centuries as independent texts. Each is found in several different versions, likely due to the interventions of later editors or scribes.&lt;ref name="Green, Monica H. 1996"&gt;Green, Monica H.  âThe Development of the ''Trotula'',â ''Revue dâHistoire des Textes'' 26 (1996), 119-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Already by the late 12th century, however, one or more anonymous editors recognized the inherent relatedness of the three independent Salernitan texts on women's medicine and cosmetics, and so brought them together into a single ensemble. In all, when she surveyed the entire extant corpus of ''Trotula'' manuscripts in 1996, Green identified eight different versions of the Latin ''Trotula'' ensemble. These versions differ sometimes in wording, but more obviously by the addition, deletion, or rearrangement of certain material.&lt;ref name="Green, Monica H. 1996"/&gt; The so-called "standardized ensemble" reflects the most mature stage of the text, and it seemed especially attractive in university settings.&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''The 'Trotula{{'}}'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of known owners of the Latin ''Trotula'' in all its forms showed it not simply in the hands of learned physicians throughout western and central Europe, but also in the hands of monks in England, Germany, and Switzerland; surgeons in Italy and Catalonia; and even certain kings of France and England.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 325-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval vernacular translations===
The trend toward using vernacular languages for medical writing began in the 12th century, and grew increasingly in the later Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;William Crossgrove, "The Vernacularization of Science, Medicine, and Technology in Late Medieval Europe:  Broadening Our Perspectives," ''Early Science and Medicine'' 5, no. 1 (2000), pp. 47-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The many vernacular translations of the ''Trotula'' were therefore part of a general trend. The first known translation was into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], made somewhere in southern France in the late 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ron BarkaÃ¯, ''A History of Jewish Gynaecological Texts in the Middle Ages'' (Leiden: Brill, 1998); and Carmen Caballero Navas, âAlgunos âsecretos de mujeresâ revelados: El ''Å eâar yaÅ¡ub'' y la recepciÃ³n y transmisiÃ³n del ''Trotula'' en hebreo [Some âsecrets of womenâ revealed. The ''Sheâar yaÅ¡ub'' and the reception and transmission of the ''Trotula'' in Hebrew],â ''MiscelÃ¡nea de Estudios Ãrabes y Hebraicos, secciÃ³n Hebreo'' 55 (2006), 381-425.&lt;/ref&gt; The next translations, in the 13th century, were into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Old French]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Hunt, ''Anglo-Norman Medicine'', 2 vols. (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1994-1997), 2:76-115; Tony Hunt, âObstacles to Motherhood,â in ''Motherhood, Religion, and Society in Medieval Europe, 400-1400: Essays Presented to Henrietta Leyser'', ed. C. Leyser and L. Smith (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), pp. 205-212; Monica H. Green, âMaking Motherhood in Medieval England: The Evidence from Medicine,â in ''Motherhood, Religion, and Society in Medieval Europe, 400-1400: Essays Presented to Henrietta Leyser'', ed. Conrad Leyser and Lesley Smith (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), pp. 173-203.&lt;/ref&gt; And in the 14th and 15th centuries, there are translations in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Middle English]], [[French language|French]] (again), [[German language|German]], [[Irish language|Irish]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.

The ''Trotula'' Ensemble of Manuscripts'', http://www.ucc.ie/celt/trotula.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, a Catalan translation of one of the ''Trotula'' texts has been discovered in a 15th-century medical miscellany, held by the Biblioteca Riccardiana in Florence. This fragmentary translation of the ''De curis mulierum'' is here collated by the copyist (probably a surgeon making a copy for his own use) with a Latin version of the text, highlighting the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Montserrat CabrÃ© i Pairet, âTrota, TrÃ²tula i ''TrÃ²tula'': autoria i autoritat femenina en la medicina medieval en catalÃ ,â in ''Els manuscrits, el saber i les lletres a la Corona dâAragÃ³, 1250-1500,'' ed. Lola Badia, LluÃ­s Cifuentes, SadurnÃ­ MartÃ­, Josep Pujol (Montserrat: Publicacions de LâAbadia de Montserrat, 2016), pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of vernacular translations suggests that the ''Trotula'' texts were finding new audiences. Almost assuredly they were, but not necessarily women. Only seven of the nearly two dozen medieval translations are explicitly addressed to female audiences, and even some of those translations were co-opted by male readers.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "In a Language Women Understand: The Gender of the Vernacular," chap. 4 of ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008).

J. Jefferson and A. Putter (Turnhout: Brepols, 2013), pp. 259-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented female owner of a copy of the ''Trotula'' is Dorothea Susanna von der Pfalz, Duchess of Saxony-Weimar (1544â92), who had made for her own use a copy of [[Johannes Hartlieb]]âs paired German translations of the pseudo-[[Albertus Magnus]] ''Secrets of Women'' and ''Das Buch Trotula''.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Trotula's" fame in the Middle Ages===
Medieval readers of the ''Trotula'' texts would have had no reason to doubt the attribution they found in the manuscripts, and so "Trotula" (assuming they understood the word as a personal name instead of a title) was accepted as an authority on women's medicine. The physician Petrus Hispanus (mid-13th century), for example, cited "domina Trotula" (Lady Trotula) multiple times in his section on women's gynecological and obstetrical conditions. The Amiens chancellor, poet, and physician, [[Richard de Fournival]] (d. 1260), commissioned a copy headed "Incipit liber Trotule sanatricis Salernitane de curis mulierum" ("Here begins the book of Trotula, the Salernitan female healer, on treatments for women").&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.  Part I: The Latin Manuscripts,â ''Scriptorium'' 50 (1996), 137-175, at pp. 157-58; and Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Two copies of the Latin ''Trotula'' ensemble include imaginative portrayals of the author; the pen-and-ink wash image found in an early 14th-century manuscript now held by the [[Wellcome Library]] is the most well-known image of "Trotula" (see image above).&lt;ref&gt;The other image is an historiated initial that opens the copy of the intermediate ensemble in Florence, Biblioteca Laurenziana, Plut. 73, cod. 37, 13th-century (Italy), ff. 2r-41r:  http://www.bml.firenze.sbn.it/Diaita/schede/scheda15.htm.  Both manuscripts are described in Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.  Part I: The Latin Manuscripts,â ''Scriptorium'' 50 (1996), 137-175, at pp. 146-47 and 153.&lt;/ref&gt; A few 13th-century references to "Trotula," however, cite her only as an authority on cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that "Trotula" was the ultimate authority on the topic of women's medicine even caused works authored by others to be attributed to her, such as a 15th-century [[Middle English]] compendium on gynecology and obstetrics based on the works of the male authors [[Gilbertus Anglicus]] and Muscio, which in one of its four extant copies was called the ''Liber Trotularis''.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green and Linne R. Mooney, âThe Sickness of Womenâ, in ''Sex, Aging, and Death in a Medieval Medical Compendium: Trinity College Cambridge MS R.14.52, Its Texts, Language, and Scribe'', ed. M. Teresa Tavormina, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Texts and Studies, 292, 2 vols. (Tempe, AZ: Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, pp. 455-568.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 14th-century Catalan author entitled his work primarily focused on women's cosmetics ''Lo libre . . . al qual a mes nom Trotula'' ("The Book&amp;nbsp;... which is called 'Trotula'").&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called Trotula Texts.  Part II: The Vernacular Texts and Latin Re-Writings,â Scriptorium 51 (1997), 80-104, at p. 103; and Montserrat CabrÃ© i Pairet, âFrom a Master to a Laywoman: A Feminine Manual of Self-Helpâ, ''Dynamis: Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam'' 20 (2000), 371â93, http://www.ugr.es/~dynamis/completo20/PDF/Dyna-12.PDF, accessed 02/14/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside "her" role as a medical authority, "Trotula" came to serve a new function starting in the 13th century:  that of a mouthpiece for misogynous views on the nature of women. In part, this was connected to a general trend to acquire information about the "secrets of women", that is, the processes of generation. When the Munich physician [[Johannes Hartlieb]] (d. 1468) made a German translation of the ''Trotula'', he not only elevated "Trotula's" status to that of a queen, but also paired the text with the pseudo-Albertan ''Secrets of Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), chap. 5, esp. pp. 212-14 and 223; Kristian Bosselmann-Cyran, (ed.), âSecreta mulierumâ mit Glosse in der deutschen Bearbeitung von Johann Hartlieb, WÃ¼rzburger medizinhistorische Forschungen, 36 (Pattensen/Hannover: Horst Wellm, 1985); "Ein weiterer Textzeuge von Johann Hartliebs ''Secreta mulierum''-und ''Buch Trotula''-Bearbeitung: Der MailÃ¤nder Kodex AE.IX.34 aus der Privatbibliothek des Arztes und Literaten Albrecht von Haller," ''WÃ¼rzburger medizinhistorische Mitteilungen'' 13 (1995), 209â15.&lt;/ref&gt; A text called ''Placides and Timeus'' attributed to "Trotula" a special authority both because of what she "felt in herself, since she was a woman", and because "all women revealed their inner thoughts more readily to her than to any man and told her their natures." &lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is echoing this attitude when he includes "Trotula's" name in his "Book of Wicked Wives," a collection of anti-matrimonial and misogynous tracts owned by the Wife of Bath's fifth husband, Jankyn, as told in [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] (Prologue, (D), 669â85) of [[The Canterbury Tales]].

==The modern legacy of the ''Trotula''==

=== Renaissance editions of the ''Trotula'' and early debates about authorship ===
The ''Trotula'' texts first appeared in print in 1544, quite late in the trend toward printing, which for medical texts had begun in the 1470s. The ''Trotula'' was published not because it was still of immediate clinical use to learned physicians (it had been superseded in that role by a variety of other texts in the 15th century),&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but because it had been newly "discovered" as a witness to empirical medicine by a Strasbourg publisher, Johannes Schottus.  Schottus persuaded a physician colleague, Georg Kraut, to edit the ''Trotula'', which Schottus then included in a volume he called ''Experimentarius medicinae'' ("Collection of Tried-and-True Remedies of Medicine"), which also included the ''Physica'' of [[Trota of Salerno]]'s near contemporary, [[Hildegard of Bingen]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Monica H. Green, âIn Search of an âAuthenticâ Womenâs Medicine: The Strange Fates of Trota of Salerno and Hildegard of Bingen,â Dynamis: Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam 19 (1999), 25-54; available on-line at http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Dynamis/article/view/106141/150117, at pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Kraut, seeing the disorder in the texts, but not recognizing that it was really the work of three separate authors, rearranged the entire work into 61 themed chapters. He also took the liberty of altering the text here and there. As Green has noted, "The irony of Kraut's attempt to endow 'Trotula' with a single, orderly, fully rationalized text was that, in the process, he was to obscure for the next 400 years the distinctive contributions of the historic woman Trota."&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âThe Development of the ''Trotula'',â ''Revue dâHistoire des Textes'' 26 (1996), 119-203, at p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraut (and his publisher, Schottus) retained the attribution of the text(s) to "Trotula." In fact, in applying a singular new title--''Trotulae curandarum aegritudinum muliebrium ante, in, &amp; postpartum Liber'' ("The Book of Trotula on the Treatment of the Diseases of Women before, during, and after Birth")--Kraut and Schottus proudly emphasized "Trotula's" feminine identity. Schottus praised her as "a woman by no means of the common sort, but rather one of great experience and erudition."&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âIn Search of an âAuthenticâ Womenâs Medicine: The Strange Fates of Trota of Salerno and Hildegard of Bingen,â Dynamis: Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam 19 (1999), 25-54; available on-line at http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Dynamis/article/view/106141/150117, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In his "cleaning up" of the text, Kraut had suppressed all obvious hints that this was a medieval text rather than an ancient one. When the text was next printed, in 1547 (all subsequent printings of the ''Trotula'' would recycle Kraut's edition), it appeared in a collection called ''Medici antiqui omnes qui latinis litteris diversorum morborum genera &amp; remedia persecuti sunt, undique conquisiti'' ("[The Writings of] All Ancient Latin Physicians Who Described and Collected the Types and Remedies of Various Diseases").  From then until the 18th century, the ''Trotula'' was treated as if it were an ancient text. As Green notes, "'Trotula', therefore, in contrast to Hildegard, survived the scrutiny of Renaissance humanists because she was able to escape her medieval associations. But it was this very success that would eventually 'unwoman' her.  When the ''Trotula'' was reprinted in eight further editions between 1550 and 1572, it was not because it was the work of a woman but because it was the work of an ''antiquissimus auctor'' ("a very ancient author")."&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âIn Search of an âAuthenticâ Womenâs Medicine: The Strange Fates of Trota of Salerno and Hildegard of Bingen,â Dynamis: Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam 19 (1999), 25-54; available on-line at http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Dynamis/article/view/106141/150117, at p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Trotula" was "unwomaned" in 1566 by Hans Caspar Wolf, who was the first to incorporate the ''Trotula'' into a collection of gynecological texts. Wolf emended the author's name from "Trotula" to Eros, a freed male slave of the Roman empress Julia: "The book of womenâs matters of Eros, physician [and] freedman of Julia, whom some have absurdly named âTrotulaâ" (''Erotis medici liberti Iuliae, quem aliqui Trotulam inepte nominant, muliebrium liber''). The idea came from [[Hadrianus Junius]] (Aadrian DeJonghe, 1511â75), a Dutch physician who believed that textual corruptions accounted for many false attributions of ancient texts. As Green has noted, however, even though the erasure of "Trotula" was more an act of humanist editorial zeal than blatant misogyny, the fact that there were now no female authors left in the emerging canon of writers on gynecology and obstetrics was never noted.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 279-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern debates about authorship and "Trotula's" existence===
If "Trotula" as a female author had no use to humanist physicians, that was not necessarily true of other intellectuals. In 1681, the Italian historian Antonio Mazza resurrected "Trotula" in 1681 in his ''Historiarum Epitome de rebus salernitanis'' ("Epitome of the Histories of Salerno"). Here is the origin of the belief that "Trotula" held a chair at the university of Salerno:  "There flourished in the fatherland, teaching at the university [studium] and lecturing from their professorial chairs, Abella, Mercuriadis, Rebecca, Trotta (whom some people call "Trotula"), all of whom ought to be celebrated with marvelous encomia (as Tiraqueau has noted), as well as Sentia Guarna (as Fortunatus Fidelis has said)."&lt;ref name="raco.cat"&gt;Monica H. Green, âIn Search of an âAuthenticâ Womenâs Medicine: The Strange Fates of Trota of Salerno and Hildegard of Bingen,â ''Dynamis: Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam'' 19 (1999), 25-54, at p. 39; available on-line at http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Dynamis/article/view/106141/150117.&lt;/ref&gt; Green has suggested that this fiction (Salerno had no university in the 12th century, so there were no professorial chairs for men or women) may have been due to the fact that three years earlier, "[[Elena Cornaro Piscopia|Elena Cornaro]] received a doctorate in philosophy at Padua, the first formal Ph.D. ever awarded to a woman. Mazza, concerned to document the glorious history of his patria, Salerno, may
have been attempting to show that Padua could not claim priority in having produced female professors."&lt;ref name="raco.cat"/&gt;

In 1773 in Jena, C. G. Gruner challenged the idea that the ''Trotula'' was an ancient text, but he also dismissed the idea that "Trotula" could have been the text's author (working with Kraut's edition, he, too, thought it was a single text) since she was cited internally.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "In Search of an 'Authentic' Womenâs Medicine: The Strange Fates of Trota of Salerno and Hildegard of Bingen,â ''Dynamis: Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam'' 19 (1999), 25-54, at p. 40; available on-line at http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Dynamis/article/view/106141/150117.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is the story of [[Trota of Salerno]]'s cure of the woman with "wind" in the womb in the ''De curis mulierum''.) And so the stage was set for debates about "Trotula" in the 19th and 20th centuries. For those who wanted a representative of Salernitan excellence and/or female achievement, "she" could be reclaimed from the humanists' erasure. For skeptics (and there were many grounds for skepticism), it was easy to find cause for doubt that there was really any female medical authority behind this chaotic text. This was the state of affairs in the 1970s, when [[second-wave feminism]] discovered "Trotula" anew.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Mosher Stuard, "Dame Trot," ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' 1, no. 2 (Winter 1975), 537-42, {{JSTOR|3173063}}.  The same phenomenon occurred in Italy:  P. Cavallo Boggi (ed.), M. Nubie and A. Tocco (transs.), ''Trotula de Ruggiero : Sulle malatie delle donne'' (Turin, 1979), an Italian translation based on the 1547 Aldine (Venice) edition of Kraut's altered text.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inclusion of "Trotula" as an invited guest at [[Judy Chicago]]'s feminist art installation, ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' (1974â79), insured that the debate would continue.

===The reclamation of [[Trota of Salerno]] in modern scholarship===
From 1544 up through the 1970s, all claims about an alleged author "Trotula," pro or con, were based on Georg Kraut's Renaissance printed text. But that was a fiction, in that it had erased all last signs that the ''Trotula'' had been compiled out of the works of three different authors. In 1985, [[California Institute of Technology]] historian [[John F. Benton]] published a study surveying previous thinking on the question of "Trotula's" association with the ''Trotula'' texts.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Benton, "Trotula, Womenâs Problems, and the Professionalization of Medicine
in the Middle Ages," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 59, no. 1 (Spring 1985), 30â53.&lt;/ref&gt; That study was important for three major reasons. (1) Although some previous scholars had noted discrepancies between the printed Renaissance editions of the ''Trotula'' and the text(s) found in medieval manuscripts, Benton was the first to prove how extensive the Renaissance editor's emendations had been.  This was not one text, and there was no "one" author. Rather, it was three different texts. (2) Benton dismantled several of the myths about "Trotula" that had been generated by 19th- and early 20th-century scholarship.  For example, the epithet "de Ruggiero" attached to her name was sheer invention. Likewise, claims about her date of birth or death, or who "her" husband or sons were had no foundation. (3) Most importantly, Benton announced his discovery of the ''Practica secundum Trotam'' ("Practical Medicine According to Trota") in a manuscript now in Madrid, which established the historic [[Trota of Salerno]]'s claim to have existed and been an author.

After Benton's death in 1988, Monica H. Green picked up the task of publishing a new translation of the ''Trotula'' that could be used by students and scholars of the history of medicine and medieval women. However, Benton's own discoveries had rendered irrelevant any further reliance on the Renaissance edition, so Green undertook a complete survey of all the extant Latin manuscripts of the ''Trotula'' and a new edition of the ''Trotula'' ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.  Part I: The Latin Manuscripts,â ''Scriptorium'' 50 (1996), 137-175; Monica H. Green, âA Handlist of the Latin and Vernacular Manuscripts of the So-Called ''Trotula'' Texts.  Part II: The Vernacular Texts and Latin Re-Writings,â ''Scriptorium'' 51 (1997), 80-104; Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Womenâs Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Green has disagreed with Benton in his claim that all the ''Trotula'' treatises were male-authored.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, pp. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, while Green agrees with Benton that male authorship of the ''Conditions of Women'' and ''Women's Cosmetics'' is probable, Green has demonstrated that not simply is the ''De curis mulierum'' (On Treatments for Women) directly attributed to the historic [[Trota of Salerno]] in the earliest known version (where it was still circulating independently),&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âThe Development of the Trotula,â ''Revue dâHistoire des Textes'' 26 (1996), 119-203, at pp. 137 and 152-57.&lt;/ref&gt; but that the text shows clear parallels to passages in other works associated with Trota and suggests strongly an intimate access to the female patient's body that, given the cultural restrictions of the time, would have likely only been allowed to a female practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, âReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,â in ''La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi'', ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale âLa Scuola medica Salernitanaâ, 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo, 2007), 183-233; and Monica H. Green, ''Making Womenâs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 29-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Trotula's" fame in popular culture===
Perhaps the best known popularization of "Trotula" was in the artwork ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' (1979) by [[Judy Chicago]], now on permanent exhibit at the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Museum of Art]], which features a place setting for "Trotula."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings Place Settings]. Brooklyn Museum. Retrieved on 2015-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction here (based on publications prior to Benton's discovery of [[Trota of Salerno]] in 1985) presents a conflation of alleged biographical details that are no longer accepted by scholars. Chicago's celebration of "Trotula" no doubt led to the proliferation of modern websites that mention her, many of which repeat without correction the discarded misunderstandings noted above.&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Museum itself has never updated its information on "Trotula," retaining, for example, the erroneous claim that she died in 1097 and that she was a "professor" at the medical school of Salerno. https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings/trotula&lt;/ref&gt; A [http://www.fgz-dietrotula.at/ clinic in Vienna] and a [http://nuove-strade.it/campania/salerno/via-trotula-de-ruggiero-2/ street in modern Salerno] and even a [[wikipedia:List of coronae on Venus|corona on the planet Venus]] have been named after "Trotula," all mistakenly perpetuating fictions about "her" derived from popularizing works like that of Chicago. Likewise, medical writers, in trying to indicate the history of women in their field, or the history of certain gynecological conditions, keep recycling outworn understandings of "Trotula" (or even inventing new misunderstandings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mistakinghistories.wordpress.com/2017/06/08/making-a-disease-from-a-remedy-trotula-and-vaginismus/|title=Making a disease from a remedy: Trotula and vaginismus|last=King|first=Helen|date=2017-06-08|website=Mistaking Histories|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Chicago's elevation of both "Trotula" and the real Trota's contemporary, the religious and medical writer [[Hildegard of Bingen]], as important medical figures in 12th-century Europe, did flag the importance of how historical remembrances of these women were created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; That it took close to twenty years for Benton and Green to extract the historic woman Trota from the composite text of the ''Trotula'' was a function of the complicated textual tradition and the broad proliferation of the texts in the Middle Ages. That it is taking even longer for popular understandings of Trota and "Trotula" to catch up with this scholarship, has raised the question whether celebrations of Women's History ought not include more recognition of the processes by which that record is discovered and assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historiann.com/2017/03/04/more-process-more-complicated-product-monica-green-on-twitter-digital-disinformation-and-womens-history-month/|title=More process, more complicated product?

'''US beef imports in Japan''' were a contentious issue in [[JapanâUnited States relations]] after [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] was detected in a steer in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].
 
==Import ban==
In late 2003, Japan suspended all imports of American beef due to a single [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|BSE]] case in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, Japan agreed to remove the restriction on importing US beef. However, in January imports stopped again because inspectors found banned cattle parts in a veal shipment from the U.S. 

Japan again halted all imports of US beef in January 2006âjust six weeks after the [[Japanese government]] began to allow boneless beef from animals younger than 21 months into Japan after a two-year banâbecause of bone material found in a shipment of [[veal]] from [[New York State]]. US Agriculture Secretary [[Mike Johanns]] conceded that the shipment had violated the Japanese regulations. Hong Kong, [[South Korea]] and Singapore had quickly followed Japan's lead in relaxing the import restrictions. In 2003, Japan accounted for $1.4 billion of the $3.9 billion in global sales of American beef and meat products; there had been two cases of BSE in the United States and 21 cases in Japan at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Michiko Kamiyama from Food Safety Citizen Watch and Yoko Tomiyama, [[Consumers Union of Japan]], said about this: "The government has put priority on the political schedule between the two countries, not on food safety or human health."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fswatch.org/newsletter/english/issue05.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, CUJ was highly critical of the resumption of imports to Japan of beef from the United States due to fears about BSE. "This conclusion was made politically and hastily in response to the American demand that we resume beef imports from the United States," said Yasuaki Yamaura to [[CBS News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/19/health/main656645.shtml | publisher=CBS News | title=Japan Close To Lifting Beef Ban | date=19 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
