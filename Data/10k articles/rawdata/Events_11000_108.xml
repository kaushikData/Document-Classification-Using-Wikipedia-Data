On 6 September 1952, a prototype [[de Havilland DH.110]] jet fighter crashed during an aerial display at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] in Hampshire, England, killing 31 people. The jet disintegrated mid-air during an [[aerobatic manoeuvre]], causing the death of pilot [[John Derry]] and onboard flight test observer Anthony Richards. Debris from the aircraft fell onto a crowd of spectators, killing 29 people and injuring 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rivas |first1=Brian |last2=Bullen |first2=Annie |author3=Duke, Neville (forward) |year=1982 |title=John Derry: The Story of Britain's First Supersonic Pilot |publisher=William Kimber |isbn=0-7183-0099-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-OTD"&gt;{{Cite news

The cause of the break-up was later determined to be [[structural failure]] due to a design flaw in the wing's [[leading edge]]. All DH.110s were initially grounded, but after modification to its design, the type entered service with the [[Royal Navy]] as the Sea Vixen.

Strict safety procedures were subsequently enacted for UK [[air show]]s and there were no further spectator fatalities until the [[2015 Shoreham Airshow crash]] in which 11 people died.{{efn|Four spectators were killed, however, while on a helicopter experience at the [[Biggin Hill Air Show]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaib.gov.uk/sites/aaib/publications/formal_reports/2_1978_g_avsn_and_g_ande.cfm |title=2/1978  Agusta Bell 206B, G-AVSN and DH82A Tiger Moth, G-ANDE, 15 May 1977 |publisher=aaib.gov.uk |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34034430|title=Shoreham air crash death toll 'rises to 11'|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=23 August 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakup==
The planned demonstration of the DH.110 on that day was nearly cancelled when the aircraft at Farnborough, ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|WG 240]]'', an all-black [[night fighter]] prototype, became unserviceable. It was [[de Havilland]]'s second DH.110 prototype, and had been taken [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] over the show on the opening day.&lt;ref name="Flight-1952"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Farnborough Tragedy|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%202678.html|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=Flight and Aircraft Engineer|issue=2277|page=344|date=12 September 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derry and Richards then collected ''WG 236'', the first DH.110 prototype, from de Havilland's factory in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]], and flew it to Farnborough with just enough time to start their slot.

Following a supersonic dive and flypast from {{convert|40,000|ft}} and during a left bank at about {{convert|450|kn}} toward the air show's 120,000 spectators, the pilot pulled up into a climb. In less than a second, the aircraft disintegrated: the outer sections of the wing, both engines and the cockpit separated from the airframe. The cockpit, with the two crew members still inside, fell right in front of the spectators nearest the runway, injuring several people. The engines travelled much further on a [[ballistic trajectory]]; one engine crashed harmlessly, but the second one ploughed into the so-called Observation Hill, causing most of the fatalities. The rest of the airframe fluttered down and crashed on the opposite side of the runway.&lt;ref name="BBC-witness"&gt;{{Cite news

One eyewitness was Richard Gardner, then five years old. He recalled in adulthood:&lt;ref&gt;Jet! When Britain Ruled the Skies. 1. Military Marvels. First broadcast BBC Four 22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I'll never forget, it looked like confetti, looked like silver confetti. The remaining airframe floated down right in front of us. It just came down like a leaf. And then the two engines, like two missiles, shot out of the airframe and hurtled in the direction of the airshow. There was a sort of silence, then people, one or two people screamed but mostly it was just a sort of shock. You could hear some people sort of whimpering which was quite shocking.}}

Sixty-three years later, speaking on the BBC [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'']] radio programme in the wake of the [[Shoreham Airshow disaster]], author Moyra Bremner recalled her own traumatic experience.  A huge bang silenced the crowd and was followed by "My God, look out" from the commentator.  Bremner, standing on the roof of her parents' car, realised that an engine was heading straight towards her. It passed a few feet over her head, a "massive shining cylinder", and then plunged into the crowd on the hill behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b066vws8|title=BBC Radio 4 Today|station =BBC Radio 4| airdate=25 August 2015| minutes=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the accident the air display programme continued once the debris was cleared from the runway, with [[Neville Duke]] exhibiting the prototype [[Hawker Hunter]] and taking it supersonic over the show later that day.

==Aftermath==
[[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Duncan Sandys]], the [[Minister of Supply]], both sent messages of condolence.&lt;ref name="BBC-OTD"/&gt; The coroner's jury recorded that Derry and Richards had "died accidentally in the normal course of their duty", and that "the deaths [of the spectators] were accidental", adding that "no blame is attached to Mr. John Derry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%202755.html|title=The Farnborough Accident|journal=Flight |date=19 September 1952 |page=377 |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation concluded that the manoeuvring had caused an [[airframe]] instability because of a faulty D-nose leading edge arrangement (which had successfully been used in the lighter subsonic [[de Havilland Vampire]]). The redesigned DH.110 resumed flights in June 1953 and was eventually developed into the de Havilland Sea Vixen naval fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

More stringent airshow safety measures were subsequently introduced: jets were obliged to keep at least {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}} from crowds if flying straight and {{convert|450|m|ft|abbr=on}} when performing manoeuvres, and always at an altitude of at least {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="BBC-OTD"/&gt;

'''Abdallah Higazy''' is a citizen of [[Egypt]] residing in the United States who [[Lawsuit|sued]] alleging that the [[FBI]] [[duress|coerced]] a [[Confession (law)|confession]] from him.

==Arrest==
Higazy was arrested following the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]]. He alleges that the [[FBI]] threatened to [[torture]] his family unless he confessed to being involved in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402639.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Dan | last=Eggen | title=Second Court Ruling Redacts Information About Interrogation | date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in Manhattan, issued a decision holding that Higazy had stated a [[5th Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment]] claim, and then removed the decision from the court's website and shortly thereafter replaced it with a redacted version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf |first=Josh |url=http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13508_1-9803883-19.html |title=Court attempts to hide FBI threats to innocent man's family &amp;#124; Media Sphere - CNET News |publisher=Blogs.cnet.com |date=2007-10-24 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.psychsound.com/2007/10/a_tale_of_two_decisions_or_how.html |title=A tale of two decisions (or, how the FBI gets you to confess) (PsychSound by Steve Bergstein) |publisher=Psychsound.com |date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2014-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401122448/http://www.psychsound.com/2007/10/a_tale_of_two_decisions_or_how.html |archivedate=2014-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA1LTQxNDgtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/05-4148-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irlf97f/1/hilite] {{deadlink|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redacted version omitted approximately one page of details relating to the FBI's alleged interrogation of Higazy during a [[polygraph]] examination. On September 24, 2009, Abdallah was paid approximately $250,000 by the FBI for his treatment and wrongful detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/nyregion/25higazy.html?hp | work=The New York Times | first=Benjamin | last=Weiser | title=9/11 Wrongful-Accusation Suit Settled | date=September 25, 2009|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts as stated by the court==
According to the original opinion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howappealing.law.com/HigazyVsTempleton05-4148-cv_opnWithdrawn.pdf |title=Higazy v Millenium Hotel |publisher=Howappealing.law.com |accessdate=2014-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121080456/http://howappealing.law.com/HigazyVsTempleton05-4148-cv_opnWithdrawn.pdf# |archive-date=2013-01-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higazy was an Egyptian student staying at the [[Millenium&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE that "Millenium" is the correct spelling here.--&gt; Hilton Hotel]] near the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Hotel security claimed they found an aviation radio in Higazy's safe. The [[FBI]] questioned Higazy, guessing he might somehow have been communicating with or aiding the [[9/11]] pilots. Higazy denied he owned the radio.

The FBI wanted Higazy to be detained as a [[material witness]], but the federal judge allowed only a 10-day detention, because the evidence suggesting Higazy's involvement in 9/11 was not very strong. On the ninth day, an FBI agent conducted a polygraph test during which, according to Higazy, the agent told Higazy that unless Higazy confessed to owning the radio, they would "make sure that Egyptian security (gave) his family Hell," which both parties understood to include torture. Higazy confessed to owning the radio. A criminal complaint was then filed against Higazy, and he was detained without [[bail]].

Approximately three weeks later, the airline pilot who actually owned the radio returned to the {{Not a typo|Millenium}}&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE that "Millenium" is the correct spelling here.--&gt; Hilton Hotel to reclaim his property, which he had left at the hotel. Two days later, Higazy was released after spending a total of 34 days in custody.

==Subsequent media coverage==
The [[CBS]] television show ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interviewed Higazy in 2004, and the CBS website includes most of Higazy's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/26/60minutes/main602401.shtml | work=CBS News | title=A True Confession? | date=February 26, 2004|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A newspaper account of the redaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402639_2.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Dan | last=Eggen | title=Second Court Ruling Redacts Information About Interrogation | date=October 25, 2007|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes the clerk for the appellate court stating that the decision to reissue the opinion in redacted format was not done at the request of the Justice Department or the FBI, and that the redacted information was originally sealed for the safety of Higazy and his family.

The '''African Writers' Evening''' is the first regular evening held for African writers at the UK's Poetry Café. It was started in 2003 by [[Nii Ayikwei Parkes]] in consultation with the directors of the [[Poetry Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x-bout.com/awe/?page_id=2|title=African Writers Evening &amp;raquo; About|accessdate=28 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926110840/http://www.x-bout.com/awe/?page_id=2| archivedate= 26 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he completed a residency there. The solid reputation of African Writers' Evening is based on its ability to consistently identify and feature talented emerging writers.

Diana Evans and [[Hisham Matar]], for example, were both featured prior to the official releases of their début publications, two of 2007′s features Ken Kamoche and [[Sade Adeniran]] were shortlisted for the 2008 [[Commonwealth Prize]] for their first books, and [[Inua Ellams]] won an [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] First Award three years after his first featured appearance at African Writers' Evening in 2006. Recently, the event's founder Nii Ayikwei Parkes was himself shortlisted for the Commonwealth Prize and the November 2009 featured reader, [[Nadifa Mohamed]] won the 2010 [[Betty Trask Award]].

African Writers' Evening is held bi-monthly from March to November with occasional special events, such as the AWE Heritage Series launched at the [[Southbank Centre]] on 6 July 2009 and AWE/NYC, which was held at the Bowery Club in September 2009. While the event is still held mainly at the Poetry Café in [[Covent Garden]], a recent partnership with the [[Southbank Centre]] has seen the end-of-year reading in November held at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] since 2008.

==Policy==
African Writers' Evening features writers of all genres and defines "African" based on lived experience rather than simplistic notions of heritage. Featured writers have included white writers like [[Robyn Scott]], [[Isobel Dixon]] and [[Gillian Slovo]], as well as Africans of Indian origin such as Sharmila Chauhan.

==First event==
The first African Writers' Evening was held in July 2003 at the Poetry Café and featured Nii Ayikwei Parkes (who was writer-in-residence at the venue), [[Jessica Horn]], a Ugandan poet, and Abby Ajayi, a Nigerian-British short story and script writer. The event in its current format started in July 2004. Its tagline is: ''Where Africa speaks and the world listens''.

==History and expansion==
African Writers' Evening initially paid writers travel expenses and they read for free as a way of supporting the reading series. However, in September 2005, the series received funding from the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]] and began to pay the featured writers an appearance fee. This development allowed the series to begin flying writers in from abroad to share their work: [[Helon Habila]]'s appearance at the Royal Festival Hall in 2009 was part of this trend.

Since the New York event held in September 2009, African Writers' Evening appears to be on a path of expansion and collaboration. In April 2010, they held an event in Birmingham in collaboration with The Drum Theatre, the [[British Council]] and London Book Festival and in July 2010 a book sale event, named the African Book Market was held at the Poetry Café in partnership with major publishers, such as [[Random House]], as well as smaller outfits like [[Serpent's Tail]]. They also announced a book discussion initiative starting in September 2010.

==Organisation==
The event is run by a London-based collective called London Society, Literature, Arts and Music Central, abbreviated as London SLAM Central.

'''Bashmurian revolt''' ({{lang-arz|ثورة البشموريين}}) (also ''Peshmurian'' revolt) was the revolt of the [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] living in [[Bashmur]] in the northern [[Nile Delta]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;against the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], which occurred around 830. The revolt (and others previous) were attributed to oppressive taxation.&lt;ref name=Goddard-2000-71-quote&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Hugh|title=A History of Christian-Muslim Relations|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield.|isbn=1566633400|page=71|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq2oLEvHzl8C&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 January 2016|quote=Large-scale conversion to Islam in Egypt began during the eighth/second century and was very much linked with economic hardship.

The rebels expelled the state workers and raised the banner of rebellion refusing to pay tribute (special tax on non-Muslims called the [[jizya]]). Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]], who was visiting the province, put down the rebellion, arresting and killing large numbers of Copts and their dependants.  According to historian [[Ira M. Lapidus]], the crushing of the rebellion was followed by "despair" among the Copts and began a second wave of major persecution, which hadn't been seen since the entry of Islam to Egypt in 642.&lt;ref name=Goddard-2000-71&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Hugh|title=A History of Christian-Muslim Relations|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield.|isbn=1566633400|page=71|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq2oLEvHzl8C&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.M.

'''''Calendar Girls''''' (previously titled '''''The Girls''''') is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Gary Barlow]] and a book by [[Tim Firth]]. The show is based on the 2003 film [[Calendar Girls]], which is in turn based on a true story. The musical received its world premiere at the [[Grand Theatre, Leeds]] in 2015, before transferring to [[The Lowry]], Salford in January 2016. It went on to open in London's [[West End Theatre|West End]] at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in February 2017, with a UK Tour tour starting in October 2018.

== Synopsis ==
Annie's husband John dies from leukaemia at an early age. Her close friend Chris, wants to purchase a comfortable sofa for the visitors' lounge in the hospital where John was treated. She hits upon the idea of printing a calendar featuring some of the members of the Knapely branch of the [[Women's Institute]], discreetly posing nude while engaged in traditional WI activities, such as baking and knitting, in order to raise funds. Her proposal is initially met with great scepticism, but she eventually convinces ten women to participate in the project with her. They enlist one of the hospital workers, an amateur photographer named Lawrence, to help them with the calendar.
==Background==
The musical is based on the 2003 film ''[[Calendar Girls]]''. The film itself was produced on a budget of $10 million, earning over $96 million in global box office receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=calendargirls.htm | title=Calendar Girls | publisher=Box Office Mojo | work=boxofficemojo.com | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stage [[Calendar Girls (play)|play]] adaption was launched in 2008 at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cft.org.uk/calendar-girls#-Overview | title=Calender Girls Overview | publisher=[[Calendar Girls]] | work=cft.org.uk | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before embarking on a national tour and transferring to the [[West End theatre|West End]]'s [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/news/10-2008/calendar-girls-sets-london-dates-at-noel-coward_18795.html | title=Calendar Girls Sets London Dates at Noel Coward | publisher=Whats On Stage | work=whatsonstage.com | date=17 October 2008 | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Rally Championship''' is an automobile [[rallying]] championship sanctioned by the Canadian Association of RallySport (CARS) held since 1957 in [[Canada]].

==Canadian rallying history==
[[File:Kananaskis rally 2007.jpg|thumb|325px|left|Bryan Maplethorpe, in his open class 2002 [[Subaru Impreza WRX]] [[rally car]] at the 2007 [[Kananaskis Country|Kananaskis]] Rally in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].]]
The Canadian Rally Championship (CRC) is Canada's only national rallying series.  2007 marked the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110325005137/http://www.carsrally.ca/CARSRally/Default.aspx?tabid=128 50th anniversary] of the Canadian Rally Championship, making it the longest running motorsport series in Canada. It has been run continuously since 1957 when Leslie Chelminski and Les Stanley from [[Montreal]] shared the very first national rally title in a factory-prepared Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia. In the early days, the rally championship was based on a navigational (also called time-speed-distance or TSD) rally series which, at times, had as many as twenty events in the series.  The most notable Canadian car rallies in those days were the Canadian Winter Rally and the [http://www.shell-4000-rally.org Shell 4000].  Some Rally champions from the TSD era include Art Dempsey, Bill Silvera, and [[Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame]] inductees John Bird, Paul S. Manson, and Bruce D. Simpson.

As the sport gradually changed and adopted the European "stage" format, performance rallying became part of the Canadian motorsport picture.  As opposed to TSD rallies, where competitors are required to follow the organizer's schedule, travel below posted speed limits and otherwise adhere to the rules of the public roads they are traveling on, performance rallies incorporate high speed "special stages" on roads closed to vehicles other than the rally cars, which must be specially prepared with full safety equipment. In 1973, the Canadian Rally Championship became based solely on stage rallies, including the [http://www.tallpinesrally.com Rally of the Tall Pines], which is still the premier event, and is held in November every year.

==2018 CRC Season==
The CRC consists of 7 national events for 2018. These events take place on gravel or snow-covered roads from coast to coast.

[[File:Cenacle on Mount Zion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A view of the ''"Cenacle"'' in the upper floor of the [[David's Tomb]] Compound on [[Mount Zion]] as it exists today]]

The '''Cenacle''' (from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:cēnāculum|cēnāculum]]'' "dining room", later spelt [[coenaculum]] and [[semantic change|semantically drifting]] towards "upper room"), also known as the '''"Upper Room"''', is a room in the [[David's Tomb]] Compound in [[Jerusalem]], traditionally held to be the site of the [[Last Supper]]. 

The word is a derivative of the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''cēnō'', which means "I dine". The [[Gospel of Mark]] employs the [[Koine Greek]]: αναγαιον, ''anagaion'', ({{bibleverse||Mark|14:15|NKJV}}), whereas the [[Acts of the Apostles]] uses [[Koine Greek]]: ύπερωιον, ''hyperōion'' ({{bibleverse||Acts|1:13|NKJV}}), both with the meaning "upper room". The language in Acts suggests that the [[apostles]] used the Upper Room as a temporary residence ([[Koine Greek]]: οὗ ἦσαν καταμένοντες, ''hou ēsan katamenontes''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/1.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Acts 1, accessed 24 September 2016: "The eleven were the tenants of the upper room, to which the other disciples resorted for conference and communion".&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary]] disagrees, preferring to see the room as a place where they were "not lodged, but had for their place of rendezvous".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/1.htm Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary] on Acts 1, accessed 24 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome]] used the Latin ''coenaculum'' for both Greek words in his Latin Vulgate translation. In [[Christian]] tradition, the ''"Upper Room"'' was not only the site of the Last Supper (i.e. the ''Cenacle''), but the room in which the Holy Spirit alighted upon the eleven apostles after Easter. It is sometimes thought to be the place where the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]]s stayed in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and, according to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], it was "the first Christian [[Church (building)|church]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Jerusalem (A.D. 71–1099)]: "During the [[Early Christianity|first Christian centuries]] the church at this place was the centre of Christianity in Jerusalem, "Holy and glorious Sion, mother of all churches" (Intercession in "[[Liturgy of St. James|St. James' Liturgy]]", ed. Brightman, p. 54). Certainly no spot in Christendom can be more venerable than the place of the Last Supper, which became the first Christian church."&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Cenacle'' is considered the site where many other events described in the [[New Testament]] took place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/pope/10GPen/12/12GPsh05.html|publisher=Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land|title=The Cenacle|accessdate=20 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915021728/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/pope/10GPen/12/12GPsh05.html#|archive-date=2008-09-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist+Information/Christian+Themes/Details/The+Coenaculum+++chr.htm|work=www.goisrael.com|publisher=Israel Ministry of Tourism|title=The Coenaculum|accessdate=20 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621050618/http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist+Information/Christian+Themes/Details/The+Coenaculum+++chr.htm#|archive-date=2009-06-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

* the descent of the [[Holy Spirit]] upon the disciples on the day of [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|2:1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pilgrims to Jerusalem report visiting a structure on Mount Zion commemorating the Last Supper since the fourth century CE. Some scholars would have it that this was the Cenacle, in fact a synagogue from an earlier time. The anonymous pilgrim from Bordeaux, France reported seeing such a synagogue in 333 CE. A Christian synagogue is mentioned in the apocryphal fourth-century ''Anaphora Pilati'' ("Report of Pilate"). But a Jewish origin for the building has come under serious question for which see below. The building has experienced numerous cycles of destruction and reconstruction, culminating in the Gothic structure which stands today.

While the term "Cenacle" refers only to the Upper Room, the building contains another site of interest. A niche located on the lower level of the same building is associated by tradition with the [[David's Tomb|burial site of King David]], marked by a large [[cenotaph]]-[[sarcophagus]] first reported seen by [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th-century]] Crusaders but earlier mentioned in the 10th-century ''Vita Constantini''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Constantini'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Most accept the notice in 1 Kings 2:10&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|2:10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that says David was buried "in the City of David", identified as the eastern hill of ancient Jerusalem, as opposed to what is today called ''Mount Sion'', which is  the western hill of the ancient city.  The general location of the ''Cenacle'' is also associated with that of the house where the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] lived among the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] until her death or ''dormition'', an event celebrated in the nearby ''[[Dormition Abbey|Church of the Dormition]]''.

===History===
[[File:Jerusalem (5564346422).jpg|thumb|The [[mihrab]]]]
[[File:Abendmahlssaal.jpg|thumb|Another view of the cenacle today]]
{{see also|Jerusalem in Christianity}}

The early history of the Cenacle site is uncertain; scholars have made attempts at establishing a chronology based on archaeological and artistic evidence as well as historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Bargil Pixner, "The Church of the Apostles found on Mount Zion," ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 16.3 May/June 1990 (http:www.centuryone.org/apostles.html); David Christian Clausen, ''The Upper Room and Tomb of David: The History, Art and Archaeology of the Cenacle on Mount Zion'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bargil Pixner, for example, following the survey conducted by Jacob Pinkerfeld in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Pinkerfeld, "'David's Tomb': Notes on the History of the Building: Preliminary Report," ''Bulletin of the Louis Rabinowitz Fund for the Exploration of Ancient Synagogues'' 3, ed. Michael Avi-Yonah (Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1960): 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that the original building was a [[synagogue]] later probably used by [[Jewish Christians]]. However, no architectural features associated with early synagogues such as columns, benches, or other accoutrements are present in the lower Tomb chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Clausen, 168-175&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], bishop of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] writing towards the end of the 4th century, the building and its environs were spared during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] under [[Titus]] (AD 70).&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''On Weights and Measures'' 14 (54c).&lt;/ref&gt; Pixner suggests that the area on Mount Zion was destroyed and that the Cenacle was rebuilt in the later first century.&lt;ref&gt;Bargil Pixner, ''Paths of the Messiah and Sites of the Early Church from Galilee to Jerusalem: Jesus and Jewish Christianity in Light of Archaeological Discoveries'', ed. Rainer Riesner, trans. Keith Myrick and Sam and Miriam Randall (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2010), 332-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest courses of [[ashlar]]s (building stones) along the north, east and south walls are attributed by Pinkerfeld to the late Roman period (135-325 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Pinkerfeld, ''Notes''.&lt;/ref&gt; Pixner believes rather that they are Herodian-period ashlars, allowing him to date the construction of the building to an earlier period.&lt;ref&gt;Pixner, ''Paths'' 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars, however, date the walls' earliest construction to the Byzantine period and identify the Cenacle as the remains of a no-longer-extant ''Hagia Sion'' ("Holy Zion") basilica.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Taylor, ''Christians and the Holy Places: The Myth of Jewish-Christian Origins'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), 215; Oskar Skarsaune, ''In the Shadow of the Temple: Jewish Influences on Early Christianity'' (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2002), 189; Denys Pringle, ''The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A Corpus'', Vol. 3, ''The City of Jerusalem'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman emperor Theodosius I constructed the five-aisled Hagia Sion basilica likely between 379 and 381 CE.&lt;ref&gt;David Christian Clausen, ''The Upper Room and Tomb of David: The History, Art and Archaeology of the Cenacle on Mount Zion'' (Jefferson , NC: McFarland, 2016), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the opinion of those scholars who would characterize the Cenacle as a remainder of Theodosius's basilica, sixth-century artistic representations, such as the mosaics found in Madaba, Jordan (the "Madaba Map") and the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, depict a smaller structure just to the south of basilica. Some have identified this smaller structure as the Cenacle thus demonstrating its independence from, and possible prior existence to, the basilica.&lt;ref&gt;Pixner, ''Paths'' 349; Clausen, 49; Richard Mackowski, ''Jerusalem - City of Jesus: An Exploration of the Traditions, Writings, and Remains of the Holy City from the Time of Christ'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980), 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The basilica (and the Cenacle?) was later damaged by [[Sassanid Empire#Second Golden Era (498–622)|Persian invaders]] in 614 AD but restored by the patriarch [[Modestus of Jerusalem|Modestus]]. In AD 1009 the church was destroyed by the [[Muslim]] caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Hakim]]. Shortly afterward it was replaced by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] with a cathedral named for Saint Mary featuring a central nave and two side aisles. The Cenacle was either repaired or  enclosed by the Crusader church, occupying a portion of two aisles on the right (southern) side of the altar.&lt;ref name="Pringle 262"&gt;Pringle 262&lt;/ref&gt; The Crusader cathedral was destroyed soon afterward, in the late 12th or early 13th century, but the Cenacle remained. (Today, part of the site upon which the Byzantine and Crusader churches stood is believed to be occupied by the smaller Church of the Dormition and its associated Abbey.) Syrian Christians maintained the Cenacle until the 1330s when it passed into the custody of the [[Franciscan Order]] of Friars who managed the structure until 1524. At that time  Ottoman authorities took possession of the Cenacle converting it into a mosque. The Franciscans were completely evicted from their surrounding buildings in 1550. Architectural evidence remains of the period of Muslim control including the elaborate mihrab in the Last Supper room, the Arabic inscriptions on its walls, the qubba over the stairwell, and the minaret and dome atop the roof. Christians were not officially allowed to return until the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. The historical building is currently managed by the State of Israel Ministry of the Interior.

===Architecture===
Scholars offer wide-ranging dates and builders for the surviving Gothic-style Cenacle. Some believe that it was constructed by Crusaders just before Saladin’s conquest of Jerusalem in 1187, while others attribute it to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Frederick II, after he arrived in the city in 1229. Still others hold that it was not built in this form until the Franciscans acquired the site in the 1330s.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Plommer has written in favor of a date prior to 1187. See "The Cenacle on Mount Sion" in ''Crusader Art in the Twelfth Century'', edited by Jaroslav Folda (Oxford: B.A.R., 1982) pp. 139–166. Camille Enlart supports a date after 1229. See ''Les monuments des croisés dans le royaume de Jérusalem; architecture religieuse et civile'' (Paris: P. Geuthner, 1925). Peter Fergusson believes that the structure dates from the 12th century but was heavily modified by the Franciscans in the 14th century. See "The Refectory at Easby Abbey: Form and Iconography." In ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 71, No. 3 (Sep., 1989), pp. 334–351. The Franciscans themselves take credit for the building. See Fr. Eugene Hoade, Guide to the Holy Land (Jerusalem: Franciscan Printing Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Scarce documentation and disturbed structural features offer little strong support for any of these dates.&lt;ref&gt;Pilgrimage accounts are vague. See the accounts of Daniel the Abbot and John of Wuerzburg in ''Jerusalem Pilgrimage 1099–1185'', edited by John Wilkinson, Joyce Hill, and William H. Ryan (London: Hakluyt Society, 1988). Each describes the Cenacle simply as an "upper room" with no precise architectural consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its current state, the Cenacle is divided into six rib-vaulted bays. The bays are supported by three freestanding columns which bilaterally divide the space, as well as six pillars flanking the side walls. While the capital of the westernmost freestanding column is flush with the Cenacle’s interior wall, the column shaft itself is completely independent of the wall, leading scholars to consider the possibility that this wall was not original to the building.&lt;ref&gt;Plommer 169&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the column and pillar capitals offers clues, but not a solution, to the mystery of the current building’s origin.  The Corinthianesque capital between the second and third bays of the Cenacle is stylistically indicative of multiple geographical regions and chronological periods.  This capital’s spiky leaves, which tightly adhere to the volume of the column before erupting into scrolls, are in congruence with common outputs of the 12th century sculpture workshop at the Temple site in Jerusalem in the last years before Saladin’s conquest in 1187.&lt;ref&gt;See Zehava Jacoby, "The Workshop of the Temple Area in Jerusalem in the Twelfth Century: its Origin, Evolution, and Impact", ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte'', 45 Bd., H. 4 (1982), 325–394. Drilling is discussed on p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;  The workshop also frequently utilized drilling as an ornamental device.   The Jerusalem workshop included artists from diverse regions in the West, who brought stylistic traits with them from their native countries.  The workshop produced sculpture for many Crusader projects and other structures, such as the [[al-Aqsa mosque]].

This comparison allows for the support of the 12th century date of the Cenacle.  There are also, however, similar capitals which originated in workshops in southern Italy, a draw for scholars who wish to associate the building with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and the Sixth Crusade in 1229.  Examples can be seen in the Romanesque cathedral in [[Bitonto]], a small city near Bari, in southern Italy, and on column supports of the pulpit in the Pisa Baptistery, carved by Apulian-born sculptor Nicola Pisano around 1260.

The capitals of the freestanding columns are not identical.  The capital between the first and second bays seems either severely weathered or shallowly carved, and its volume is a marked contrast from the others.  It rises from the shaft in a straight cylinder, rather than in an inverted pyramid, and then flares only just before it intersects with the abacus.  The third capital, which now flanks the Cenacle’s western wall, is also unique among the three.  It is not decorated with a floral motif, rather, scrolling crockets spring from the base of the volume.  Enlart has proposed a comparison to buildings constructed by Frederick II in Apulia.&lt;ref&gt;Enlart 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of these column capitals does not yield significant evidence to link them to the 14th century and a potential Franciscan construction, nor does it definitively date them to the 12th or 13th century. The building remains a frustrating, but intriguing, mystery.

'''''Chains''''' is the first novel in the Seeds of America trilogy, a series of historical novels that follows the story of eleven- year- old Isabel, a Black American slave fighting for her and her younger sister's (Ruth) freedom while the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] is occurring. The story sets in New York in the years 1776 to 1777, when slavery was legal and common in the [[13 Colonies|colonies]].

Though the novel is fictional, the events in the story are actual events that occurred back then in the colonies. Some examples of these events are the failed plan of George Washington's assassination followed by the hanging of one of the conspirators, the capture of [[Fort Washington (Manhattan)|Fort Washington]], and the popular pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]].

The novel contains 45 chapters with the chapter numbers in [[Roman Numerals]] and the dates of the events in the chapter written right under the chapter number. Under the dates, Anderson has put in quotes from important documents at the time such as private letters, newspapers, the Common Sense pamphlet, the [[Declaration of Independence of the United States|Declaration of Independence]] of the United States, and even spoken opinions from various country leaders. This opening of each chapter gives a perspective of what Isabel might face in the chapter or something relating to the events of the chapter.

==Plot introduction==
Isabel and her younger sister, Ruth were supposed to be released from slavery as promised by their owner, Miss Mary Finch's will when she dies but unfortunately they landed in the hands of Miss Mary's nephew, Robert Finch, who claimed them as his property with the reason that there was no actual will in physical form. He then sold them to a Loyalist couple who brings them to New York away from their previous hometown, [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Isabel, determined to gain her and her sister's liberty, follows the advice of a servant boy named Curzon, who tells her to spy on her master and other Loyalists for any suspicious plans that could be reported back to the Patriots to use against the Loyalists.

==Characters==

===Isabel===
Protagonist and narrator of the novel, she is always striving her best to do anything she can to get her and her sister out of [[slavery]] and back to Rhode Island, where they belong. Though at a very young age—thirteen-years-old—she has a very tough character and is devoted to anything she does. Her cleverness helps her in her various tasks on spying the Loyalists and planning her escape. She is very nurturing towards her younger sister Ruth, knowing that she is the only person who can truly take care of her. She befriends a slave boy named Curzon who works for a Patriot, to whom she is a good friend he can always trust, which is shown when she desperately tried to deliver leftover food to Curzon, who is in prison; considering she knows the consequences of helping a Patriot when she herself is working for a Loyalist. She also shows a brave spirit when she stands up to Mrs. Lockton and demand the information on the whereabouts of Ruth, who Lockton said she has sold but in truth kept Ruth in hiding away from Isabel to weaken her. This action results in her being branded with ''I'' for ''insolence'' on her right cheek as a punishment for standing up to her master, but towards the end of the novel she sees this mark standing for her name Isabel, and is proud to have everyone know her name. On the night of the Queens Ball she makes her move on her way to freedom, bringing Curzon along with her.

===Ruth===
Isabel's five-year-old sister and also a slave. Ruth, who is suffering from [[epilepsy]], often encounters fits from this sickness. She does not talk very often and does what she is told without question, which becomes the more desirable slave to Mrs. Lockton and she would be kept in Mrs. Lockton's chamber for hours to be her personal maid. As a young child, she is sometimes stubborn, for example she asks for her baby doll every night before going to bed even though she knows that Mr. Robert Finch has taken away all their belongings. Her innocent and vulnerable nature makes her very dependent on Isabel.

===The Locktons===

====Elihu Lockton====
A [[Loyalist]] who is very self-centered and untrustworthy. His commitment to being a Loyalist is shown by his various attempts to get the rebels to join the British side; one of the attempts was to bribe them and hiding the money in his wife's linen chest to discourage suspicion.This attempt, however, was discovered thanks to Isabel's report on her spying tasks. He also had a plan to assassinate [[George Washington|President George Washington]] along with a group of Loyalists; unfortunately, their plan was also discovered by Isabel. At home, he is very abusive towards his wife, and he demands to be obeyed by everybody in the house.

====Anne Lockton====
Wife of Elihu Lockton, she is also a Loyalist though not as strongly committed as Elihu. Very abusive towards Isabel, both physically and mentally, she does not call her by name and instead calls her Sal; in return demanding Isabel refers to her as Madam. Her harsh and brutal character is shown in her [[Branding persons|branding]] Isabel as a punishment for standing up to her and running away afterward. She strongly dislikes Isabel, as opposed to her liking Ruth because she is considered easier to order around. She is very impatient and she always blames Isabel for accidents she encounters, also often picking on the simplest mistakes such as not placing her dog statue in the right position after being dusted. When her husband's aunt falls sick, she hopes that her condition will cause her to die soon. Whenever Lady Seymour's condition improves, Ms. Lockton seems to be saddened.

===Miss Mary Finch===
The previous owner of Isabel and Ruth before she died and they were sold to the Locktons. She promised Isabel that she and her sister would be free when she dies, as a part of her [[Will and testament|will]]. Isabel views her as one of the nicer slaveowners, describing her as being polite to her slaves by saying ''please'' and ''thank you'' when assigning tasks. Along with those acts, She taught Isabel to read and write.

===Robert Finch===
Miss Finch's nephew and only relative. He denies Miss Mary's will by saying that it is verbal and not physically extant thus making it non-legal and claims that the death of Miss Mary would mean Isabel and Ruth belongs to him. He then sells the girls to the Locktons and takes away all of the girls' only belongings, including Ruth's favorite baby doll.

===Curzon===
A slave of Mr. Bellingham, a Patriot, he helps Isabel to achieve her wish for freedom by telling her to become a [[spy]] on the Locktons and try to find out any personal information that is sensitive to the political being, and report back. While other slaves join the Patriot army to be free from slavery, Curzon says that he is simply a loyal American fighting for the independence of his country; he is even brave enough to risk life imprisoned as long as he is fighting for America's liberty. He is a very good and loyal friend to Isabel, calling her Country, and he is always helping her in her attempts to seek the liberation of her and her sister.

===James Bellingham===
He is a strong-willed [[American Patriot]] who distrusts Elihu Lockton. His suspicious nature is shown towards Elihu, which is shown in the mid-beginning of the book where he demands that Anne Lockton's linen closet shall be inspected as they arrive in the docks of New York. He trusts Curzon though he is a slave, which is considered very odd at the time.

===Lady Seymour===
Elihu Lockton's aunt, she is very kind to slaves, unlike the rest of the people of the society. She acquaints Isabel and welcomes her dearly, and she always helps Isabel whenever she needs it. When Isabel came to her house to pass the information that Mr. Lockton had been arrested and that Madam is in need of his aunt, she tells Isabel to come in the house and even serves her milk and cookies to nourish herself; something nobody at the time would do to slaves. She also took care of Isabel while in recovery right after getting branded, which in return was paid by Isabel helping her escape from the [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|burning buildings]] and save her life.

===Angelika===
Lady Seymour's servant who only speaks Dutch and does not show interests in learning English. She treats Isabel kindly when she was branded with a hot iron with the letter I for insolence.

===Becky===
She is a maid in the Lockton house, and she often helps Isabel whenever she is having tough times due to Mrs. Lockton's orders and actions. She reminds Isabel to do what Mrs. Lockton says, and she tells Isabel what and what not to do in the Lockton house. Becky also tries her best to get Isabel and Ruth out of situations where they would possibly get punished. She told Isabel about a slave who worked for the Locktons a couple of years earlier who got beaten severely for talking back to Madam, trying to get Isabel to stay cautious in her actions and hold her fists down.

===Grandfather===
He is an elder African-American slave who is in charge of the distribution of water from the Tea Water Pump. He seems to know much about the gossip of the war, which is passed around every morning when slaves come to the pump to obtain water for the day. His real name is not revealed, but most slaves refer to him as "Grandfather", because he is kind to everyone.

===Colonel Regan===
A colonel who works for Mr. Bellingham, he is Isabel's only hope to get her and her sister back to Rhode Islands. He retrieves information and evidence in the form of a list of names of the plan to assassinate General [[George Washington]] from Isabel, who secretly spied on Mr. Lockton during one of his meetings. He promised to help Isabel in return for the information, but he, later on, dismisses her when she begged for help when she ran away from Madam.

===Captain Morse===
Leader of the [[war prisoners]] of [[Fort Washington (Manhattan)|Fort Washington]], he asks Isabel to be his messenger and bring messages from other [[military officers]]. He treats Isabel kindly and allows her to bring in food for Curzon, who was a prisoner in there. Captain Morse often takes some food from the basket that Isabel brings along.

===Captain Farrar===
A military officer who Isabel goes to in the midst of her task of being Captain Morse's personal messenger. He gives a note to Isabel which was demanded by Mrs. Lockton when she discovers that Isabel has been working for the rebels. Isabel surprisingly throws away the note in the hearth so that Mrs. Lockton would not be able to obtain the information in the note.

===Pastor Weeks===
A pastor that fulfills Isabel's parents funeral. He also helps Isabel with trying to get to a safe place, and where she would be best happy, even though she would still be a slave.

===Old Ben===
Pastor Week's slave who pulled the wagon carrying a pine coffin containing Miss Mary Finch's body at the beginning of the story.

===Momma===
Isabel and Ruth's mother who died when they were young from pox. She was always kind and loved her family. Isabel sneaks her seeds when she gets sold to the Locktons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10719">'''Cheryl Ann Araujo''' (March 28, 1961 {{ndash}} December 14, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] [[rape]] victim whose case became national news. She was gang-raped in 1983 at age 21 by four men in a tavern in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], while other patrons watched but did not intervene. During the prosecution, the defendants' attorneys [[cross-examined]] Araujo to such an extent about her own life and activities that the case became widely seen as a template for "[[blaming the victim]]" in rape cases. Her case was widely known as the "Big Dan's rape," after the name of the bar in which the attack occurred. Ostracized in New Bedford, Araujo moved with her family to [[Miami, Florida]], to make a new life. She died a few years later in a drunk driving car accident.

Her case prompted national debate at the time over broadcasting of the trial, in which her name was released. Some states have passed legislation to protect the names of rape victims, and court cases have attempted to settle issues of newsworthiness, freedom of the press, and state interest, as well as personal privacy. Her case was the basis of the 1988 film ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]''.

== Rape ==
On March 6, 1983, after putting her two daughters to sleep following a third birthday party for the older girl, Araujo left her home in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], to buy cigarettes. The store she usually purchased from was closed, so she stopped at Big Dan's tavern. Two men approached and asked her to leave with them. When she refused, a third man grabbed her from behind and threw her onto the bar's pool table. She was stripped below the waist, and several men raped her. According to Araujo's original report to police, she heard people "laughing, cheering, yelling", but no one responded to her cries for help.  As Araujo seemingly admitted later, there was no crowd cheering on the rape.&lt;ref name="friendly"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/11/us/the-new-bedford-rape-case-confusion-over-accounts-of-cheering-at-bar.html |title=The New Bedford Rape Case: Confusion Over Accounts of Cheering at Bar |author=Jonathan Friendly |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 April 1984 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513224253/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/11/us/the-new-bedford-rape-case-confusion-over-accounts-of-cheering-at-bar.html |archive-date=13 May 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, Araujo fought off her attackers and ran half-naked into the street, screaming that she had been raped.  Three college students passing by in a van came upon Araujo in the street and drove her to the nearest [[hospital]].

==Prosecution==
Six men were originally charged with the rape, though only four, Victor Raposo, John Cordeiro, Joseph Vieira and Daniel Silva, were eventually tried. Two separate trials were conducted to avoid the men testifying against each other during trial. The trials attracted international attention, and people in the Portuguese community felt the case was a catalyst for stirring anti-Portuguese discrimination and sentiment.&lt;ref name="friendly"/&gt;

In addition, the press coverage and trial cast new light on how victims are treated in rape cases. Defense attorneys questioned the victim about her personal life, suggesting she had invited or somehow deserved the attack. During live TV coverage of the trial in the US, the victim's name was broadcast. After allowing TV coverage, the courts had the right to prevent disclosure of the woman's name but did not. The courts later admonished the press for releasing her name.&lt;ref name="identify"/&gt;

The three college students who drove Araujo to the hospital testified as to her state of terror when they encountered her. The four defendants were convicted of aggravated rape; charges against two additional men were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2009/03/history-for-pub-38.html "Today in history: Judge denies Rocky Point park purchase"], ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', March 26, 2009.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118224807/http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2009/03/history-for-pub-38.html |date=January 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most any of the men served was 6½ years.

==Issues of media coverage==
This case added to the debate of whether rape victims had a right to privacy because of the nature of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friendly, "Naming of Rape Victim Spurs Debate", ''New York Times,'', 11 April 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor said that he believed victims should be protected by having trials be closed, in order to protect their privacy. He felt the publicity might discourage rape victims from trying to get justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19840425&amp;id=Yz4gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0WgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6884,5298382 "Prosecutor Says Rape Trials Should Be Closed"], ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]],'' April 25, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable controversy at the time over broadcasting the rape trial. The broadcasts received wide ratings.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/30/arts/issue-and-debate-should-televising-of-rape-trials-be-permitted.html Peter W. Kaplan, "ISSUE AND DEBATE; SHOULD TELEVISING OF RAPE TRIALS BE PERMITTED?"], ''New York Times,'' 30 June 1984&lt;/ref&gt; As one study later noted, "Publication of a rape victim's name severely invades the personal privacy interests of the victim and exposes the victim to a variety of social and psychological problems."&lt;ref name="identify"&gt;[http://repository.jmls.edu/lawreview/vol18/iss4/10/ Fishbein, Ellen. "Identifying the Rape Victim: A Constitutional Clash between the First Amendment and the Right to Privacy"], 18 ''John Marshall Law Review'' 987 (1985); accessed 1 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There was national debate about the issue of releasing the victim's name, and United States Senator [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania held subcommittee hearings on the issue of televised trials after the conclusion of this case. Supporters of broadcasting criminal trials felt that newscasters should have used their editing capacity to delete Araujo's name.&lt;ref name="kaplan"/&gt; As noted by Peter Kaplan, Specter said, "Some hard thinking has to be done in protecting the rights of witnesses and defendants."  He added, "If this could be achieved, it would be highly desirable to televise rape cases, child-abuse cases and other crimes."&lt;ref name="kaplan"/&gt; Other supporters also believed that it was important to show the judicial process.&lt;ref name="kaplan"/&gt;

Other concerns about media coverage of this case related to the press' repetition of the first police report, without adequate attribution. They published Araujo's initial account of a crowd cheering in the bar. It was found that there were fewer men in the tavern than she claimed; during the trial, she said the attack resulted in her being distraught and distorting the number. But the dramatic first account had staying power; it was repeated even after more factually accurate accounts were published and broadcast.&lt;ref name="friendly" /&gt;

== Later life and death ==

Araujo was essentially ostracized in New Bedford. Shortly after the trial, she moved to [[Miami, Florida]], along with her two daughters and their father {{ndash}} Araujo's high school sweetheart {{ndash}} to find anonymity. Araujo had entered school to become a secretary, was making a life for herself, and had found some measure of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Paul Edward.

November 1, 1999. p. C.1.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225150403/https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/45980674.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |date=February 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 1986, she lost control of her car while taking her daughters to a Christmas show and struck a [[utility pole]]. The girls were injured, but survived. Araujo died in the crash.  She was 25 years old. At the time of the crash her [[blood alcohol level]] was .29, above the legal limit of .10. According to a United Press International article published December 24, 1986, "The woman who was gang-raped in a New Bedford, Mass., bar two years ago was driving while 'falling-down drunk' when she was killed in an automobile accident here, a Dade County medical examiner said on Tuesday."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-12-24/news/8603190521_1_utility-pole-blood-alcohol-level-dade-county&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greeniley, Jeannie.

==Legacy==
The feature film drama, ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'' (1988), was loosely based on this case. It starred [[Jodie Foster]] as the woman attacked and [[Kelly McGillis]] as an assistant district attorney prosecuting the case. In press coverage related to the film, McGillis acknowledged that she had survived an assault and rape herself. She discussed her long struggle to get over the attack, and wanted to talk about it to help other victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100476,00.html|title=Memoir of a Brief Time in Hell|author=Kelly McGillis, as told to Kristin McMurran|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=14 November 1988|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Foster won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

'''Choking''' (also known as foreign body airway obstruction) is a life-threatening medical emergency characterized by the blockage of air passage into the [[lung]]s secondary to the inhalation or ingestion of food or another object.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910514461|title=Injury facts|last=Council.|first=National Safety|others=National Safety Council. Research and Statistics Department.|isbn=9780879123345|edition=2015|location=Itasca, IL|oclc=910514461}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Choking is caused by a mechanical obstruction of the airway that prevents normal breathing. This obstruction can be partial (allowing some air passage into the lungs) or complete (no air passage into the lungs). The disruption of normal breathing by choking deprives [[oxygen]] delivery to the body, resulting in [[asphyxia]]. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFl6GGZsqp4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Asphyxiation+and+Ventilatory+Requirements#v=onepage&amp;q=Asphyxiation%20and%20Ventilatory%20Requirements&amp;f=false|title=Sudden Deaths in Custody|author1=Ross, Darrell Lee|author2=Chan, Theodore C|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59745-015-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; this sequence of events is potentially fatal. Choking was the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related death in the US in 2011.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

According to the [[National Safety Council]] (NSC), deaths from choking most often occur in the very young (children under 1 years old) and in the elderly (adults over 75 years).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Obstruction of the airway can occur at the level of the [[pharynx]] or the [[trachea]]. Foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx (such as bananas, marshmallows, or gelatinous candies) can be a danger not just for children but for persons of any age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Swallow Safely: How Swallowing Problems Threaten the Elderly and Others|last1=Sayadi|first1=Roya|date=May 2010|publisher=Inside/Outside Press|isbn=9780981960128|edition=First|location=Natick, MA|pages=46–47}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Choking is one type of [[airway obstruction]], which includes any blockage of the air-conducting passages, including blockage due to tumors, swelling of the airway tissues, and compression of the [[laryngopharynx]], [[larynx]] or [[vertebrate trachea]] in [[strangulation]].

==Symptoms and signs==
* Difficulty or inability to speak or cry out
* Inability or difficulty in breathing . Labored breathing, including gasping or [[wheeze|wheezing]] may be present
* Violent and largely involuntary coughing, gurgling, or vomiting noises may be present
* More serious choking victims will have a limited (if any) ability to produce these symptoms since they require at least some air movement.
* The person may begin clutching of the throat or mouth, or attempting to induce vomiting by putting fingers down the throat
* The person's face turns blue ([[cyanosis]]) from lack of oxygen, if breathing is not restored.
* The person may become unconscious, if breathing is not restored.


=== Complications ===
* Brain damage typically occurs if the body is deprived of air for three minutes. 
* Death will usually occur if breathing is not restored in six to eight minutes.

==Cause==
[[File:Illu conducting passages.svg|thumb|Respiratory tract.]]
Choking is caused by an object from outside the body, also called a [[foreign body]], blocking the airway.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Committee on Injury|first=Violence|date=2010-03-01|title=Prevention of Choking Among Children|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/125/3/601|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=125|issue=3|pages=601–607|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2862|issn=0031-4005|pmid=20176668}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can block the upper or lower airway passages.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/book.aspx?bookid=2172|title=CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Emergency Medicine|last=Dominic Lucia; Jared Glenn|first=|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-184061-3|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airway obstruction is usually partial but can also be complete.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Among children, the most common causes of choking are food, coins, toys, and balloons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In one study, [[peanut]]s were the most common object found in the airway of children evaluated for suspected [[foreign body aspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadav|first=S. P.|last2=Singh|first2=J.|last3=Aggarwal|first3=N.|last4=Goel|first4=A.|date=September 2007|title=Airway foreign bodies in children: experience of 132 cases|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|volume=48|issue=9|pages=850–853|issn=0037-5675|pmid=17728968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods that pose a high risk of choking include hot dogs, hard candy, nuts, seeds, whole grapes, raw carrots, apples, popcorn, peanut butter, marshmallows, chewing gum, and sausages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most common cause of choking death in children is latex balloons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Small, round non-food objects such as balls, marbles, toys, and toy parts are also associated with a high risk of choking death because of their potential to completely block a child's airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Children younger than age three are especially at risk of choking because they explore the environment by putting objects in their mouth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, young children are still developing the ability to chew food completely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Molar (tooth)|Molar teeth]], which come in around 1.5 years of age, are necessary for grinding food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even after molar teeth are present, children continue developing the ability to chew food completely and swallow throughout early childhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, a child's airway is smaller in [[diameter]] than an adult's airway, which means that smaller objects can cause an airway obstruction in children. Infants and young children generate a less forceful cough than adults, so coughing may not be as effective in relieving an airway obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, children with neuromuscular disorders, developmental delay, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions that affect swallowing are at an increased risk of choking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In adults, choking often involves food blocking the airway.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Risk factors include using alcohol or [[sedative]]s, undergoing a procedure involving the [[Mouth|oral cavity]] or [[pharynx]], wearing oral appliances, or having a medical condition that causes difficulty swallowing or impairs the [[cough reflex]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Conditions that can cause difficulty swallowing and/or impaired coughing include neurologic conditions such as [[stroke]]s, [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer disease]], or [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Michael|last2=Chatterjee|first2=Arjun|last3=Chiles|first3=Caroline|last4=Chin|first4=Robert|title=Tracheobronchial Foreign Body Aspiration in Adults|url=http://sma.org/southern-medical-journal/article/tracheobronchial-foreign-body-aspiration-in-adults|journal=Southern Medical Journal|language=en-US|volume=102|issue=2|pages=171–174|doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e318193c9c8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In older adults, risk factors also include living alone, wearing [[dentures]], and having difficulty swallowing.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview?pa=O5pzXnIQmp0HSYIjLAN2mYVvrJsEmBNyNHtRnP9znPLPzn2yYsFObfV518L8UVs0Bov2jwgwzAu4eLRPOzK6WiwhCTQq25Ki1mL6i64Z7Vg%3D|title=Foreign Body Aspiration|last=Warshawsky|first=Martin|date=31 December 2015|website=Medscape|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children and adults with neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric disorders may experience a delay in diagnosis because there may not be a known history of a foreign body entering the airway.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
Providers such as pediatricians and dentists can provide information to parents and caregivers about what food and toys are appropriate by age to prevent choking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends waiting until 6 months of age before introducing solid foods to infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/HALF-Implementation-Guide/Age-Specific-Content/Pages/Infant-Food-and-Feeding.aspx|title=Infant Food and Feeding|website=www.aap.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caregivers can supervise children while eating or playing.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.safekids.org/safetytips/field_age/babies-0%E2%80%9312-months/field_risks/choking-and-strangulation?gclid=Cj0KCQiAgs7RBRDoARIsANOo-HjfEJgbAdX6WkGugweSYUtf_bfEh0tmWp7JHl7_xCdsCrzsGF1O9moaAsXOEALw_wcB|title=Choking Prevention for Babies|work=Safe Kids Worldwide|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, caregivers can avoid giving children younger than 5 foods that pose a high risk of choking such as hot dog pieces, cheese sticks, cheese chunks, hard candy, nuts, grapes, marshmallows, or popcorn.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Parents, teachers, child care providers, and other caregivers for children get training in choking first aid and [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the US, manufacturers of children's toys and products must follow requirements to prevent choking and include appropriate warning labels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, toys that are resold may not be marked with warning labels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Caregivers can try to prevent choking by considering the features of a toy (such as size, shape, consistency, small parts) before giving it to a child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children's products that are found to pose a choking risk can be recalled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Treatment==
{{main|Airway management}}
[[File:US medic teaches the Heimlich manuever to laughing Afghans.jpg|thumbnail|right|US medic teaches the [[abdominal thrusts]] to Afghans]]
Choking is treated with a number of different procedures, with both [[basic airway management|basic techniques]] available for [[first aid]]ers and more [[advance airway management|advanced techniques]] available for health professionals.

=== Basic treatment ===
Basic treatment of choking includes a number of non-invasive techniques to help remove foreign bodies from the airways. Most modern protocols, including those of the [[American Heart Association]] and the [[American Red Cross]], recommend several stages, designed to apply increasingly more pressure. For the conscious choking victim, most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps and if none of these things work; [[abdominal thrusts]] (''Heimlich maneuver'') or [[chest thrusts]]. Once the choking victims loses consciousness, initiating CPR is recommended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 5: Adult Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality – ECC Guidelines|url=https://eccguidelines.heart.org/index.php/circulation/cpr-ecc-guidelines-2/part-5-adult-basic-life-support-and-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-quality/?strue=1&amp;id=10-5|website=eccguidelines.heart.org|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cough ====
If the choking individual is conscious and coughing, the American Red Cross recommends encouraging the individual to continue coughing. The American Red Cross recommends that if the person choking is unable to cough or if coughing is not effective, to move onto other methods, detailed below.&lt;ref name="redcross.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=STEP 3: Be Informed - Conscious Choking {{!}} Be Red Cross Ready|url=http://www.redcross.org/flash/brr/English-html/conscious-choking.asp|website=www.redcross.org|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Back Blows (or Slaps) ====
The Mayo Clinic recommends the use of back blows to aid in the rescue of choking victims. Back blows are performed by leaning the choking victim forward, then delivering blows with the heel of the hand onto the victim's back, in between their shoulder blades.&lt;ref name="Choking: First aid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Choking: First aid|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-choking/basics/art-20056637|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER)|accessdate=4 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If back blows are performed, they must be performed with the head lower than the chest (i.e., bend the person over when you slap them hard between the shoulder blades with the heel of the palm); otherwise, the blow may drive the object deeper into the person's throat.

==== Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) ====
Abdominal thrusts are performed with the rescuer standing behind the person choking and exerting inward and upward pressure with their hands on the choking person's abdomen. This method of dislodging an airway obstruction was discovered by Dr. Henry Heimlich in 1974 and, when used alone (without back blows) to assist a choking victim, is referred to as "The Heimlich Maneuver." The purpose of abdominal thrusts is to create pressure that will expel any object lodged in the airway upwards to relive the obstruction. The Heimlich Maneuver specifically excludes back blows; its inventor, Dr. Henry Heimlich, believed that back blows were likely to cause an airway obstruction to become more deeply lodged in the victim's airway. So, while abdominal thrusts are part of other choking victim protocols, the Heimlich Maneuver uses only abdominal thrusts to attempt to dislodge airway obstructions.

==== "Five and Five" Technique ====
The American Red Cross recommends a strategy of alternating five back blows and five abdominal thrusts for conscious choking victims until the object blocking the airway is dislodged. Chest thrusts are advised for pregnant or obese victims. If the person choking becomes unconscious, basic [[CPR]] is recommended.&lt;ref name="redcross.org"/&gt; Although the Red Cross does not specifically refer to its choking victim protocol as the "Five and Five Technique," it is important to recognize that the Red Cross protocol differs from the Heimlich Maneuver since it includes administering back blows to the victim, contrary to Dr. Heimlich's procedure which specifically omits back blows.

==== Finger Sweep ====
If the choking victim becomes unconscious, the American Medical Association advocates sweeping the fingers across the back of the throat to attempt to dislodge airway obstructions,&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuvXnhwU8nQC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=AMA+Emergency#v=onepage&amp;q=dislodge%20the%20object&amp;f=false | title= American Medical Association Handbook of First Aid and Emergency Care | author= [[American Medical Association]] | publisher= [[Random House]]| isbn=978-1-4000-0712-7| date=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many modern protocols recommend against the use of the finger sweep. Red Cross procedures specifically direct rescuers not to perform a finger sweep unless an object can be clearly seen in the victim's mouth due to the risk of driving the obstruction deeper into the victim's airway. Other protocols suggest that if the patient is conscious they will be able to remove the foreign object themselves, or if they are unconscious, the rescuer should simply place them in the [[recovery position]] as this allows (to a certain extent) the drainage of fluids out of the mouth instead of down the trachea due to gravity.  There is also a risk of causing further damage (for instance inducing vomiting) by using a finger sweep technique. There are no studies that have examined the usefulness of the finger sweep technique when there is no visible object in the airway. Recommendations for the use of the finger sweep have been based on anecdotal evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Self-treatment ===
[[File:Heimlich.JPG|thumb|Self-Assist Choking Emergency Device]]
The Heimlich Maneuver (abdominal thrusts) can be performed or can be self-administered. Self-administration of this maneuver requires positioning of one's own abdomen over a chair, railing, or countertop and driving the abdomen upon the object with sharp, upward thrust. This serves as a substitute for thrusts made with the hands by another person. One study showed that these self-administered abdominal thrusts were just as effective as those performed by another person, although obese individuals were not included in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavitt MJ, Swanton LL, Hind M, et al.|first=|date=12 April 2017|title=Choking on a foreign body: a physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure.|url=https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/pmc/articles/PMC5520267/|journal=Thorax|volume=|pages=576–578|doi=10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209540|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-assist choking devices are another self-treatment option. This device is used to produce the inward and upward force of traditional abdominal thrusts. 
Multiple sources of evidence suggest, that one of promising approaches for self treatment during choking could be by applying the head-down (inversed) position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Special treatment populations ===

==== Infants (Less than 1 year) ====
[[File:Head-down position for self-treatment of choking if other approaches fail.gif|thumb|head-down position for self-treatment of choking if other approaches fail]]For children less than 1 year, the American Heart Association recommends performing cycles of 5 back blows (or slaps) followed by 5 chest compressions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Lippincott Williams &amp;|date=2010-11-02|title=Editorial Board|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/122/18_suppl_3/S639|journal=Circulation|language=en|volume=122|issue=18 suppl 3|pages=S639–S639|doi=10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181fdf7aa|issn=0009-7322}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles of 5 back blows then 5 chest compressions are repeated until the object comes out of the infant's airway or until the infant becomes unresponsive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the infant becomes unresponsive, the American Heart Association recommends starting [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The reason that abdominal thrusts are not recommended in children less than 1 year is because they can cause liver damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[File:Heimlich Infant.png|thumb|Back blows (or slaps) and chest compressions for treating an infant less than 1 year of age.]]

==== Pregnant or Obese Persons ====
The American Heart Association recommends [[chest thrusts]] rather than abdominal thrusts for pregnant or obese persons who are choking.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
Chest thrusts are performed in a similar to the abdominal thrusts, but with a change in hand placement of the rescuer. The hands are placed on the lower part of the choking victim's chest, at the base of the breastbone or [[sternum]], rather than over the middle of the abdomen, as in traditional abdominal thrusts. Strong inward thrusts are then applied.&lt;ref name="Choking: First aid"/&gt;

=== Advanced treatment ===
There are many [[Advanced airway management|advanced medical treatments]] to relieve choking or airway obstruction. These include inspection of the airway with a [[laryngoscope]] or [[bronchoscope]] and removal of the object under direct vision. Severe cases where there is an inability to remove the object may require [[cricothyrotomy]] (emergency tracheostomy). Cricothyrotomy involves making an incision in a patient's neck and inserting a tube into the trachea in order to bypass the [[upper airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a trahceostomy?|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/tracheostomy/about/what.html|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is usually only performed when other methods have failed. In many cases, an emergency tracheostomy can save a patient's life, but if performed incorrectly, it may end the patient’s life.

== Epidemiology ==
Choking is the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related death in the US.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsc.org/Membership%20Site%20Document%20Library/2015%20Injury%20Facts/NSC_InjuryFacts2015Ed.pdf|title=Injury Facts 2015 Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=National Safety Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many episodes are not reported because they are brief and resolve without seeking medical attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among reported events, the majority of episodes (80%) occur among children younger than age 15, with fewer episodes (20%) among age 15 and older.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; The death rate from choking is low at most ages but increases starting around age 74.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Choking due to a foreign object resulted in 162,000 deaths (2.5 per 100,000) in 2013, compared to 140,000 deaths (2.9 per 100,000) in 1990.&lt;ref name="GDB2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|date=17 December 2014|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|volume=385|pages=117–71|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|pmid=25530442|url=http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673614616822/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clip joint''' or '''fleshpot''' is an establishment, usually a [[strip club]] or [[night club]] (often claiming to offer [[Striptease|adult entertainment]] or [[bottle service]]) in which customers are tricked into paying excessive amounts of money, for surprisingly low-grade goods or services—or sometimes, nothing—in return. Typically, clip joints suggest the possibility of sex, charge inflated prices for watered-down alcoholic drinks, and then throw out customers when they become unwilling or unable to spend more money. The products and services offered may be illegal, allowing the establishment to maintain such activities with little fear of punishment from law enforcement, since its victims cannot report the venue without admitting that they broke the law. Even in situations where no law was broken, victims may be too embarrassed to seek legal recourse.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

In the United States, clip joints were widespread during the [[Prohibition in the United States|national Prohibition of alcohol from 1920 to 1933]], and the practice later became outlawed. For instance, the [[New York State Liquor Authority]] imposes penalties against any licensed premises permitting such conduct. Clip joints still operate openly in some areas of the world, such as [[Shanghai]] and [[Las Vegas]], where they prey on visiting tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== The scam ==
A typical scenario involves a young adult male (typically a tourist) being approached by a beautiful woman (typically either a local or claiming to be) who recommends a "favorite local" bar or club.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The man is usually seated at a table and joined by a "hostess", who may or may not order drinks. Whether or not any "services" are performed or drinks are ordered has little bearing on the outlandish bill received at the end of the night. Bills are commonly hundreds of - if not over a thousand - dollars, listing items like a "hostess fee" or "service charge" that were not originally mentioned to the customer. The arrival of the bill typically corresponds with the arrival of a few large [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s to ensure payment, sometimes leading the victim to an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] to retrieve the money.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

The beautiful woman or women who originally lured the mark to the location often makes an excuse and leaves prior to the arrival of the bill. If confronted, the establishment claims that they have no connection with the woman and indicates that she arrived with the man, and as such the man is responsible for all of the items on the bill.

Often, a clip joint employee waits near a legitimate club, and invites passing pedestrians into a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] area. The potential customers are led to believe that the person works for the nearby club, though they may not explicitly say so. Once inside, drinks are usually alcohol free (as the venues usually do not have a license) or watered down and overpriced with no prices listed on the menu. As is typical, unrequested companions may also arrive at the table.

This scam is in a legal gray area if [[extortion]] is not explicitly involved, since there is no law against charging high prices and the customer is primarily responsible for determining the prices of services to be rendered before accepting them.

== In the United Kingdom ==
A number of clip joints (or "[[near beer]] bars") still operate in [[London]]'s [[Soho]] area, alongside legitimate strip bars. Since 2007, the London Local Authorities Act reclassified clip joints as sex establishments, meaning that they required relevant licences, closing a loophole where these businesses did not need a licence to operate because they did not serve food or alcohol or provide entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/localact2007/ukla_20070002_en_5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

In 2009, two people were jailed for 36 and 14 months respectively after threatening an undercover police officer in a Soho clip joint.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Sarah| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8175510.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Cracking down on clip joint scams | date=6 October 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== In Japan ==
"Bottakuri" or rip-off clubs have been a small but persistent problem in Japan, especially Tokyo’s Kabukicho district. The complaints had surged tenfold in 2015 and police have begun crack-downs. &lt;ref name="JapanTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiber|first=Mark| url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/06/national/media-national/bottakuri-scams-put-the-squeeze-on-the-unwary/ | publisher=Japan Times | title=‘Bottakuri’ scams put the squeeze on the unwary | date=6 June 2015 | accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mid-2015 sweep by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, six hostess clubs were found to have charged as much as 2.6 Million yen (~$26000 USD) for one evening's visit by nine male customers.&lt;ref name="TokyoReporter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|first=Tokyo Reporter| url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2015/06/16/tokyo-cops-bust-6-clubs-in-kabukicho-for-overcharging/ | publisher=Tokyo Reporter | title=Tokyo cops bust 6 clubs in Kabukicho for overcharging | date=16 June 2015 | accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bottle service clubs ==
The [[Manhattan]] bottle service club Arena was sued in 2007 for their version of the clip joint scam. In December 2007, a patron knowingly purchased a $350 bottle of vodka, but was not told of a three bottle minimum. At the end of the night, he was presented with a $1050 tab that included two unordered bottles. When he refused to pay, the Arena bouncers beat him up. The patron agreed to get money from an ATM, but after the bouncers escorted him two blocks to a machine, his debit card was declined. The bouncers then dragged him back to the bar, where he was held until police arrived. He was arrested for theft of services but the charges were dismissed, and he later sued the club for $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Del |first=John |url=http://gothamist.com/2007/12/31/roughedup_revel.php |title=Roughed-Up Reveler Sues Club Over 3 Bottle Shakedown |publisher=Gothamist |date=31 December 2007 |accessdate=10 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719044530/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/31/roughedup_revel.php |archivedate=19 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural references ==
The film ''[[Marked Woman]]'', starring Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart, portrays a clip joint. Other films featuring clip joints include ''[[Manpower (1941 film)|Manpower]]'', ''[[Lullaby of Broadway (film)|Lullaby of Broadway]]'' and ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]''.

''[[The Fabulous Clipjoint]]'' is the first novel by science fiction and mystery writer [[Fredric Brown]].

In the video game ''[[Cuphead]]'', one of the earlier boss battles takes place in a clip joint. The title of the stage is "Clip Joint Calamity".

'''''Clouseau in 't lang''''' is the name of the concert given by the [[Flanders|Flemish]] band [[Clouseau (band)|Clouseau]] in 2005 at the [[Antwerp]] [[Sportpaleis Merksem]].  The name was inspired by the 6 meter wide, 40 meter long catwalk in the concert hall from which the band played.  This unusual arrangement made it possible for the entire hall to see the band more or less equally.

Video of the concert was made available on a DVD with the same name in February 2006.

'''''Death and the King's Horseman''''' is a play by [[Wole Soyinka]] based on a real incident that took place in [[Nigeria]] during [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule: the horseman of a Yoruba King was prevented from committing [[ritual suicide]] by the colonial authorities.&lt;ref name="enotes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death and the King's Horseman: Introduction. Drama for Students. |editor=Marie Rose Napierkowski |volume=10 |location=Detroit |author=Gale |journal=eNotes |date=January 2006 |accessdate=23 January 2009 |url=http://www.enotes.com/death-kings/introduction}}{{dubious|date=September 2015}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the British intervention, Soyinka calls the horseman's own conviction toward suicide into question, posing a problem that throws off the community's balance.

Soyinka wrote the play in [[Cambridge]], where he was a fellow at [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]] during his political exile from Nigeria.&lt;ref name="gumbel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/08/wole-soyinka-death-kings-horseman|title=Wole Soyinka on how he came to write Death and the King's Horseman|last=Gumbel|first=Andrew|date=8 April 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written a preface to the play, explaining what he sees as the greatest misconceptions in understanding it. In particular, he says that the play should not be considered as "clash of cultures."&lt;ref name="gumbel"/&gt; Rather, the play demonstrates the need for interaction between African and European cultures, as per Soyinka's post-[[Biafra]]n cultural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/849653968|title=The concise Oxford companion to English literature.|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Birch, Dinah,, Hooper, Katy,, Oxford University Press.|isbn=9780191744556|edition=Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=849653968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Death and the King's Horseman'' builds upon the true story which Soyinka based the play off of, to focus on the character of Elesin, the King's Horseman of the title. According to [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] tradition, the death of the king must be followed by the [[ritual death]] of the king's horseman as well as the king's dog and horse, because the horseman's spirit is essential to helping the chief's spirit ascend to the afterlife.  Otherwise, the king's spirit will wander the earth and bring harm to the Yoruba people. The first half of the play documents the process of this ritual, with the potent, life-loving figure Elesin living out his final day in celebration before the ritual process begins. At the last minute, the local [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonial ruler]], Simon Pilkings, intervenes, the suicide being viewed as barbaric and illegal by the British authorities.

In the play, the result for the community is catastrophic, as the breaking of the ritual means the disruption of the cosmic order of the universe and thus the well-being and future of the collectivity is in doubt. The community blames Elesin as much as Pilkings, accusing him of being too attached to the earth to fulfill his spiritual obligations. Events lead to tragedy when Elesin's son, Olunde, who has returned to [[Nigeria]] from studying medicine in Europe, takes on the responsibility of his father and commits ritual suicide in his place so as to restore the honour of his family and the order of the universe. Consequently, Elesin kills himself, condemning his soul to a degraded existence in the next world. In addition, the dialogue of the native suggests that this may have been insufficient and that the world is now "adrift in the void".

Another Nigerian playwright, [[Duro Ladipo]], had already written a play in the [[Yoruba language]] based on this incident, called ''Oba waja'' ("The King is Dead").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death and the King's Horseman |last=Soyinka |first=Wole |authorlink=Wole Soyinka |year=2002 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=0-393-32299-8 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and motifs==
* [[Duty]]&lt;ref name="enotes"/&gt;
* [[Anti-imperialism|Anti-colonialism]] is considered a theme by some scholars based on aspects of the text, but Soyinka specifically calls the colonial factors "an incident, a catalytic incident merely" in the "Author's Note" prepended to the play.

===Yoruba proverbs===
Almost every character in ''Death and the King's Horseman'' at some point uses a traditional Yoruba proverb.  Through his vast knowledge of Yoruba proverbs, Soyinka is able to endow his play with a strong Yoruba sentiment.

Characters often employ Yoruba proverbs primarily as a means of bolstering their opinions and persuading others to take their point of view.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, David. ''Death and the King's Horseman and the Masks of Language.'' Excerpt from: Soyinka, Wole. ''Death and the King's Horseman: A Norton Critical Edition''. New York: Norton &amp; Company, 2003. Pp. 196-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Praise-singer gets annoyed with ''Elesin'' for his decision to take a new wife and tries to dissuade him:
::Because the man approaches a brand-new bride he forgets the long faithful mother of his children.
::''Ariyawo-ko-iyale''&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Similarly, ''Iyaloja'' tries to admonish ''Elesin'' against his earthly attachments and stay true to the ritual upon which the good of his society depended:
::Eating the awusa nut is not so difficult as drinking water afterwards.
::''Ati je asala [awusa] ko to ati mu omi si i''.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Another common way in which Soyinka uses proverbs is with ''Elesin''.  ''Elesin'' himself uses several proverbs in order to convince his peers that he is going to comply with their ritual and thus join the ancestors in ''orun'':
::The kite makes for wide spaces and the wind creeps up behind its tail; can the kite say less than thank you, the quicker the better?
::''Awodi to'o nre Ibara, efufu ta a n'idi pa o ni Ise kuku ya''.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|202}}

::The elephant trails no tethering-rope; that king is not yet crowned who will peg an elephant.
::''Ajanaku kuro ninn 'mo ri nkan firi, bi a ba ri erin ki a ni a ri erin''&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|202}}

::The river is never so high that the eyes of a fish are covered.
::''Odu ki ikun bo eja l'oju''&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|202}}
The final way in which proverbs appear in the play is when ''Iyaloja'' and the Praise-singer harass ''Elesin'' while he is imprisoned for failing to complete his role within the ritual:
::What we have no intention of eating should not be held up to the nose.
::''Ohun ti a ki i je a ki ifif run imu''&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|202}}

::We said you were the hunter returning home in triumph, a slain buffalo pressing down on his neck; you said wait, I first must turn up this cricket hole with my toes.
::''A ki i ru eran erin lori ki a maa f'ese wa ire n'ile''&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|202}}

::The river which fills up before our eyes does not sweep us away in its flood.
::''Odo ti a t'oju eni kun ki igbe 'ni lo''&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;{{rp|202}}

==Performances==
Written in five scenes, it is performed without interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5727 |title=The Literary Encyclopedia |accessdate=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soyinka himself has directed important American productions, in Chicago in 1976 and at [[Lincoln Center]] in New York in 1987, but according to Andrew Gumbel, the play "has been much more widely admired than performed".&lt;ref name="gumbel"/&gt;

The British premiere was directed by [[Phyllida Lloyd]] at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]] in [[Manchester]] in 1990. It starred [[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]] and [[Claire Benedict]].

The play was performed at London's [[Royal National Theatre]] beginning in April 2009, directed by [[Rufus Norris]], with choreography by [[Javier de Frutos]] and starring [[Lucian Msamati]].&lt;ref name="gumbel"/&gt; The play was also staged by the St. Louis Black Repertory Theater February 2008, directed by Olusegun Ojewuyi, who has been dramaturge for the Oregon Shakespeare's production. It was performed at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] from February 14 to July 5, 2009 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death and the King's Horseman |url=http://www.osfashland.org/browse/production.aspx?prod=160 |work=Oregon Shakespeare Festival |location=Ashland, OR| year=2009 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Yoruba translation Iku Olokun Esin was also performed at the National Theater, Lagos Nigeria, directed by Olusegun Ojewuyi (thus making him the first and only director to have staged the play in both English and in Yoruba – the language and culture of the play.

In 1988 the play was produced by the Addison Center Theatre in Dallas, Texas, under the direction of Clinton Turner Davis. Davis had previously served as stage manager for the Lincoln Center production.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The '''Dnepropetrovsk maniacs''' ({{lang-uk|Дніпропетровські маніяки}}, {{lang-ru|Днепропетровские маньяки}}) are [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] [[serial killer]]s responsible for a string of murders in [[Dnipropetrovsk]]&lt;ref&gt;The name of this city is rendered in English as either "Dnipropetrovsk" or "Dnepropetrovsk". English-language media coverage of this case almost invariably uses the spelling "Dnepropetrovsk".&lt;/ref&gt; in June and July 2007. The case gained additional notoriety because the killers made video recordings of some of the murders, with one of the videos leaking to the Internet. Two 19‑year-old locals, '''Viktor Sayenko''' ({{lang-uk|Віктор Саєнко}}, {{lang-ru|Виктор Саенко}}), born 1 March 1988, and '''Igor Suprunyuk''' ({{lang-uk|Ігор Супрунюк}}, {{lang-ru|Игорь Супрунюк}}), born 20 April 1988, were arrested and charged with 21 murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-204617.html |title=Three 19‑year-old youths committed 19 murders in Dnepropetrovsk during a month |publisher=[[UNIAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A third conspirator, '''Alexander Hanzha''' ({{lang-uk|Олександр Ганжа}}, {{lang-ru|Александр Ганжа}}), born February 1988, was charged with two armed robberies that took place before the murder spree.&lt;ref name="poleznaya"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://poleznaya.dp.ua/news.php?v=010_10_29.12.2008&amp;n=8 |title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs did not Show Regret |work=Novomoskovsk City News |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824215220/http://poleznaya.dp.ua/news.php?v=010_10_29.12.2008&amp;n=8 |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dndz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dndz.tv/news-3072.html|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs that operated in Dneprodzerzhinsk are already in Court |work=Dneprodzerzhinsk News|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 2009, all three defendants were found guilty.

== Murders ==
The first two murders occurred late on 25 June 2007. The first victim was a 33-year-old woman, Yekaterina Ilchenko,&lt;ref name="Gazeta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gazeta.ua/index.php?id=175109&amp;eid=417&amp;lang=ru|title=Viktor Sayenko and Igor Suprunyuk Murder 19 in a Month |work=Gazeta |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was walking home after having tea at her friend's apartment. According to Sayenko's confession, he and Suprunyuk were "out for a walk." Suprunyuk had a hammer. As Ilchenko walked past, Suprunyuk "spun around" and struck her in the side of the head. Ilchenko's body was found by her mother at 5 AM.&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zavtra.com.ua/news/1/49094 |title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs: Details and victims' names |work=Zavtra |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within an hour of the first murder, the two men attacked their next victim, Roman Tatarevich, as he slept on a bench near the first murder scene. Tatarevich's head was smashed with blunt objects numerous times, rendering him unrecognizable. The bench was located across the street from the local public prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name="details"/&gt;

On 1 July, two more victims, Yevgenia Grischenko and Nikolai Serchuk, were found murdered in the nearby town of [[Novomoskovsk, Ukraine|Novomoskovsk]].&lt;ref name="versii"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=7131 |title=Bloody Trail – 3|work=Versii |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 6 July, three more people were murdered in Dnipropetrovsk. The first was Egor Nechvoloda, a recently discharged army recruit, who was bludgeoned while walking home from a nightclub. His mother found the body in the morning by their apartment building on Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street.&lt;ref name="versii" /&gt; Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old night guard, was then murdered around the corner on Kosiora Street.&lt;ref name="glavred"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://glavred.info/archive/2007/09/06/144016-0.html |title=How the Dnepropetrovsk Rippers were Caught |work=GlavRed |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606054917/http://glavred.info/archive/2007/09/06/144016-0.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under his shirt and struck her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out.&lt;ref name="mycity"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mycityua.com/country/2008/07/09/183354.html |title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs Begin to Blame Each Other |work=MyCityUA |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312005636/http://mycityua.com/country/2008/07/09/183354.html |archivedate=2009-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same night, the men murdered a woman named Valentina Hanzha (no apparent relation to co-defendant Alexander Hanzha), a mother of three with a disabled husband.&lt;ref name="versii" /&gt;

The next day, 7 July, two 14‑year-old boys from [[Pidhorodne|Podgorodnoye]], a nearby town, were attacked as they went fishing. One of the two friends, Andrei Sidyuk, was killed, but the other, Vadim Lyakhov, managed to escape after hiding in the woods.&lt;ref name="glavred" /&gt; Later, on 12 July, 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko, disabled by a recent bout with cancer, went missing while riding his [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr motorcycle]]. His battered body was found four days later, with signs of a savage attack visible even after four days in the summer heat.&lt;ref name="sergei"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.facts.kiev.ua/archive/2007-08-01/83762/index.html |title=Sergei Cheated Death Twice – First a Car Accident, Then Cancer |work=www.facts.kiev.ua |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726130346/http://www.facts.kiev.ua/archive/2007-08-01/83762/index.html |archivedate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, on 14 July, 45‑year-old Natalia Mamarchuk was riding her scooter in the nearby village of Diyovka. As she was passing through a wooded area, two men approached her and knocked her down. They then bludgeoned her to death with a hammer or pipe and drove off on her scooter. Local witnesses gave chase but lost sight of the attackers.&lt;ref name="glavred-3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://glavred.info/archive/2008/04/09/105257-3.html|title=Before murdering people maniacs practiced on cats|work=GlavRed|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227081609/http://glavred.info/archive/2008/04/09/105257-3.html|archivedate=2009-02-27|deadurl=yes|language=Russian|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shcandal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shcandal.com/news.php?readmore=2158|title=Victims of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs|work=Shcandal|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve more murders followed, often with multiple bodies found on the same day. In addition to the earlier sprees, two victims were found each day from 14 July to 16. Victims were seemingly selected at random. Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, elderly, vagrants, or people under the influence of alcohol. Most victims were killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction bars. Blows were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many victims were also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her [[fetus]] cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any victim were reported. Some victims were also robbed of their cell phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area. However, most victims had their possessions intact. The murders covered a large geographical area. Aside from Dnepropetrovsk, many occurred in outlying areas of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]].&lt;ref name="lowlifes"/&gt;

== Investigation ==

No official link between the murders was made until the 7 July attack on two boys in Podgorodnoye. Vadim Lyakhov, the survivor, was initially placed under arrest, suspected of murdering his friend.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-92-dnepropetrovsk-maniacs/|title=Case 92: Dnepropetrovsk Maniacs - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|date=2018-08-11|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly denied access to counsel and beaten by police during questioning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it quickly became clear that he was not responsible for his friend's death, given that the murder was connected with the developing murder spree. Lyakhov cooperated with the investigators to create sketches of the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/330449.html |title=Survived Victim Afraid the Murderers will not Go to Jail |work=[[Segodnya]] |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two local children who had also witnessed the 14 July Mamarchuk attack, hidden in a tent just a few feet away, also provided a detailed description corroborating the one given by Lyakhov.

A task force was quickly set up from [[Kiev]], headed by lead criminal investigator Vasily Paskalov.&lt;ref name="mycity"/&gt; The manhunt soon grew to encompass most local law enforcement,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and reportedly over 2,000 investigators worked on the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rus.newsru.ua/crime/24jul2007/ubijstvo.html |title=Teenagers had Fun Murdering 19 |publisher=[[NEWSru]] |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was initially kept secret. No official information about the murders was released, and local people were not warned about possible attacks or provided with descriptions of the suspects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, rumors of the attacks kept most of the local population home at night.&lt;ref name="glavred" /&gt; Eventually, investigators selectively distributed sketches and lists of stolen property to local [[pawnbroker|pawn shops]], and soon, stolen property began to be identified in the pawn shops of the city's Leninskiy district.

=== Suspects ===
The three suspects Viktor Sayenko, Igor Suprunyuk, and Alexander Hanzha were arrested on 23 July 2007. Suprunyuk attempted to sell a [[mobile phone]] stolen from a victim in a local pawn shop, asking for 150 [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]] (around 30 USD in 2007). Law enforcement agents [[Mobile phone tracking|tracked the phone's location]] once the shop's owner turned it on to check its functionality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sayenko and Suprunyuk were arrested near the cash register of the shop.&lt;ref name="versii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lowlifes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="europa express"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euxpress.de/archive/artikel_13506.html|title=Unusual Killers|author=Katsman, Vladimir|publisher=www.euxpress.de|language=Russian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719001923/http://www.euxpress.de/archive/artikel_13506.html|archivedate=19 July 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=17 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanzha was arrested at home, reportedly managing to flush other stolen mobile phones and jewelry down the toilet. The items were recovered, but all information on the phones was lost.&lt;ref name="glavred" /&gt;

The three suspects had attended school together,&lt;ref name="school"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/324349.html|title=Mother of suspect: "My son is not a maniac."|author1=Konova, Natalia|accessdate=2009-08-01|publisher=Segodnya|author2=Leontieva, Anna|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by age 14 found some common ground. "Me and Igor [Suprunyuk] were both afraid of heights, and we were afraid we'd be beaten up by bullies", Sayenko stated during questioning. Suprunyuk sought advice on getting rid of their fears, which led the boys to stand on a balcony of their 14th floor apartment for hours, hanging over the railing. This reportedly had a positive effect on their fear of heights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hanzha was reportedly the most squeamish of the three. He had [[blood phobia]], and even refused to bathe his kitten, afraid he might scald it. Suprunyuk suggested tackling the fears by torturing stray dogs. The boys captured dogs in a wooded area near their house, hanged them from trees, disemboweled them, and took pictures next to the corpses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prosecution evidence included many of these photos taken by the suspects while underage. Some photos show the boys drawing [[swastika]]s and other symbols with animal blood, and giving the [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In one photo, Suprunyuk poses sporting a [[toothbrush moustache]], similar to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s moustache. Suprunyuk was born on April 20, the same day as Hitler, and referred to this fact.&lt;ref name="dndz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="videos" /&gt; A long video showing the three torturing a white kitten was shown in court. It takes place in their garage. The suspects fashioned a cross from wooden boards and nailed the kitten to it, then shot at it with pistols, placing foam and glue in its mouth to muffle the kitten's noises.&lt;ref name="dndz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/13044933.html|title=The maniacs case: suspects charged with 21 murders deemed fit to stand trial|publisher=Segodnya|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the boys were 17, Suprunyuk beat up a local boy and stole his bike, which he then sold to Sayenko. Both were arrested, but did not go to jail due to their age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rus.newsru.ua/crime/30jul2007/ybijstva.html#5|title=The Guys First Practiced on Cats|publisher=[[NEWSru]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Hanzha drifted between odd jobs, which included a pastry chef and a construction worker. At his arrest he had been unemployed for some time.&lt;ref name="school" /&gt;&lt;ref name="glavred-2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://glavred.com/archive/2007/07/27/141027-4.html|title=Dnepropetrovsk was terrorized by rich kids?|work=GlavRed|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711100020/http://glavred.com/archive/2007/07/27/141027-4.html|archivedate=2011-07-11|deadurl=yes|language=Russian|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayenko went to a [[metallurgy]] institute part-time&lt;ref name="versii" /&gt; and worked as a security guard.&lt;ref name="shcandal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shcandal.com/news.php?readmore=2147|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs captured!|publisher=|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suprunyuk remained officially unemployed, but made a living driving his green [[Daewoo Lanos]] as an unlicensed taxi. The car was reportedly a birthday gift from his parents.&lt;ref name="mycity" /&gt;

Some months before the murder spree, Suprunyuk — with the help of Sayenko and Hanzha — began picking up passengers and robbing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A green Daewoo with a taxicab's checkerboard marking was often described as the vehicle used in the murders. According to the suspects' confessions, some murder victims were picked up as passengers in the cab.&lt;ref name="glavred" /&gt; Hanzha reportedly participated in one where two men were robbed, and then declined to take part in any further attacks.&lt;ref name="dndz" /&gt;

Local media reported the suspects had wealthy influential parents with ties to local law enforcement. Vladimir Suprunyuk, Suprunyuk's father, in his interview to ''[[Segodnya]]'' stated that he had been employed at [[Yuzhmash]] as a test pilot, often flying with [[Leonid Kuchma]], the future president of Ukraine, and continuing to serve as his personal pilot on domestic flights after Kuchma's rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/interview/10041462.html|title=Interview with a Dnepropetrovsk maniac's father|work=Segodnya|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities, including deputy interior minister Nikolay Kupyanskiy, initially referred to the supposed influence of the suspects' families,&lt;ref name="shcandal1" /&gt; but later denied the assessment, claiming that all three suspects came from poor families. However, Sayenko was represented in court by his father, Igor Sayenko, a lawyer.&lt;ref name="kiev1" /&gt;

=== Trial ===
The three men were charged with involvement in 29 separate incidents, including 21 murders and eight more attacks where victims survived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Suprunyuk was charged with 27 of the cases, including 21 counts of capital murder, eight armed robberies, and one count of animal cruelty. Sayenko was charged with 25 instances, including 18 murders, five robberies and one count of animal cruelty. Hanzha was charged with two counts of armed robbery stemming from a 1 March 2007 incident in [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=They don't even Deserve Life |url=http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=901987 |work=[[Kommersant]] |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three confessed quickly, although Suprunyuk later withdrew his confession. Their trial began in June 2008. Suprunyuk pleaded not guilty, while the other two suspects pleaded guilty to all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kp.kiev.ua/daily/110608/44525/ |title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs plead guilty |publisher= |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219083802/http://www.kp.kiev.ua/daily/110608/44525/ |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Chevguz, Suprunyuk's original defense lawyer, left the case after reportedly being disappointed that his client's [[Insanity defense|plea of insanity]] was not accepted. Lawyers for the victims' families argued that the level of care taken by the killers during their crime spree meant that they were fully aware of their actions.&lt;ref name="chevguz"&gt;{{cite news |title=Maniacs are mentally ill, argues defense |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/10047924.html|publisher=Segodnya |language=Russian|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecution evidence included bloodstains on the suspects' clothing and video recordings of the murders. The defense denied that the people in the videos were the suspects, claiming serious problems with the investigation, including at least 10 more murders covered up by the prosecution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blik.ua/content/view/10969/198/ |title=Maniacs' case takes longer |work=Blik |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231114845/http://www.blik.ua/content/view/10969/198/ |archivedate=2008-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; supposed cover-ups of additional arrests of people with powerful connections who were released without being charged, even naming some of the additional people supposedly involved with the murders.&lt;ref name="kiev1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect's Father is his Lawyer |url=http://kiev.kp.ru/daily/041208/64882/ |publisher= |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107020325/http://kiev.kp.ru/daily/041208/64882/ |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by a panel of judges chaired by judge Ivan Senchenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rus.newsru.ua/arch/crime/10jul2008/gydota.html|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs say they are afraid of each other |publisher=NEWSru |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution asked for [[life imprisonment]] for Sayenko and Suprunyuk, and 15 years of [[penal labour|hard labor]] for Hanzha.&lt;ref name="poleznaya"/&gt; Ukraine has no [[capital punishment]] since February 2000 after the Constitutional Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in December 1999.&lt;ref name="death_penalty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://podrobnosti.ua/podrobnosti/2011/04/05/762384.html |title=Tenth anniversary of ban on death penalty in Ukraine (with television news video featuring the maniacs)|work=podrobnosti.ua|date=2011-04-05|accessdate=2011-04-13|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation ===
The prosecution did not establish a motive behind the killings. Local media reported the killers had a plan to get rich from the murder videos they recorded. One suspect's girlfriend reported that they planned to make forty separate videos of murders. This was corroborated by a former classmate who claimed he often heard Suprunyuk was in contact with an unknown "rich foreign website operator" who ordered forty [[snuff film|snuff videos]], and would pay lots of money once they were made.&lt;ref name="lowlifes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rus.newsru.ua/crime/30jul2007/ybijstva.html#1 |title=Lowlifes Planned 40 Murders |publisher=NEWSru |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional security chief Ivan Stupak rejected the claim that the murders were committed to make internet snuff videos, saying that there was no evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Locals believe maniacs' motive could have been sale of films|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/338189.html|publisher=Segodnya |language=Russian|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detective Bogdan Vlasenko stated: "We think they were doing it as a hobby, to have a collection of memories when they get old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/23537 |title=Killing for kicks – youths confess to 21 murders (with television news video in English) |publisher=[[Russia Today]] |accessdate=2009-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104203946/http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/23537 |archivedate=2009-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy interior minister Nikolay Kupyanskiy commented "For these young men, murder was like entertainment or hunting."&lt;ref name="shcandal1"/&gt; At the trial, it emerged that Suprunyuk collected newspaper cuttings about the case.&lt;ref name="chevguz" /&gt; Some photographs of the crimes had captions added, including: "The weak must die. The strongest will conquer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Viktor Cherguz|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/1022183.html|publisher=Segodnya |language=Russian|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense claims ===
The legal team defending the suspects consisted of three lawyers, one for each suspect. All three lawyers were originally court-appointed, but after the initial hearings Sayenko requested to be represented by his father, because his appointed lawyer apparently graduated from law school only two months earlier.&lt;ref name="kiev1"/&gt; The request was granted, which significantly delayed the proceedings as Sayenko's father familiarized himself with the evidence. Igor Sayenko became the most prominent figure on the defense, giving numerous interviews and taking a lead role in court proceedings.

Hanzha's attorneys based their defense on the fact that he never participated in the murder spree, and was involved only with a single incident four months before it began, in which two men were robbed in the nearby town of [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]]. Hanzha admitted his guilt, hoping for leniency in sentencing.&lt;ref name="poleznaya"/&gt;
 
The defense strategy for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including the leader of the arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators, but never the actual moment of discovery.&lt;ref name="kiev1"/&gt; The legal team also denied that the people in the murder videos were the suspects.

In an interview with ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', Igor Sayenko claimed that a fourth suspect named Danila Kozlov was initially charged with the murders.&lt;ref name="kiev1"/&gt; Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in an interview that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents, and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders, and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he "did not murder anyone," and that when her attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge "asked him to sit down."&lt;ref name="credit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=12946|title=Justice on credit: The case of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs |publisher=Dnepropetrovsk City News|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor Sayenko continued to speculate on the influence of the families of the "real killers", claiming that he conducted an interview with an escaped victim who wanted his identity kept secret for fear for his life. This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired.&lt;ref name="credit"/&gt; Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. "But now these details are being covered up", Sayenko said in court. "The investigators claim that this did not happen. But there are people, officers in the Militsiya, who on July 19, 2007 received reports that those three were arrested. […] But, alas, it turned out that the persons arrested had powerful parents. So the information was quickly suppressed, and instead my son and two of his friends were railroaded. I also believe that the girl arrested on that day has since left the country and is now in Germany."&lt;ref name="kiev1"/&gt;

The defense team also claimed the prosecution withheld from the court information that exonerated their clients. Igor Sayenko claimed the police interviewed witnesses and recovered evidence from two additional murders. The suspects had a strong alibi for the time of these murders, and so all information on these crimes was removed from the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |title=I'm 100% Convinced that my Son did not Murder Anyone! |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sayenko's defense claimed that he had a "psychological dependence" on Suprunyuk, whom they called the ringleader. They claimed that Suprunyuk repeatedly threatened Sayenko, and that Sayenko feared for his life. Sayenko testified in court that he was in constant fear of Suprunyuk since 7th grade.&lt;ref name="mycity"/&gt;

The strategy of the defense team received some support from the victims' families, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the slow-moving legal process and an alleged cover-up by the investigators. Some victims' relatives told the media they planned to begin an independent organization to monitor the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sayenko from Dnepropetrovsk innocent? |url=http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |publisher= |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231085023/http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |archivedate=2008-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities in Ukraine strongly denied that a fourth person was involved in the killings who could still be at large, and said that rumors of similar crimes taking place since the arrest of the three suspects are unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|title=Murders continue after arrest of Dnepropetrovsk maniacs|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070701151420/http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder videos and photographs ===
The suspects' mobile phones and personal computers contained multiple video recordings of the murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video.&lt;ref name="blik video"/&gt; The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.

The suspects were also found in possession of multiple photographs showing them attending funerals of the victims. They can be seen smiling and "[[Finger (gesture)|flipping off]]" the coffins and gravestones. Evidence of animal abuse was also shown in court, with the suspects posing alongside mutilated animal corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://exo.at.ua/news/2008-10-30-3736|title=Killers captured death of victims on video (with television news video)|publisher=exo.at.ua|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographic and video evidence was shown in court on 29 October 2008, as part of a larger presentation of over 300 photographs and two videos.&lt;ref name="videos"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/12086123.html|title=Court shocked by brutal Dnepropetrovsk maniacs video|publisher=www.segodnya.ua |author= Leontieva, Anna|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense objected to the presentation, claiming that the evidence was obtained illegally, and that the subjects shown in the video and the photographs were digitally altered to resemble the suspects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Sayenko and Suprunyuk were asked if they recognized the people in the photographs, they replied that they did not. Judge Ivan Senchenko responded by stating: "You are not blind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.facts.kiev.ua/archive/2009-02-27/94631/index.html|title=Video camera clearly captured one of the defendants|publisher=www.facts.kiev.ua |language=Russian|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valery Voronyuk, an expert on film and video editing, testified that the video was not faked or altered.&lt;ref name="dndz"/&gt; The court rejected all defense objections, accepted the prosecution's argument that the material was genuine and showed the suspects in the act of murdering their victims.&lt;ref name="videos"/&gt;

=== Victim in the video ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sergei Yatzenko.jpg|thumb|right|Sergei Yatzenko's widow, Lyudmila, holds his photograph.]] --&gt;

The man whose murder is recorded in the leaked video was identified as Sergei Yatzenko from the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Taroms'ke|2=uk|3=Таромське|4=ru|5=Таромское|preserve=1}}. His murder took place on 12 July 2007, and his body was found on 16 July.&lt;ref name="sergei"/&gt; Yatzenko was 48 years old. He had recently been forced into retirement due to a [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in his throat. The treatment left him unable to speak for some time, but Yatzenko was unhappy with being unable to work and continued to find odd jobs around the village. He took on small construction work, repaired cars, wove baskets and cooked for his family. He was beginning to regain his voice at the time he was murdered. Yatzenko was married and had two sons and one grandchild. He also looked after his disabled mother.

At around 14:30 on the day of the murder, he called his wife to say he was going to fill his motorcycle and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned [[Dnipro (motorcycle)|Dnepr]] bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.&lt;ref name="sergei"/&gt;

The fact that Yatzenko's murder was captured on video was unknown to the public until a court session on 29 October 2008. The unedited video of the murder was shown as part of a large presentation by the prosecution, causing shock in the gallery. The court agreed with the prosecution that the video was genuine, that it showed Suprunyuk attacking the victim, and that Sayenko was the man behind the camera.&lt;ref name="sergei"/&gt;

The video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko was leaked to a [[shock site]] based in the [[United States]] and dated 4 December 2008. Ekaterina Levchenko, adviser to Ukraine's minister of the interior, was critical of the leak, but admitted that control of videos on the [[Internet]] was "virtually impossible".&lt;ref name="blik video"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blik.ua/content/view/15141/42/ |title=Shocking Murder Video Makes Rounds on the Internet |work=www.blik.ua |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122024812/http://blik.ua/content/view/15141/42 |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caitlin Moran]] of ''[[The Times]]'' watched part of the video and recalled her reaction in her column in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran|first=Caitlin|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/caitlin_moran/article5483397.ece|title=It took 1 min 47 seconds for my memory to become host to a horror that will never go|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=5 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121815/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/caitlin_moran/article5483397.ece|archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sentencing ===

[[File:Suprunyuck hammer.jpg|thumb|right|Suprunyuk photographed with a hammer; the court described the motive of the killers as "morbid self-affirmation".]]

On 11 February 2009, the court in Dnepropetrovsk found Sayenko and Suprunyuk guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced both to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seychas.ua/highlife/2009/2/12/video/4268.htm |title=Court sentences Dnepropetrovsk maniacs who killed 21 people (television news video) |publisher=www.seychas.ua |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402175931/http://www.seychas.ua/highlife/2009/2/12/video/4268.htm |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suprunyuk was found guilty of 21 murders, Sayenko of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blik.ua/content/view/16873/42/ |title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs hear verdict |author=Ilyinskaya, Marina |publisher=www.blik.ua |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006043154/http://www.blik.ua/content/view/16873/42/ |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also received fifteen-year sentences after being found guilty on the robbery charges. Hanzha, who was not involved in the killings, was found guilty of robbery and sentenced to nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podrobnosti.ua/criminal/2009/02/11/582026.html|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs sentenced to life in prison (with television news video)|author=Olinikova, Oksana|publisher=podrobnosti.ua|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.new-most.info/video/10517.htm|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs sentence is read out by Judge Ivan Senchenko (television news video)|publisher=www.new-most.info|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayenko and Suprunyuk were also found guilty on the animal cruelty charges. Hanzha said of Sayenko and Suprunyuk: "If I had known the atrocities that they were capable of committing, I would have not gone near them at gunpoint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facts.kiev.ua/archive/2009-02-12/94178/ |title=Dnepropetrovsk serial killers sentenced to life imprisonment |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528103706/http://www.facts.kiev.ua/archive/2009-02-12/94178 |archivedate=2009-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge stated in the verdict that the main motive for the crimes had been a desire for "morbid self-affirmation".&lt;ref name="verdict"/&gt; Referring to the accused, the court noted "the poverty of their emotional world, and their absence of interest in people and moral standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/02/11/01011-20090211FILWWW00574-ukraine-prison-a-vie-pour-21-meurtres.php|title=Ukraine: Life imprisonment for 21 murders|publisher=[[Le Figaro]] |language=French|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's verdict was several hundred pages long and read out over two days. The lawyers for Sayenko and Suprunyuk announced their intention to appeal, saying that the authenticity of the photographic and video evidence was not established beyond reasonable doubt. The claim was dismissed by Edmund Saakian, a lawyer for one of the victims' families, who commented: "In theory a photo can be faked, but to fake a forty-minute video would require a studio and a whole year." Larissa Dovgal, a representative of the victims' families, claimed other perpetrators involved in the crimes could still be at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smi.liga.net/articles/IT090767.html|title=Fatal outcome|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk repeated their belief in the innocence of their sons. Vladimir Suprunyuk claimed that Igor had been tortured to extract his confession, with the police covering his head and forcing him to inhale cigarette smoke. Speaking at a televised press conference, he cited irregularities in the investigation, and said that the case against his son was false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.new-most.info/photo-report/photo-society/10617.htm|title=Vladimir Suprunyuk: "The case against my son is false" (with television news video)|publisher=Novi Most |language=Russian|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayenko claimed that his son was a scapegoat, and that the crimes were committed by relatives of senior officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.new-most.info/news/others/10629.htm|title=Igor Sayenko: "The crimes were committed by the relatives of senior officials, and innocent people had to be blamed"|publisher=Novi Most |language=Russian|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents plan to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.new-most.info/press-centre/archives/13497.htm|title="Dnepropetrovsk hammer murders" case will be continued|author=Shutina, Tatyana|publisher=Novi Most |language=Russian|accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk also argued that the sentence on Hanzha was too lenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/14004801.html|title=Parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk: They are still not guilty!|publisher=Segodnya |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[opinion poll]] conducted in Dnepropetrovsk found that 50.3% of people believed that the sentence was fair, and 48.6% believed that the sentence should have been more severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.new-most.info/news/society/10632.htm|title=Sentencing of maniacs "fair", say half of Dnepropetrovsk citizens in poll|publisher=Novi Most |language=Russian|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, a poll found that nearly 60% of Ukrainians wanted the death penalty available for serial killings where judicial error had been ruled out.&lt;ref name="death_penalty"/&gt;

=== Appeal ===

On 18 August 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine referred the case back to the Dnepropetrovsk regional court of appeal. The move was welcomed by Igor Sayenko, who stated that it was a step towards clearing his son's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reporter.zp.ua/2009/09/30/delo-dnepropetrovskikh-manyakov-snova-vernuli-v-apelyatsionnyi-sud |title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs case returned to court of appeal |publisher=reporter.zp.ua |language=Russian |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826002340/http://reporter.zp.ua/2009/09/30/delo-dnepropetrovskikh-manyakov-snova-vernuli-v-apelyatsionnyi-sud |archivedate=26 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a press conference, Igor Sayenko and Vladimir Suprunyuk repeated their belief that the case was based on fabricated evidence. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said that the decision to refer the case back to the appeal court was procedural, and that they were confident that the verdict would be upheld. The appeal was scheduled for 5 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.new-most.info/press-centre/archives/18656.htm|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs case continues|publisher=Novi Most|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/14082904.html|title=Maniacs case back in court|publisher=Segodnya|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.11channel.dp.ua/news/dp/2009/10/02/16995.html|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs case goes to appeal court (with television news video)|publisher=www.11channel.dp.ua|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the newspaper ''Novi Most'', the mothers of Sayenko and Suprunyuk said that their children were being treated well in prison. It was also reported that Igor Sayenko was considering setting up a website about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://most-dnepr.info/stories/leftside/18877/18888.htm|title=Dnepropetrovsk maniacs to go on the Internet?|publisher=Novi Most|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the life sentences passed on Sayenko and Suprunyuk in February 2009.

==Media==
===Chilean documentary===
[[File:Suprunyuck roadside.jpg|thumb|right|Suprunyuk waits at the roadside before the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. The yellow plastic bag conceals the hammer used in the attack. A longer version of the Yatzenko murder video was obtained by the Chilean [[television|TV]] documentary series ''{{lang|es|Aquí en Vivo}}''.]]

On 2 August 2010, the [[Chile]]an television channel [[Red Televisiva Megavisión|MEGA]] broadcast a documentary about the case. It was titled ''{{lang|es|Los maníacos del martillo}}'' (''The Hammer Maniacs'') and ran for 1 hour and 25 minutes as part of the investigative series ''{{lang|es|Aquí en Vivo}}'' (''Here, Live''). Journalist Michele Canale flew to Dnepropetrovsk and interviewed a range of people involved in the case.

The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk maintained the innocence of their children, while detectives involved in the case gave their recollections, and repeated the lack of confirmation for the theory that the murder videos had been shot as [[snuff film]]s for sale overseas. Lidia Mikrenischeva, an elderly woman who survived a hammer attack and helped to identify the killers in court, was also interviewed. She recalled being struck on the head from behind and falling to the ground, but her life was saved when the dogs accompanying her barked loudly and scared off the attackers. Natalia Ilchenko, the mother of the first known victim Ekaterina Ilchenko, recalled finding her daughter unrecognizable after the hammer attack, and commented that the killers should not be compared to animals because they killed for fun.

The documentary was notable for showing a wide range of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Sayenko and Suprunyuk are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their [[Daewoo Lanos]] taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what they are going to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through [[binoculars]] for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director [[Jorge Olguín (director)|Jorge Olguín]], who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.

The documentary also showed a video recording of Sayenko's confession, in which he admits that robbery was a motive for some of the killings. A video of Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after an alleged beating by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison, but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still unanswered questions about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |title=Capítulo 6 Aquí en Vivo: 'Los maníacos del martillo' |publisher= |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311011756/http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged copycat case in Irkutsk ==

On 5 April 2011, two [[Russia]]n youths, Artyom Anoufriev ({{lang-ru|Артём Ануфриев}}) (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin ({{lang-ru|Никита Лыткин}}) (born 1993), known as the [[Academy maniacs]] ({{lang-ru|Академовские маньяки}}) were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in [[Irkutsk]]. The attacks, which involved a mallet and knife, began in December 2010. Both were arrested after a video recording showing a female body being mutilated with a knife was found on a camera belonging to Lytkin's uncle, who had become suspicious. According to media reports, the youths were influenced by reading about the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs on the Internet. A psychiatric examination found them sane, and they told doctors they chose weak people as their victims. On 2 April 2013, Anoufriev was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Lytkin to 24 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lifenews.ru/news/58330|title=Killers take script from the Internet|publisher=[[LifeNews|Lifenews.ru]]|language=Russian|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsru.com/crime/09jun2011/nazimaniacconfes.html|title=Maniac from Akademgorodok, Irkutsk records video message, confessing to evil of nationalism|publisher=NEWSru|language=Russian|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irk.kp.ru/online/news/990955/|title=Hammer killers from Akademgorodok to spend longer in jail: trial will not begin before December|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|language=Russian|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vsp.ru/social/2011/10/29/517150|title=Killing – It's fun|publisher=www.vsp.ru|language=Russian|date=October 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://38.mvd.ru/news/item/912746/|title=Irkutsk "hammer killers" convicted over a series of murders, assassinations and extremism |publisher=38.mvd.ru|language=Russian|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Georgia Apple Festival''' is an annual festival in [[Ellijay, Georgia]]. The festival has been held every October since 1971 and offers handmade crafts, live music, and apples. An annual parade and antique car show are also held in conjunction with the festival.

==History==
After the [[boll weevil]] came through and destroyed Georgia's [[cotton]] crops in the 1920s, [[Gilmer County, Georgia|Gilmer County]]'s economy was bolstered by its [[apple]] orchards. A festival to celebrate the apples and what they did for the county  during the hard times created by the loss of the cotton crop was first held in 1971.

==Apples and Attractions==
There are over 300 vendors and exhibitions. The vendor booths include candles, woodwork, crafts, food, and blacksmith and glass blowing exhibits. Apple fritters, pies, and other apple treats are the face of the Georgia apple festival. The hundreds of booths feature craftsmen and artisans from throughout the Southeastern United States.

'''Hurricane preparedness in New Orleans''' has been an issue since the city's early settlement because of its location.

[[New Orleans]] was built on a [[marsh]]. Unlike the first two centuries of its existence, today a little under half of the modern city sits below [[sea level]]. The city is surrounded by the [[Mississippi River]], [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to the north, and [[Lake Borgne]] on the east.

The earliest-settled parts of New Orleans and surrounding communities are above sea level. However, flooding was long a threat, from the periodic high waters of the Mississippi and from more occasional severe tropical storms which [[storm surge|pushed the waters]] of Lake Pontchartrain into settled areas. Construction of the [[levee]]s along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. These earthen barriers were erected to prevent damage caused by seasonal Mississippi River flooding. The Lake Pontchartrain shore was mostly undeveloped [[swamp]], and only small levees were built there in the 19th century.

==Colonial era==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Awareness of the city's vulnerability to hurricanes dates back to the early Colonial era. A major hurricane hit the city in September 1722, leveling many of the buildings in the young city.

1794 was perhaps as dreadful a year as the city of New Orleans ever experienced, as it suffered two hurricanes in addition to a major fire.

==19th century hurricanes==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The 19th century saw such hurricanes as the [[1856 Last Island Hurricane]] and the [[1893 Chenière Caminada hurricane]], which were devastating.

==Early 20th century hurricanes==
1909 saw the [[1909 Grand Isle hurricane|Grand Isle hurricane]] hit the city. There was major flooding in the "back of town" area and in the undeveloped swamps north of town.

The [[1915 New Orleans hurricane]], or as it was called locally, "the Great Storm of 1915" struck with more wind damage than the 1909 storm. Flooding was more limited in scope and duration due to improved drainage pumping. However, Lake Pontchartrain rose to a higher level than previously recorded, overtopping some of the back levees. The Sewage and Water Board recommended taller levees to protect the city from flooding on the lake side.

A much larger project to build up levees along the lake and extend the shoreline out by [[dredging]] began in 1927. As the city grew, there was increased pressure to develop lower-lying areas. A large system of [[canal]]s and pumps was constructed to drain the land. Flooding containment efforts until the mid-20th century primarily focused on floods from the [[Mississippi River]].

In 1947, the [[1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane|Fort Lauderdale hurricane]] struck the New Orleans area. There was moderate wind damage. Flood prevention was largely successful in [[New Orleans|Orleans Parish]], but there was severe flooding in the new [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|East Jefferson]] suburbs near the Lake.

==Late 20th century hurricanes==
[[Image:Hurricanes Category 3 or greater within 100 miles of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hurricanes of Category 3 or greater passing within 100 miles of New Orleans 1852–2005. from [[NOAA]]]]
[[Hurricane Flossy (1956)|Hurricane Flossy]] in 1956 resulted in flooding in parts of [[Eastern New Orleans]].

[[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965 alerted a new generation to the threat posed by major hurricanes. As [[radar]] showed the storm heading for the city, a mandatory evacuation of [[Eastern New Orleans]] was declared. The [[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] channeled [[storm surge]] into the metro area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A levee failure was responsible for major flooding in the [[Lower 9th Ward]].

The heavy flood damage caused by Hurricane Betsy brought concerns about hurricane flooding to the forefront. Betsy resulted in a major redesign of the levee system. By [[Flood Control Act of 1965|authorizing]] the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to design and construct the flood protection, Congress essentially overrode responsibility for flood protection by the local levee boards.  The [[Flood Control Act of 1965]] directed the Corps of Engineers to plan for the maximum anticipated hurricane for the area. (This project was still under construction when the city was struck by Katrina 40 years later.)

The Corps of Engineers also designed a Lake Pontchartrain Hurricane Barrier to shield the city with flood gates like those which protect the [[Netherlands]] from the [[North Sea]]. Congress provided funding, and construction began in 1971. But the work stopped in 1977 when a federal judge ruled, in a [[lawsuit]] brought by the environmental group ''Save Our Wetlands'', that the Corps' [[environmental impact statement]] was deficient. In 1985, after nearly a decade of court battles, the Corps scrapped the plan, and decided to reinforce the existing levee system instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112769984088951774|last=Schoenbrod|first=David|title=The Lawsuit That Sank New Orleans|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 26, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512162557/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB112769984088951774.html|archivedate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of 1969's [[Hurricane Camille]] was known in advance through improved radar technology and much of New Orleans braced for a repeat of Betsy. But Camille turned east and wreaked havoc on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf coast]] of [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]].

[[Hurricane Juan (1985)]] prompted a large evacuation from the city but did little damage.

[[Hurricane Andrew]] threatened the city in 1992.  Clearly a major killer storm which had already devastated parts of south [[Florida]], it prompted the largest evacuation of the city to date. Andrew turned west of the city but prompted re-evaluation of emergency evacuation procedures.

[[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998 precipitated an even larger evacuation. The [[Louisiana Superdome]] was opened as a shelter of last resort for those unable to evacuate, with unfortunate consequences as much of the venue was looted. Highways out of the city were tied up bumper to bumper, prompting development of the [[Contraflow lane reversal]] plan. The evacuation from Greater New Orleans and the [[Mississippi]] coast was the largest in U.S. history up to that point. [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lix/html/top10.htm]

Georges missed the city, but it caused significant [[storm surge]], raising the level of Lake Pontchartrain to the point that the city was spared major flooding only by the lake levees and flood walls. There was significant destruction to the areas just outside the flood walls, including at Little Woods [?] and at [[West End, New Orleans|West End]] near the mouth of the [[17th Street Canal]].

==21st century==
In early 2001, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), named three major scenarios as being among the most serious threats to the nation: (1) a major hurricane hitting New Orleans, (2) a terrorist attack in New York City, and (3) a large earthquake hitting San Francisco.&lt;ref name="NOdoomsday"&gt;Berger, Eric. "[http://www.hurricane.lsu.edu/_in_the_news/houston.htm Keeping its head above water: New Orleans faces doomsday scenario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907181549/http://www.hurricane.lsu.edu/_in_the_news/houston.htm |date=September 7, 2005 }}." ''[[Houston Chronicle]].'' December 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a Corps of Engineers study was done on the cost and feasibility of protecting southeast Louisiana from a major [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, including construction of floodgate structures and raising existing levees. The report also suggested that the chances of a major [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane directly striking New Orleans was a one-in-500-year event.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Eric. "[http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/pao/Riverside/Sept-Oct_04_Riv.pdf Old plans revived for Category 5 hurricane protection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906014701/http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/pao/Riverside/Sept-Oct_04_Riv.pdf |date=September 6, 2005 }}." ''[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].'' September–October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warnings of dangerous vulnerability===
In 2001, the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' published a story which predicted that a severe hurricane striking New Orleans, "would strand 250,000&amp;nbsp;people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under {{convert|20|ft|m}} of water. Thousands of refugees could end up in Houston."&lt;ref name="NOdoomsday" /&gt; In 2002, ''[[The Times Picayune]]'' published a feature covering various scenarios, including a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane hitting the city from the south. The series also explored the various environmental changes that have increased the area's vulnerability. One article in the series concluded that hundreds of thousands would be left homeless, and it would take months to dry out the area and begin to make it liveable. But there wouldn't be much for residents to come home to.  The local economy would be in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;McQuaid, John; Schleifstein, Mark. "[http://www.nola.com/hurricane/content.ssf?/washingaway/index.html]." ''[[Times Picayune]].'' June 23–27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many concerns focus around the fact that the city lies below sea level with a [[levee]] system that was designed for hurricanes of no greater intensity than [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]].&lt;ref&gt;Westerink, J.J.; Luettich, R.A. "[http://nd.edu/~coast/reports_papers/Civil%20Engineering%20Magazine%20-%20June%202003.htm The Creeping Storm]." ''Civil Engineering Magazine.'' June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, its natural defenses, the surrounding [[marshland]] and the [[barrier island]]s, have been dwindling in recent years.&lt;ref name="gonewater"&gt;Bourne, Joel K. "[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2004/10/louisiana-wetlands/bourne-text Gone with the Water]." ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].'' October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just a few months before Katrina, the [[FX Networks|FX]] docudrama ''[[Oil Storm]]'' depicted a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane hitting New Orleans, killing thousands of people and forcing residents to evacuate and hide out in the Superdome, and speculated about a national economic meltdown caused by the decreased oil supply.

===Hurricane Isidore===
[[Hurricane Isidore]] in 2002 prompted some cautious New Orleanians to evacuate; the majority kept an eye on the news without leaving town.

===LSU-USACE Study===
In 2002 the Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the [[Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute]] at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU), and the authorities in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], modeled the effects and aftermath of a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] strike on New Orleans. The model predicted an unprecedented disaster, with extensive loss of life and property. The study identified the problem: the New Orleans area is like a bowl, surrounded by levees which are strongest along the outer Mississippi and primarily intended to contain river flooding. When a hurricane drives water into [[Lake Pontchartrain]], the weaker levees bordering Pontchartrain and canals leading to it are overwhelmed. Water then flows into the below-sea-level city, accompanied by water overflowing the levees along the Mississippi on the south side of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wetlands/hurricane1.html Hurricane Risk for New Orleans]." ''American RadioWorks.'' September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Ivan===
In 2004 [[Hurricane Ivan]]'s threat to the city resulted in the largest evacuation of the city to date. Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] issued a call for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on September 13. An estimated 600,000 or more evacuated from Greater New Orleans. The [[contraflow]] plan was put into full effect for the first time, but rather late in the evacuation due to various confusions. This proved valuable practice, for the contraflow was implemented much more smoothly in 2005.

===Hurricane Pam exercise===
Hurricane Pam was a hypothetical hurricane used as a disaster scenario to drive planning for a 13-parish area in Southeastern Louisiana, including the city of [[New Orleans]], in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;News Release. "[http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=13051 Hurricane Pam Exercise Concludes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426004030/http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=13051 |date=April 26, 2006 }}."

June 3, 2004.'''&lt;/ref&gt;  Developed by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security, Emergency Preparedness, the [[National Weather Service]], and Innovative Emergency Management, Inc., the mock hurricane scenario and its projected consequences were the focal point of an eight-day exercise held at the State Emergency Operations Center in [[Baton Rouge]] in July 2004. Hurricane Pam was a slow-moving [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] storm with sustained winds of 120&amp;nbsp;mph. It brought with it up to {{convert|20|in|mm}} of rain to some parts of southeastern Louisiana and caused levee-topping [[storm surge]]. The consequence assessment for Hurricane Pam indicated that more than one million people would be displaced and that 600,000 buildings would be damaged, with some completely destroyed. 60,000 people would be killed. The report on the simulation, TIME reported, warned that transportation would be a major problem in any storm situation paralleling the fictional "Hurricane Pam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1103591,00.html 1 The Mayor] Amanda Ripley. TIME. September 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Follow-on Hurricane Pam workshops were conducted in November/December 2004, July 2005, and August 2005.

The Hurricane Pam scenario and the level of attention that the federal government paid to it were discussed following the catastrophic effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] on [[New Orleans]] in November and December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beriwal |first1=Madhu |title=Hurricanes Pam and Katrina: A Lesson in Disaster Planning |url=https://www.colorado.edu/hazards/o/archives/2005/nov05/nov05d2.html |website=Natural Hazards Center |publisher=[[University of Colorado Boulder]] |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714155931/https://www.colorado.edu/hazards/o/archives/2005/nov05/nov05d2.html |archivedate=14 July 2007 |date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Madhu |first1=Beriwal |last2=Moore |first2=Avagene |title=Hurricane Pam and Hurricane Katrina: Pre-event 'Lessons Learned' |url=http://www.emforum.org/vforum/lc051214.htm |website=EIIP Virtual Forum |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305043100/http://www.emforum.org/vforum/lc051214.htm |archivedate=5 March 2006 |date=14 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Cindy===
[[Hurricane Cindy (2005)|Hurricane Cindy]] hit Louisiana at just barely hurricane strength on July 5, 2005. Many New Orleanians paid it little attention in advance, some having gotten blasé about threats of hurricanes which for decades had missed the city. However, Cindy's winds gusted to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the city, knocking branches off trees and causing New Orleans' largest blackout since [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="CindyTCR"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Cindy|publisher=NOAA|date=February 14, 2006|accessdate=May 15, 2006|format=PDF|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL032005_Cindy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience encouraged many to evacuate when the much more powerful Hurricane Katrina was heading towards the city less than two months later.&lt;ref name="Christiansburg"&gt;{{cite web|author=Niki King|publisher=The Roanoke Times|date=December 5, 2005|accessdate=August 12, 2008|title=Katrina victims make Christiansburg a home|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv%5Cwb/43728|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104164919/http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv%5Cwb/43728|archivedate=January 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Del_Rio_Katrina"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Gleason|publisher=Del Rio News-Herald|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=August 12, 2008|title=Louisiana family calling Del Rio home|url=http://www.delrionewsherald.com/story.lasso?ewcd=8d3a20080e1b17ef}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Decision Points: Katrina Response Was 'flawed', but I Wasn't to Blame: Bush|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/08/decision-points-katrina-bush|publisher=The Guardian Press|accessdate=Nov 12, 2011|location=London|date=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina===
[[Image:Hurricane Route sign Tulane Avenue floodlines.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Evacuation route sign on Tulane Avenue in New Orleans shows lines from long-standing flood waters, after Hurricane Katrina.]]

[[Hurricane Katrina]] threatened the city in August 2005. The eye of the huge storm grazed the eastern side of the city, sparing it from the worst of its power. However, due to poorly designed levees and the worst civil engineering failure in United States history, most of the city experienced flooding similar to a direct hit; see: [[Levee failures in Greater New Orleans, 2005]].

There were many predictions of hurricane risk in New Orleans before Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jim. "[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282151.html New Orleans is Sinking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907092726/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282151.html |date=September 7, 2005 }}."

"[http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=9754 Thinking Big About Hurricanes]." ''The American Prospect.'' May 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26 the storm, at one point up to a Category&amp;nbsp;5, was in the Gulf with a projection to possibly hit New Orleans a few days later. (The previous day the projected path was towards the Florida Panhandle.) On August 27 Mayor Nagin declared a state of emergency and called for a voluntary evacuation. The following day he issued the city's first ever whole-city mandatory evacuation order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Townsend|first=Frances|title=The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned|url=http://library.stmarytx.edu/acadlib/edocs/katrinawh.pdf|publisher=The White House|accessdate=Nov 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mandatory evacuation order is an extreme measure: the most recent such order in Louisiana occurred when east New Orleans was ordered evacuated in 1965.

There have been various plans to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The evacuation plans were the most successful. The contraflow worked relatively smoothly, and over 80% of the population succeeded in fleeing the area in advance of the storm. The evacuation no doubt saved thousands of lives. However, beyond the evacuation of those willing and able to leave town through their own resources, almost every other aspect of preparedness was found wanting.

Like many other cities, New Orleans heavily relied on evacuation in case of a Category&amp;nbsp;5 storm. The inadequacy of evacuation plans was shown when no provision was made in time to evacuate the large number of people– elderly, disabled, those without cars– who could not leave by their own means.

Blame for lack of preparedness has been leveled at all levels of government. New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] has been criticized for not following the city's evacuation plan which called for the use of school buses to transport disadvantaged and elderly citizens out of the city. Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] was also criticized for not deploying the [[Louisiana National Guard]] sooner, although she did in fact deploy them before the hurricane hit and requested reinforcements from other states. Blanco asked for additional resources from the federal government, but refused to declare martial law or a state of emergency.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Saundra|title=Administrative Breakdowns in the Governmental Response to Hurricane Katrina|url=http://polisci.msu.edu/schneider/Administrative%20Breakdowns.pdf|publisher=JSTORE|accessdate=Nov 12, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114184538/http://polisci.msu.edu/schneider/Administrative%20Breakdowns.pdf|archivedate=November 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disorganization began when the Louisiana Governor declined a proposal from the White House to put National Guard troops under the control of the federal government.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;  President [[George W.

====Hurricane relief plan vs. non-existent flood relief plan====
One of the most significant planning failures was that there was no plan for the effects of a levee breach with the mass flooding that would result. After a typical hurricane hit the region, the plan would be for disaster relief forces to reach the city by overland routes. Since there was no New Orleans mass flooding and isolation by flooding plan, the plan that was pulled off the books was the hurricane relief plan. This plan failed because the relief personnel, most of whom were in trucks, could not get past nor through the areas that were under water. That there was no mass flooding relief plan to be executed was obvious by the lack of any heavy-lift helicopters such as Chinooks in relief forces that would have replaced the usual truck-born hurricane relief forces. A mass flooding with regional isolation plan would not have used land-based relief forces at all overland relief was impossible because of the barrier in place with the flooding.

====Louisiana Superdome fiasco====
The designation by the city of the [[Louisiana Superdome]] as the "shelter of last resort" proved poor. It did not meet the safety standards required for a [[Red Cross]] shelter and thus it was not staffed by them or the [[Salvation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Frances Fargo.  "[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/reports/katrina-lessons-learned.pdf Katrina Lessons Learned]." ''[[The White House]]''.  February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands were trapped inside it as the area around it flooded and part of the roof blew off. Provisions for supplies were just barely adequate; sanitation, medical, and crowd control were worse. Since there was no flood-based federal nor state plan, heavy lift capacity helicopters that could have brought 16 tons of water, medical and food per flight were nowhere to be found. The much less effective hurricane-only response utilized much smaller UH and [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters.

Under the [[National Response Plan]], disaster planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility.  On the day after the Hurricane, [[Michael Chertoff]] invoked the National Response Plan, transferring emergency authority to the [[Department of Homeland Security]].

Civil order broke down, infrastructure failed, and some 80% of the city flooded. A few government responders, including Coast Guard helicopters and Louisiana Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Boats, responded early and worked hard to save people stranded in the flooding, but their numbers were inadequate for the scope of the disaster. Private volunteers with boats assisted with rescue in great numbers, but significant Federal response was largely absent until 5&amp;nbsp;days after the disaster.

While no detailed proposals had yet been made to augment the New Orleans levee system to be capable of withstanding a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 4]] or greater hurricane, in October 2004, the Corps of Engineers submitted a proposal to Congress requesting US$4&amp;nbsp;Million to fund a preliminary study for such a plan. Congress tabled the proposal, never addressing it on the floor, citing budgetary concerns resulting from the [[Iraq War]]. A senior Corps official made an off-hand estimate that this project would require approximately $1&amp;nbsp;Billion dollars and would take 20 years, stating "It's possible to protect New Orleans from a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane... we've got to start. To do nothing is tantamount to negligence."&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Paul. {{cite web|url=http://hurricane.lsu.edu/_in_the_news/phillyinquirer100804.htm |title="New Orleans' growing danger." |accessdate=2005-09-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041220185747/http://hurricane.lsu.edu/_in_the_news/phillyinquirer100804.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2004 |df=mdy-all }} ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]].'' October 8, 2004.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not such additional funding might have been capable of preventing the extensive flooding in New Orleans caused by Katrina, is a matter that has yet to be determined.

Starting in 2003, federal spending on the Southeast Louisiana Project was substantially reduced. Lt. General Carl Strock, [[Chief of Engineers]] at the Corps of Engineers, said that, "at the time that these levees were designed and constructed, it was felt that that was an adequate level given the probability of an event like this occurring." Strock also said that he did not believed that funding levels contributed to the disaster, commenting that, "the intensity of this storm simply exceeded the design capacity of this levee." Strock also told reporters that the Corps of Engineers "had a 200- or 300-year level of protection. That means that an event that we were protecting from might be exceeded every 200 or 300 years."&lt;ref&gt;News Transcript.

''[[United States Department of Defense]].'' September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 through 2005, the Bush administration battled with Congress to cut a total of approximately 67% from the budgetary requests from the Corps of Engineers for levee augmentation projects in the New Orleans area, but ultimately settled with Congress on a 50% cut in these budgetary requests. In February 2004, Al Naomi, a project manager for the Corps of Engineers, stated that, "I've got at least six levee construction contracts (in the New Orleans area where funding has been cut) that need to be done to raise the levee protection back to where it should be (because of settling). Right now I owe my contractors about US$5&amp;nbsp;Million. And we're going to have to pay them interest."&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Will. "[http://alternet.org/story/24871/ Why the Levee Broke]." ''[[AlterNet]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as the Bush administration was cutting the Corps of Engineers' budget, many were criticizing the administration for not cutting the budget more. The ''[[New York Times]]'', in particular, published several editorials criticizing the large size of the $17&amp;nbsp;Billion Corps budget, and called for the Senate to cut, "pork," in S. 728, which would have provided $512&amp;nbsp;Million in funding for hurricane protection projects in southern Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Noel. {{cite web|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=4796 |title="The American Thinker." |accessdate=2006-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030000312/http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=4796 |archivedate=October 30, 2005 |df=mdy-all }} ''The American Thinker.''

Just after Hurricane Katrina hit, there was some concern expressed that government officials had placed an overemphasis on disaster recovery, while neglecting the process of pre-planning and preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Bill; Alpert, Bruce; McQuaid, John. {{cite web|url=http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/alpert083105.html |title="Feds' Disaster Planning Shifts Away from Preparedness." |accessdate=2005-09-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224075301/http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/alpert083105.html |archivedate=December 24, 2005 |df=mdy-all }} ''Newhouse News Service.'' August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17 months following Katrina, five investigations were carried out.  The only federally ordered study was conducted by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and paid for by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/weblogs/nola/index.ssf?%2Fmtlogs%2Fnola_nolaview%2Farchives%2F2006_06_01.html |title=NOLA View weblog |accessdate=2007-10-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930191702/http://www.nola.com/weblogs/nola/index.ssf?%2Fmtlogs%2Fnola_nolaview%2Farchives%2F2006_06_01.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two major independent studies were done by the University of California at Berkeley&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/%7Enew_orleans/ ILIT DOWNLOAD CENTER (sponsored in part by the National Science Foundation)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Louisiana State University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dotd.louisiana.gov/administration/teamlouisiana/TeamLaLetter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Two minor studies were done by FEMA and the insurance industry.  All five studies basically agree on the engineering mechanisms of failure.

The failure mechanisms included overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge, consequential undermining of flood wall foundations or other weakening by water of the wall foundations, and the storm surge pressures exceeding the strength of the floodwalls.  In June 2006, a contrite Lt. Gen Carl Strock took responsibility for the failure of metro New Orleans flood protection, calling the system "a system in name only."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/01/news/orleans.php Army engineers admit levees were badly made – International Herald Tribune&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2006, the Corps of Engineers planned to spend $6&amp;nbsp;billion to make sure that by 2010, the city would probably be flooded only once every 100 years.  But this would not equal the best levee system in the world, which is in The Netherlands.  That system is designed to protect populated areas against anything but a 1-in-10,000-years flood.  If the Corps built a 1-in-500-year levee system in New Orleans, Ivan van Heerden, deputy director of Louisiana State University's Hurricane Center, says, it would cost $30&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1229102,00.html Why We Don't Prepare For Disaster, Amanda Ripley. TIME. August 20, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the [[National Academy of Engineering]] and the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], levees and floodwalls surrounding New Orleans—no matter how large or sturdy—cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events.  Levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that completely eliminate risk.  For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12647 National Academy of Sciences ''"Levees Cannot Fully Eliminate Risk of Flooding to New Orleans"''] April 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==The impact of Louisiana's sinking coast==
When the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] started systematically leveeing the river in the 19th century, it cut off the region's main source of silt, the raw material of delta-building in the [[Mississippi Delta]] and the [[Wetlands of Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="Katrina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tidwell|first=Mike|title=''The Ravaging Tide: Strange Weather, Future Katrinas, and the Coming Death of America's Coastal Cities|publisher=Free Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7432-9470-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of large buildings and infrastructure and the leaching of water, oil and gas from beneath the surface across the region have also contributed to the problem. Following the great floods of 1927, the Mississippi River was surrounded by a series of levees meant to protect the city from such floods. In 1965, New Orleans was hit by [[Hurricane Betsy]], which caused tremendous flooding in the New Orleans area. The federal government began a levee-building program to protect New Orleans from a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane (the same strength as Betsy). These series of levees were completed in recent years before Hurricane Katrina.

However, an [[unintended consequence]] of the levees was that natural silt deposits from the Mississippi River were unable to replenish the delta, causing the coastal wetlands of Louisiana to wash away and the city of New Orleans to sink even deeper.&lt;ref name="gonewater"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt; The Mississippi River delta is subsiding faster than any other place in the nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} While the land is sinking, sea level has been rising. In the past 100 years, land subsidence and sea-level rise have recently added three feet&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt; to all [[storm surge]]s. That extra height puts affected areas under deeper water; it also means flooding from weaker storms and from the outer edges of powerful storms spreads over wider areas. The marshes that ring New Orleans, as well as the land depression of the city itself, originally above sea level,&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt; have sunk the quickest.

The problem with the wetlands was further worsened by salt water intrusion caused by the canals dug by the oil companies and private individuals in this marshland. This erosion of the wetlands not only caused Louisiana to lose {{convert|24|sqmi|km2}} per year of land annually and {{convert|1900|sqmi|km2}} of land since the 1930s, but it also destroyed Louisiana’s first line of defense against hurricanes.&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt;

Hurricanes draw their strength from the sea, so they quickly weaken and begin to dissipate when they make landfall. Hurricanes moving over fragmenting marshes toward the New Orleans area can retain more strength, and their winds and large waves pack more speed and destructive power. Scientists working for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources measured some of these effects during [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992. Andrew's surge height dropped from {{convert|9.3|ft|m}} at Cocodrie to {{convert|3.3|ft|m}} at the Houma Navigation Canal {{convert|23|mi|km}} to the north. For every mile of the marsh-and-water landscape it traversed, it lost 3.1&amp;nbsp;inches of height, sparing some homes farther north from more flooding. Currently Louisiana has 30% of the total coastal marsh and accounts for 90% of the coastal marsh loss in the lower 48 states. The engineering of the river has basically brought the Gulf of Mexico much closer to New Orleans, making it more vulnerable to hurricanes.

The combination of sinking land and rising seas has placed the Mississippi River delta as much as {{convert|3|ft|m}} lower relative to sea level than it was a century ago,&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt; and the process continues. That means hurricane floods driven inland from the Gulf have risen by corresponding amounts. Storms that once would not have had much impact can now be devastating events, and flooding now penetrates into places where it has rarely occurred before. The problem also is slowly eroding levee protection, cutting off evacuation routes sooner and putting dozens of communities and valuable infrastructure at risk of being wiped out by the flooding.

State and federal officials have recently pushed a $14&amp;nbsp;billion plan to rebuild wetlands over the next 30 years, to be funded by oil and gas royalties, called Coast 2050.
&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coast2050.gov/ Coast 2050] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323010219/http://www.coast2050.gov/ |date=March 23, 2013 }}." Accessed April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana will receive US$540&amp;nbsp;million under the energy bill enacted in August 2005. More money for this program is likely to come with aid from Hurricane Katrina. The original actual cost needed for the project, however, was $14&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt;

Wetlands have the capacity to absorb storm surges at the rate of {{convert|1|ft|m|sing=on}} per {{convert|2.7|mi|km}}. However, due to the systematic, long-term nature of wetland loss,&lt;ref name="fischetti"/&gt; and because wetland remediation can take decades,&lt;ref&gt;Schleifstein, Mark. "[http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf?/washingaway/futureofcoast_1.html  Coastal Resuscitation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912000854/http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf?%2Fwashingaway%2Ffutureofcoast_1.html |date=September 12, 2005 }}." ''[[Times Picayune]].'' June 23–27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not possible to pinpoint blame for wetland loss on any specific Congress, legislature, President, or governor.

'''Illegal dumping''',&lt;ref name="brampton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rdek" /&gt; also called '''fly dumping''' or '''fly tipping''',&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt; is the dumping of [[waste]] illegally instead of using an authorised method such as [[kerbside collection]] or using an authorised [[civic amenity site|rubbish dump]]. It is the illegal deposit of any [[waste]] onto land, including waste dumped or tipped on a site with no licence to accept waste.&lt;ref name="tidy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] developed a “profile” of the typical illegal dumper. Characteristics of offenders include, local residents, construction and landscaping contractors, waste removers, scrap yard operators, and automobile and tire repair shops.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/2000CNVU.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1995+Thru+1999&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D:%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C95thru99%5CTxt%5C00000009%5C2000CNVU.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|title=Document Display {{!}} NEPIS {{!}} US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Illegal dumping is typically distinguished from [[littering]] by the type and amount of material and/or the manner in which it is discarded. An example of littering could be throwing a cigarette on the ground. However, emptying a [[rubbish bin]] with no permission in a public or private area can be classified as illegal dumping.

The term ''fly tipping'' is derived from the verb ''tip'', meaning "to throw out of a vehicle", and ''on the fly'', meaning "on the wing" – to throw away carelessly or casually.&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt;

== Types of materials dumped ==
[[File:Law enforcement officer inspects tires that were illegally dumped.jpg|alt=Image of an officer looking at illegally dumped tires on the side of the road.|thumb|Illegally dumped tires on the side of the road.]]
Illegal dumping involves the unauthorized disposal of numerous types of waste. Typical materials dumped include building materials from construction sites, such as drywall, roofing shingles, lumber, brick, concrete, and siding. Other frequently dumped materials include automobile parts, household appliances, household waste, furniture, yard scraps, and medical waste.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

== Causes of illegal dumping ==
The reasons people illegally dump vary; however, research indicates that lack of legal waste disposal options is a primary factor. A shortage of legal disposal options drives demand for waste removal service, increasing prices. Studies also have found unit pricing, which involves charging a set price per bag of garbage thrown out, may contribute to illegal dumping. Although the intent of unit pricing is to encourage people to use other forms of waste disposal such as recycling and composting, people may turn to disposing of waste in unauthorized areas to save money.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ichinose|first=Daisuke|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Masashi|date=2011-01|title=On the relationship between the provision of waste management service and illegal dumping|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2010.01.002|journal=Resource and Energy Economics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=79–93|doi=10.1016/j.reseneeco.2010.01.002|issn=0928-7655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, weak enforcement of laws prohibiting illegal dumping and a lack of public awareness regarding the environmental, health, and economic dangers of illegal dumping contribute.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/waste-management/waste-management-permit-guidance/solid-waste-section/illegal-dumping|title=NC DEQ: Illegal Dumping|website=deq.nc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of illegal dumping ==
Effects of illegal dumping include health, environmental, and economic consequences. While legal waste disposal locations, such as landfills, are designed to contain waste and its byproducts from infiltrating the surrounding environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Landfill|date=2018-05-22|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Landfill&amp;oldid=842449428|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; illegal dumping areas do not typically incorporate the same safeguards. Due to this, illegal dumping may sometimes lead to [[pollution]] of the surrounding environment. [[Toxin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or hazardous materials infiltrating soil and drinking water threaten the health of local residents.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Additionally, illegal dump sites that catch fire pollute the air with toxic particles. Environmental pollution due to illegal dumping causes short term and long term health issues. Short term issues include [[asthma]], [[Birth defect|congenital illnesses]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anxiety]], [[headache]]s, [[Dizziness|dizzines]]s and [[nausea]], and [[Eye disease|eye]] and [[Respiratory disease|respiratory infections]]. Long term concerns include [[cancer]] and [[Kidney disease|kidney]], [[Liver disease|liver]], [[Respiratory disease|respiratory]], [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]], [[Brain disease|brain]], [[Nervous system disease|nervous]], and lymphohematopoietic diseases.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Triassi|first=Maria|last2=Alfano|first2=Rossella|last3=Illario|first3=Maddalena|last4=Nardone|first4=Antonio|last5=Caporale|first5=Oreste|last6=Montuori|first6=Paolo|date=2015-2|title=Environmental Pollution from Illegal Waste Disposal and Health Effects: A Review on the "Triangle of Death"|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=12|issue=2|pages=1216–1236|doi=10.3390/ijerph120201216|issn=1661-7827|pmc=4344663|pmid=25622140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond negative health outcomes due to pollution and toxic waste, illegal dumps pose a physical threat. Unstable piles of material and exposed nails threaten harm to humans, specifically children who may be attracted to illegal dumps as play areas.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Illegal dumps also attract [[vermin]] and [[insect]]s. Tires, a material frequently illegally disposed of as most municipalities ban their disposal in landfills, provide an ideal breeding ground for [[mosquito]]s due to stagnant water collected within the wheels. Mosquitos transfer life threatening diseases, such as [[encephalitis]] and [[West Nile virus]], to humans.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Materials disposed of in illegal dumps, specifically tires and electronic waste, are [[Combustibility and flammability|combustible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epa.illinois.gov/topics/waste-management/illegal-dumping/open-dumping/index|title=Open Dumping|last=Batty|first=Stuart|website=epa.illinois.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of fire at illegal dump sites can lead to forest fires, causing [[erosion]] and destroying habitat.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Illegal dumping also negatively affects surrounding property values. Unattractive and odorous accumulations of waste discourage commercial and residential developers from improving communities. Additionally, existing residents may have difficulty “taking pride” in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In addition to decreasing property values and, therefore, tax revenue for governments, illegal dumping costs governments millions of dollars in clean up costs. In the United Kingdom, the Environmental Protection Agency spends £100–150 million annually to investigate and clean up illegal dump sites.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates several million in costs each year nationwide.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

== How to combat illegal dumping ==

Efforts to combat illegal dumping vary in each situation as solutions are crafted with specific community dynamics in mind. However, common approaches include a combination of limiting access to illegal dumping sites, surveillance, enforcement, and increasing access to legal waste disposal opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Waste/SolidWaste/Illegal/Pages/default.aspx|title=Illegal Dumping|website=www.dep.pa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listed below are common techniques employed by governing bodies:

=== Limit access ===
The majority of illegal dumpers engage in illicit waste disposal at night, as darkness helps them avoid detection.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Installing lighting around known or potential illegal dumping sites deters the practice. In [[Canada Bay, New South Wales]], the city installed [[solar power]]ed lights in dumping “hot spots”. Following installation of the lights, the city received less complaints regarding illegal dumping in those areas.

Other methods of limiting access include re-[[landscaping]] and beautifying illegal dump sites. Adding aesthetic amenities such as grass, flowers, and benches demonstrates that the site is well maintained, discouraging dumpers. Additionally, increasing community use of the area will adjust locals’ perception of the site from dumping ground to valued open space.

Adding barriers such as fencing, rocks, locked gates, and concrete blocks prevents offenders from accessing dump sites with their vehicles, completely deterring illegal dumping or reducing the volume of disposed materials. For example, [[Maitland, New South Wales]] erected fences around rural dumping sites prevented vehicles from gaining access. Continued monitoring 12 months later showed that 80% of dump sites protected by the fences experienced negligible illegal waste disposal activity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/your-environment/litter-and-illegal-dumping/prevent-illegal-dumping|title=Prevent illegal dumping|first=|date=|website=NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increase surveillance and enforcement ===

Increasing offenders’ risk of getting caught is also a way to combat illegal dumping. The most common way to accomplish this is through surveillance measures, such as video cameras. Camera footage can help law enforcement officials identify dumpers while also collecting data on peak dumping periods. Installation of fake cameras has also been shown to be a deterrent. Police patrols, helicopter and plane surveillance, and community surveillance are also options for increasing risk. Police presence generally deters illegal activity, while community surveillance depends upon residents reporting known illegal dumpers to law enforcement for a monetary reward.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The cities of [[Los Angeles]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] all implement similar reporting schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bss.lacity.org/investigationandenforcement/illegaldumpingcrimetippgm.htm|title=Bureau of Street Services - Illegal dump report form|website=bss.lacity.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Public-Works/RSW/Collection-Services/Illegal-Dumping|title=Illegal Dumping - City of Sacramento|website=www.cityofsacramento.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaklandca.gov/services/public-works/recycling-and-garbage/illegal-dumping/get-a-reward-for-reporting-illegal-dumping|title=Get a Reward for Reporting Illegal Dumping {{!}}   City of Oakland|website=www.oaklandca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:What are you looking at.jpg|alt=Image of a surveillance camera|thumb|Surveillance camera.]]

Cities can implement periodic compliance campaigns, which involve randomly conducted “crackdowns” by law enforcement. Increased police patrols, anti-dumping signage posted in known illegal disposal sites, random inspections of property, and publicity regarding convicted illegal dumpers and the use surveillance can deter illegal dumping.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Provide alternatives ===

Removing illegal dumpers’ reasons for improperly disposing of waste is also an option for governing bodies. Offenders often dump to save money. Cities can offer free or [[Subsidy|subsidized]] waste services to residents to encourage legal disposal. If free and subsidized programs are not feasible due to funding limitations, cities must ensure affordability of waste disposal services. Offering alternate disposal options like recycling and compost centers is also recommended. Giving fines or assigning liability for clean-up costs to those caught illegally disposing of waste can also act as a deterrent.

Combating illegal dumping also involves promoting legal waste disposal avenues. Offering [[Kerbside collection]] and improving waste storage in high density residential areas provides residents with convenient trash disposal options. Communication of available services is important to the success of such programs. Offering similar accommodations for [[Commercial waste|commercial]] and [[Industrial waste|industrial]] waste generated by office buildings, restaurants, schools, and factories will also decrease instances of illegal dumping.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cities can also combat illegal dumping by offering disposal options for materials and substances banned from landfills, such as tires, toxic and hazardous waste, and medical waste. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recommends chipping or shredding tires so that they can be recycled in other uses such as highways, playgrounds, and running tracks.&lt;ref&gt;"Waste tire management" mass.gov. Retrieved 2018-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends disposing of household hazardous and toxic waste in the nearest community drop off location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/household-hazardous-waste-hhw|title=Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Boston]], Massachusetts holds drop off days four times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-works/get-rid-household-hazardous-waste|title=Get rid of household hazardous waste|work=Boston.gov|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules apply to disposal of medical waste. In Boston, officials recommend storing syringes in Sharps Containers and disposing in a designated community site. The city also recommends utilizing mail back services to dispose of used syringes.&lt;ref&gt;"Proper Use and Disposal of Waste and Syringes" mass.gov. Retrieved 2018-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

City governments can implement education campaigns to further mitigate illegal dumping. For example, cities can inform residents and businesses of legal waste disposal avenues through mailed flyers, newspaper and radio announcements, and posters. Posting signs near known illegal dumping sites can also help deter offenders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Cleaning up existing dumps ===
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], waste attracts more waste. Therefore, cleaning up existing illegal dumps is a helpful deterrent for additional illegal dumping. The United States Environmental Protection Agency instituted a program to cap open dumps in tribal communities. 1,100 of these dumps exist in the United States and pose health and environmental risks to the surrounding communities. The open dumps are closed off with a clay liner and soil depth accounting for infiltration and erosion. “Native dryland grass” is planted on top of the newly covered dump to prevent erosion and water monitoring wells are installed nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/tribal-lands/tribal-waste-management-program|title=Tribal Waste Management Program {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Illegal dumping in Campania, Italy ==
The [[Triangle of death (Italy)]] in [[Campania]], Italy is Europe’s “largest illegal waste dump”. The area, which encompasses Italian municipalities [[Acerra]], [[Marigliano]], and [[Nola]], experiences illegal waste disposal practices by the [[Camorra]] such as unauthorized burying of toxic waste under places frequented by humans. Frequent fires at dumping sites and illegal waste fires set by residents have resulted in contamination of the air and drinking water. Additionally, the land has deteriorated due to the illegal waste.

The environmental pollution caused by the illegal dumping has resulted in elevated instances of cancer and cancer mortality in the region. In 2014 and 2015, the Italian government funded health screenings to track the rise in illnesses in Campania.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Studies conducted using the data collected from these screenings found elevated instances of [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], and [[Colorectal cancer|colorectal]] and [[liver cancer]] mortality in one of Campania’s districts. The study attributed this increase in cancer and cancer mortality with toxic exposures from the illegal waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Senior|first=Kathryn|last2=Mazza|first2=Alfredo|date=2004-09|title=Italian "Triangle of death" linked to waste crisis|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(04)01561-X|journal=The Lancet Oncology|volume=5|issue=9|pages=525–527|doi=10.1016/s1470-2045(04)01561-x|issn=1470-2045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic waste in China ==

Illegal dumping of [[electronic waste]], or e-waste, presents environmental and health concerns in [[China]]. The informal e-waste sector recycles the majority of e-waste in China, which is supplied through consumption, [[import]]ation, and [[Production (economics)|production]]. Foreign governments often send e-waste to China as the informal sector offers cheaper recycling services. China is not only the “largest e-waste dumping site”, it also generates large amounts of e-waste. In 2006, China produced 1.3&amp;nbsp;kg of e-waste per capita.

The informal e-waste sector lacks formal government oversight and pays its workers low wages while using recycling practices that expose both workers and the environment to toxic materials.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chi|first=Xinwen|last2=Streicher-Porte|first2=Martin|last3=Wang|first3=Mark Y.L.|last4=Reuter|first4=Markus A.|date=2011-04|title=Informal electronic waste recycling: A sector review with special focus on China|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0956053X10005696|journal=Waste Management|volume=31|issue=4|pages=731–742|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2010.11.006|issn=0956-053X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic substances are found in [[leachate]]s, [[Particulates|particulate]] matter, [[ash]]es, [[Smoke|fume]]s, [[wastewater]], and [[effluent]]s generated during dumping, dismantling, and burning throughout the recycling process. Particles emitted are carried through the air and deposited nearby recycling centers and in surrounding areas. Leachates and wastewater infiltrate the soil, drinking water, livestock, and fish, exposing humans to toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sepúlveda|first=Alejandra|last2=Schluep|first2=Mathias|last3=Renaud|first3=Fabrice G.|last4=Streicher|first4=Martin|last5=Kuehr|first5=Ruediger|last6=Hagelüken|first6=Christian|last7=Gerecke|first7=Andreas C.|date=2010-01|title=A review of the environmental fate and effects of hazardous substances released from electrical and electronic equipments during recycling: Examples from China and India|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2009.04.001|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=30|issue=1|pages=28–41|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2009.04.001|issn=0195-9255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, China has begun to address the informal e-waste sector. At the governmental level, improvements have been made to waste management practices through adoption of Western management schemes such as those found in [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and the [[European Union]]. Additionally, the Chinese government has invested in improved e-waste collection and processing. Locally, various Chinese cities have constructed “recycling industrial parks” where e-waste can be processed efficiently and without harm to the environment. Regulations on e-waste have been implemented in the Chinese regions of [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Jiangsu]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;province, [[Zhejiang]] province and [[Guangdong]] province.

Corporations such as [[Nokia]] and [[Lenovo]] instituted free return services for Chinese customers who wish to dispose of old electronic products from the two companies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==United Kingdom==
[[Waste in the United Kingdom|Rubbish disposal in the UK]] is heavily regulated, with most households having on average one 240 litre bin for recyclable waste and one similar bin of non recyclable waste every week; some areas have additional similar or smaller bins for garden, food, or specific recycling waste. Any large rubbish  e.g. old furniture and mattresses - may need to be taken to the local waste depot by the home owner at their own expense, although many councils will collect certain items for free, or for a small fee. This leads to some people simply leaving their waste in open public spaces or untended public gardens. This is called '''fly tipping'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fly Tipping in the United Kingdom|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/9859261.City_worst_for_fly_tipping/|accessdate=18 May 2017|publisher=Bournemouth Echo|date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, commercial or industrial users may fly-tip to avoid waste handling charges, as will bogus waste disposal firms.

[[Landfill tax|Taxes on landfill]] in the UK have led to illegal waste dumping. Materials illegally disposed of can range from [[green waste]] and domestic items to [[abandoned car]]s and [[construction waste]], much of which may be [[hazardous waste|hazardous]] or toxic.

As the cost of disposing of [[household waste|household rubbish and waste]] increases, so does the number of individuals and businesses that fly-tip, and the UK government has made it easier for members of the public to report fly-tipping.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; The fine or punishment is normally defined by the local council that operates in the local area in which the rubbish was dumped. According to the BBC, fly-tipping costs councils in England and Wales more than £50m annually (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36931848 |title='It fell off the back of the van' - fly-tipping excuses |website=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open dumping==
[[File:Fly tipping, The Avenue, Tatsfield.jpg|thumb|right|Open dump by a rural lane in Tatsfield, Surrey, England]]
'''Open dumps''' are locations where illegally dumped, abandoned piles of [[waste]] and [[debris]] are left in noticeable quantities. [[Fine (penalty)|Fine]]s are a common punishment for a person caught dumping at an open dump. Open dumps are commonly found in [[forest]]s, backyards and [[abandoned building]]s. Open dumps are sometimes removed shortly after they are created, but most will persist for an indefinite period of time when the site is situated in the [[wilderness]] or in [[public space]] without adequate [[public service]]s.

His media career started as a disc jockey at [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] in 1958 and on [[Tyne Tees Television]] in 1960, and he developed a reputation for eccentricity and flamboyance. At the BBC, he presented the first edition of ''Top of the Pops'' in 1964 and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] from 1968. From 1975 until 1994, he presented ''Jim'll Fix It'', a popular television programme in which he arranged for the wishes of viewers, mainly children, to come true. During his lifetime, he was noted for fund-raising and supporting charities and hospitals, in particular [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in Aylesbury, [[Leeds General Infirmary]] and [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in Berkshire. In 2009 he was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "prodigious philanthropist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Anthea|last= Lipsett|url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jul/14/medical-research-funding-jimmy-savile|title= Jim Fixes it for medical students|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2009|access-date= 30 October 2011|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was honoured for his charity work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Paul|last= Taylor|title= Popular Music Since 1955: A Critical Guide to the Literature|publisher= Mansell|year= 1985|isbn= 978-0-7201-1727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1971 and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1990. In 2006 he introduced the last edition of ''Top of the Pops''.

==Early life==
Savile, born in [[Leeds]], was the youngest of seven children (his elder siblings were Mary, Marjory, Vincent, John, Joan, and Christina) in a [[Roman Catholic]] family.&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jimmy|last=Savile|title=God'll Fix it|publisher=Mowbray|year=1979|isbn=978-0264664576}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Vincent Joseph Marie Savile (1886–1953), a [[bookmaker]]'s clerk and insurance agent, and his wife, Agnes Monica Kelly (1886–1972). Savile believed he owed his life to the intercession of [[Margaret Sinclair (nun)|the Venerable Margaret Sinclair]], a Scottish nun, after he recovered quickly from illness, possibly [[pneumonia]],&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt; at the age of two when his mother prayed at [[Leeds Cathedral]] after picking up a pamphlet about Sinclair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3060395.stm |title=Sir Jimmy backs saint calls |work=BBC News |access-date=17 November 2011 |date=11 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18 during the [[Second World War]] he was conscripted to work as a [[Bevin Boys|Bevin Boy]] and worked in [[Coal mining|coal mines]], where he reportedly suffered spinal injuries in an accident and spent a long period recuperating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/my-badge-of-honour-1-2106929 |title= My badge of honour |newspaper=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]] |date=22 June 2007 |location= Leeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savile started playing records in dance halls in the early 1940s, and claimed to be the first DJ. According to his autobiography, he was the first to use [[two turntables and a microphone]] at the Grand Records Ball at the Guardbridge Hotel in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/apr/20/guesteditors2|title= Harland Miller on Jimmy Savile: inventor of hip-hop style|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location= London|access-date= 28 July 2008|last= Miller|first= Harland|date= 27 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph301011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.djawards.com/en/history.php|title= DJ Awards-History|publisher= djawards.com|access-date= 28 July 2008|last= Brewster|first= Bill|last2= Browghton|first2= Frank|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080323111406/http://www.djawards.com/en/history.php |archivedate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his claim to have been the first is disputed; twin turntables were illustrated in the BBC Handbook in 1929 and advertised for sale in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' magazine in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Donovan|first= Paul|title= The Radio Companion|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=79IaAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Savile%27s+claim+was+disputed%22|access-date= 3 July 2011|year= 1991|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location= London|isbn= 978-0-246-13648-0|page= 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a semi-professional sportsman, competing in the 1951 [[Tour of Britain]] [[road bicycle racing|cycle race]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A22368558|work= BBC News|title= Tour of Britain's long ride for respect|date= 4 May 2007|access-date= 18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and working as a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt; He said:

Savile lived in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the later period with [[Ray Teret]], who became his support DJ, assistant and chauffeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/djs-relatives-tell-of-despair-and-sadness-claims-8229385.html|title= DJ's relatives tell of despair and sadness claims|author1= Owen, Jonathan|author2= Cahalan, Paul|newspaper= The Independent on Sunday|location= London|date= 28 October 2012|access-date= 8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savile managed the Plaza Ballroom on [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road, Manchester]], in the mid-1950s.

==Career==
===Radio===
Savile's radio career began as a DJ at [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] from 1958 to 1967. He ran the ''Teen and Twenty Disc Club'' (''TTDC''),&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, John. ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Music of the World'', Volume 1, Media, Industry and Society, p. 468 (Continuum, 2003). {{ISBN|0-8264-6321-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; membership for life, on Radio Luxembourg. For a small fee listeners received a certificate and bracelet with a disc inscribed with the show's name. On the BBC television series ''[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out]]'', he said the title ''Teen and Twenty Disc Club'' had been rejected as too long in favour of ''Top of the Pops''.

In 1968, he joined Radio 1, where he presented ''Savile's Travels'', a weekly programme broadcast on Sundays in which he travelled around the UK talking to members of the public. From 1969 to 1973 he fronted ''Speakeasy'', a discussion programme for teenagers. On Radio 1 he presented the Sunday lunchtime show ''Jimmy Savile's Old Record Club'', playing chart Top 10s from years gone by. It was the first show to feature old charts and Savile used a "points system" in an imaginary quiz with the audience to guess the names of the song and artist. It began in 1973 as ''The Double Top Ten Show'', and ended in 1987 as ''The Triple Top Ten Show'' when he left Radio 1 after 19 years.&lt;ref name=savileradio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/jimmy_savile_page.htm|title= Radio Rewind: Jimmy Savile|publisher=|access-date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented ''The Vintage Chart Show'', playing top tens from 1957 to 1987, on the [[BBC World Service]] from March 1987 until October 1989.

From March 1989 to August 1997 he broadcast on various stations around the UK (mostly taking the [[Oldies|Gold]] format, such as the West Midlands' [[Xtra AM]] and the [[Classic Gold]] network in Yorkshire) where he revived his Radio 1 shows.&lt;ref name=savileradio /&gt; In 1994, satirist [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] gave a [[List of premature obituaries|fake obituary]] on BBC Radio 1 (as a joke), saying that Savile had collapsed and died, which allegedly drew threats of legal action from Savile and forced an apology from Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Joseph|first= Joe|title= Grave concerns|newspaper= The Times|date= 4 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 2005, and 1 January 2007, he presented shows on the [[Real Radio]] network. The Christmas 2005 show counted down the festive Top 10s of 10, 20 and 30 years previously,&lt;ref name=savileradio /&gt; while the New Year 2007 show (also taken by [[Century FM|Century Radio]] following its acquisition by [[GMG Radio|GMG]]) featured Savile recounting anecdotes from his past and playing associated records, mostly from the 1960s and some from the 1970s.

===Television===
Savile's first television role was as a presenter of [[Tyne Tees Television]]'s music programme ''[[Young at Heart (1960 TV series)|Young at Heart]]'', which aired from May 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= Geoff|title= Memories of Tyne Tees Television |year= 1998 |publisher= G P Electronic Services|location= Durham |isbn= 978-0-9522480-6-4 |page=25 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the show was broadcast in black and white, Savile dyed his hair a different colour every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sixties Pop and Music Television 1960–64 |work=Sixties City |url= http://www.sixtiescity.com/PopTV/PopTV6064.shtm |access-date=17 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121005092222/http://www.sixtiescity.com/PopTV/PopTV6064.shtm

On New Year's Day 1964 he presented the first edition of the BBC [[UK Singles Chart|music chart]] television programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' from a television studio in [[Mancunian Films|a converted church]] in Dickenson Road, [[Rusholme]], Manchester. On 30 July 2006, he co-hosted the final weekly edition, ending it with the words "It's number one, it's still ''Top of the Pops''", before turning off the studio lights after the closing credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Top of the Pops bids fond goodbye |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5228858.stm |work= BBC News |date= 31 July 2006 |access-date= 4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed by the BBC on 20 November 2008 and asked about the revival of ''Top of the Pops'' for a Christmas comeback, he said he would welcome a "cameo role" in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sir Jimmy on Top of the Pops return |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7739589.stm |work= BBC News |date= 20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 1969, he hosted the BBC/[[ZDF]] co-production ''[[Pop Go the Sixties]]'', shown across Western Europe, celebrating the hits of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Jimmy Savile dies aged 84 |url= http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/sir-jimmy-savile-dies-aged-84/047126 |access-date=12 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Music Week]] |location =London |date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savile presented a series of [[Public Information Film]]s promoting road safety, notably "[[Clunk Click Every Trip]]", which promoted the use of seatbelts, the clunk representing the sound of the door and the click the sound of the seatbelt fastening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4669540.stm |title=The message clicks |date=1 February 2006 |work=[[BBC Online]] |access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It led to Savile's Saturday-night chat/variety show from 1973 on BBC1 entitled ''Clunk, Click'', which in 1974 featured the UK heats of the ''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]'' featuring [[Olivia Newton-John]]. After two series, ''Clunk, Click'' was replaced by ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'', which he presented from 1975 to 1994. Savile won an award from [[Mary Whitehouse]]'s [[Mediawatch-uk|National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]] in 1977 for his "wholesome family entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Ben (9 November 2012).

In April 2000, he was the subject of an in-depth documentary by [[Louis Theroux]], in the ''[[When Louis Met...]]'' series, in which Theroux accompanied British celebrities going about their daily business and interviewed them about their lives and experiences. In the documentary, Savile confided "that he used to beat people up and lock them in a basement during his career as a nightclub manager".&lt;ref name=inbedwithjimmy /&gt; When Theroux challenged Savile about rumours of paedophilia over a decade ago, Savile said: “We live in a very funny world.

During his lifetime and at the time of his death, Savile was regarded as "an eccentric adornment to British public life&amp;nbsp;... an ubiquitous and distinctive face on television",&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt; who "relished being in the public eye" and was "a shrewd promoter of his own image".&lt;ref name="guardian obit"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/29/sir-jimmy-savile?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Sir Jimmy Savile obituary|date=29 October 2011 |work=The Guardian |location= London|access-date= 4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was famous for his "bizarre yodel",&lt;ref name="telegraph obit"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8857428/Sir-Jimmy-Savile.html|title= Obituary: Sir Jimmy Savile |date=29 October 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |access-date=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Bernadette |last=Strachan |title= Little White Lies |chapter= 21 |publisher= Hodder |year=2008 |isbn= 978-0-340-89805-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and catchphrases which included "How's about that, then?", "Now then, now then", "Goodness gracious", "As it 'appens" and "Guys and gals".&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt; Savile was frequently [[parody|spoofed]] for his distinctive appearance, which usually featured a [[tracksuit]] or shell suit and gold jewellery. A range of licensed [[fancy dress]] costumes was released with his consent in 2009. Savile was often pictured holding a [[cigar]]. He claimed to have started smoking cigars at the age of seven, saying "My dad gave me a drag on one at Christmas, thinking it would put me off them forever, but it had the opposite effect."&lt;ref name="guardian obit" /&gt;

A lifelong bachelor,&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt; Savile lived with his mother (whom he referred to as "The Duchess") and kept her bedroom and wardrobe exactly as it was when she died. Every year he had her clothes dry cleaned. Savile's personal relationships were rarely the subject of media report or comment in his lifetime. In his autobiography he claimed he had had many sexual relations with women, and that "there have been trains and, with apologies to the hit parade, boats and planes (I am a member of the 40,000ft club) and bushes and fields, corridors, doorways, floors, chairs, slag heaps, desks and probably everything except the celebrated chandelier and ironing board."&lt;ref&gt;''As It Happens'', pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of sexual abuse==
{{Main|Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal}}

===During his lifetime===
During Savile's lifetime, sporadic allegations of child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21756150 |title=The missed chances to get Jimmy Savile |work=BBC News |date=12 March 2013 |access-date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed the key to his success on ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'' had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer, claiming that he did not want anybody to think he was downloading [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name="Tel o" /&gt; His autobiography ''As it Happens'' (1974, reprinted as ''Love is an Uphill Thing'', 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Neil |last1=Tweedie |first2=Tom |last2=Rowley |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9636035/Jimmy-Savile-a-strange-and-sordid-life-unravels-after-death.html |title=Jimmy Savile: a strange and sordid life unravels after death |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 October 2012|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Public Image Ltd]] vocalist [[John Lydon]] alluded to sordid conduct committed by Savile, as well as suppression of widely held knowledge about such activity, in an October 1978 interview recorded for [[BBC Radio 1]]. Lydon stated: "I'd like to kill Jimmy Savile; I think he's a hypocrite. I bet he's into all kinds of seediness that we all know about, but are not allowed to talk about. I know some rumours." He added: "I bet none of this will be allowed out."&lt;ref&gt;Interview With John Lydon (BBC Radio 1, ''Rock On'', 28 October 1978). ''[[Public Image: First Issue]]'' (2013 remaster). [[Light in the Attic Records]]. Disc 2, track 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As predicted, the comment was edited out by the BBC prior to broadcasting, but the complete interview was included as a bonus track on a re-release of Public Image Ltd's 1978 debut album ''[[Public Image: First Issue]]'' in 2013, after Savile's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/reissue-cds-weekly-public-image-ltd-tom-robinson-band-michael-chapman-bobby-whitlock |title=Reissue CDs Weekly: Public Image Ltd, Tom Robinson Band, Michael Chapman, Bobby Whitlock |last=Tyler |first=Kieron |date=7 July 2013 |work=[[The Arts Desk]] |access-date=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: "By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children... I'm disgusted at the media pretending they weren't aware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/what-s-on/music/audio-john-lydon-outspoken-at-sheffield-s-off-the-shelf-1-6899790 |title=John Lydon outspoken at Sheffield's Off The Shelf |date=16 October 2014 |work=Sheffield Telegraph |access-date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former professional wrestler [[Adrian Street]] described in a November 2013 interview how "Savile used to go on and on about the young girls who’d wait in line for him outside his dressing room&amp;nbsp;... He'd pick the ones he wanted and say to the rest, 'Unlucky, come back again tomorrow night'." Savile, who cultivated a "tough guy" image promoted by his entourage, was attacked with [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] strikes during a 1971 bout with Street, who commented that had he "known then the full extent of what I know about [Savile] now, I’d have given him an even bigger hiding – were that physically possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Nathan|title='I beat Jimmy Savile black and blue'|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/i-beat-jimmy-savile-black-6265408|access-date=27 December 2014|work=[[WalesOnline]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1990 interview for ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', [[Lynn Barber]] asked Savile about rumours that he liked "little girls". Savile's reply was that, as he worked in the pop music business, "...the young girls in question don't gather round me because of me – it's because I know the people they love, the stars... I am of no interest to them."&lt;ref name=lynnbarberinterview&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/lynn-barber-i-was-nervous-when-i-told-jimmy-savile-people-say-you-like-little-girls-8193169.html|title= Lynn Barber: I was nervous when I told Jimmy Savile, 'People say you like little girls' |first= Lynn |last= Barber |work= The [[Independent on Sunday]] |date=2 October 2012 |access-date=5 November 2012 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, in a documentary by [[Louis Theroux]], ''When Louis Met...

In 2007, Savile was interviewed [[Right to silence in England and Wales|under caution]] by police investigating an allegation of indecent assault in the 1970s at the now-closed Duncroft Approved School for Girls near [[Staines]], [[Surrey]], where he was a regular visitor. The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action and no charges were brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9578870/Jimmy-Savile-interviewed-under-caution-over-indecent-assault-allegation.html |title= Jimmy Savile interviewed under caution over indecent assault allegation |date=1 October 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=1 October 2012 |last1=Marsden |first1=Sam |last2= Alleyne |first2=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Savile started legal proceedings against ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which had linked him in several articles to [[Child sexual abuse|child abuse]] at the [[Jersey]] children's home [[Jersey child abuse investigation 2008|Haut de la Garenne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thelawyer.com/jimmy-savile-turns-to-fox-hayes-for-action-against-the-sun/131780.article |title= Jimmy Savile turns to Fox Hayes for action against The Sun |work= The Lawyer |location= London |last= Goswami |first=Nina |date=17 March 2008 |access-date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted he had done so following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children.&lt;ref name="as a teenager"&gt;{{cite news |title= Sir Jimmy Savile: He raped me as a teenager claims woman |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9583373/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-He-raped-me-as-a-teenager-claims-woman.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=3 October 2012 |access-date=3 October 2012 |last= Alleyne |first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey Police]] said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-19802630 |title= Jimmy Savile named in Jersey children's home abuse inquiry |work= BBC News |date=2 October 2012 |access-date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in a taped interview with his biographer, Savile defended pop star [[Gary Glitter]], [[Gary Glitter#Child pornography arrest and conviction|convicted]] in 1999 of possession of child pornography, whom he described as a celebrity being vilified for watching "dodgy films": "It were for his own gratification. Whether it was right or wrong is up to him as a person... they [viewers] didn't do anything wrong but they are then demonised." The interview was not published at the time, and the recording was not released until after Savile's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Alleyne |first= Richard |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9578230/Jimmy-Savile-claimed-paedophile-Gary-Glitter-did-nothing-wrong.html |title=Jimmy Savile claimed paedophile Gary Glitter 'did nothing wrong' |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=1 October 2012 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Sir Roger Jones, a former [[BBC governor]] for Wales and chairman of BBC charity ''[[Children in Need]]'', disclosed that more than a decade before Savile's death he had banned Savile from involvement in the charity, because he felt his behaviour was "strange" and "suspicious", and had heard unsubstantiated rumours about his activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Jimmy Savile was banned from Children in Need, says Sir Roger Jones |work=Wales Online |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/10/29/jimmy-savile-was-banned-from-children-in-need-says-sir-roger-jones-91466-32124571/| access-date=29 October 2012| date= 29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] press secretary [[Dickie Arbiter]] said Savile's behaviour had raised "concern and suspicion" when Savile acted as an informal [[marriage counsellor]] between [[Prince Charles]] and [[Princess Diana]] in the late 1980s, although no reports had been made.&lt;ref name=guardian291012 /&gt;

===After his death===
Immediately after Savile's death, the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme began an investigation into reports that he was a sexual abuser. [[Meirion Jones]] and [[Liz MacKean]] interviewed one victim on camera and others agreed to have their stories told. The interviewees alleged abuse at Duncroft approved school for girls in Staines, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and the BBC. The item was scheduled for broadcast in ''Newsnight'' on 7 December 2011, but was never shown; the BBC broadcast tributes to Savile at Christmas 2011. ''Newsnight'' also discovered that Surrey Police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title= Jimmy Savile scandal: Newsnight emails timeline|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/jimmy-savile-bbc|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, a review led by [[Nick Pollard]] of the BBC's handling of the issue described the decision not to broadcast the ''Newsnight'' investigation as "flawed". The review said that Jones and MacKean had found "cogent evidence" that Savile was an abuser. [[George Entwistle]] – at that time the Director of BBC Vision – who had been told about the plan to broadcast the ''Newsnight'' item, was described by the review as "unnecessarily cautious, and an opportunity was lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title=Newsnight's Jimmy Savile story: key points from the Pollard report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/pollard-report-newsnight-jimmy-savile|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20778261|title= BBC criticised for Newsnight axed Jimmy Savile report|date=19 December 2012 |work= BBC News |access-date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no public mention of the ''Newsnight'' investigation into Savile at the time but in early 2012, several newspapers reported that the BBC had investigated but not broadcast (its report of) allegations of sexual abuse immediately after his death. ''[[The Oldie]]'' alleged there had been a cover-up by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9073142/BBC-buried-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-to-save-its-reputation.html |title= BBC 'buried Savile sex abuse claims to save its reputation' |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |author= Singh, Anita |location= London |date=10 February 2012 |access-date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2012, almost a year after his death, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] said it would broadcast a documentary, ''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure]]: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile''.&lt;ref name="ITV notification" /&gt; The documentary, presented by [[Mark Williams-Thomas]], who had been a consultant on the original ''Newsnight'' investigation, revealed claims by up to 10 women, including one aged under 14 at the time, that they had been sexually molested or raped by Savile during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9576863/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-abused-us-at-the-BBC-claim-women.html |title= 'Sir Jimmy Savile abused us at the BBC', claim women |date= 30 September 2012 |newspaper= The Sunday Telegraph |location= London |access-date=30 September 2012 |author= Adams, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement attracted national attention, and more reports and claims of abuse against him accumulated. The documentary was broadcast on 3 October. The next day, the [[Metropolitan Police]] said the [[Child Abuse Investigation Command]] would assess the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19837906 |title= Met Police to assess Jimmy Savile claims |date=4 October 2012 |work= BBC News |access-date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 19 October 2012, police were pursuing 400 lines of inquiry based on testimony from 200 witnesses via 14 police forces across the UK. They described the alleged abuse as "on an unprecedented scale", and the number of potential victims as "staggering".&lt;ref name="telegraph 191012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9620149/Jimmy-Savile-police-launch-criminal-investigation-after-victims-claim-some-abusers-are-still-alive.html |author= Rayner, Gordon |title= Jimmy Savile: police launch criminal investigation after victims claim some abusers are still alive |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=19 October 2012 |access-date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations, codenamed [[Operation Yewtree]], were opened to identify criminal conduct related to Savile's activities by the Metropolitan Police, and to review the 2009 decision by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] to drop a prosecution as "unlikely to succeed."&lt;ref name="police and CPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hilton" /&gt; By 25 October, police reported the number of possible victims was approaching 300.&lt;ref name=bbc251012 /&gt;

On 12 November 2012, the Metropolitan Police announced the scale of sexual allegations reported against Savile was "unprecedented" in Britain: a total of 450 alleged victims had contacted the police in the ten weeks since the investigation was launched. Officers recorded 199 crimes in 17 police force areas in which Savile was a suspect, among them 31 allegations of rape in seven force areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9740435/Jimmy-Saviles-victims-accuse-him-of-200-crimes-including-31-rapes.html |title= Jimmy Savile's victims accuse him of 200 crimes, including 31 rapes |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=12 December 2012 |author= Marsden, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the report showed 82% of those who came forward to report abuse were female and 80% were children or young people at the time of the incidents.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20697738 |title= Jimmy Savile abuse: Number of alleged victims reaches 450 |work= BBC News |date=12 December 2012 |access-date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]] staff members claimed that Savile had told them that he engaged in [[necrophilia]]c acts with corpses in their mortuary in Leeds; Savile was friends with the chief mortician, who gave him near-unrestricted access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/savile-bodies-sex-acts-corpses-glass-eyes-mortuary|title= Savile told hospital staff he performed sex acts on corpses in Leeds mortuary |date=26 June 2014 |author= Halliday, Josh |work= The Guardian |access-date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developing scandal led to inquiries into practices at the BBC and the [[National Health Service]]. It was alleged that rumours of Savile's activities had circulated at the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, but no action had been taken. The [[Director-General of the BBC]], [[George Entwistle]], apologised for what had happened, and on 16 October 2012 appointed former High Court judge [[Janet Smith (judge)|Dame Janet Smith]] to review the culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there;&lt;ref name="DT20121016"&gt;{{cite news |first= Rowena |last= Mason |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9613014/BBCs-Jimmy-Savile-probe-to-be-led-by-Harold-Shipman-inquiry-judge.html |title= BBC's Jimmy Savile probe to be led by Harold Shipman inquiry judge |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=16 October 2012 |access-date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nick Pollard]], a former [[Sky News]] executive, was appointed to look at why the ''Newsnight'' investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before transmission in December 2011.&lt;ref name="DT20121016" /&gt;

On 22 October 2012, the BBC programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' broadcast an investigation into ''Newsnight'' and found evidence suggesting "senior manager" pressure;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1= Christopher |last1= Hope |first2= Gordon |last2= Rayner |title= Jimmy Savile: BBC scrapped investigation after Newsnight came 'under pressure' from senior managers |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9624583/Jimmy-Savile-BBC-scrapped-investigation-after-Newsnight-came-under-pressure-from-senior-managers.html |access-date=28 October 2012 |newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph |location= London |date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the same day ''Newsnight'' editor [[Peter Rippon]] "stepped down" with immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Rob |last= Williams |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/newsnight-editor-peter-rippon-steps-aside-over-jimmy-savile-claims-8220491.html|title= Newsnight editor Peter Rippon 'steps aside' over Jimmy Savile claims |newspaper=The Independent |location= London |date=22 October 2012 |access-date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-20024904 |work=BBC News |title=BBC Newsnight editor steps aside over Jimmy Savile claims |date=22 October 2012 |access-date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] appointed former [[barrister]] [[Kate Lampard]] to chair and oversee its investigations into Savile's activities at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]], [[Leeds General Infirmary]], Broadmoor Hospital and other hospitals and facilities in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19980979|title= Jimmy Savile scandal: Kate Lampard to lead NHS investigation |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2012 |access-date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Exposure Update: The Jimmy Savile Investigation'' was shown on ITV on 21 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Midgley, Neil |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9694258/The-Jimmy-Savile-Investigation-Exposure-Update-ITV1-review.html |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location= London |title= The Jimmy Savile Investigation: Exposure Update, ITV1, review |date=22 November 2012 |access-date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary]] reported that 214 of the complaints that had been made against Savile after his death would have been criminal offences if they had been reported at the time. Sixteen victims reported being raped by Savile when they were under 16 (the [[age of consent|age of heterosexual consent]] in England) and four of those had been under the age of 10. Thirteen others reported serious sexual assaults by Savile, including four who had been under 10 years old. Another ten victims reported being raped by Savile after the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/review-into-allegations-and-intelligence-material-concerning-jimmy-savile.pdf |title="Mistakes were made."

Savile's [[Estate (law)|estate]], believed to be worth about £4 million, was frozen by its executors, the [[NatWest]] bank, in view of the possibility that those alleging that they had been assaulted by Savile could make claims for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Jimmy Savile estate frozen after abuse claims |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20162980 |access-date=1 November 2012 |work=BBC News |date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After "a range of expenses" were charged to the estate, a remainder of about £3.3 million was available to compensate victims, with those victims not having a claim against another entity (such as the [[BBC]] or the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]) given first priority, and all victims limited to a maximum claim of £60,000 against all entities combined, a compensation scheme approved by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All of Jimmy Savile's estate to be used to settle abuse claims|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27236420|access-date=26 February 2015|work= BBC News|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Savile: Victims' compensation scheme approved|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30494996|access-date=26 February 2015|work= BBC News|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An authorised biography, ''How's About That Then?'', by Alison Bellamy, was published in June 2012. After the claims made against him were published, the author said that, in the light of the allegations, she felt "let down and betrayed" by Savile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Betrayed by my good friend Jimmy Savile |url= http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/betrayed-by-my-good-friend-jimmy-savile-1-5072056 |access-date=1 May 2013 |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |location =Leeds |date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2014, UK [[Secretary of State for Health]] [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] delivered a public apology in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to the patients of the National Health Service abused by Savile. He confirmed that complaints had been raised before 2012 but were ignored by the bureaucratic system:{{quote|Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals, many of them patients and young people, who expected and had a right to expect to be safe. His actions span five decades – from the 1960s to 2010. ... As a nation at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes. Today's reports show that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/26/world/europe/uk-jimmy-savile-abuse-report/ | title=Rapes, abuse, possible necrophilia: DJ Jimmy Savile's hospital horrors detailed | work=CNN |date=26 June 2014 |access-date=26 June 2014 |author=Smith-Spark, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]], in a 2014 piece for ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote that Savile had the [[dark triad]] of personality characteristics: [[psychopathy]], [[Machiavellianism]] and [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/26/inside-the-mind-of-jimmy-savile |title= Inside the mind of Jimmy Savile |work= The Guardian |location= London |author=James, Oliver |date=26 June 2014 |access-date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Harrison, a long-serving [[Psychiatric and mental health nursing|psychiatric nurse]] at [[Broadmoor Hospital]], said in 2012 that Savile had long been regarded by staff as "a man with a severe [[personality disorder]] and a liking for children". Another nurse, Bob Allen, agreed with assessments of Savile as a psychopath, and stated: "A lot of the staff said he should be behind bars." Allen also said that he had once reported Savile to his supervisor for apparent improper conduct with a juvenile, but no action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9647718/Broadmoor-staff-said-Jimmy-Savile-was-a-psychopath-with-a-liking-for-children.html |title=Broadmoor staff said Jimmy Savile was a 'psychopath' with a 'liking for children' |date=1 November 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |access-date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
* In the [[1972 New Year Honours]], Savile was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45554 |date=31 December 1971 |page=12 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled to append "OBE" to his name.
* In the [[1990 Birthday Honours|1990 Queen's Birthday Honours]] he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] "for charitable services",&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52173 |date=15 June 1990 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled to use the honorific prefix "Sir". Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] had made four attempts to have him knighted before succeeding in her final year in office.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatcher-made-repeated-attempts-to-get-jimmy-savile-knighted--despite-pleas-from-concerned-aides-8713407.html |title=Margaret Thatcher made repeated attempts to get Jimmy Savile knighted – despite pleas from concerned aides |date=17 July 2013 |work=The Independent |location= London |access-date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the allegations of sexual abuse, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] suggested in October 2012 that it would be possible for Savile's honours to be rescinded by the [[Honours Forfeiture Committee]]. A [[Cabinet Office]] spokesman said that there was no procedure to posthumously revoke an OBE or knighthood, as these honours automatically expire when a person dies, but that the committee might consider introducing a process to do so in the light of Savile's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19884359 |title=Could Jimmy Savile lose knighthood over abuse claims? |date=9 October 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Savile was honoured with a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Holy See|Papal knighthood]] by being made a [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great]] (KCSG) by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.sky.com/home/showbiz-news/article/16106367 |title=Fans flock to cathedral service for Sir Jimmy Savile |last=Tubb |first=Gerard |date=9 November 2011 |work=[[Sky News]] |access-date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the scandal broke, the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] asked the [[Holy See]] to consider stripping Savile of the honour. In October 2012, Father [[Federico Lombardi]] told BBC News:&lt;ref name="lombardi"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20108980 |title=Jimmy Savile: Catholic Church bid to remove papal knighthood |date=26 October 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=26 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[The Holy See] firmly condemns the horrible crimes of sexual abuse of minors, [and the honour] in the light of recent information should certainly not have been bestowed ... As there does not exist any permanent official list of persons who have received papal honours in the past, it is not possible to strike anyone off a list that does not exist. The names of recipients of papal honours do not appear in the Pontifical Year Book and the honour expires with the death of the individual.}}
* He was an honorary fellow of the [[Royal College of Radiologists]] (FRCR).&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/30/jimmy-savile-top-of-pops-dead |title=Jimmy Savile, eccentric king of children's TV, dies aged 84 |date=30 October 2011 |work=The Observer |access-date=3 November 2011 |location=London |first=Tracy |last=McVeigh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many honours are considered to cease on the death of the holder; some of Savile's honours were considered no longer applicable, and did not need to be rescinded.&lt;ref name="knight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lombardi" /&gt; In other cases honours were withdrawn, or removed from lists:

* In the 1970s he was awarded an honorary [[green beret]] by the [[Royal Marines]] for completing the Royal Marine Commando speed march, {{convert|30|mi|km}} across [[Dartmoor]] carrying {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2009/07/13/runners-for-charlotte-take-on-30-mile-marine-challenge |title=Runners for Charlotte take on 30-mile Marine challenge |newspaper=[[The Guernsey Press]] |date=13 July 2009 |access-date=11 June 2010 |location=St Peter Port}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the allegations of child abuse, his beret award was not revoked, as that honour expires upon death of the Marine. However, the Royal Marines ordered that any certification granted to Savile or mention of Savile's name in their records be expunged immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal Marines 'erase' the memory of Jimmy Savile |url= http://www.exmouthjournal.co.uk/news/royal_marines_erase_the_memory_of_jimmy_savile_1_1662912 |access-date=27 October 2012 |date=19 October 2012 |work=[[Exmouth Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent''''' is&lt;!--NOT "was" due to literary present tense: i.e. the show did not stop being a show just because it no longer airs--&gt; an American [[police procedural]] television drama series set in [[New York City]], where it was also primarily produced. Created and [[Executive producer#Motion pictures and television|produced]] by [[Dick Wolf]] and [[René Balcer]], the series premiered on September 30, 2001, as the third series in Wolf's successful [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]]. ''Criminal Intent'' focuses on the investigations of the [[Major Case Squad]] in a fictionalized version of the [[New York City Police Department]] set in New York City's [[One Police Plaza]]. In the style of the original ''Law &amp; Order'', episodes are often "ripped from the headlines" or loosely based on a real crime that received media attention.

The series aired on [[NBC]] for the first six seasons but was moved to the [[NBCUniversal]]-owned [[USA Network]] starting with the seventh season to share costs and due to declining ratings. During its NBC run, each episode aired on USA the week after its original NBC airing. The 10th and final season premiered on Sunday, May 1, 2011, at 9 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]&lt;ref name="cipremieredate"&gt;{{Cite news |title=USA Network Launches New Seasons of "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" and "In Plain Sight" Premiering Sunday, May 1 |work = The Futon Critic |date=February 2, 2011 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/02/03/usa-network-launches-new-seasons-of-law-and-order-criminal-intent-and-in-plain-sight-premiering-sunday-may-1-784201/20110203usa01/ |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with original cast members [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]&lt;ref name="cireturns"&gt;{{Cite news |title='Law &amp; Order: CI' returns to USA |work = Variety |date=September 22, 2010 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118024461.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kathryn Erbe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/10/08/law-order-criminal-intent-kathryn-erbe-returns/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009224026/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/10/08/law-order-criminal-intent-kathryn-erbe-returns/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 9, 2010 |title=Ausiellofiles.ew.com |publisher=Ausiellofiles.ew.com |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring as Detectives Robert Goren and Alexandra Eames, respectively, and featuring [[Jay O.

==Premise==
{{quote box |width=31% |align=left|border=2px|fontsize=99%|quote=In New York City's war on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad. These are their stories.|source={{nb10}}—Opening narration spoken by [[Steven Zirnkilton]]}}

''Criminal Intent'' follows a division of the New York City Police Department, the "Major Case Squad", a force of brilliant and skilled first-grade detectives who handle the most serious and the most complex crimes that New York has to offer. The Major Case Squad investigates high-profile cases (in most cases, [[murder]], [[kidnapping]]s or major robberies) such as those involving [[Very Important Person (person)|VIPs]], local government officials and employees, the financial industry, and the art world.

The series is notable for its heavy focus on the motives and actions of the criminals, supplemented with scenes of the suspects in their own lives, parallel to the investigation. Each episode features a [[cold open]] of the victim and suspects in the days leading up to the crime; these scenes are out of context to maintain suspense as to the perpetrator's identity and motive until the ensuing investigation reveals their involvement. However, some episodes [[Inverted detective story|reveal the killer]] at the start but leave out other key details for the detectives to uncover. Unlike other ''Law &amp; Order'' series, most ''Criminal Intent'' episodes end in the detectives eliciting confessions rather than continuing to the trial phase.

Seasons 1–4 and 10 focus on Detectives [[Robert Goren|Robert "Bobby" Goren]] and [[Alexandra Eames]] as the primary detectives in every episode. In seasons 5–8, ''Criminal Intent'' episodes then typically alternated between the team of Goren and Eames and a team composed of veteran Detective [[Mike Logan (Law &amp; Order)|Michael "Mike" Logan]] and his partners: [[Carolyn Barek]], [[Megan Wheeler]], and [[Nola Falacci]]. After season 7, Mike Logan retired from the [[NYPD]] and was replaced with Detective [[Zack Nichols]] until season 10, when Goren and Eames returned.

The UK-aired version of ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' features the song "There's Only Me" by [[Rob Dougan]] in the opening credits (seasons 1–5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyc2ImJ8RtI |title=Law &amp; Order Criminal Intent Theme Season Five UK Version |publisher=YouTube |date=August 7, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Rob Dougan track, "I'm Not Driving Anymore", is used as the theme for ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|2MhqacIiP7U}} {{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|BtRFKtu58h8}} {{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9EEKPCNepI |title=Law &amp; Order SVU Theme UK five edition |publisher=YouTube |date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From season 6 the UK-aired version theme is "Urban Warfare" by Paul Dinletir.

==History==
''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' was created in 2001 by [[René Balcer]] and [[Dick Wolf]].  Balcer served as the show's executive producer, [[showrunner]], and head writer for its first five seasons. The show dominated its original time slot on Sundays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. for its first three seasons (routinely beating its competition, ABC's ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' and HBO's ''[[The Sopranos]]'', in households and in the 18–49 demographic), and was often the highest-rated show of the night, with an average audience of 15.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers. The show aired Sundays on NBC, with each week's episode being repeated on [[USA Network]] the following Saturday.

Beginning in Season 4, it faced stiff new competition from ABC's night-time soap opera ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', a show that soon became the No. 1 drama on television. Although ratings for ''Criminal Intent'' further eroded in season 5 amid stiff competition, the series maintained respectable ratings through the season, enough to get it renewed for a sixth season on NBC.

Balcer left the show at the end of Season 5, and the show was handed off to [[Warren Leight]], a longtime ''Criminal Intent'' staffer. Under Leight's leadership, the show acquired a new, more [[melodramatic]] tone. The mystery aspect of the show was simplified in favor of more personal stories involving the detectives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} For example, Goren endured his mother's long battle with cancer, culminating with her death in Goren's last episode in season six. The show's look and editing style also changed in an effort to attract viewers of the newer [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'' franchise]].

When NBC had acquired the rights to ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' for the 2006–2007 season, ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' was moved to a new time slot on Tuesdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., to serve as a lead-in to fellow ''Law &amp; Order'' spinoff, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.  For its first six airings, it faced [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Unit]]'' and baseball on Fox.  In late October, Fox's hit series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' moved opposite ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent''. It was hoped that the show could maintain second position, beating the then-marginal ''[[The Unit]]'' but that did not occur.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The show's ratings suffered a steep drop and regularly finished fourth in its time slot. By the end of Season 6, ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' saw its lowest ratings ever.

In May 2007, NBC faced a choice of renewing either ''Criminal Intent'' or the original ''Law &amp; Order'', which had seen a ratings increase in the last few episodes of its 17th season. Ultimately, because of ''Criminal Intent's'' weak ratings, NBC picked up ''Law &amp; Order''. ''Criminal Intent''{{-'}}s new episodes were moved to the NBCUniversal-owned [[USA Network]], where it could be expected to attract a much larger audience than the cable channel's average.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN2254792220080523| title=USA renews Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent|accessdate=May 26, 2008 |publisher=Reuters |date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining episodes from the seventh season began running on June 8, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5I-OKayl5dO621eaf94h11XR7eQD90RC7080|title=The Associated Press: 'Law &amp; Order:CI' is returning for an eighth season|accessdate=May 26, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production on the show was halted temporarily in December 2007 due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]].

For its move to the USA Network, the version of the ''Law &amp; Order'' theme used for the show's opening credits was replaced by the version originally used on the short-lived ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]''.

On May 22, 2008, USA Network renewed ''Criminal Intent'' for an eighth season. Season 7 was the top-rated television series on [[basic cable]], having more than quadrupled the audience for the 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. Thursday slot on [[USA Network]] when compared to the ratings from the previous year. Nielsen ratings for the week of July 13, 2008 showed that ''Criminal Intent'' was ranked sixth overall on top 20 cable ratings, with a viewer base of 4.899&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/07/15/nielsen-ratings-cable-tv-top-20-usa-tops-with-wwe-raw-burn-notice/4435 |title=Nielsen Ratings Cable TV Top 20: USA Tops with WWE RAW, Burn Notice |publisher=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network ordered 16 episodes, which were originally to begin broadcasting in November 2008, but the network moved the premiere back, first to February 5, 2009, then with an expected date of spring–summer 2009, and finally announcing the start date as April 19. The only change in cast members from the seventh season was&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; Chris Noth's departure and replacement by Jeff Goldblum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-jeffgodlblumlandocriminalintent,0,2869315.story |title=Jeff Goldblum Has 'Criminal Intent,' Chris Noth leaving 'Law &amp; Order' series |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |accessdate=June 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627223603/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-jeffgodlblumlandocriminalintent%2C0%2C2869315.story |archivedate=June 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of Season 7, Leight, who left to focus on ''[[In Treatment (U.S. TV series)|In Treatment]]'', was replaced by new executive producers [[Walon Green]] and [[Robert Stuart Nathan|Robert Nathan]]. In December 2008, Nathan left the show after completing two Goldblum episodes. ''Law &amp; Order'' co-executive producer and writer Ed Zuckerman then picked up Nathan's assignment while continuing his duties for the original ''Law &amp; Order''{{-'}}s 19th season. Michael Chernuchin co-executive produced Green's episodes, and Tim Lea co-executive produced Zuckerman's episodes. Other executive producers on the series were Norberto Barba, Peter Jankowski, Diana Son, [[Julie Martin (writer)|Julie Martin]], and Arthur W. Forney. Charlie Rubin was the supervising producer, and Balcer, [[Eric Overmyer]], and Siobhan Byrne O'Connor were consulting producers. In April 2009, [[NBC]] began airing ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' Season 8 encores a few days after they premiered on USA.

D'Onofrio, Erbe, and Bogosian left the series in the Season 9 premiere, which aired in two parts on March 30 and April 6, 2010. [[Walon Green]], [[Peter Jankowski]], [[John David Coles]], and [[Dick Wolf]] were the executive producers for the [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''Criminal Intent''.

Media outlets reported in August 2010 that actor [[Jeff Goldblum]] ([[Zack Nichols|Detective Zachary Nichols]]) had decided to leave the cast of ''Law &amp; Order: CI'', citing concerns about the show's future.&lt;ref name="leavingci"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jeff Goldblum exits 'Law &amp; Order'|work=Variety|date=August 3, 2010|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118022539.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|accessdate=August 4, 2010|first=Michael|last=Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leavingci2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jeff Goldblum to quit Criminal Intent |work=The Spy Report |date=August 4, 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/08/04/us-jeff-goldblum-to-quit-criminal-intent/ |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830183923/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/08/04/us-jeff-goldblum-to-quit-criminal-intent/ |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The option to return on all the actors formally expired on July 31, 2010 after being extended by a month on June 30, 2010 when they were originally up. A final decision by the USA Network over whether the series would be renewed for another season had not been announced at that time.&lt;ref name="leavingci" /&gt;

On September 22, 2010, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced that ''Criminal Intent'' had been renewed, and that Vincent D'Onofrio would be returning to the series as Detective Robert Goren for its final season.&lt;ref name="cireturns" /&gt;  Kathryn Erbe subsequently signed on to reprise the role of Detective Eames for the eight-episode final season of ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/10/08/kathryn-erbe-returns-for-final-season-of-law-order-criminal-intent/67250 |title=TVbythenumbers.com |publisher=TVbythenumbers.com |date=October 8, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Brancato]] was announced as the executive producer/showrunner for the [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (season 10)|final eight-episode season]] of ''Law &amp; Order: CI''.

Prior to the season premiere, creator Dick Wolf was hoping the series would be renewed for an 11th season, versus ending with season 10. "Being the unbridled optimist that I am, I still have hope that this is a 'victory lap' and not a 'swan song,'" Wolf said during a conference call. "Based on the work so far, I think the audience is going to be very happy, relieved, and welcoming ... and hopefully enough fans will come out so the powers-that-be reconsider their decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=Dick Wolf Hopes for Criminal Intent Reprieve, Says D'Onofrio &amp; Erbe Have Never Been Better|url=http://tvline.com/2011/04/22/dick-wolf-law-order-criminal-intent-reprieve/|newspaper=TV Line|date=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New show runner/EP Chris Brancato suggested that the show could be picked up for an 11th season if the intended final episodes garnered sufficient ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overland|first=Jody|title=Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent To Continue For An 11th Season?|url=http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2011/05/05/law-order-criminal-intent-to-continue-for-an-11th-season/|accessdate=May 7, 2011|date=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth season ended on June 26, 2011, and USA Network announced the following month that they were choosing not to air more episodes of the series due to costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Mitovich |title=No Reprieve for Law &amp; Order: CI: 'It Was a Good Series Finale,' Says USA Network Boss |date=July 15, 2011 |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/07/law-order-criminal-intent-series-finale-confirmed/}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if ''LOCI'' would be taken back by NBC, Wolf tweeted "USA Network decided not to pick up #LOCI for another season.

In August 2012, it was announced that Kathryn Erbe would be playing her character [[Alexandra Eames]] again in ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'s'' [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 14)|fourteenth season]]. Detective Eames transferred out of Major Case, and is now working for a joint City/Federal Homeland Security Task Force, and crosses paths with the SVU squad when their investigation of a sex trafficking ring uncovers a connection to terrorists. Erbe will likely guest star in more ''SVU'' episodes later in the fourteenth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|title=Law &amp; Order Scoop: Kathryn Erbe Bringing Criminal Intent's Eames to SVU This Fall!|url=http://tvline.com/2012/08/14/kathryn-erbe-law-order-svu/|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=TVLine|date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren Leight, who now is show runner/executive producer on ''Law &amp; Order: SVU'', tweeted that Erbe's first episode would be the fourth of the season, "[[Acceptable Loss (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Acceptable Loss]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Robyn|title=Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent's Kathryn Erbe to Reprise Role on SVU|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathryn-Erbe-SVU-1051957.aspx|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=TV Guide|date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Warren Leight further tweeted on ''LOCI's'' ending, "... simply put, USA didn't make enough money on LOCI to justify even the final 8 [episodes] they did. they felt they owed it to the fans. ...

It was then moved to Sunday nights at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET on June 8, 2008 (when it paired up with ''[[In Plain Sight]]'') until the 8th-season finale on August 9, 2009.

{{:List of Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent characters}}

;Seasons 1 and 2
On September 30, 2001, [[NBC]] premiered the show, starring [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Detective [[Robert Goren]], a junior detective in the Major Case Squad who has a degree in [[psychology]] and has a knack for solving difficult crimes, and [[Kathryn Erbe]] as his partner, Detective [[Alexandra Eames]], a veteran detective from an [[NYPD]] family who initially resists her partner's eccentric style, but grows to understand him as the series progresses. Before joining the NYPD Goren was a Special Agent with the United States Army's Criminal Investigations Division. [[Jamey Sheridan]] plays Captain [[James Deakins]]; although Deakins's first priority is the success of criminal investigations, he is often forced to rein in and protect his more maverick detectives, especially Goren and later Logan, to manage the bad publicity they occasionally attract. While this creates some friction between Deakins and his detectives, for the most part they respect his professional judgment and authority. [[Courtney B. Vance]]'s Assistant District Attorney [[Ron Carver]] is frequently in conflict with all the detectives because they tend to rely on hunches and instinct, when he wants more hard evidence. Despite this conflict, however, he has a strong working relationship with both teams.

;Season 3
In the third season, from episodes 5–11, Eames is temporarily replaced by Detective [[G. Lynn Bishop]] portrayed by [[Samantha Buck]]. Eames is volunteering to serve as a [[Surrogate pregnancy|surrogate]] mother for her sister's baby; in reality, Erbe was pregnant with her second child.

;Seasons 4 and 5
In the fifth season, [[Chris Noth]] joined the cast, reprising his role as Detective [[Mike Logan (Law &amp; Order)|Mike Logan]] from the original ''Law &amp; Order''. Noth alternates the starring role every other episode with D'Onofrio, and is partnered with [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Detective [[Carolyn Barek]]. Sciorra left after one season.

Deakins retires from the Major Case Squad at the end of Season 5 rather than battle a conspiracy to frame him instigated by former Chief of Detectives Frank Adair, whom Major Case detectives have arrested for killing a female acquaintance and her husband. Carver leaves as well, though there is no explanation as to why he departed the ADA's office.

;Seasons 6–9
Deakins was replaced by Captain [[Danny Ross]] ([[Eric Bogosian]]). Carver was initially replaced by ADA Patricia Kent ([[Theresa Randle]]), although she appears in only two episodes. The ADA role from this point on is left vacant, as the detectives aren't shown working with any ADA on a regular basis.

[[Julianne Nicholson]] replaced [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Detective [[Megan Wheeler]], who remains with the show through the end of the eighth season.

In season 7, Wheeler temporarily leaves MCS to go to Europe, where she teaches a course on American police procedure. In reality, Julianne Nicholson was pregnant with her first child and was replaced temporarily by [[Alicia Witt]], playing Detective [[Nola Falacci]].

Noth left the series at the [[Last Rites (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|end of season seven]]. He was replaced by [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Detective [[Zack Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://tv.yahoo.com/contributor/30074/news/urn:newsml:tv.tvguide.com:20080627:2c71be8e5495a907c33322931f7a6faa__ER:6;_ylt=AjZ5wqmSXxER6YVpgm6d60L6o9EF Jeff Goldblum – Yahoo! TV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renewed for a ninth season, which began in March 2010 and marked the departure of D'Onofrio, Erbe, and Bogosian. Ross is murdered in the first half of the season premiere, while Eames fires Goren in the second half and then quits the NYPD. Goldblum was the head of the series with new partner Detective [[Serena Stevens]], played by [[Saffron Burrows]]. [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] succeeded Bogosian, portraying Captain [[Zoe Callas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/11/02/law-order-ci-scoop-mary-elizabeth-mastrantonio-named-new-captain/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105185104/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/11/02/law-order-ci-scoop-mary-elizabeth-mastrantonio-named-new-captain/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 5, 2009 |title=Ausiellofiles.ew.com |publisher=Ausiellofiles.ew.com |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100226usa01| title=Breaking News - USA Network kicks off action-packed spring lineup with new seasons of Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent and in Plain Sight |publisher= Thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Season 10:
The final season featured the return of Detectives Alexandra Eames and Robert Goren, replacing outgoing Zack Nichols and Serena Stevens who made their final appearances in the season 9 finale. Eames and Goren are brought back at the request of [[Joseph Hannah]], played by [[Jay O. Sanders]], the new Major Case Captain who replaced Zoe Callas, on the condition that Goren attend mandatory psych sessions with brilliant police doctor Paula Gyson, played by [[Julia Ormond]]. The final season consisted of eight episodes, all featuring D'Onofrio, Erbe, Sanders and Ormond.

*Region 2 dates refer to United Kingdom releases only
*Due to content issues stemming from the Season 8 episode, "[[The Glory That Was ... (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|The Glory That Was ...]]", only 15 episodes from Season 8 will be on the DVD set.&lt;ref name="tvshowsondvd1"/&gt;

==Technical information==
''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' has been produced in 16:9 format since at least 2004, when it was first broadcast in [[High Definition Television|HDTV]]. Standard definition NBC stations aired the episodes cropped to 4:3 until 2006, when all ''Law &amp; Order'' series began airing episodes in 16:9 for SD. Reruns of those episodes which were cropped to 4:3 have subsequently been aired in 16:9 as well. Some broadcasters outside the USA, however, still use versions cropped to 4:3.

The show has been recorded on [[35mm film]] with the use of motion cameras for the first eight seasons, the first five seasons the series' on set lighting was very dim, with the sixth season scenes on set were brightened until season eight. At the commencement of season nine, the camera department switched to digital video acquisition. The lighting in the MCS squad room also received a significant change. The series has always relied heavily on color corrected fluorescent lighting which contributed to its drab and bluish look. At the beginning of season nine, sections of the MCS ceiling were removed and banks of incandescent lighting strips were added to steepen the warmer, sunny day look of the drab squad room. In the tenth season, the lighting in interrogation room senses were brightened to their color in the sixth and seventh seasons.

Starting with the sixth season, the editing style changed apart from the other shows in the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise (examples: zooms, colors, and thud sounds used to quickly fade to commercials, quick brighting effects and sharp sounds to show scene changes) and the tempo of the background music was amplified and at a faster pace.

===Crossovers===
During the first season of ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'', several cast members from the original series made guest appearances as their ''Law &amp; Order'' characters. [[Dianne Wiest]] appeared in the first episode of the series, "One", [[Jerry Orbach]] and [[Jesse L. Martin]] guest starred in the episode "Poison", [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] appeared in the episode "Badge", and [[J.K. Simmons]] appeared in the episode "Crazy." [[Leslie Hendrix]] also reprises her role as Medical Examiner Dr. Elizabeth Rodgers as a recurring character throughout the run of the series starting with the first-season episode "The Faithful." In 2005, Chris Noth reprised his role as Detective Mike Logan for the show's fourth season. This appearance led to Noth joining the cast in the fifth season, appearing in the starring role for half the episodes of the season. Noth remained with the show for three seasons before departing in 2008. Also appearing during the show's fifth season were [[Fred Dalton Thompson]] and [[Carolyn McCormick]].

On June 15, 2008, [[Mary McCormack]] made a guest appearance in the 2008 episode "[[Contract (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|Contract]]", as Mary Shannon, her character from ''[[In Plain Sight]]''.  At the time of the original airing, ''In Plain Sight'' followed ''Criminal Intent'' on the USA Network.

In the 14th season of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', Kathryn Erbe reprised her role as Alexandra Eames in the episodes "Acceptable Loss" and "Poisoned Motive". Also in this season Denis O'Hare guest starred as his character Father Shea from the episode [[Last Rites (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|Last Rites]] in the episode "Presumed Guilty".

''[[Jo (TV series)|Jo]]'', a 2013 series created by [[René Balcer]], featured in what would be its last episode [[Olivia d'Abo]] playing her Nicole Wallace character.

===French adaptation===
{{Main|Paris enquêtes criminelles}}
In July 2005, NBC Universal sold the format of ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' to French channel [[TF1]] Alma Productions to create a French remake of the show. The show mirrors the content of the original US stories, although it is set in Paris and is adjusted for language and culture. The show ran for 20 episodes over three seasons between May 2007 to November 2008.

===Russian adaptation===
A Russian version of ''L&amp;O: CI'' (shot in Moscow with Russian actors) premiered in March 2007, where it was shown back to back with the Russian version of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', to become one of Russia's top-rated series.  As a result, the initial order of eight episodes has been expanded to some 40 episodes. The show is entitled Закон и порядок. Преступный умысел (Translation -  Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruskino.ru/mov/9438 |title=Сериал "Закон и порядок.

'''''Le Martyre de saint Sébastien''''' is a five-act musical [[mystery play]] on the subject of [[Saint Sebastian]], with a text written in 1911 by the Italian author [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] and [[incidental music]] by the French composer [[Claude Debussy]] (L.124).

==Background==
The work was produced in collaboration between [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] (at that time living in France to escape his creditors) and [[Claude Debussy]], and designed as a vehicle for [[Ida Rubinstein]]. Debussy's contribution was a large-scale score of [[incidental music]] for orchestra and chorus, with solo vocal parts (for a [[soprano]] and two [[alto]]s).

Debussy accepted the commission in February 1911. Some of the material was orchestrated by [[André Caplet]].&lt;ref name="Mouvement"/&gt; During auditions for the female semi-chorus, the chorus director [[Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht]] suggested, on hearing [[Ninon Vallin]], that she take over the role of the celestial voice. As [[Rose Féart]] (who had been engaged) was absent from the general rehearsal, Vallin sang the role and Debussy insisted on her singing it in the production.&lt;ref name="Mouvement"&gt;Inghelbrecht D-É. ''Mouvement Contraire'' (Chapter XVII, 1911). Editions Domat, Paris, 1947, ({{p.|214-223}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere had sets and costumes designed by [[Léon Bakst]], stage direction by Armand Bour and choreography by [[Michel Fokine]]. The orchestra was conducted by André Caplet, and Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht directed the chorus.  Alongside Rubinstein as Saint Sébastien, Adeline Dudlay sang La Mère douloureuse, Vera Sargine sang La Fille malade des fièvres, Ninon Vallin was the off-stage voice, Desjardins was the emperor, and [[Henry Krauss]] was the préfet.&lt;ref name="Stoullig"&gt;Stoullig E. ''[[Les Annales du Théâtre et de la Musique]], 37eme année, 1911.'' Librairie Paul Ollendorf, Paris, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first [[Gabriel Astruc]] production was attended by scandal (the [[Archbishop of Paris]] requested Catholics not attend because the dancer playing St. Sebastian was a woman and a Jew), the work was not successful and did not enter the repertoire; thanks to Debussy's score, however, it has been recorded in abridged and adapted versions several times—notably by [[Pierre Monteux]] (in French), [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]] (in French), [[Leonard Bernstein]] (sung in French, acted in English), and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] (in French).

Though Debussy's complete score still exists and can be performed in its original form (including linking narration taken from the original play, if the story is not staged), the work is very seldom heard in this way. More often performed is a four-movement orchestral suite made up of music extracted from the score and subtitled 'Fragments Symphoniques' (''Symphonic Fragments''). In addition, there are also two short [[brass instruments|brass]] [[fanfare]]s which are sometimes presented with the symphonic fragments.

==''Mystère en cinq actes''==
Following the acts of the original play, each section is called a 'mansion'. The narrator sets the scene at the beginning of each section.
#''La Cour de Lys'' (The Court of Lilies)
#''La Chambre Magique'' (The Magic Chamber)
#''Le Concile des Faux Dieux'' (The Council of the False Gods)
#''Le Laurier Blessé'' (The Wounded Laurel)
#''Le Paradis'' (Paradise)

==''Fragments symphoniques''==
#''La Cour de Lys'' (The Court of Lilies)
#''Danse extatique et Final du 1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; Acte'' (Ecstatic Dance and Finale of the 1st Act)
#''La Passion'' (The Passion)
#''Le Bon Pasteur'' (The Good Shepherd)

==Recordings==
The work has been recorded several times, in abridged format or with the symphonic music only. The orchestral version, arranged by Caplet, is generally described as ''Fragments symphoniques'', and was published in 1912. Conductors who have recorded this version have included [[Jean Martinon]], [[Daniel Barenboim]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]].

In 1953 the first full recording appeared, by the [[Oklahoma City Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorale, with soloists [[Frances Yeend]] and [[Miriam Stewart]], sopranos, and [[Anna Kaskas]], contralto, conducted by [[Victor Alessandro]]. 

In the same year almost the complete score was recorded for Decca by [[Suzanne Danco]], Nancy Waugh, Lise de Montmollin, Union Chorale de la Tour-de-Peilz (Chorus master Robert Mermoud), and the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] under [[Ernest Ansermet]]; digital remastering at [http://www.naxos.com Naxos]. In the 1960s, [[Leonard Bernstein]] adapted the text and recorded the work with his wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], in the role of Sebastian, and the actor [[Fritz Weaver]] as narrator and assuming other speaking roles, with the [[New York Philharmonic]], along with [[Adele Addison]], Virginia Babikian, Marlena Kleinman, [[Joanna Simon (mezzo-soprano)|Joanna Simon]], and The Choral Art Society. The work was given with Bernstein's English-language translation of the D'Annunzio text, with some added narration. 

In 1991 it was recorded digitally with soloists [[Ann Murray]], [[Sylvia McNair]], [[Nathalie Stutzmann]], narrator [[Leslie Caron]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. In 2011 [[Thierry Fischer]], conducting the BBC National Chorus and Orchestra of Wales, recorded the complete score. According to the CD booklet, the latter recording uses the "definitive scholarly version" of the score by Durand (2009), edited by [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Eko Kasaba]].

[[Image:Live8 London.jpg|thumb|The main [[Live 8]] concert in Hyde Park on 2 July 2005]]
'''[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]''' in [[London]], England, has been an important venue for [[rock music]] concerts since the late 1960s. The music management company [[Blackhill Enterprises]] held the first rock concert there on 29 June 1968, attended by 15,000 people. On the bill were [[Pink Floyd]], [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. The supergroup [[Blind Faith]] (featuring [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Steve Winwood]]) played their debut gig in Hyde Park on 7 June 1969. [[The Rolling Stones]] headlined a concert (later released as  [[The Stones in the Park]]) on 5 July that year, two days after the death of founding member [[Brian Jones]], and is now remembered as one of the most famous gigs of the 1960s. The early gigs from 1968–71 were free events, while later concerts were pay-to-enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicheritageuk.org/about-us/stones-in-the-park/further-thoughts.html|title=The Hyde Park free concerts (1968–1971)|publisher=Music Heritage|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mandi Shivaratri Fair''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]:मण्डी शिवरात्री मेला) is an annual renowned international fair that is held for 7 days starting with the Hindu festival of [[Maha Shivaratri|Shivaratri]], in the [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh|Mandi]] town ({{coord|31.72|N|76.92|E|}}) of the [[States of India|Indian state]] of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. 

The Mandi Shivaratri fair is held as per [[Hindu calendar]] every year on the Krishna [[paksha]] 13th day/13th night (breaking fast/'vrata' on 14th after sunrise) of the waning moon in the month of [[Phalguna]] that corresponds to February/March as per [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name=mandi&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hpmandi.nic.in/history.htm|title= History Of Mandi|accessdate=2010-02-07|publisher=National Informatics Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival’s popularity is widespread and hence is known as an international festival. In view of the large number of gods and goddesses that are invited to the festival from its 81 temples, Mandi town has the title of 'Varanasi of the Hills'.&lt;ref name= Sharma&gt;{{Cite book|last= Sharma|first=L.R|title= Quality of life in the Himalayan region|page=72|accessdate=2010-02-07|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oThuRcNAaN4C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Mandi+Fair&amp;lr=&amp;cd=32#v=onepage&amp;q=Mandi%20Fair&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing |year=2005|isbn=81-7387-173-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shiv&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mandishivratri.com/about-mandi.html|title=The International Festival|accessdate=2010-02-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401052653/http://mandishivratri.com/about-mandi.html|archivedate=1 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2016, the festival will be celebrated from 7 March (Shivaratri day) for seven days till 14 March 2016.&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://himachaltourism.gov.in/post/Mandi.aspx|title=Mandi|accessdate=2010-02-07|publisher=Himachal Tourism, Government of Himachal Pradesh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414002705/http://himachaltourism.gov.in/post/Mandi.aspx|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dream&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.himvani.com/news/2008/04/06/the-mysticism-of-mandi%E2%80%99s-mahashivratri/1366/|title=The Mysticism of Mandi’s Mahashivratri|accessdate=2010-02-07|publisher=Himavani: A voice of Himachal Citizen initiative|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128163440/http://www.himvani.com/news/2008/04/06/the-mysticism-of-mandi%E2%80%99s-mahashivratri/1366/|archivedate=28 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandi festival or fair is particularly famous as the special fair transforms Mandi town into a venue of grand celebration when all gods and goddesses, said to be more than 200 deities of the [[Mandi district]] assemble here, starting with the day of Shivaratri. Mandi town located on the banks of the [[Beas River]], popularly known as the "cathedral of temples", is one of the oldest towns of Himachal Pradesh with about 81 temples of different gods and goddesses in its periphery. There are several legends linked to the celebration of this event. The festival is centred on the protector deity of Mandi "Mado Rai" ([[Lord Vishnu]]) and [[Lord Shiva]] of the [[Bhootnath temple]] in Mandi.&lt;ref name=mandi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shiv/&gt;&lt;ref name=heaven&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matabhimakali.com/mandi.html|title=Mandi -The Seventh Heaven|accessdate=2010-02-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410001057/http://matabhimakali.com/mandi.html|archivedate=10 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mandi town, where the festival is held, was ruled by Raja Ajbar Sen who was considered the first great ruler of [[Mandi State]] in the sixteenth century, since he not only combined the hereditary regions but also added to it by conquering new areas. Apart from his palace, he built the temple of Bhootnath (temple for Shiva) at the centre of the Mandi town, which is one of the two focal temples of the festival.&lt;ref name=mandi/&gt;&lt;ref name= Chaudhry&gt;{{Cite book|last= Chaudhry|first= Minakshi |title= Guide to trekking in Himachal: over 65 treks and 100 destinations|page=177|accessdate=2010-02-07|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DvcK7Or0AIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Mandi+Shivarathri+Fair&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing |year=2003|isbn=81-7387-149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the theocratic state that evolved during this period, worship of Shiva and related goddesses was dominant. However, the theocratic nature of the state received special emphasis when, during Raja Suraj Sen’s reign, Vishnu worship also became integral to the State. Raja Suraj Sen (1664 to 1679), who did not have an heir, built the temple known as "Madhav Rai temple", dedicated to a form of [[Lord Vishnu]], as protector of Mandi. An elegant silver image of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] was made by his goldsmith Bhima, in the year 1705, which was named "Madho Rai" and deified, and ordained as the King of the State of Mandi thereafter. Since then the rulers served the state as servants of Madho Rai and custodians of the State. Suraj Sen’s successors have also held the deity of the temple in great reverence. This god is represented with precedence over all other gods on various religious occasions. The theocratic nature of the people of the state is amply reflected during the popular "Mandi Shivratri Fair", which is held every year with great fanfare.&lt;ref name=mandi/&gt;&lt;ref name=dream/&gt;&lt;ref name= Chaudhry/&gt;

However, the specific observance of this festival as a fair, starting with Shivaratri, is linked to its ruler Ishwari Sen. Ishawri Sen was held a prisoner for 12 years after he lost his kingdom in the war waged by Sansar Chand of Punjab, in 1792. He was released by the Gurkha invaders who had invaded the [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] and Mandi states. Afterwards, the Gurkhas' restored the Mandi state to Ishwari Sen. He was given a reception on the occasion of his return to Mandi, his state capital. On this occasion, the King invited all hill deities of the Kingdom and held a grand celebration, and this day happened to be the Shivratri festival day. Since then the practice of holding the Mandi fair during Shivaratri has been observed every year at Mandi. In recent years, modernity has also set in with [[Bollywood]] artists performing at the fair at [[Paddal]] in the celebrations in the evenings.&lt;ref name= Chaudhry/&gt;&lt;ref name=fair&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hpmandi.nic.in/fairs.htm|title=Fairs|accessdate=2010-02-07|publisher=National Informatics Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observance==
The observance of the fair is marked on the Shivaratri day when the village gods are carried in [[palanquin]]s or [[ratha]]s (chariots by people) to Mandi to pay homage to Madho Rai and the Raja. Members of caste denominations such as [[Brahmin]] and [[Kshatriya]] carry their gods and goddesses by palanquins or on their back. However, some exceptions of carrying them in vehicles by some caste groups have been noted. Thereafter, the fair lasts for seven days.

It is an accepted practice that every deity that is brought to the festival (decorated with glittering embroidered drapery) visits Madho Rai temple first to pay obeisance to Lord Vishnu and then proceed to the palace in a colourful procession called the Shoba Yatra, known locally as 'Zareb,' to honour the ruler (the regent of the Lord Mado Rai). (It is said that Madho Rai comes out of his temple only once a year on the Shivaratri day and leads the procession.&lt;ref name= Chaudhry/&gt;). The ruler thereafter pay obeisance to Lord Shiva at the Bhootnath temple where the main festival of Shivaratri is held. The palanquins of the deities are swayed to the drum beats and folk music to indicate their happiness after visiting the temples of Vishnu and Shiva.

There is pecking order that is maintained in the sequence of worship by the deities invited to the fair, based on rank and status. The day after the Shivaratri, on the second day of the fair, a pageant of gods with folk bands, dancers and devotees (all dressed in their colourful attire) and with lot of fanfare, is held in Paddal, a large open ground at the confluence of the Beas and Suketi rivers. Some 200 deities arrive from shrines around Mandi town and are assigned places at the Paddal grounds as per the pecking order, where the devotees offer worship to all the deities. The pageant is held every day of the festival.

The fair is also an occasion when local traders and people carry out brisk trade in local products such as wool, opium, honey, walnut, ghee (butter oil), and general merchandise from the region of Kangra, [[Kullu]], [[Shimla]], [[Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]] and from the neighbouring state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. It is said that the festivities promote handcrafted jewellery of the region. However, during the entire Mandi Shivaratri Fair, religiosity is the main theme. It is said that religious synthesis was achieved by combining the worship of Vishnu and Shiva cults during the seven-day fair.&lt;ref name= Sharma/&gt;&lt;ref name=dream/&gt;&lt;ref name=fair/&gt;&lt;ref name= Charak&gt;{{Cite book|last= Charak |first= Sukh Dev Singh |title= Himachal Pradesh, Volume 2|page=116|accessdate=2010-02-07|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tExDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Mandi+Fair&amp;dq=Mandi+Fair&amp;lr=&amp;cd=74|publisher= Light &amp; Life Publishers |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Jreat&gt;{{Cite book|last= Jreat |first= Manoj |title= Tourism in Himachal Pradesh |page=99|accessdate=2010-02-07|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n6Qa0OrXstAC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Mandi+Shivarathri+Fair&amp;lr=&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing |year=2004|isbn=81-7387-157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=palanquin&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.himachaltourism.net/mandi.html |title=Mandi |accessdate=2010-02-07 |publisher=Himachal Tourism |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301095719/http://www.himachaltourism.net/mandi.html |archivedate=1 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Minhas&gt;{{Cite book|last=Minhas|first=Poonam|title= Traditional trade and trading centres in Himachal Pradesh|page=160|accessdate=2010-02-07|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_52-WyPfLG0C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Mandi+Fair&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Mandi%20Fair&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing|year=1998|isbn=81-7387-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the concluding day of the festival at the end of fanfare, music and dance, in the evening, [[Jagaran]] ("night vigil," a nightlong worship) is held. On this occasion, a guru and his disciple proclaim prophesies for the following year. On the last day of the festivities, prayers are chanted and, after paying obeisance to Lord Shiva, all the deities assembled in Mandi depart to their original abodes. On this occasion, [[chadars]] (a form of devotional drapery offering to the god) are offered. It is an occasion when the head of the state (now a governor) is normally present on the last day, joins the worship, and accompanies the pageant.&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://himachal.us/2008/03/13/international-shivratri-fair-concluded-at-mandi-himachal/4821/news/yashrazz|title=International Shivratri Fair concluded at Mandi|accessdate=2010-02-07|publisher=My Himachal|date=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During all these festivities, it is said that Rishi Kamru Nag (local god of rains), the presiding deity of the Maha Shivaratri, after paying his obeisance to Madho Rai, moves to the Tarna ma temple at the top of the Tarna hill from where he watches the proceedings of the fair for seven days.&lt;ref name=dream/&gt;

;Bhootnath Temple
Bhootnath Temple, with an idol of a manifestation of god Shiva, an ancient temple dated to the 1520s, is synonymous with Mandi. It is in the heart of the town. The [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], Shiva's mount,  faces the deity from the ornamented double-arched entrance. The festival of Shivaratri is the prime event at this temple; the temple is the focal point of the seven day festival.&lt;ref name =palanquin/&gt;

A legend is told of the building of Bhoothnath Temple. It is said that, in 1526, Raja Ajber Sen heard the story of a cow offering milk on her own volition to a particular stone in a forest in Mandi. Lord Shiva is said to have appeared in the Raja’s dream and directed him to extricate the [[Shiva Linga]] that was buried at that site. Thereafter, the Raja found the Shiva Linga at the indicated location, which he deified in a temple that he erected in 1526, at the place it was found. He called it the "Bhootnath Temple" and started the observance of the Shivaratri festival at Mandi. Concurrent with this event, the Raja shifted his capital from Bhiuli to Mandi.&lt;ref name=dream/&gt;

==Visitor information==
Mandi town is accessible by road from [[Shimla]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Pathankot]] and [[Delhi]]. The nearest railway stations are [[Joginder Nagar]] and Shimla by narrow gauge train.

The '''Mathura rape case''' was an incident of [[custodial rape]] in India on 26 March 1972, wherein Mathura, a young tribal girl, was allegedly raped by two policemen on the compound of Desaiganj Police Station in [[Gadchiroli]] district of [[Maharashtra]]. After the Supreme Court acquitted the accused, there was public outcry and protests, which eventually led to amendments in the [[Indian law|Indian]] [[rape law]] via [[Criminal Law Amendment Act#India|The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1983 (No. 43)]] .&lt;ref name="Older friends"&gt;{{cite news|title=Older friends|url=http://www.mid-day.com/columnists/2013/jan/130113-opinion-paromita-vohra-old-er-friends.htm|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Mid-day|date=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suguna2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=B.

==The incident==
Mathura was a young orphan tribal girl living with one of her two brothers.&lt;ref name="Basu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Basu|first=Moni|title=The Girl Whose Rape Changed A Country|url=http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2013/11/world/india-rape/|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was an ''[[Adivasi]]''. The incident is suspected to have taken place on 26 March 1972, she was between 14 and 16 years old at that time.&lt;ref name="Basu"/&gt;  Mathura occasionally worked as a domestic helper with a woman named Nushi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Basu |first=Moni |title=The Girl Whose Rape Changed A Country |url=http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2013/11/world/india-rape/ |accessdate=7 December 2013 |newspaper=CNN |date=8 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205192527/http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2013/11/world/india-rape/ |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She met Nushi's nephew named Ashok who wanted to marry her, but her brother did not agree to the union and went to the local police station to lodge a complaint claiming that his sister, a minor, was being kidnapped by Ashok and his family members. After receiving the complaint, the police authority brought Ashok and his family members to the police station. Following general investigation, Mathura, her brother, Ashok, and his family members were permitted to go back home. However, as they were leaving, Mathura was asked to stay behind while her relatives were asked to wait outside.&lt;ref name="Majumdar2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maya Majumdar|title=Encyclopaedia of Gender Equality Through Women Empowerment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5aYvBs7iGIC&amp;pg=PA297|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-548-6|pages=297–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathura was then raped by the two policemen.

When her relatives and the assembled crowd threatened to burn down the police chowky, the two accused policemen, Ganpat and Tukaram, reluctantly agreed to file a panchnama (legal recording of evidence).&lt;ref name=slamming&gt;{{cite news

==The case==
The case came for hearing on 1 June 1974 in the sessions court. The judgment returned found the defendants not guilty. It was stated that because Mathura was 'habituated to sexual intercourse', her consent was voluntary; under the circumstances only sexual intercourse could be proved and not rape.&lt;ref name=slamming/&gt;&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite web |title=Mathura rape case|author= Kamini Jaiswal|url=http://www.thesundayindian.com/en/story/mathura-rape-case/7/6489/ |date=12 October 2008  |publisher=The Sunday Indian |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal, the [[Bombay High Court#Nagpur Bench|Nagpur bench]] of the [[Bombay High Court]] set aside the judgment of the Sessions Court, and sentenced the accused to one and five years imprisonment respectively. The Court held that passive submission due to fear induced by serious threats could not be construed as consent or willing sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=slamming/&gt;

However, in September 1979 the [[Supreme Court of India]] justices Jaswant Singh, Kailasam and Koshal in their judgement on ''Tukaram vs. State of Maharashtra'' 
reversed the High Court ruling and again acquitted the accused policemen. The Supreme Court held that Mathura had raised no alarm; and also that there were no visible marks of injury on her body thereby suggesting no struggle and therefore no rape.&lt;ref name=slamming/&gt; The judge noted, "Because she was used to sex, she might have incited the cops (they were drunk on duty) to have intercourse with her".&lt;ref name=kh132/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remember Mathura?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorial-views-on/sujataanandan/Remember-Mathura/Article1-981083.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=26 December 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In September 1979, only a few days after the verdict was pronounced, law professors [[Upendra Baxi]], Raghunath Kelkar and [[Lotika Sarkar]] of [[Delhi University]] and Vasudha Dhagamwar of Pune wrote an [[open letter]] to the Supreme Court, protesting the concept of consent in the judgment. "Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."&lt;ref name=kh132&gt;[[#Kh|Khullar, p. 132]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous widespread protests and demonstrations followed by women's organisations who demanded a review of judgement, receiving extensive media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rape Case Reversal Infuriates Indian Women's Groups; Assaults on Women Reported 'I was Appailed' Class and Sexist Prejudice|author=Michael T.

A number of women's group were formed as a direct response to the judgment, including ''Saheli'' in Delhi, and prior to that in January 1980, Lotika Sarkar, was also involved in the formation of the first feminist group in India against rape, "Forum Against Rape", later renamed "[[Forum against Oppression of Women|Forum Against Oppression of Women]]" (FAOW). A national conference was organised by FAOW which started the debate for legal reforms. Issues of [[violence against women]] and the difficulty of seeking judicial help in sexual crimes was highlighted by the women's movement.&lt;ref name=ep&gt;[[#Ep|Epp, p. 105]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fem web"&gt;{{cite web|title=In memoriam: Lotika Sarkar 1923 – 2013|url=http://feministsindia.com/in-memoriam-lotika-sarkar-1927-2013/|publisher=feministsindia.com|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ga&gt;[[#Ga|Gamble, p. 59]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the same tradition, on the International Women's day women from various states including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Nagpur took to the streets. Seema Sakhare, the founder of the first organizations in India that worked on the issue of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Basu"/&gt;

However, the courts ruled that there was no ''[[locus standi]]'' (legal standing) in the case to rule in favour to Mathura.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kh|Khullar, p. 133]]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually this led to [[Government of India]] amending the rape law.&lt;ref name=slamming/&gt;&lt;ref name=ga/&gt;

==Legal reform==
[[Criminal Law Amendment Act#India|The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1983 (No. 43)]] made a statutory provision in the face of Section 114 (A) of the Evidence Act made 25 December 1983, which states that if the victim says that she did not consent to the sexual intercourse, the Court shall presume that she did not consent as a [[rebuttable presumption]].&lt;ref name=slamming/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rape law, a double-edged sword in India |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/face-the-nation-rape-law-a-doubleedged-sword/95126-3-single.html |date=18 June 2009 |newspaper=CNN-IBN |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act. 46 of 1983, 113 (A) and 114 (A) |url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/185thReport-PartIIIB.pdf|page =265 |publisher=Law Commission of India |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New laws were also enacted following the incident. The Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the [[Indian Penal Code]] underwent a change with the enactment and addition of Section 376(A), Section 376(B),Section 376(C), Section 376(D), which made [[custodial rape]] punishable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ja|Jain, p. 12]]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides defining custodial rape, the amendment shifted the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from the accuser to the accused once intercourse was established; it also added provisions for in-camera trials, the prohibition on the victim identity disclosure, and tougher sentences.&lt;ref name=ep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From Mathura to Bhanwari|author= Laxmi Murthy |url=http://www.epw.in/commentary/mathura-bhanwari.html |date=8 June 2013 |issue=Vol – XLVIII No. 23 |publisher=Economic and Political Weekly |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The case is seen as turning point in women right's movement in India, as it led to just greater awareness of women's legal rights issue, oppression, and patriarchal mindsets. A number of women's organisations soon came forth across India. Previously, rape misjudgments or acquittals would go unnoticed, but in the following years, women's movement against rape gathered force and organisation supporting rape victims and women's rights advocates came to the fore.&lt;ref name=ep/&gt;&lt;ref name=ga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ep|Epp, p. 106]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mid America Off Road Association''' (MAORA) is an American off road racing sanctioning. It has sanctioned off road racing events since 1972. Web site www.maoraracing.us

==History==
MAORA is a non-profit race sanctioning organization. MAORA was created in 1972 to organize off-road enthusiasts and generally promote the sport of off-road racing. MAORA offers two Driver's points series and sets the rules and regulations to be followed by racers, track owners and promoters. Club officers are elected annually by the membership.

==Current Classes==
MAORA has 2 divisions of classes.  One is the "Pro" classes, with the other being "Trophy Classes."  The pro classes usually feature the more experienced racers, with more technologically advanced vehicles, whereas the trophy classes feature a "run-what-you-brung" format, meaning almost no rules.  The more novice racers generally race in the Trophy classes.  The pro classes race for money, while top finishers in the trophy classes receive trophies. Although class descriptions do not say this, all vehicles MUST have approved [[fuel cell]]s, [[roll cage]]s, [[racing seats]], and [[seat belt#Five-point harnesses|safety belts]].  All drivers must wear approved safety gear which includes fireproof suits and [[Snell Memorial Foundation|Snell]] approved [[helmets]].
:'''Class 7E'''
::With the E standing for Economy, Class 7E is a fairly inexpensive route into off road racing.  Very few modifications are allowed, and the trucks still must remain very close to stock.  Engine modifications are all but banned, and suspension parts must remain stock, and in stock location.  Class 7E is a pro class.&lt;ref name=mrules&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davecorrearacing.com/files/RULES2007ht.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207021610/http://www.davecorrearacing.com/files/RULES2007ht.htm |archivedate=2007-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Class 7S'''
::For many, many years, MAORA's Class 7S was  reserved for the 6-cylinder mini-trucks.  In the early 2000s, MAORA's rules were changed to allow ANY 2-wheel drive [[pick-up truck]] to be raced in Class 7s, with no restrictions. is a pro class.&lt;ref name=mrules /&gt;
:'''Class 7X'''
::This is MAORA's Trophy Class for mini trucks.  As per MAORA rules, Class 7X trucks must remain almost bone stock, with exceptions for safety items, such as the addition of racing seats, roll cages, fuel cells, and battery placement.  All suspension pieces must remain stock, as well as all driveline components.  They must also retain stock frames, and stock bodies, as well as retaining opening doors.&lt;ref name=mrules /&gt;
*'''Class 10'''
:One of MAORA's newest classes, Class 10 is an almost unlimited buggy class.  All that is required is that the engine have no more than 4 cylinders.&lt;ref name=mrules /&gt;
*'''Class 1-2 1600'''
[[Image:Jump163.jpg|right|thumb|2 Class 1600 is one of the most popular "Pro" classes in all of off road racing.  With most parts being relatively stock, and engine modifications limited, class 16 provides a more level playing field and is a relatively inexpensive class compared to most other forms of motorsports.]]

==Proposed and former Classes==
'''Side by Side'''
:There is a movement in MAORA to start a class of race vehicles designed around popular [[Side by Side (UTV)]] vehicles, such as those offered by [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], [[Polaris]], [[Arctic Cat]], and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]].  The class is very popular in other off-road racing series throughout the US.

==Types of Races==
*'''Short Course'''
:Short-course racing generally takes place on relatively short (usually under 1 mile) long.  The races are a specified number of laps, usually 10.  Each class will race 3 "heats."  The best average finish in all 3 heats is declared the winner of the event.

*'''Enduro'''
:Enduro races are the [[Midwest]]'s answer to [[Desert racing|desert off road racing]].  These events take place on long tracks, usually between {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, and {{convert|5|mi|km}} long.  These races are run very much like desert races, in that all of the cars are on the track at the same time, but start at different intervals.  These races are raced for a period of time, as opposed to being a specified number of laps.  A normal Enduro race is 3 hours.

'''MoonLIGHT''', also called '''Lunar Laser Ranging Retroreflector Array for the 21st Century''' (LLRRA-21), is a laser [[retroreflector]] to be deployed near the south pole of the Moon. The reflector is planned to be launched in 2019 as a secondary payload on the [[MX-1E]] lunar lander built by the private company [[Moon Express]]. The laser-ranging experiment was developed as a collaboration primarily between the [[University of Maryland]] in the United States, and the Italian [[Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati|National Laboratories of Frascati]] to complement and expand on the [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment]] started with the [[Apollo Program]] in 1969.

==Overview==

[[File:Goddard Spaceflight Center Laser Ranging Facility.jpg|thumb|Lunar laser ranging at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] ]]

The principle of this [[Lidar|laser ranging]] is based on [[laser]] pulses sent from a telescope on Earth to the [[retroreflector]] array on the Moon. The retroreflector (mirrors) send the pulse straight back to the originating telescope where the round trip time —and therefore the exact distance— is recorded. The reflector arrays are designed to allow more accurate measurements from Earth that will increase lunar mapping accuracy, will test principles of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]], and other theories of gravity.  Researchers think these studies may also help understand the nature of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name='Tune 2015'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Currie 2011'&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Lunar Laser Ranging Retroreflector Array for the 21st Century |journal=Acta Astronautica |first1=Douglas |last1=Currie |first2=Simone |last2=Dell'Agnello |first3=Giovanni |last3=Delle Monache |volume=68 |issue=7-8 |pages=667-680 |date=April-May 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.09.001 |bibcode=2011AcAau..68..667C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashley Ann Olsen''' was an American woman living in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] who was murdered in her apartment in 2016.  An illegal immigrant who arrived in Italy from [[Senegal]] during the 2015 [[European migrant crisis]] was arrested and charged with the murder.

==Context==
{{see also|Immigration and crime}}

The case drew attention as one of a number of murders committed by migrants during the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref name="KingtonDNA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SquiresArrest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeverStillAlive"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bever|first1=zlindsey|title=African immigrant says he fought with U.S. woman in Italy but 'she was still alive'|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1757195900/fulltext/DF1DAFF84CDC4DD4PQ/2?accountid=10226|accessdate=9 January 2017|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]], "resonated in Italy", and the police chief of Florence addressed safety worries, "assuring the public that Florence remained safe" in the wake of the Olsen murder."&lt;ref name=Pianagiani/&gt;
===Sexual harassment===
{{see also|Victim blaming|Slut-shaming}}
Olsen's murder was discussed as an example of the sexual harassment that women, especially young, foreign, women face in Italian cities, and of the [[victim blaming]] of young, attractive female murder victims for their own deaths.&lt;ref name="GrisafiGoodVictim"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grisafi|first1=Patricia|title=The myth of the good victim: As an American facing street harassment abroad, I wondered what it meant to be a "good victim"|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/03/25/the_myth_of_the_good_victim_as_an_american_facing_street_harassment_abroad_i_wondered_what_it_meant_to_be_a_good_victim/|accessdate=8 January 2017|publisher=Salon.com|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NadeauvictimBlamed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nadeau|first1=Barbie Latza|title=Ashley Olsen Didn't Deserve to Die, No Matter How Hard She Partied|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1779933235/DF1DAFF84CDC4DD4PQ/6?accountid=10226|accessdate=9 January 2017|publisher=Daily Beast|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olsen was killed at a time of rising public concern about miscommunication regarding consent to sexual activity between migrant men and European women, and international attention was focused on the [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]] that took place in a number of cities just days before Olsen was killed.&lt;ref name=Pianagiani/&gt; In January, Denmark debated a proposal to ban anyone who could not speak Danish, German or English from entering a bar or nightclub, and news discussion of the proposal included the Ashley Ann Olsen case.&lt;ref name="NadeauDenmark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nadeu|first1=Barbie Latza|title=Denmark Bounces Migrants From Nightclubs|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/20/denmark-bounces-migrants-from-nightclubs.html|accessdate=12 February 2016|publisher=Daily Beast|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheik Tidiane Diaw, a 27-year-old [[Senegalese]] national who had recently entered  Italy as an [[illegal immigrant]], was arrested for the crime.&lt;ref name=Pianagiani/&gt;  Witnesses saw the two leave a nightclub in Florence together on 7 January.

The lead investigator on the case, Giacinto Profazio, was involved in the [[Amanda Knox]] and Meredith Kercher expatriate murder, a case with which Olsen's murder is frequently compared.&lt;ref name=VogtStrangled/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingtonDNA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SquiresArrest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title=Italian police arrest illegal immigrant over murder of American woman in Florence|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12097235/Italian-police-reportedly-arrest-man-over-murder-of-American-woman-in-Florence.html|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February, reexamination of security tapes by authorities showed that suspect Diaw had returned to the apartment on the night of the murder and spent a period of time inside after his first departure from it.&lt;ref name="SerannoLuca"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seranno|first1=Luca|title=Omicidio Ashley, nuove immagini di Cheik che lascia l'appartamento della donna|url=http://firenze.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/02/09/news/omicidio_ashley_nuove_immagini_di_cheik_che_lascia_l_appartamento_della_donna-133064920/|accessdate=11 February 2016|publisher=La Repubblica|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rome (band).JPG|left|thumb|Experimental [[neofolk]] act [[Rome (band)|Rome]] performing on the Mėnuo Juodaragis Big stage in 2013]]
Mėnuo Juodaragis was initiated in 1997 as a spontaneous one day gathering of several young people and their friends in Verbiškės village, [[Molėtai District Municipality|Molėtai District]], [[Lithuania]], where it was organized biennially until 1999.&lt;ref name="About festival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjr.lt/arc/mjr2017/en/festival/11-about|title=About festival|publisher=Mėnuo Juodaragis|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the start in Verbiškės, Mėnuo Juodaragis moved to [[Sudeikiai]], a settlement near [[Utena]] town, where it took place from 2000 to 2002. Since then the timing of the festival also became fixed on the last weekend of August. Then in 2003–2005, Mėnuo Juodaragis was held in [[Kernavė]], the medieval capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. After a break in 2006 for financial and organisational reasons, the festival chose an island in Zarasas Lake in [[Zarasai]] town as the location for the 2007 festival.&lt;ref name="About festival"/&gt;

In 2011 Mėnuo Juodaragis returned to Lake Zarasas and the 12th festival was dedicated to [[sutartinės]], Lithuanian ancient polyphonic singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=7570|title=Baltic post-folk festival "Mënuo Juodaragis" to take place in Zarasai in August|date=July 22, 2011|publisher=[[The Baltic Course]]|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the 13th festival in 2012 was birds and [[aviation]] and it was once again organized in Lake Zarasas. An [[air balloon]] race was held for the occasion, as well as a night balloon parade.&lt;ref name="MJRXV"/&gt;

[[File:Duburys1.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Island in Dūburys Lake where the festival took place in 2016 and 2017]]
The 14th Mėnuo Juodaragis was dedicated to [[Latvian people|Latvians]], the other surviving [[Baltic people]], and the unity of Baltic people, featuring an extensive list of Latvian bands, such as [[Iļģi]], [[Auļi]], [[Skyforger]], [[Vilki]], [[Grodi]] and [[Dzelzs Vilks]], as well as Latvian artisans and lecturers.&lt;ref name="MJRXVI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=11683|title=Lithuanian music festival "Menuo Juodaragis" held today through Sunday|date=August 23, 2013|publisher=[[The Baltic Course]]|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theme of the 19th festival in 2016 was "Home", according to the organizers not only in the physical sense, but also in a spiritual meaning. That year Mėnuo Juodaragis took place on an island in Dūburys Lake, [[Zarasai District Municipality|Zarasai District]] and the [[headliner (performances)|headliner]] was Slovenian [[avant-garde music]] group [[Laibach]].&lt;ref name="MJRXIX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicexportfund.com/menuo-juodaragis-19/|title=Mėnuo Juodaragis XIX: A mystical festival of Lithuanian traditions|first=Paulina|last=Ružauskaitė|date=August 16, 2016|publisher=Music Export Fund|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th edition of Mėnuo Juodaragis returned to the island in Dūburys Lake. The festival was dedicated to [[Baltic people|Baltic]] [[List of thunder gods|god of thunder]] [[Perkūnas]] and was headlined by [[Nordic folk music]] group [[Wardruna]].&lt;ref name="Radikaliai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delfi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MJRXX"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heathenharvest.org/2017/07/11/celebrate-20-years-menuo-juodaragis-festival-august/|title=Celebrate 20 Years of The Mėnuo Juodaragis Festival This August|date=July 11, 2017|publisher=[[Heathen Harvest]]|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisers and supporters==
Mėnuo Juodaragis is organised by the Lithuanian record label "Dangus" and non-profit public institution "Baltijos Griaustinis". From 2002, the festival is partially supported by the [[Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania]], as well as the Department of UNESCO Cultural Management at [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]], other culture institutions, enterprises, media channels and private persons.&lt;ref name="About festival"/&gt;

'''Necrofauna''' are species that were previously [[extinct]] and have been biologically revived or recreated by the process of [[de-extinction]].

Necrofauna are proxies or imitations of their former species and not identical replicas. Due to a number of technological, biological and environmental factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/science/revive-restore-extinct-species-dna-mammoth-passenger-pigeon.html|title=We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species. Is It Worth the Cost?|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=2017-03-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are considered a new type organism altogether. [[De-extinction|Revive and Restore]], a nonprofit organization that supports pursuing de-extinction research with transparency to the public, describes the creation of necrofauna as a result of “transfer[ing] the [[gene]]s that define the extinct species into the [[genome]] of the related species, effectively converting it into a living version of the extinct creature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reviverestore.org/what-we-do/genetic-rescue/|title=What is Genetic Rescue? – Revive &amp; Restore|date=2013-09-27|work=Revive &amp; Restore|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existence of necrofauna is still largely [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]], a [[Pyrenean ibex]] was the first and only animal to have undergone the de-extinction process with moderate success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "unextinct" or revived animal was born, but then died several minutes later due to a lung defect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piña-Aguilar|first=Raul E.|last2=Lopez-Saucedo|first2=Janet|last3=Sheffield|first3=Richard|last4=Ruiz-Galaz|first4=Lilia I.|last5=de J. Barroso-Padilla|first5=Jose|last6=Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez|first6=Antonio|date=2009-07-13|title=Revival of Extinct Species Using Nuclear Transfer: Hope for the Mammoth, True for the Pyrenean Ibex, But Is It Time for "Conservation Cloning"?|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/clo.2009.0026|journal=Cloning and Stem Cells|volume=11|issue=3|pages=341–346|doi=10.1089/clo.2009.0026|issn=1536-2302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Necrofauna and the de-extinction movement are highly [[Controversy|controversial]] within [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and scientific circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minteer|first=Ben|date=2014-05-15|title=Is it right to reverse extinction?|url=https://www.nature.com/news/is-it-right-to-reverse-extinction-1.15212|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=509|issue=7500|pages=261–261|doi=10.1038/509261a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conservationists argue that creating necrofauna could potentially distract from the urgency of saving [[endangered species]] that are still alive. Concerns have also been raised pertaining to the possible damaging impacts [[ecology]] could face in the wake of introducing a new species into an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Alexandre|last2=Thévenin|first2=Charles|last3=Princé|first3=Karine|last4=Sarrazin|first4=François|last5=Clavel|first5=Joanne|date=2017-05-01|title=De-extinction and evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12723/abstract|journal=Functional Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1031|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12723|issn=1365-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term ''necrofauna'' is a [[portmanteau]] consisting of two [[morphemes]]. The first morpheme, “necro,” comes from the Greek prefix [[wikt:necro-#Prefix|''necro'']], meaning death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=necro-|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necr-|website=Merriam Webstar|publisher=Merriam Webster Incorporated|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Fauna]],” meanwhile, refers to the animals that inhabit a particular time period or environment and is derived from the Greek name [[Fauna (deity)|''Fauna'']], the Roman goddess of earth and fertility.

[[Alex Steffen]] is referred to as the first person to coin the [[neologism]] “necrofauna” in Jason Mark’s ''[[Earth Island Institute|Earth Island Journal]]'' article titled “Back From the Dead.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mark|first1=Jason|title=Back From the Dead|journal=Earth Island Journal|date=September 3, 2013|issue=Autumn 2013|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/back_from_the_dead/|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in the context of describing the phenomenon of "charismatic necrofauna," which expresses the possibility that only certain charismatic species may be chosen as candidates for de-extinction based on human preferences, or that such resurrection efforts could distract from helping less "charismatic" species that are currently endangered.

[[Image:Nancy Place Stanislas BW 2015-07-18 13-49-20 1.jpg|thumb|Opéra national de Lorraine, Nancy]]
[[Image:F54 Nancy Opera Foyer.JPG|thumb|Foyer of the opera house]]
'''Opéra national de Lorraine''' is an [[opera company]] and [[opera house]] located in the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in the French province of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Formerly named the '''Opéra de Nancy et de Lorraine''', it was given the status of "national opera" in 2006.

The company's original theatre was constructed during the reign of the King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine, [[Stanisław Leszczyński|Stanislas Leszczyński]] in 1758. This theatre, located behind the Museum of Fine Arts, was destroyed by fire in October 1905 and a new opera house was constructed in its present location on the Place Stanislas by Joseph Hornecker and was inaugurated in 1919.

Joseph Hornecker, a member of the "[[Musée de l'École de Nancy|School of Nancy]]," created the opera house in the classical style combined with characteristics of "art nouveau". The work done in Nancy made it a center of art and architecture that rivaled Paris and helped give the city the nickname "Capitale de l'Est."  

The opera house underwent restoration in 1994.

All productions are accompanied by the [[Orchestre symphonique et lyrique de Nancy]].

"'''Orange Crush'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]] It was released as the first single from the band's sixth studio album, ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', in 1988. It was not commercially released in the U.S. despite reaching number one as a promotional single on both the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] (where, at the time, it had the record for longest stay at number one with eight weeks, beating [[U2]]). It peaked at number 28 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], making it the band's then-highest chart hit in Britain, where they promoted the song by making their debut appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gittins |first=Ian |date=2007 |title=Top of the Pops: Mishaps, Miming, and Music - True Adventures of TV's No. 1 Pop Show |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWr5r2CPOtgC&amp;pg=PT51&amp;lpg=PT51&amp;dq=rem+orange+crush+top+of+the+pops&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KTQ6F9oI3j&amp;sig=XWN1Q3U_xdKWFK5SK4He3KYr6Vw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0YhFU-D4LKup7Ab214HIAg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=rem%20orange%20crush%20top%20of%20the%20pops&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=[[Random House]] |page=126 |isbn=9781846073274 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video for the song, directed by [[Matt Mahurin]], won the band its first [[MTV Video Music Award|VMA]], for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Post-Modern Video|Best Post-Modern Video]]. "Orange Crush" was also the first song to win in the category.

The song was placed on R.E.M.'s [[Warner Bros. Records]] [[compilation album|compilation]] ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003]]'' in 2003, and a live version appears on the ''[[R.E.M. Live]]'' album recorded in Dublin in 2005.

The song's title is a reference to the chemical defoliant [[Agent Orange]] manufactured by [[Monsanto Corporation]] and [[Dow Chemical]] for the U.S. Department of Defense and used in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the barbed-wire edge of "Orange Crush."

The '''Origins of the Cold War'''  involved the breakdown of relations between the [[Soviet Union]] versus the United States, Great Britain and their allies in the years 1945–1949. From the American-British perspective, first came diplomatic confrontations stretching back decades, followed by the issue of political boundaries in Central Europe and political non-democratic control of the East by the Soviet Army. Then came economic issues (especially the [[Marshall Plan]]) and then the first major military confrontation, with a threat of a hot war, in the Berlin Blockade of 1948–1949. By 1949, the lines were sharply drawn and the [[Cold War]] was largely in place in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carole K. Fink, ''Cold War: An International History'' (2014) pp 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Europe, the starting points vary in the late 1940s or early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lee, ''Outposts of Empire: Korea, Vietnam, and the Origins of the Cold War in Asia, 1949–1954'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press; 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Events preceding [[World War II]] and even the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, underlay older tensions between the Soviet Union, European countries and the United States. A series of events during and after World War II exacerbated tensions, including the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet–German pact]] in 1939, the [[Special relationship|Anglo-Americans]] repeated postponement of [[D-Day|an amphibious invasion]] of German-[[occupied Europe]], the Western allies' support of the [[Atlantic Charter]], Soviet rejection of decisions about Eastern European democracy made in wartime conferences and the Kremlin's control of an [[Eastern Bloc]] of Soviet [[satellite state]]s.

==Russian Revolution==
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}

In [[Diplomatic history of World War I|World War I]], Britain, France and Russia had been allies from the start in 1914, and the U.S. joined in April 1917. The [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in Russia in November 1917 but German armies advanced rapidly deep into the country. The Allies responded with an economic [[blockade]] against all of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mkFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA608|year=2013|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March 1918, the Soviets followed through on the wave of [[Opposition to World War I|popular disgust against the war]] and accepted harsh German peace terms at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerald A Combs|title=The History of American Foreign Policy from 1895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGamBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|page=97-101}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by "relinquishing much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd Chretien|title=Eyewitnesses to the Russian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oG4kDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT129|year=2017|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael  Senior|title=Victory on the Western Front: The Development of the British Army 1914-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE-uDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176|year=2016|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt, "The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention," and proceeded to step up their "[[economic warfare]]" against the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

However, the Bolsheviks, operating a unified command from a central location, defeated all the opposition one by one and took full control of Russia, as well as breakaway provinces such as Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.{{cn|date=September 2018}} [[Bainbridge Colby]], the American Secretary of State, in 1920 announce an American policy of refusing to deal with the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;David W.

Differences in the political and economic systems of Western democracies and the Soviet Union—--dictatorship by one party versus pluralistic competition among parties, mass arrests and execution of dissidents versus free press and independent courts, state ownership of all farms and businesses versus capitalism, economic [[autarky]] versus [[free trade]], [[Planned economy|state planning]] versus private enterprise—became simplified and refined in national ideologies to represent two ways of life. Following the postwar [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]], many in the U.S. saw the Soviet system as a threat.

In 1933 the United States under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] officially recognized the Soviet Union. The long delay was caused by Moscow's repudiation of Tsarist-era debts, the undemocratic nature of the Soviet government, and its threats to overthrow capitalism using local Communist Parties.  By 1933 these issues had faded and the opportunity for greater trade appealed to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Justus D. Doenecke|author2=Mark A. Stoler|title=Debating Franklin D.

Moscow was angry with Western [[appeasement]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] after the signing of the [[Munich Pact]] in 1938 which gave Germany partial control of Czechoslovakia after conference in which the Soviet Union was not invited.

In 1939 after conducting negotiations with both the British and French group and Germany regarding potential military and political agreements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|pp=515–540}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet Union and Germany signed a [[German–Soviet Credit Agreement (1939)|Commercial Agreement]] providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials&lt;ref name="shirer668"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ericson57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ericson|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], commonly named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries (Molotov–Ribbentrop), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Alan J.; East, Roger; Thomas, Richard.

One week after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's signing, the partition of Poland commenced with the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion]] of western Poland.&lt;ref name="stalinswars82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the Soviet Union and the West further deteriorated when, two weeks after the German invasion, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland]] while coordinating with German forces.&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union then [[Winter War|invaded Finland]], which was also ceded to it under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol,&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York : Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in stiff losses and the entry of an [[Moscow Peace Treaty|interim peace treaty]] granting it parts of eastern Finland.&lt;ref name="ckpipe"/&gt;  In June, [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|the Soviets issued an ultimatum demanding]] [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]] and the [[Hertza region]] from [[Romania]], after which Romania caved to Soviet demands for occupation.&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, the Soviets also [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic countries]] of  [[History of Lithuania#First Soviet occupation|Lithuania]], [[Estonia#Soviet occupation|Estonia]] and [[Latvia#Latvia in World War II|Latvia]]&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 1939 to June 1941 (when Germany broke the Pact and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]), relations between the West and the Soviets deteriorated further when the Soviet Union and Germany engaged in [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations|an extensive economic relationship]] by which the Soviet Union sent Germany vital oil, rubber, manganese and other material in exchange for German weapons, manufacturing machinery and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ericson|first=Edward E.|title=Feeding the German Eagle: Soviet Economic Aid to Nazi Germany, 1933–1941 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=0-275-96337-3|pages=1–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Shirer|first=William L.|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990 |isbn=0-671-72868-7|pages=598–610}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1940, the Soviets also engaged in [[German–Soviet Axis talks|talks with Germany regarding potential membership in the Axis]], culminating in the countries trading written proposals, though no agreement for Soviet Axis entry was ever reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=195–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Poster russian.jpg|thumb|200px|U.S. government poster showing a friendly Russian soldier as portrayed by the [[Allies of World War II]]]]
{{Further|Diplomatic history of World War II}}

On June 22, 1941, Germany broke the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union through the territories that the two countries had previously divided.&lt;ref name="stalinswars82" /&gt; Stalin switched his cooperation from Hitler to Churchill. Britain and the Soviets signed a formal alliance, but the U.S. did not join until after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. Immediately, there was disagreement between Britain's ally Poland and the Soviet Union. The British and Poles strongly suspected that when Stalin was cooperating with Hitler, he ordered the execution of about 22,000 Polish officer [[POW]]s, at what was later to become known as the [[Katyn massacre]]. Still, the Soviets and the Western Allies were forced to cooperate, despite their tensions. The U.S. shipped vast quantities of [[Lend-Lease]] material to the Soviets.

During the war, both sides disagreed on military strategy, especially the question of the opening of a second front against Germany in Western Europe. As early as July 1941, Stalin asked Britain to invade northern France, but Britain was in no position to carry out such a request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin had also requested that the Western Allies open a second front from the early months of the war—which finally occurred on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944. The US and Britain initially indicated that they would open the second front in 1942, and then in 1943, but it was postponed both times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/08/news/dday-60-years-later-for-russia-opening-of-a-second-front-in-europe-came.html Olga Rzheshevsky, "D-DAY / 60 years later : For Russia, opening of a second front in Europe came far too late", ''New York Times'', June 8, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1944 [[MI6]] re-established Section IX, its prewar anti-Soviet section, and Philby took a position there. He was able to alert the [[NKVD]] about all British intelligence on the Soviets–including what the American [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] had shared with the British about the Soviets. Throughout World War II, the Soviet [[NKVD]]'s mole [[Kim Philby]] had access to high-importance British [[MI6]] intelligence, and passed it to the Soviets.

The Soviets believed at the time, and charged throughout the Cold War, that the British and Americans intentionally delayed the opening of a second front against Germany in order to intervene only at the last minute so as to influence the peace settlement and dominate Europe. Historians such as [[John Lewis Gaddis]] dispute this claim, citing other military and strategic calculations for the timing of the Normandy invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|pp=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the Russians suffered heavy casualties, with as many as twenty million dead. Nevertheless, Soviet perceptions (or misconceptions) of the West and ''vice versa'' left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, in 1944, the Soviets appeared to the Allies to have deliberately delayed the relief of the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish underground]]'s [[Warsaw Uprising]] against the Nazis. The Soviets did not supply the Uprising from the air, and for a significant time also refused to allow British and American air drops. On at least one occasion, a Soviet fighter shot down an RAF plane supplying the Polish insurgents in Warsaw. [[George Orwell]] was moved to make a public warning about Soviet postwar intentions. A 'secret war' also took place between the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]]-backed [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] and Soviet [[NKVD]]-backed [[Soviet partisans in Poland|partisans]]. British-trained Polish special forces agent [[Maciej Kalenkiewicz]] was killed by the Soviets at this time. The British and Soviets also sponsored competing factions of resistance fighters in Yugoslavia and Greece.

Both sides, moreover, held very dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security. The Americans tended to understand security in situational terms, assuming that, if US-style governments and markets were established as widely as possible, countries could resolve their differences peacefully, through [[international organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the US vision of security was a post-war world shaped according to the principles laid out in the 1941 [[Atlantic Charter]]—in other words, a liberal international system based on free trade and open markets. This vision would require a rebuilt capitalist Europe, with a healthy Germany at its center, to serve once more as a hub in global affairs.&lt;ref name = "LaFeber 1991"&gt;[[Walter LaFeber]], "Cold War." ''A Reader's Companion to American History'', Eric Foner and John A. Garraty, eds. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

This would also require US economic and political leadership of the postwar world. Europe needed the USA's assistance if it was to rebuild its domestic production and finance its international trade. The USA was the only world power not economically devastated by the fighting. By the end of the war, it was producing around fifty percent of the world's industrial goods.&lt;ref name = "LaFeber 1991" /&gt;

Soviet leaders, however, tended to understand security in terms of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reasoning was conditioned by Russia's historical experiences, given the frequency with which the country had been invaded over the preceding 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The Second World War experience was particularly dramatic for the Russians: the Soviet Union suffered unprecedented devastation as a result of the Nazi onslaught, and over 20 million Soviet citizens died during the war; tens of thousands of Soviet cities, towns, and villages were leveled; and 30,100 Soviet factories were destroyed.&lt;ref name = "Schmitz"&gt;David F. Schmitz, "Cold War (1945–91): Causes" ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History''. John Whiteclay Chambers II, ed., Oxford University Press 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent a similar assault in the future, Stalin was determined to use the [[Red Army]] to gain control of [[Poland]], to dominate the Balkans and to destroy utterly Germany's capacity to engage in another war. The problem was that Stalin's strategy risked confrontation with the equally powerful United States, who viewed Stalin's actions as a flagrant violation of the Yalta agreement.

At the end of the war in Europe, in May 1945, the Soviets insisted on occupying the Danish island of [[Bornholm]], due to its strategic position at the entrance to the Baltic. When the local German commander insisted on surrendering to the Western Allies, as did German forces in the rest of Denmark, the Soviets bombed the island, causing heavy casualties and damage among a civilian population which was only lightly touched throughout the war, and then invaded the island and occupied it until mid-1946 - all of which can be considered as initial moves in the Cold War.

Even before the war came to an end, it seemed highly likely that cooperation between the Western powers and the USSR would give way to intense rivalry or conflict. This was due primarily to the starkly contrasting economic ideologies of the two superpowers, now quite easily the strongest in the world. Whereas the USA was a liberal, two-party democracy with an advanced capitalist economy, based on free enterprise and profit-making, the USSR was a one-party Marxist–Leninist State with a state-controlled economy where private wealth was all but outlawed.

==Postwar relations==

In 1945, the Soviet Union conducted{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} a [[show trial]] of [[Trial of the Sixteen|16 Polish resistance leaders]] who had spent the War fighting against the Nazis with British and American help. Within six years, 14 of them were dead.

At the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the chief Soviet prosecutor submitted false documentation in an attempt to indict German defendants for the murder of around 22,000 Polish officers in the [[Katyn massacre|Katyn]] forest near Smolensk. However, suspecting Soviet culpability, the other Allied prosecutors refused to support the indictment and German lawyers promised to mount an embarrassing defense. No one was charged or found guilty at Nuremberg for the [[Katyn Massacre|Katyn Forest massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/places/germany/nuremberg/ftp.py?places/germany/nuremberg/tusa/katyn-hearing |title=German Defense Team Clobbers Soviet Claims |publisher=Nizkor.org |date=1995-08-26 |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Soviet government acknowledged that the Katyn massacre was carried out, not by the Germans, but by the Soviet secret police.&lt;ref name="bbc161204"&gt;[[BBC News]] story : Russia to release massacre files, 16 December 2004 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4102967.stm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1945, Polish resistance fighter and [[Polish Righteous among the Nations|Righteous]] [[Witold Pilecki]] was sent by [[General Anders]] to spy against the communists in Poland. In 1948, he was executed on charges of spying and 'serving the interests of foreign imperialism'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime conferences===
[[Image:Potsdam conference 1945-8.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Clement Attlee, Harry Truman and Joseph Stalin at the [[Potsdam Conference]], July 1945]]

Several postwar disagreements between western and Soviet leaders were related to their differing interpretations of [[List of World War II conferences|wartime and immediate post-war conferences]].

The [[Tehran Conference]] in late 1943 was the first Allied conference in which Stalin was present. At the conference the Soviets expressed frustration that the Western Allies had not yet opened a second front against Germany in Western Europe. In Tehran, the Allies also considered the political status of Iran. At the time, the British had occupied southern Iran, while the Soviets had occupied an area of northern Iran bordering the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, at the end of the war, tensions emerged over the timing of the pull out of both sides from the oil-rich region.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

At the February 1945 [[Yalta Conference]], the Allies attempted to define the framework for a postwar settlement in Europe. The Allies could not reach firm agreements on the crucial questions: the occupation of Germany, postwar reparations from Germany, and the fate of Poland. No final consensus was reached on Germany, other than to agree to a Soviet request for reparations totaling $10 billion "as a basis for negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over the composition of Poland's postwar government were also acrimonious.&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaFeber, Russia, America, and the Cold War (New York, 2002), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Yalta Conference ended with "a declaration on liberated Europe pledging respect for democratic forms and providing a diplomatic mechanism for constituting a generally acceptable Polish government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=48|oclc=907585907|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Allied victory in May, the Soviets effectively occupied Eastern Europe, while the US had much of Western Europe. In occupied Germany, the US and the Soviet Union established zones of occupation and a loose framework for four-power control with the ailing French and British.

At the [[Potsdam Conference]] starting in late July 1945, the Allies met to decide how to administer the defeated Nazi Germany, which had agreed to unconditional surrender nine weeks earlier on May 7 and May 8, 1945, [[VE day]]. Serious differences emerged over the future development of Germany and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name = "Byrd"&gt;Peter Byrd, "Cold War" ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics''. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; At Potsdam, the US was represented by a new president, [[Harry S. Truman]], who on April 12 succeeded to the office upon Roosevelt's death. Truman was unaware of Roosevelt's plans for post-war engagement with the Soviet Union,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}&lt;!--what is this "postwar plans"??--&gt; and more generally uninformed about foreign policy and military matters.&lt;ref name = "Schmitz" /&gt; The new president, therefore, was initially reliant on a set of advisers (including Ambassador to the Soviet Union [[Averell Harriman]] and Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]]). This group tended to take a harder line towards Moscow than Roosevelt had done.&lt;ref name = "Schmitz" /&gt;  Administration officials favoring cooperation with the Soviet Union and the incorporation of socialist economies into a world trade system were marginalized. The UK was represented by a new prime minister, [[Clement Attlee]], who had replaced Churchill after the Labour Party's defeat of the Conservatives in the 1945 general election.

One week after the Potsdam Conference ended, the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] added to Soviet distrust of the United States, when shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to U.S. officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in [[occupied Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber 2002, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate end of war material shipments from America to the USSR after the surrender of Germany also upset some politicians in Moscow, who believed this showed the U.S. had no intentions to support the USSR any more than they had to.

==Creation of the Eastern Bloc==
[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|right|thumb|300px|Expansion of the USSR during World War II. The borders of Eastern bloc's members other than the USSR, Poland and Yugoslavia are shown in their post-war status]]
{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}
After the war, Stalin sought to secure the Soviet Union's western border by installing communist-dominated regimes under Soviet influence in bordering countries. During and in the years immediately after the war, the Soviet Union annexed several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. Many of these were originally countries effectively ceded to it by [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], before Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. These later annexed territories include Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43" /&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] ([[Karelo-Finnish SSR]] and annexed into the [[Russian SFSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe" /&gt; and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as [[East Germany]],&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Romania]] and the [[People's Republic of Albania]],&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aligned itself in the 1960s away from the Soviet Union and towards the [[People's Republic of China]].

The defining characteristic of the [[Stalinist]] communism implemented in Eastern Bloc states was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.&lt;ref name="hardt11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.&lt;ref name="hardt12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were economically communist and depended upon the Soviet Union for significant amounts of materials.&lt;ref name="hardt15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the first five years following World War II, massive emigration from these states to the West occurred, restrictions implemented thereafter stopped most East-West migration, except that under limited bilateral and other agreements.&lt;ref name="bocker209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further division in the 1940s==

==="Long Telegram" and "Mr. X"===
{{main|X Article}}
In February 1946, [[George F. Kennan]]'s [[Long Telegram]] from Moscow helped articulate the growing hard line against the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz&lt;/ref&gt; The telegram argued that the Soviet Union was motivated by both traditional Russian imperialism and by [[Marxist]] ideology; Soviet behavior was inherently expansionist and paranoid, posing a threat to the United States and its allies. Later writing as "Mr. X" in his article "The Sources of Soviet Conduct" in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (July 1947), Kennan drafted the classic argument for adopting a policy of "containment" toward the Soviet Union.

==="Iron Curtain" speech===
{{Main|Iron Curtain}}
On March 5, 1946, [[Winston Churchill]], while at [[Westminster College (Missouri)|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]], gave his speech "The Sinews of Peace," declaring that an "[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]" had descended across Europe. From the standpoint of the Soviets, the speech was an incitement for the West to begin a war with the [[USSR]], as it called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets &lt;ref&gt;Stalin Interview With ''Pravda'' on Churchill. ''New York Times'', 1946, March 14, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;ref name = "Schmitz" /&gt;

===Morgenthau and Marshall Plans===
{{Further|Morgenthau Plan|Marshall Plan|Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948}}
Having lost 20 million people in the war, suffered German invasion twice in 30 years, and suffered tens of millions of casualties from onslaughts from the West three times in the preceding 150 years, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany's capacity for another war. This was in alignment with the U.S. policy which had foreseen returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry (the [[Morgenthau Plan]]). On September 6, 1946, James F. Byrnes made a speech in [[Germany]], repudiating the [[Morgenthau Plan]] and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. (''see'' [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]) As Byrnes admitted one month later, "The nub of our program was to win the German people [...] it was a battle between us and Russia over minds [....]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daz.org/enJamesFByrnes.html Curtis F. Morgan, Southern Partnership: James F. Byrnes, Lucius D. Clay and Germany, 1945 1947]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gimbel]] [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2147827 "''On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy"''] Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2. (Jun., 1972), pp. 242–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1947, Truman appointed General [[George Marshall]] as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067, which embodied the [[Morgenthau Plan]] and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.".&lt;ref name="beschloss277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beschloss|2003|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, good and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="miller16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After six weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt;  In a June 5, 1947 speech,&lt;ref name="marshallspeech"&gt;Marshall, George C, [[s:The Marshall Plan Speech|''The Marshal Plan Speech'']], June 5, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; Comporting with the [[Truman Doctrine]], Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt;

With the initial planning for the Marshall plan in mid 1947, a plan which depended on a reactivated German economy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html Pas de Pagaille!] [[Time Magazine]] July 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; restrictions placed on [[The industrial plans for Germany|German production were lessened]]. The roof for permitted steel production was for example raised from 25% of pre-war production levels to 50% of pre-war levels. The scrapping of JCS 1067 paved the way for the 1948 currency reform which halted rampant inflation.

Stalin opposed the Marshall Plan.  He had built up the [[Eastern Bloc]] protective belt of Soviet controlled nations on his Western border,&lt;ref name="miller10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to maintain this buffer zone of states combined with a weakened Germany under Soviet control.&lt;ref name="miller11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet [[Eastern bloc]] countries of the newly formed [[Cominform]] from accepting [[Marshall Plan]] aid.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; In [[Czechoslovakia]], that required a Soviet-backed [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]],&lt;ref name=trueye&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', "Eye of the Storm" chapter&lt;/ref&gt;   the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="miller19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 1947 the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] secretary [[Andrei Zhdanov]] declared that the Truman Doctrine "intended for accordance of the American help to all reactionary regimes, that actively oppose to democratic people, bears an undisguised aggressive character."

===Greece and Italy===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:greece-resistance.jpg|thumb|Greek ELAS-EAM resistance fighters]] --&gt;
In Greece, during a civil war involving the communist-led partisan movement ELAS-EAM, British Special Forces terminated arms supplies to the ELA-ELAM, pro-monarchist armed forces were strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S Wittner, ''American Intervention in Greece 1943-1949'', New York: Columbia, 1982; John O Iatrides (ed), ''Greece in the 1940s'', Hanover and London: University Press of New England, 1981; Howard Jones, ''A New Kind of War: America's global strategy and the Truman Doctrine in Greece'', London: Oxford University Press 1989.

===''Nazi–Soviet Relations'' and ''Falsifiers of History''===
{{Main|Falsifiers of History}}
Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] also published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="henig67" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name="roberts97" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', this book, edited and partially re-written by Stalin, attacked the West.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin blockade and airlift===
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}

The first major crisis in the emerging Cold War was the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Phillips|title=The Cold War: Conflict in Europe and Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlNaN_k4YtcC&amp;pg=PA27|year=2001|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Carol K. Fink argues that this crisis, "occupies a special place in Cold War historiography, as an emblem of Soviet aggressiveness and Anglo-American resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carole K. Fink|title=Cold War: An International History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ebc_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|year=2013|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After setbacks to Soviet plans through the [[Marshall Plan]], the successful introduction of a new currency to West Germany, and massive electoral losses for Communist parties, Moscow decided to cut off land access to West Berlin by rail and highway, thereby initiating the [[Berlin Blockade]].Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.&lt;ref name="miller6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1948, because of massive post-war military cuts, the entire United States army had been reduced to 552,000 men.&lt;ref name="miller28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military forces in non-Soviet Berlin sectors totaled only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.&lt;ref name="miller33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled one and a half million men.&lt;ref name="miller30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two United States regiments in Berlin would have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.&lt;ref name="miller29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries, the success of which caused Stalin to lift their blockade in May 1949. At no time did the Soviet military or the Politburo contemplate a military escalation of the Berlin crisis.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The United States, the Berlin crisis underscored the need to reverse the demobilization of the Army. On July 20, 1948, President Truman reopened the [[Conscription|military draft]].  He called for nearly 10 million men to register for military service within the next two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Goodpaster et al|title=Toward a Consensus on Military Service: Report of the Atlantic Council's Working Group on Military Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtU_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|year=2016|publisher=Elsevier Science|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute over Germany escalated after Truman refused to give the Soviet Union [[War reparations|reparation]]s from West Germany's industrial plants because he believed it would hamper Germany's economic recovery further. Stalin responded by [[Berlin Blockade|splitting off]] the [[East Germany|Soviet sector of Germany]] as a communist state. The dismantling of West German industry was finally halted in 1951, when Germany agreed to place its heavy industry under the control of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which in 1952 took over the role of the [[International Authority for the Ruhr]].

At other times there were signs of caution.  Stalin observed his 1944 agreement with Churchill and did not aid the communists in the struggle against the British-supported anti-communist regime in Greece. In Finland he accepted a friendly, non-communist government; and Russian troops were withdrawn from Austria by the end of 1955.

===Soviet military perspective===
The Soviet military was focused on its main mission, the defense of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Gobarev, "Soviet military plans and actions during the first Berlin crisis, 1948–49" ''Journal of Slavic Military Studies'' 10:3, 1-24, DOI:
10.1080/13518049708430303&lt;/ref&gt;  From that perspective, the formation of NATO in 1949 was the decisive threat, and became its starting point for the Cold War.  Historian [[David Glantz]] argues that:
:Militarily, the Soviets considered themselves threatened by, first, the United States' atomic monopoly (broken in 1949) and, second, by the emergence of United States dominated military alliances, the most menacing of which was NATO.  The Soviet Union responded strategically by preserving a large, expandable peacetime military establishment, keeping large military forces in conquered regions of Eastern Europe, and cloaking these forces within the political guise of an alliance (the Warsaw Pact), Which could contend with NATO on a multilateral basis.  The major thrust of Soviet military strategy was to possess a conventional military force whose offensive capabilities could check Western nuclear and conventional military power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M. Glantz|title=The Military Strategy of the Soviet Union: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBlmeZB_BrQC&amp;pg=PA169|year=2001|pages=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other regions==
The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a somewhat different timing and trajectory outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''The Cold War: A World History'' (Penguin UK, 2017)  pp 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Africa, decolonization took place first; it was largely accomplished in the 1950s. The main rivals then sought bases of support in the new national political alignments.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Meriwether, "Endangering the Security of the Free World: Africa, the United States, and the Cold War," ''New England Journal of History,'' 64 (Fall 2007), 90–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
During World War II, the United States military operations had widespread support across Latin America, except for Argentina. After 1947, with the Cold War emerging in Europe, Washington made repeated efforts to encourage all the Latin American countries to take a Cold War anti-Communist position. They were reluctant to do so – for example, only Colombia sent soldiers to the United Nations contingent in the Korean War. The Soviet Union was quite weak across Latin America. Not until the late 1950s did Moscow achieve diplomatic or commercial relationships with most Latin American countries.,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Weeks, ''U.S. and Latin American Relations'' (2008) p 97&lt;/ref&gt; Before then it had only two trade agreements (with Argentina and Mexico.) The communist movements that had existed in Brazil and elsewhere in the 1930s had been disbanded or outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Skidmore and Peter H. Smith, ''Modern Latin America'' (6th ed. 2005) pp 121, 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Washington exaggerated the dangers, and decided on a preemptive attack against a possible communist threat.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore and Smith, ''Modern Latin America'' (2005) p 410–419.&lt;/ref&gt; It sought anti-communist resolutions at the annual meetings of the Pan American Union (renamed the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1948) and paid special attention to the growth of left-wing forces in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Westad, ''The Global Cold War'', pp 146–149.&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was reached  whereby the Latin American states agreed on vague statements of support for the American Cold War position, and the United States provided expanded financial grants and loans to stimulate economic growth. In 1954, at the 10th Inter-American Conference in Caracas, Washington demanded a resolution that the establishment of a communist government in any American state was a threat to the peace of the hemisphere. Guatemala cast the only negative vote. Guatemala's military, with CIA encouragement, overthrew its left-wing government later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Immerman, "Guatemala as Cold War History," ''Political Science Quarterly'' 95#3 (1980–81): 629–653.

===Far East and Pacific===

After the war ended, Malaya was plunged into a state of emergency as British and Commonwealth forces fought a protracted counter-insurgency war against their former communist-led MPAJA ally, who had fought the Japanese and now demanded independence from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kitson, ''Low Intensity Operations: Subversion, Insurgency and Peacekeeping'', London: Faber, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spenser Chapman, ''The Jungle is Neutral'', London: Chatto and Windus, 1948; Ian Trenowden, ''Operations Most Secret: SOE, the Malayan Theatre'', London: Wm Kimber, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;  In British Hong Kong, which had surrendered to Japan in December 1941, civil unrest occurred after Britain rapidly re-established rule at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Snow, ''The Fall of Hong Kong: Britain, China, and the Japanese Occupation'', Yale University Press: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's entry into the Cold War came in 1950, when it rushed combat air and sea forces into the Korean War, two days after the Americans did.  The Australian Prime Minister received a hero's welcome in Washington.  The ANZUS military alliance with New Zealand and the United States was signed in July 1951; it was a plan for consultation and did not involve military planning like NATO. Public opinion in Australia was intensely hostile to Japan after its wartime atrocities, but Japan was now an ally in the Cold War, so Australia's accepted the very generous soft peace treaty with Japan in 1951.  Instead of worrying about a resurgent Japan, Australia now worried more about a possible Chinese threat.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Ward, ''A Nation for a Continent: History of Australia 1901-1975'' (1977)  p 322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavan McCormack, ''Cold war, hot war: An Australian perspective on the Korean war'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Sino-Soviet relations|China–United States relations}}
Following decades of struggle, in 1949 the Chinese Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] defeated [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist armies and took control of the mainland. The Nationalist leaders and much of China's upper class fled to Taiwan where they had American protection. Stalin had long supported Chiang Kai-shek, while also giving some help to the Communists. The United States had tried in 1945–1948 to bring the Nationalists and Communists together in a coalition, but had no success. The conflict was not therefore part of the Cold War until 1949–1959.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Roberts, "New Perspectives on Cold War History from China," ''Diplomatic History'' 41:2 (April 2017) [https://networks.h-net.org/system/files/contributed-files/ar722.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1950s, however, China and the USSR were at sword's point, and became bitter enemies over ideological control of the Marxist–Leninist orthodoxy. The two set up rival communist organizations in countries across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Friedman, ''Shadow Cold War: The Sino-Soviet Competition for the Third World'' (2015). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469623771_friedman online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cold War then became a three-way conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Ross, ''China, the  United States, and the Soviet Union: Tripolarity and Policy Making in the Cold War'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

France for many years had been dealing with a nationalist insurgency in Vietnam in which communists, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]], played a prominent leadership role. In 1949, Mao's Communists took control of the north side of the China-Vietnam border, and began supporting the insurgents, especially by providing sanctuary from French attacks. Mark Lawrence and Frederik Logevall point out that "resurgent French colonialism became inextricably intertwined with Cold War tensions, especially in the years after 1949." American pressure on France after 1949 tried to force France to give priority to fighting communism, rather than fighting Vietnamese nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Atwood Lawrence and Fredrik Logevall, eds|title=The First Vietnam War: Colonial Conflict and Cold War Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYX4Cmi0gwgC|year=2007|publisher=Harvard UP|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
The political situation in [[History of Iran|Iran]] was a flashpoint between the major players in 1945–46, with the Soviet Union sponsoring two breakaway provinces in northern Iran, adjacent to the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. Soviet troops were stationed in northwestern Iran during the war. They not only refused to withdraw in 1945 but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states called the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] and the [[Republic of Kurdistan]]. The issue was debated at the United Nations, and in 1946 Moscow abandoned its position, and the conflict was permanently resolved peacefully, with a pro-western government resuming control. Iran did not become a major battlefield of the Cold War, but it had its own history of confrontation with Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Kuniholm, ''The Origins of the Cold War in the Near East: Great Power Conflict and Diplomacy in Iran, Turkey, and Greece'' (Princeton UP, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arms, ''Encyclopedia of the Cold War'' (1994) pp 37–38, 400&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-standing conflict between Arabs and Jews in the [[Mandatory Palestine]] region continued after 1945, with Britain and in an increasingly impossible situation as the mandate holder. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 calling for a homeland for the Jews was supported in 1947 by both the Soviet Union and the United States. Both countries promptly Recognize the independent state of Israel in 1948. The Soviet Union later broke with Israel to support its Arab enemies. The region was more of an independent trouble zone rather than a playing field of the Cold War, and was not a precipitating factor in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Howard A. Patten, ''Israel and the Cold War'' (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/Israel-Cold-War-Diplomacy-International/dp/1848858086/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1953, Arab nationalism based in Egypt was a neutralizing force. The Soviet Union leaned increasingly toward Egypt. Ehe United States based its Cold War coalition primarily on the [[Baghdad Pact]] of 1955 which formed  Central Treaty Organization ('''CENTO'''), that included Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Cohen, "From 'Cold' to 'Hot' War: Allied Strategic and Military Interests in the Middle East after the Second World War." ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 43.5 (2007): 725–748.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Behcet Kemal Yesilbursa, ''The Baghdad Pact: Anglo-American Defence Policies in the Middle East, 1950–59'' (2003) [https://www.amazon.com/Baghdad-Pact-Anglo-American-Yesilbursa-2013-12-14/dp/B01F9R4BWQ/ excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayesha  Jalal,"Towards the Baghdad Pact: South Asia and Middle East Defence in the Cold War, 1947–1955." ''International History Review'' 11.3 (1989): 409–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historians on the beginning of the Cold War==

While most historians trace its origins to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began with the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]] in 1917 when the [[Bolsheviks]] took power.&lt;ref name = "Gaddis"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Lenin]] stated that his new state was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement", and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon that should be used in order to keep the Soviet Union's enemies divided. He began with a new [[Communist International]] ("Comintern"), based in Moscow, which was designed to plan for revolutionary upheavals abroad.  It was ineffective—Communist uprisings all failed in Germany, Hungary and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=N. Copsey|author2=A. Olechnowicz|title=Varieties of Anti-Fascism: Britain in the Inter-War Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt4YDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|year=2010|publisher=Springer|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Max Beloff argues that the Soviets saw "no prospect of permanent peace", with the 1922 Soviet Constitution proclaiming:
:Since the time of the formation of the soviet republics, the states of the world have divided into two camps: the camp of capitalism and the camp of socialism. There - in the camp of capitalism - national enmity and inequality, colonial slavery, and chauvinism, national oppression and pogroms, imperialist brutalities and wars. Here - in the camp of socialism - mutual confidence and peace, national freedom and equality, a dwelling together in peace and the brotherly collaboration of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Max Beloff, ''The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia 1929-1936'' (vol 1, 1947) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British historian Christopher Sutton:
:In what some have called the First Cold War, from Britain's intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918 to its uneasy alliance with the Soviet Union against the Axis powers in 1941, British distrust of the revolutionary and regicidal Bolsheviks resulted in domestic, foreign, and colonial policies aimed at resisting the spread of communism. This conflict after 1945 took on new battlefields, new weapons, new players, and a greater intensity, but it was still fundamentally a conflict against Soviet imperialism (real and imagined).&lt;ref&gt;Chrtistopher Sutton,  [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-33491-2_2 ''Britain’s Cold War in Cyprus and Hong Kong: A Conflict of Empires'' (2016), abstract of ch. 1 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of long-term continuity is a minority scholarly view that has been challenged. Frank Ninkovich writes:
:As for the two cold wars thesis, the chief problem is that the two periods are incommensurable. To be sure, they were joined together by enduring ideological hostility, but in the post-World War I years Bolshevism was not a geopolitical menace. After World War II, in contrast, the Soviet Union was a superpower that combined ideological antagonism with the kind of geopolitical threat posed by Germany and Japan in the Second World War. Even with more amicable relations in the 1920s, it is conceivable that post-1945 relations would have turned out much the same.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ninkovich, "The First Cold War" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (2003) 33#3 pp 688-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term "cold war" to describe the postwar tensions between the U.S.- and Soviet-led blocs was popularized by [[Bernard Baruch]], a U.S. financier and an adviser to Harry Truman, who used the term during a speech before the South Carolina state legislature on April 16, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch, Bernard M.. Vital Speeches of the Day, 5/1/47, Vol. 13 Issue 14, p425, 3p; (AN 9753238)[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024721 Cold War — Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term "Cold War" was popularized in 1947, there has been extensive disagreement in many political and scholarly discourses on what exactly were the sources of postwar tensions.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Nashel 1999"&gt;Jonathan Nashel, "Cold War (1945–91): Changing Interpretations" ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History''. John Whiteclay Chambers II, ed., Oxford University Press 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In the American historiography, there has been disagreement as to who was responsible for the quick unraveling of the wartime alliance between 1945 and 1947, and on whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan (1986). ''American History: A Survey''. New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 798–799.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of these questions has centered in large part on the works of [[William Appleman Williams]], [[Walter LaFeber]], and [[John Lewis Gaddis]].&lt;ref name="Brinkley, 798–799"&gt;Brinkley, 798–799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dictionary of the Social Sciences'. Craig Calhoun, ed. Oxford University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials in the Truman administration placed responsibility for postwar tensions on the Soviets, claiming that Stalin had violated promises made at Yalta, pursued a policy of expansionism in Eastern Europe, and conspired to spread communism throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Brinkley, 798–799"/&gt; Historians associated with the [[Wisconsin School (diplomatic history)|"Wisconsin School" of diplomatic history]] such as Williams, however, placed responsibility for the breakdown of postwar peace mostly on the U.S., citing a range of U.S. efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II. According to Williams and later writers influenced by his work&amp;mdash;such as LaFeber, author of the popular survey text ''America, Russia, and the Cold War'' (published in ten editions between 1967 and 2006)&amp;mdash;U.S. policymakers shared an overarching concern with maintaining capitalism domestically. In order to ensure this goal, they pursued a policy of ensuring an "[[Open Door Policy|Open Door]]" to foreign markets for U.S. business and agriculture across the world. From this perspective, a growing economy domestically went hand-in-hand with the consolidation of U.S. power internationally.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Nashel 1999"/&gt;

Williams and LaFeber also dismissed the assumption that Soviet leaders were committed to postwar "expansionism." They cited evidence that Soviet Union's occupation of Eastern Europe had a defensive rationale, and Soviet leaders saw themselves as attempting to avoid encirclement by the United States and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun&lt;/ref&gt; From this view, the Soviet Union was so weak and devastated after the end of the Second World War as to be unable to pose any serious threat to the U.S., which emerged after 1945 as the sole world power not economically devastated by the war, and also as the sole possessor of the atomic bomb until 1949.&lt;ref name="Brinkley, 798–799"/&gt;

Gaddis, however, argues that the conflict was less the lone fault of one side or the other and more the result of a plethora of conflicting interests and misperceptions between the two superpowers, propelled by domestic politics and bureaucratic inertia. While Gaddis does not hold either side as entirely responsible for the onset of the conflict, he argues that the Soviets should be held at least slightly more accountable for the problems. According to Gaddis, Stalin was in a much better position to compromise than his Western counterparts, given his much broader power within his own regime than Truman, who had to contend with Congress and was often undermined by vociferous political opposition at home. Asking if it were possible to predict if the wartime alliance would fall apart within a matter of months, leaving in its place nearly a half century of cold war, Gaddis wrote in a 1997 essay, "Geography, demography, and tradition contributed to this outcome but did not determine it. It took men, responding unpredictably to circumstances, to forge the chain of causation; and it took [Stalin] in particular, responding predictably to his own authoritarian, paranoid, and [[narcissistic]] predisposition, to lock it into place."&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''We Now Know: Rethinking the Cold War'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Global historian [[Prasenjit Duara]] has placed the issue in a global context: 
:The Cold War is increasingly treated as a global historical period beginning customarily in 1947 when the Truman Doctrine sought to contain communism and the expansion of Soviet influence, and ending with the decline and fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Prasenjit Duara, "The Cold War as a historical period: an interpretive essay." ''Journal of Global History'' 6.3 (2011): 457-480. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prasenjit_Duara/publication/227406888_The_Cold_War_as_a_historical_period_An_interpretive_essay/links/54d45a060cf246475805c6fe/The-Cold-War-as-a-historical-period-An-interpretive-essay.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stone louse''' (''Petrophaga lorioti'', in [[German language|German]] '''''Steinlaus''''') is a fictitious animal created by German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]] to parody [[nature documentary|nature documentaries]]. It was primarily featured in a video sketch, as well as being a [[fictitious entry]] in the German medical encyclopedic dictionary ''[[Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch]]''.

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Steinlausgehege ZooDo.jpg|thumb|"Habitat" of the stone louse in [[Dortmund]] Zoo]]
In a popular [[mockumentary]] titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVKsbeayihI The Stone-Louse] by [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]], Loriot parodied ''Ein Platz für Tiere'' ("A Place for Animals", a longstanding TV series about endangered wildlife) by the famous German [[zoologist]] and documentary filmmaker Dr. [[Bernhard Grzimek]] ([[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], 20.47-51).  The mockumentary chronicles Loriot's 1976 "discovery" of the stone-louse.  The mockumentary has had .4 million views, despite the fact that it is only available in the German language.

The "science documentary" factually describes the stone-louse as a rodent-like [[mite]] in the order "Fictional Rodents", between 20 and 24&amp;nbsp;mm in length which consumes about 28 kilograms of stone per day, depending on the density and tastiness of said stone. Loriot gives some [[deadpan]] comments on a filmed [[building implosion]], mentioning the "shy rodent" to be at lunch in its natural habitat (before the implosion). As the building vanishes into dust and rubble in the background, Loriot caringly speaks about the "''possierliche kleine Nager''" ("endearing little rodents") and concludes with some "alarming" points about the endangered status of the entire species.

==Publication in ''Pschyrembel''==
In 1983 the clinical dictionary ''[[Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch|Pschyrembel]]'', from German scientific publisher [[Walter de Gruyter]], contained information about the stone louse for the first time in printed form. The short article is thought{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} to be based mainly on Loriot's TV documentary.

Extending Loriot's parody, the ''Pschyrembel'' informs about the louse's "value" in fighting bladder, gall and kidney stones. The subspecies "[[gallstone]] louse" and "[[kidney stone]] louse" are mentioned only briefly due to "lack of further scientific data".

In the 257th edition of the ''Pschyrembel'', the authors omitted the [[fictitious entry]]. The following edition, in 1997, featured it again due to protests from readers and was presented on [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] as the correct "Steinlaus inside" version.

Recently discovered "insights" found their way into this new version, which even speculated about the stone louse's participation in the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], since the wall was mainly placed in areas "commonly inhabited by the stone louse". That theory was reinforced by "discoveries" that the stone louse might have been used by the Spartans to bring down the ancient Athenians' [[Long Walls]]. Other hypotheses connect the stone louse with the end of the [[Stone Age]].

The ''Pschyrembel'' denies that the stone louse has become extinct, and refers to recent "sightings" by a local expert on stone lice, "Dr. Schlereth", at construction sites in Kronach, [[Bavaria]]. The 260th and ({{as of|2007|lc=on}}) most recent edition extends the article even further, referring to results in [[homeopathy]].

== Further publications and sightings ==

The fictional Member of Parliament [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]] has contributed to the (fictional) ''3. Hoechster Steinlaus-Symposium, XII (3) in Frankfurt''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]] ''Ökologische Kenndaten zum FCKW- Ersatzstoff R 134a'', 3. Hoechster Steinlaus-Symposium, XII (3), Frankfurt/M., 1993 (Ecological Data of FCKW substitutes)&lt;/ref&gt;

A contribution to a [[Senckenberg Museum]] Symposium in [[Frankfurt]] 1999 mentioned "dangers" posed by stone lice to the protection of architectural heritage and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Dr.&amp;nbsp;Wolfgang E. Krumbein ''Leben am Rande des Möglichen'' (Life on the edge of possibility), [[Senckenberg Museum]] Symposium in Frankfurt 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Dortmund]] Zoo some stone lice are "tended" and "on display".

Petrascheck's handbook of ''Lagerstättenlehre'' (ores and mineral resources )&lt;ref&gt;W. &amp; W. E. Petrascheck  ''Lagerstättenlehre Eine Einführung in die Wissenschaft von den mineralischen Bodenschätzen'', 4. Auflage von 1992, {{ISBN|3-510-65150-2}} In Kapitel II: ''Lagerstättenbildung durch Verwitterung''&lt;/ref&gt; refers to weathering effects of the animal.

She states a 19th-century use of [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] remedies, based on [[Silver nitrate|Lapis infernalis]] [[Materia medica|C 30]] had resulted in the extinction of the species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a scientific paper of [[Deutsche Bibliothek]] a ballpark guess of the amount of stone lice in the neighborhood of German libraries amounted to 113.3 billion. The author, Dr. Florian Seiffert, assumes that after the fall of the Berlin Wall, stone lice sought another ecological niche and found it in libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florian-seiffert.de/doc/steinlaus.pdf Untersuchung über die Verbreitung der Steinlaus in wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken in Deutschland]. Eine Erhebung im Rahmen der Deutschen Bibliotheksstatistik 20021. By Dr. Florian Seiffert, Steinlauszentrum des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, Marsiliusstr. 65, 50937 Köln / 13.

The German Insurance Catalogue for the German Public Health Service (only the G-DRG Version 2003/2004) temporarily mentioned Stonelouse Parasitism on men as a possible illness and gave some indications about average treatment, cost tags and remedies. The ''Color Atlas of Pathology'' by [[Thieme Medical Publishers]] refers to ''Petrophaga lorioti'' as a therapeutic infestation that could be used in the management of [[Calculus (medicine)|stone disorders]].

The municipality of [[Zürich]] has issued official guidance for citizens having trouble with stone lice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/dam/stzh/gud/Deutsch/UGZ/Gesundheitsschutz/Sch%c3%a4dlingsbek%c3%a4mpfung/Sch%c3%a4dlinge/Sch%c3%a4dlingsbestimmung/%3e%20Merkbl%c3%a4tter%20und%20Formulare/MB_SPB_Steinlaus.pdf Merkblatt der Stadt Zürich zu Steinlausbefall] (Recommendations of the City of Zürich concerning Stone Louse Parasitism)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chameleon''''' is a 2010 film directed by [[Jean-Paul Salomé]] and co-written with Natalie Carter. The screenplay is based upon the true story of [[Frédéric Bourdin]] who impersonated a missing child named Nicholas Barclay in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], in the 1990s. Much of the true story was incorporated into the film although the years have been altered and the location was moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].

==Plot==
A young man ([[Marc-André Grondin]]) in [[France]] shaves off all his body hair and turns himself in to the police.  The man claims to be a 16-year-old boy from [[Louisiana]] named Nicholas Mark Randall, who had been missing for four years. His story is that he was kidnapped by a [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution ring]] in France who physically altered his appearance.

He is reunited with his family who immediately have their suspicions regarding his story.  His mother ([[Ellen Barkin]]) and half brother Brendan ([[Nick Stahl]]) do not seem to accept him, and many questions are open regarding whether this man could in fact be their lost family member, considering he bears little resemblance to the boy who left and now talks with a French accent.  His sister Kathy ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) accepts his story without hesitation and eventually so does his possible mother.

F.B.I. Agent Jennifer Johnson ([[Famke Janssen]]) strongly suspects that he is lying because she has had extensive experiences with people lying to her, including a man who was a child murderer whom she had dated.  Meanwhile, his story starts to unravel and the true story of what happened to Nicholas starts to emerge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7241">{{About||the 2013 film|Trap Street (film)}}

In [[cartography]], a '''trap street''' is a [[fictitious entry]] in the form of a misrepresented [[street]] on a [[map]], often outside the area the map nominally covers, for the purpose of "trapping" potential [[copyright]] violators of the map who, if caught, would be unable to explain the inclusion of the "trap street" on their map as innocent. On maps that are not of streets, other "copyright trap" features (such as [[Phantom_settlement|nonexistent towns]], or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams. [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1058/do-maps-have-copyright-traps-to-permit-detection-of-unauthorized-copies ''Do maps have 'copyright traps' to permit detection of unauthorized copies?''] ''The Straight Dope'', August 16, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trap streets are often nonexistent streets; but sometimes, rather than actually depicting a street where none exists, a map will misrepresent the nature of a street in a fashion that can still be used to detect copyright violators but is less likely to interfere with navigation. For instance, a map might add nonexistent bends to a street, or depict a major street as a narrow lane, without changing its location or its connections to other streets.

Trap streets are rarely acknowledged by publishers. One known case is a popular driver's atlas for the city of [[Athens]], [[Greece]], which has a warning inside its front cover that potential copyright violators should beware of trap streets.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|el|Αττική}}" Greek-language map book published by Nik. &amp; Ioan Fotis O.E. {{clarify|date=August 2014}} (Νικ. &amp; Ιωάν. Φωτής Ο.Ε. {{clarify|date=August 2014}}, http://www.fotismaps.gr {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107170139/http://www.fotismaps.gr/ |date=2012-11-07 }}), Greek-language warning inside front cover&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

In an edition of the [[BBC Two]] programme ''[[Map Man]]'', first broadcast 17 October 2005, a spokesperson for the [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] claimed there are "about 100" trap streets included in the [[London A-Z]] Street atlas. One such street, "Bartlett Place", a genuine but misnamed walkway (named after Kieran Bartlett, an employee at Geographers’ A-Z Map Company), was identified in the programme and will appear in future editions under its real name, Broadway Walk.

It has been suggested that [[Google Earth]] placed [[Sandy Island, New Caledonia]] as the geographical analog to a trap street, although historical evidence implies that it originated as a cartographical error and [[Google]] simply passed the error along.

== Legal issues ==
Trap streets are not copyrightable under the federal law of the [[United States]].  In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;796 F.Supp. 729, [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=leagle.com|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19921525796FSupp729_11403/NESTER'S%20MAP%20&amp;%20GUIDE%20CORP.%20v.%20HAGSTROM%20MAP%20CO|date=|accessdate=2015-11-14|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United States]] federal court found that copyright traps are not themselves protectable by [[copyright]]. There, the court stated: "[t]o treat 'false' facts interspersed among actual facts and represented as actual facts as fiction would mean that no one could ever reproduce or copy actual facts without risk of reproducing a false fact and thereby violating a copyright&amp;nbsp;... If such were the law, information could never be reproduced or widely disseminated."  (Id. at 733)

In a 2001 case, [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. In this case, the identifying "fingerprints" were not deliberate errors but rather stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark| title=Copying maps costs AA £20m| last=Clark| first=Andrew| date=2001-03-06| work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, the [[Singapore Land Authority]] sued [[Streetdirectory.com|Virtual Map]], an online publisher of maps, for infringing on its copyright. The Singapore Land Authority stated in its case that there were deliberate errors in maps they had provided to Virtual Map years earlier.

The 2010 novel ''[[Kraken (novel)|Kraken]]'' by [[China Miéville]] features the trap streets of the ''[[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas|London A-Z]]'' being places where the magical denizens of the city can exist without risk of being disturbed by normal folk.

A 2013 film, ''[[Trap Street (film)|Trap Street]]'', inverts the usual meaning of a ''trap street'', becoming a real street which is deliberately obscured or removed from a map—and anyone who attempts to identify it by placing it on public record is then "trapped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/trap-street-review-venice-toronto-1200601404|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|title=Venice Film Review: ‘Trap Street’|author=Chang, Justin|accessdate=2014-05-11|date=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]" features a hidden street where alien asylum seekers have taken shelter. Due to a psychic field that subconsciously makes observers ignore it, outsiders consider it a trap street when they see it on maps. One scene involves the character [[Clara Oswald]] discussing the definition of "trap street". The episode's working title was also "Trap Street".

'''Tribal Gathering''' was a dance [[music festival]] that catered for different types of dance music cultures such as [[drum and bass]], [[techno]] and [[house music|house]].

==History==
The original promoters of Universe (Paul Shurey, Rob Vega, former Bath Rugby Captain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bathrugbyheritage.org/content/heritage-topics/people/player-profiles/spurrell-roger-3|title=Spurrell Roger|work=Bath Rugby Heritage|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Spurrell, Tennant and Jill Trick) had been organising events since the heady days of 1989 when [[rave]]s such as ''Sunrise'', ''[[Raindance (rave)|Raindance]]'' and ''Perception'' were in their pomp. They wanted to organise an event to bring together the different sub-cultures of the dance world and also to have a festival feel to it.

The first Tribal Gathering took place Friday 30 April 1993 at [[Pertwood|Lower Pertwood Farm]], [[Warminster]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]. 25,000 people attended to see acts such as [[Laurent Garnier]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Slipmatt]], [[DiY Sound System]] and [[Pete Tong]].

In March 1994 they opened the legendary London night club 'Final Frontier', at Club UK in Wandsworth. Weekly nights ran for several years, relocating in 1997 to the Complex Club in Islington. Each week featured numerous headline djs and live acts, the likes of which had never been seen before. A proud moment for the promoters was when 'Final Frontier' was voted number 5 in Musik Magazines top 50 clubs of all time, just behind [[Studio 54]], [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]], Paradise Garage and Limelight.

Also in 1993 the ''Universe - World Techno Tribe'' compilation CD was released in Europe on [[Rising High Records]], on Sony Music in Japan and Moonshine Music in the USA. Compiled and mixed by Mr Oz it reached number 4 in the Gallup album charts. Subsequent CDs were later released on MMS records and [[FFRR]].

The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]] of 1994 discouraged massive outdoor raves.
In 1994 Tribal Gathering moved to Munich Germany and in cooperation with "N.A.S.A/ Hannover Nice And Safe Attitude" managed to stage one of the most exciting event in Munich and Universe/Tribal Gathering  was selected as the best event in Germany in 1994.

In the UK Tribal Gathering teamed up with the [[Mean Fiddler Music Group|Mean Fiddler]] organisation to organise more legal festivals. The next event took place in May 1995, UK Tribal Gathering at Otmoor Park, [[Beckley, Oxfordshire|Beckley]], [[Oxfordshire]]. Headline acts included [[The Prodigy]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Moby]]

The 1996 version of the UK Tribal Gathering, took place in June at [[Luton Hoo]], Bedfordshire with 30,000 turning up for to see sets by [[Leftfield]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Black Grape]], [[Goldie]], [[Daft Punk]] and others.

In 1997, at Luton Hoo, [[Kraftwerk]] were the headliners of the festival, playing for the first time in the UK since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/2cents/kraftwerk.htm 2 Cents: Kraftwerk, Tribal Gathering] (May 25, 1997). Retrieved on February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was a monumental success, even though there was no new material released since The Mix.

By 1998, the Tribal Gathering name had grown into a brand. There were albums, a TV Show and plans to establish events worldwide in the pipeline. However their things did not go to schedule and the 1998 event did not take place due to Universe and Mean Fiddler's legal battle of the Tribal Gathering name.

In 1999 David Vincent buys the Tribal Gathering name off Paul Shurey &amp; Ian Jenkinson with the aim to bringing the event back to life.

The Tribal Gathering name was revived in 2000 at the legendary Sankeys Soap club, Manchester. The weekly legendary "Tribal Sessions" club night took place at Sankeys with DJs generally playing House, Techno, Tech-house, Acid House &amp; Breaks &amp; Beats. Tribal Sessions djs included Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Carl Cox, Sasha, Steve Lawler, Laurent Garnier and many others. Tribal Sessions won many awards from Mixmag best club of the year 2004. There was also 2 exhibitions in Manchester Museum of Science and Industry for the brand for providing significant culture for the city of Manchester.

In 2002 Tribal Gathering returned as a weekender at Southport Pontins to a sell out 5000 capacity crowd with DJs Sasha, Dave Clarke, Deep Dish, Derrick Carter, Erol Alkan amongst others performing with many rave reviews. There was a follow up event in November 2003.

In 2003 Tribal Gathering held the first legal warehouse party for over 10 years in a "secret" Manchester location, which turned out to be a warehouse previously used as a set for the movie [[24 Hour Party People]], in which it was decorated to replicate [[The Haçienda]] nightclub. 12,000 people attended where artistes like Groove Armada, Laurent Garnier, Jeff Mills, Deep Dish appeared. The event won best event of the year 2003 with Mixmag and was voted second best party ever by Mixmag in 2004.

In 2004 Tribal Gathering held a 2 day warehouse party in a Manchester City Centre in association with the Hacienda with DJs Groove Armada, Graeme Park and Mike Pickering.

In July 2005, a Tribal Gathering festival was organised, in aid of the war victims in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]], to take place again at Luton Hoo but it was cancelled due to the terrorist attacks that took place on 7 July in London. There has not been a follow up event since but rumours suggest a return event is planned for 2020.

The '''Walam Olum''' or '''Walum Olum''', usually translated as "Red Record" or "Red Score," is purportedly a historical narrative of the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe. The document has provoked controversy as to its authenticity since its publication in the 1830s by [[botanist]] and [[antiquarian]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]]. [[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] studies in the 1980s and analysis in the 1990s of Rafinesque's [[manuscripts]] have produced significant evidence that the document is a hoax. Some Delaware people, however, believe Rafinesque based his writing on actual Lenape stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/lenape_culture.htm Lenape Nation: Lenape Culture], Native Languages&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Walamolum01.jpg|thumb|280px|Walam Olum pictograph]]

==The work==
In 1836 in his first volume of ''The American Nations'', Rafinesque published what he represented as an [[English (language)|English]] translation of the entire text of the ''Walam Olum'', as well as a portion in the [[Lenape language]].

The ''Walam Olum'' includes a [[creation myth]], a [[deluge myth]], and the narrative of a series of [[Human migration|migrations]]. Rafinesque and others claimed or interpreted the migrations to have begun in [[Asia]]. The Walam Olum suggested a migration over the [[Bering Strait]] took place 3,600 years ago.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;Jackson, Brittany and Mark Rose. [http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/hoaxes/walam_olum.html "Walam Olum Hokum."] ''Archaeology.'' 4 Dec 2009 (retrieved 26 Dec 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The text included a long list of chiefs' names, which appears to provide a timescale for the epic. According to Rafinesque, the chiefs appeared as early as 1600 [[BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Rafinesque, C.S.,''The American nations; or, outlines of their general history, ancient and modern, including: the whole history of the earth and mankind in the western hemisphere; the philosophy of American history; the annals, traditions, civilization, lanuguages, &amp;c., of all the American nations, tribes, empires, and states '' 1836 p. 124 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XYlHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=rafinesque+chiefs+1600&amp;ei=QqR5S8WDLInwMozL4csE&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The story in summary===
The narrative begins with the formation of the universe, the shaping of the Earth, and the creation of the first people, by the Great [[Manitou]]. Then, as the Great Manitou creates more creatures, an evil manitou creates others, such as flies. Although all is harmonious at first, an evil being brings unhappiness, sickness, disasters and death. A great snake attacked the people and drove them from their homes. The snake flooded the land and made monsters in the water, but the Creator made a giant turtle, on which the surviving people rode out the flood, and prayed for the waters to recede. When land emerged again, they were in a place of snow and cold, so they developed their skills of house-building and hunting, and began explorations to find more temperate lands. Eventually, they chose to head east from the land of the Turtle to the land of the Snake, walking across the frozen ocean and first reaching a land of spruce trees.

After a few generations (from this point on, chiefs of the tribe are named), they began to spread into the adjoining territories. Many generations passed (the characteristics of each chief briefly described), until a large part of the nation decided to invade the territory of the Talegawi people, aided by the northern Talamatan. Although the invasion eventually succeeded, the Talamatan later became hostile, but were soon subdued, and a further long period of consolidation began. Slow expansion into the rich eastern lands eventually reached another sea, where, after generations, the first white men arrived in ships.

There the text ends, though Rafinesque did publish an additional "Fragment: On the History of the Linapis since abt. 1600, when the Wallamolum closes" which takes the story up to his own time. This (which incidentally names the composer of the original Walam Olum as one Lekhibit) exists only as a purported translation by John Burns, who has himself never been satisfactorily identified.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Leopold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVzI3z8NugkC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=%22rafinesque+%22john+burns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hskaj25aHs&amp;sig=UbjDpHu6erlO-ydJimuQ7PeEuVM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CU1KTdiLLcimhAem4MzlDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rafinesque%20%22john%20burns%22&amp;f=false  ''Early nineteenth-century contributions to American Indian and general linguistics: Du Ponceau and Rafinesque''] Springer (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-7923-2506-2}}, p315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Rafinesque claimed the original narrative was recorded in pictographs on birch bark, or cedar wood tablets or sticks (Rafinesque explained that "Olum... implies a record, a notched stick, an engraved piece of wood or bark.")  He said "the late Dr. Ward of Indiana" acquired the materials in 1820 from a Lenape patient in return for a medical cure, and eventually passed them on to Rafinesque. From Rafinesque's personal notes and a family legend, this Dr. Ward was tentatively identified in 1954 as Dr John Russell Ward, a Kentucky physician who died in 1834,&lt;ref&gt;Weer, Paul (1954). "History of the Walam Olum Manuscript and Painted Records". In Voegelin, Charles F. (et al.) ''Walam Olum; or, Red Score, the Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape'', Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; but a potential Indiana candidate has been identified: Malthus A. Ward&lt;ref&gt;William Barlow and David O. Powell [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27790973 "The Late Dr. Ward of Indiana": Rafinesque's Source of the Walam Olum"] in ''Indiana Magazine of History'' Vol. 82, No. 2 (June 1986), pp. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; (1794–1863, so not "late" in the sense of "deceased") who spent some of his early career in Indiana, moved to New England in 1823 and from 1831 was professor of natural history at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2180 "Malthus Ward (1794-1863)"] in the ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. Accessed 2010-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; He said the explanatory transcription of verses in the [[Lenape language]] came from a different source, in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Daniel G. (1885) ''The Lenâpé and their Legends: With the Complete Text and Symbols of the Walam Olum''&lt;/ref&gt; After his translation was published, Rafinesque said he lost the actual plaques.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

When Rafinesque wrote an essay on the Lenape language in October 1834, he did not mention the ''Walam Olum'' at all.  It was two months later that he submitted a supplement about it.  This was shortly after he acquired a list of authentic Lenape names compiled by [[John Heckewelder]].&lt;ref name="oestr"&gt;Oestreicher, David M. (1996) "Unraveling the Walam Olum", ''Natural History'' 105 (10):14–21. (also revised version in Boewe, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Rafinesque's translation of the 183 verses totals fewer than 3,000 words. In his manuscript he juxtaposed the pictographs with the verses in Lenape language that explained them. This material is now held at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and has been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;Wallam-Olum: first and second parts of the painted and engraved traditions of the Linnilinapi / translated word for word by C. S. Rafinesque. [http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/2571471 UPenn Ms. Coll. 700, Item 217]&lt;/ref&gt; Any items in Rafinesque's large collection of specimens, which did not find a ready sale after his death were apparently destroyed. There is no evidence other than Rafinesque's testimony that the original sticks existed. Scholars have only his work to study.

Twentieth-century archaeology has confirmed that by Rafinesque's time, Native Americans had been using birch bark scrolls for over 200 years.  In 1965 the archaeologist Kenneth Kidd reported on two finds of "trimmed and fashioned pieces of birch bark on which have been scratched figures of animals, birds, men, [[myth]]ological creatures, and esoteric symbols" in the [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Head-of-the-Lakes]] region of [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]]. Some of these resembled scrolls used by the [[Midewiwin|Mide Society]] of the [[Ojibwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;  A scroll from one of these finds was later dated to about 1560 +/-70 [[common era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Rajnovich, Grace. ''Reading Rock Art: Interpreting the Indian Rock Paintings of the Canadian Shield''. Dundurn Press Ltd., 1994. {{ISBN|0-920474-72-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' in the 19th century==
While there was controversy about the ''Walam Olum'', it was treated as an accurate account by historians, [[anthropologist]]s, and archaeologists for many years.  [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim G. Squier]], widely regarded as an influential figure of American 19th-century [[archaeology]], republished the text in 1849. He accepted it as genuine, partially on internal evidence but also because the educated Indian chief (Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh) ([[George Copway]]), to whom he showed the manuscript, "unhesitatingly pronounced it authentic, in respect not only to the original signs and accompanying explanations in the Delaware dialect, but also in the general ideas and conceptions which it embodies. He also bore testimony to the fidelity of the translation." More recently, Barnhart noted that Copway was "fluent in his native dialect and knowledgeable of the traditions of the Ojibwa and other Algonquian groups such as the Lenape, but he was certainly not an expert on the traditions and language of the Delaware."&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1849, after the documented was republished, [[Henry Schoolcraft|Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] wrote to Squier that he believed the document is "well sustained by comparisons with such transcripts as I have obtained from bark scrolls, and the tabular pieces of wood called music boards".
 
In 1885, after the third printing,&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; the well-known [[ethnographer]] [[Daniel G. Brinton]] published a new translation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garrison Brinton, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 1885 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=jaZegQr677wC&amp;dq=rafinesque+walam+olum+&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=f-A73ojqP2&amp;sig=OTQRiPltl-2am1E189ruL5lEV5E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result ''The Lenâpé and Their Legends: With the Complete Text and Symbols of the Walam Olum. A New Translation, and an inquiry into its authenticity''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Brinton explained, "In several cases the figures or symbols appear to me to bear out the corrected translations which I have given of the lines, and not that of Rafinesque.  This, it will be observed, is an evidence, not merely that he must have received this text from other hands, but the figures also, and weighs heavily in favor of the authentic character of both."&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1885 edition may have been read by ethnographer and explorer [[James Mooney]]. Published in 1888, his ''[[Myths of the Cherokee]]'' references the ''Walum Olum.'' In his "Historical sketch of the Cherokee" at the beginning of the work he attempts to adduce the origins of the term 'Cherokee:' "...among other synonyms for the tribe are Rickahockan or Rechahecrian, the ancient Powhatan name, and Tallige', or Tallige'wi, the ancient name used in the ''Walam Olum'' chronicle of the Lenape'."&lt;ref name=Mooney1888&gt;Mooney, James. King, Duane (ed.). ''Myths of the Cherokee.'' Barnes &amp; Noble. New York. 1888 (2007). pp. 4 - 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' in the 20th century==
In the 1930s, [[Erminie Voegelin]] attempted to find evidence of ''Walam Olum'' narrative elements in independent Lenni-Lenape and Delaware sources; the parallels were at best inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Erminie W., "Cultural parallels," pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts about the text's authenticity began to grow. In 1952 renowned archaeologist [[James Bennett Griffin]] publicly announced that he “had no confidence in the 'Walam Olum'.”  Historian [[William A. Hunter]] also believed the text a hoax. In 1954 archaeologist [[John G. Witthoft]] found linguistic inaccuracies and suspicious correspondences of words in the texts to 19th-century Lenape-English word lists.  He concluded that Rafinesque composed the narrative from Lenape texts already in print.&lt;ref name="witt"&gt;Witthoft, John, 1955. "The Walam Olum Project", ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' Vol. 21, p194.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, he announced in the ''Journal of American Linguistics'' the start of a ''Walam Olum'' project for further study, but this project did not take place.&lt;ref name="witt"/&gt;

In 1954, a multidisciplinary team of scholars from the [[Indiana Historical Society]] published another translation and commentary.  They stated, "The 'Red Score' is a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture." A reviewer noted that the team was not able to identify Dr. Ward, and he concluded that the document's origins "are undeniably clouded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of "Walam Olum or Red Score. The  Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians. A New Translation,  Interpreted by Linguistic, Historical, Archaeological, Ethnological, and  that Physical Anthropological Studies"|journal=American Antiquity|date=October 1955|first=Richard  B.|last=Woodbury|volume=21|issue=2|pages=191–192|id=  |format=|doi=10.2307/276869|publisher=American Antiquity, Vol. 21, No. 2|jstor=276869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthropologist [[Della Collins Cook]] commented on the 1954 study, "The scholarly essays are best read as exercises in stating one's contradictory conclusions in a manner designed to give as little offense as possible to one's sponsor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Buikstra, Jane]] and Lane Beck, eds. ''Bioarchaeology: The Contextual Analysis of Human Remains'', Academic Press (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-12-369541-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other translations and commentaries have followed, including translations into languages other than English.

[[Selwyn Dewdney]], art educator and researcher into [[Ojibwa]] art and [[anthropology]], wrote the only comprehensive study of the Ojibwa birch bark scrolls (''[[wiigwaasabak]]oon''). In it he wrote: "A surviving [[pictographic]] record on wood, preserved by the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking Delaware long after they had been shifted from their original homeland on [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] shores at the mouth of the [[Delaware River]], offers evidence of how ancient and widespread is the [[myth]] of a flood (see [[Deluge (mythology)]]) involving a powerful water ''[[manitou]]''. The record is known as the ''Walum Olum'' (Painted Sticks), and was interpreted for [[George Copway]] by a Delaware Elder... Apart from the reference to man's moral wickedness, the mood and imagery of the ''Walum Olum'' convey an archaic atmosphere that surely predates European Influence."&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, Selwyn. 1975. ''The Sacred Scrolls of the Southern Ojibway''. Glenbow Museum &amp; University Of Toronto Press. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of his study by the anthropologist Edward S Rogers states "Dewdney is apt to rely upon ethnographic generalizations that were in vogue a quarter of a century ago, but in the intervening years have been modified or disproven...Dewdney handles ethnohistorical matters no better than he does ethnographic topics... Dewdney has deceived the unwary that do not realize that the exact distributions and certain proposed migrations of Ojibwa still remain unresolved. A final word, but one that is of paramount importance, must be voiced. How will the [[Ojibwa]] react to this book? Most likely, negatively, from the few comments received to date. The fact that "Sacred" information is being divulged will be resented."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Edward S., ''Ethnohistory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, (Winter, 1975), pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Kentucky-based writer [[Joe Napora]] wrote a modern translation of the text, which was published in 1992. At the time he thought the ''Walam Olum'' was genuine.  In his preface, he wrote, "My belief is that the Walam Olum is closely related to the [[Midewiwin#Teaching scrolls|Mide Scrolls]] that Dewdney wrote so eloquently about in 'Sacred Scrolls of the Ojibway.'"&lt;ref&gt;Napora, Joe. ''The Walam Olum / as translated by Joe Napora''. Greenfield Center, NY: Greenfield Review Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-912678-82-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, however, ethnologists had collected enough independent information "to discount the ''Walam olum'' completely as a tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert C. Kraft]], an expert on the Lenape,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDF1331F934A15752C1A96E948260 "Lenape Expert Assails Phone Flier"], ''New York Times'' online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnj.org/herbert_c.html "Archaeological Society of New Jersey Lifetime Achievement Award"]&lt;/ref&gt; had long suspected the document to be a fraud. He stated that it did not square with the archaeological record of migrations by the prehistoric ancestors of the Lenape.  In addition, he cited a 1985 survey conducted among Lenape elders by ethnologists David M. Oestreicher and James Rementer that revealed traditional Lenape had never heard of the narrative. The older Lenape people said that they "found its text puzzling and often incomprehensible." Oestreicher examined the Lenape language text with fluent native speaker, Lucy Parks Blalock, and they found problems such as frequent use of English idioms.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

In 1991 Steven Williams summarized the history of the case and the evidence against the document, lumping it with many other famous archaeological frauds.  The existence of genuine historic pictogram documents elsewhere does not overcome the textual and ethnological problems of the ''Walam Olum''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Steven. ''Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' since 1994==
In 1994, and afterwards, textual evidence that the Walam Olum was a hoax was supplied by David M. Oestreicher in “Unmasking the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Hoax.” Oestreicher examined Rafinesque's original manuscript and "found it replete with crossed-out Lenape words that had been replaced with others that better matched his English 'translation.' In other words, Rafinesque had been translating from English to Lenape, rather than the other way round".&lt;ref name="oestr"/&gt; In general, he found a variety of evidence that the ''Walam Olum'' was not an authentic historical record but was composed by someone having only a slight familiarity with the Lenape language. Oestreicher argued that Rafinesque crafted the linguistic text from specific sources on the Delaware Language published by the American Philosophical Society and elsewhere.  Further, he said that the supposedly "Lenape" pictographs were hybrids from published [[Egypt]]ian, [[China|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] sources.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; 
Barnhart concurs, stating that "the pictographs are in no way comparable to the figures found on the stone carvings or [[petroglyphs]] found in ''[[Lenapehoking]]'', the traditional homeland of the Lenape.&lt;ref&gt;Barton: 140&lt;/ref&gt;  David Oestreicher asserted that the stories were a conglomerate assembled from numerous sources from different cultures that spanned the globe.  Barnhart was of the opinion that Rafinesque created the ''Walam Olum'' in hopes of winning the international ''Prix Volney'' contest hosted in [[Paris]], and Barnhart thought that Rafinesque wanted to prove his long-held theories regarding the peopling of America. Oestreicher’s findings were summarized by Herbert Kraft in his study, "The Lenape-Delaware Indian Heritage: 10,000 BCE to 2000 CE.", and by Jennifer M. Lehmann in "Social Theory as Politics in Knowledge".

Later David Oestreicher wrote that he had received a direct communication from Joe Napora.  Oestreicher wrote that Napora wrote, "[H]e now recognises that the 'Walam Olum' is indeed a hoax...and was dismayed that the sources upon whom he relied had been so negligent in their investigation of the document and that the hoax should have been continued as long as it has".&lt;ref name="oest2"&gt;Oestreicher, "Hoax," pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oestreicher's very detailed analyses have not found a wide audience, but they have made it possible to go a step further, and study the thinking and cultural assumptions of earlier researchers (for example by examining how they treated features of the ''Walam Olum'' which should have been clear evidence that it was a fake).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Walam Olum: An Indigenous Apocrypha and Its Readers|journal=American Literary History|year=2010|first=Andrew|last=Newman|volume=22|issue=1|pages=26–56|doi=10.1093/alh/ajp055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent biography of Rafinesque concluded: "There is now very good reason to believe that he fabricated important data and documents... The most egregious example is the Lenni Lenape migration saga, 'Walam Olum', which has perplexed scholars for one and a half centuries. Rafinesque wrote the 'Walam Olum' believing it to be ''authentic'' because it accorded with his own belief—he was merely recording and giving substance to what must be true. It was a damaging, culpably dishonest act, which misled scholars in search of the real truth, far more damaging than his childish creations, which could be easily dismissed; this was more than mischief."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Leonard. 2005. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/081312316X ''Constantine Samuel Rafinesque: A Voice in the American Wilderness''.] Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2316-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional Lenape believe they have lived in their homeland (that is, in the [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] area) forever. The [[Delaware Tribe of Indians]], located in eastern Oklahoma, originally endorsed the document but withdrew their endorsement on February 11, 1997 after reviewing the evidence.&lt;ref name ="oest2"/&gt; The Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania emphasize their belief that they have been in the area for 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenapenation.org/lenapeculture.html Lenape Nation - A Tribal Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst concluding that the burden of proof lies on those who believe the ''Walam Olum'' to be authentic, Barnhart states that "whatever one's position on the 'Walam Olum', its controversial place in the history of American anthropology is most definitively secured."&lt;ref&gt;Barnheart, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference in literature ==
[[Paula Gunn Allen]]'s poetry collection, ''Shadow Country'', from 1982 contains a reference to the ''Walam Olum''. In Part II of the poem, ''ANOTHER LONG WALK'', it says:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quantify the myths''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''symbolic utterance of the Grandfather (Lenape)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''count    /     years on the Red Score''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''wich does not''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''count for history''&lt;/blockquote&gt;"the Red Score" is the reference, and is also related to the mention of ''[[Lenape]]'' in line 2.
