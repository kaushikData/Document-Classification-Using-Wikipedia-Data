'''AWQAF Africa Muslim Open College''' is an institution of [[AWQAF Africa]]'s educational department.  It was launched in [[London]] 2005 to cater for educational needs of the [[Africa]]ns (including the [[North Africa]]ns) and for people of African origin (e.g. the [[Caribbean]]s).&lt;ref&gt;About Awqaf Africa [http://www.esinislam.com/Awqaf_Africa_Exclusives/Aid_And_Relief/Awqaf_Africa_In_Brief.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
The Muslim Open College was founded while studying [[postgraduate degree]]s in [[Damascus]] early 1990s by founder of Awqaf Africa [[Sheikh Adelabu|Sheikh Abu-Abdullah Adelabu]] ([[Ph.D.]] Damas), a West African Muslim scholar and cleric of [[Nigeria]]n origin who is the international organization's first al Amir (president).&lt;ref&gt;Biography Of Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu [http://www.esinislam.com/Muslim_Biography/Sheikh_Adelabu.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also lectures and supervises on dissertations and publications of his students and followers, including the African Muslim Portals such as [http://www.esinislam.com/ EsinIslam.Com], [http://www.muxlima.Com/ Muxlima.com], and [http://www.islamafrica.com/ IslamAfrica.Com].  Day-to-day activities and management of the College, its lectures, seminals, and administration are run mainly by volunteers and associates of Awqaf Africa in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Origin Of Awqaf Africa [http://www.esinislam.com/AwqafAfrica/Awqaf_Africa_Index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Like its umbrella organization Awqaf Africa, the Muslim Open College is an international organization which is incorporated in its structure with African Hajj and 'Umrah Commission and the African Union Muslim working to relieve human suffering amongst the Muslims of Africa - in particular and as a primary objective - and around the world - as necessary.  It shares the same aims and objectives as Awqaf Africa, especially for Muslim societies where each national society effectuates programmes of Awqaf Africa. Relief, human dignity, and spiritual uplift remain main goals of the international body.&lt;ref&gt;[Delab International Magazine, London August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through education, Awqaf Africa's Open College seeks the causes of suffering, poverty, and [[Islamophobia]] and tries to eliminate them under the banner of Islamic teachings.

==Studies==
The Open College is also projected to provide, in particular, the African Muslims with studies and qualifications that enable them to serve themselves and their Muslim communities, offering them maximum flexibility, so that they can build a program of studies that fits both their personal and community needs and adapt accordingly. Awqaf Africa gives priority to those who serve or intend to serve the Muslim communities through teachings and preachings or administration and career development.&lt;ref&gt;Studying With Awqaf Africa [http://www.esinislam.com/Awqaf_Africa_Exclusives/College/College_1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies at Awqaf Africa Muslim Open College are free, especially for the Africans (including the North Africans) and for people of African Origins (e.g. the Caribbeans) in an effort to help people develop their spiritual uplifts, to become a teacher, to foster their career development for the Muslims, or to serve as a Da^’i, offering them a true learning experience, supporting them as they study their first course with Awqaf Africa and appealing they intend to serve the Muslims and their interests - appreciating that a prospect of studying with Awqaf Africa could be so exciting that students overlook the sacred needs to be devoted to the amiable values of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Why Awqaf Africa [http://www.esinislam.com/Awqaf_Africa_Exclusives/College/College_3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The college coordinates a number of educational and training programmes for several Muslim portals including [http://www.esinislam.com/ EsinIslam.com] and [http://www.islamafrica.com/ IslamAfrica.com].

Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

'''Abu l-Abbas al-Fadl ibn Sahl ibn Zadhanfarukh al-Sarakhsi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو العباس الفضل بن سهل بن زادانفروخ السرخسي}}; ''Abu ’l-ʿAbbās al-Faḍl b. Sahl b.

Sahl, called Dhu'l-Riyasatain...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vizier]] of the [[Abbasid]] era in [[Khurasan]], who served under Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–832). He played a crucial role in the [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] between al-Ma'mun and his brother [[al-Amin]] (r. 809–813), and was the ''de facto'' ruler of the Caliphate until 817.

==Family==
Fadl's father Sahl was a Zoroastrian from [[Kufa]], who later converted to [[Islam]] and joined the [[Barmakids]]. At the urging of Barmakid [[Yahya ibn Khalid]], Fadl also converted to Islam, probably in 806, and entered the service of the Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[al-Ma'mun]].&lt;ref name="EIr"&gt;Bosworth 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Fadl realized very early on that after Harun al-Rashid's death, his throne was disputed between his sons, and urged al-Ma'mun, the son of a Persian concubine, to accompany his father on his expedition to [[Khurasan]], to secure a power-base in Iranian lands. When the arrived events as accurately as Fadl had predicted it, al-Ma'mun made him his chief adviser, and his right hand during the civil war with his brother [[al-Amin]].

==Political career==

After defeating al-Amin, al-Ma'mun became the new Caliph throughout the eastern Islamic world, primarily the Iranian lands, and Fadl was appointed vizier and Emir of these areas. Because of his local role as civil and military leader he received the honorary title of ذو الرئاستين, meaning "the dual leadership of violence".&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;Sourdel 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was rewarded with immense riches and an inheritable estate.&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt; Fadl's brother, [[al-Hasan ibn Sahl]] was also appointed Minister of Finance.&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt;

Even though he emerged victorious during the [[Fourth Fitna]], al-Ma'mun continued to face several revolts and a considerable resistance from the Arab aristocracy, especially in [[Baghdad]] and [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]]. According to the historian [[al-Azraqi]] and [[Ibn Babuya]], Fadl led several campaigns in Khurasan and the neighboring areas, and there the local rulers faced decisive defeats, including the [[Karluks|Karluk Turks]] (whose leaders had to flee) and the [[Kabul Shahi]]. The significance of this victory can hardly be underestimated, since Fadl not only secured the eastern flank of the empire, but also for the influx of new mercenaries and military slaves made for al-Ma'mun's army.

A significant turning point in history of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was the nomination of a Shiite Imam named [[Ali al-Ridha]] as al-Ma'mun's successor. The appointment of Ali al-Ridha as his successor, the general pro-Shiite attitude of the Caliph and the fact that al-Ma'mun continued reside in the [[Merv]], a prominent city populated by [[Persian people|Persians]], and not in the Arab heartland of the Caliphate in [[Iraq]], allowed the enemies of the Caliph, he and his consultants were seen as [[Persophilia|Persophiles]] and branded as "anti-Arab". Fadl was accused of secretly a Shiite takeover of the caliphate and trying to restore the [[Sasanian Empire]]. According to the some sources, Fadl later rejected a large sum of money from the Caliph and resigned from his office to live a quiet and ascetic life.&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt;

==Death==
On 13 February 818, Fadl was mysteriously found dead in a bathroom in [[Sarakhs]], in northern Khurasan. According to various reports, he was circa 41–60 years old when he died. According to some rumors, the caliph himself had ordered his assassination. Within a short time later Ali Al-Ridha was also murdered. Most modern historians agree that it was al-Ma'mun who ordered the death of both men, despite his deep friendship and solidarity to them (with whom he was related by marriage), politics and the unity of the caliphate.&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt;

Fadl was seen as a dynamic, sometimes violent and authoritarian politician, but was not selfish or greedy.

'''Bašmu''' or '''Bashmu''' ([[cuneiform]]: &lt;small&gt;MUŠ.ŠÀ.TÙR&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;MUŠ.ŠÀ.TUR&lt;/small&gt;, {{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Venomous Snake") was an ancient [[Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian mythological]] creature, a horned snake with two forelegs and wings. It was also the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] name of the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] [[constellation]] (&lt;small&gt;MUL.DINGIR.MUŠ&lt;/small&gt;) equivalent to the [[Greek astronomy|Greek]] [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].&lt;ref&gt;Included in the [[MUL.APIN]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] terms ''ušum'' (portrayed with feet, see [[Dragon (Ninurta)|Ninurta's Dragon]]) and ''muš-šà-tùr'' ("birth goddess snake", portrayed without feet) may represent differing iconographic types or different demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts | author = F. A. M. Wiggermann | publisher = Styx Publications | year = 1992 | pages = 166–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first attested by a 22nd-century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} cylinder inscription at [[Gudea]].

==Mythology==
In the [[Angim]], or "[[Ninurta]]'s return to [[Nippur]]", it was identified as one of the eleven "warriors" (''ur-sag'') defeated by Ninurta. Bašmu was created in the sea and was "sixty double-miles long", according to a fragmentary Assyrian myth&lt;ref&gt;KAR 6, ii 26.&lt;/ref&gt; which recounts that it devoured fish, birds, wild [[Onager|ass]]es, and men, securing the disapproval of the gods who sent [[Nergal]] or Palil ("snake charmer") to vanquish it. It was one of the eleven monsters created by [[Tiamat]] in the ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' creation myth. It had "six mouths, seven tongues and seven ...-s on its belly".&lt;ref&gt;''sebe'', CAD S, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1026-Tomb-of-the-Boy-Bishop-q75-547x1217.jpg|Tomb of the Boy bishop, [[Salisbury]] (Wiltshire, England)|thumb]]

'''Boy bishop''' was a name given to a custom very widespread in the [[Middle Ages]], whereby a boy was chosen, for example among cathedral [[chorister]]s, to parody the real [[bishop]], commonly on the feast of [[Holy Innocents]]. This custom was linked with others, such as that of the [[Feast of Fools]] and the [[Feast of the Ass|Feast of Asses]].

==History==
[[File:Boy bishop.jpg|thumb|19th century depiction of a medieval boy bishop, attended by his [[Canon (priest)|canons]]]]

In England the boy bishop was elected on 6 December, the feast of [[Saint Nicholas]], the patron of children, and his authority lasted till [[Holy Innocents]]' day (28 December).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The real Bishop would, symbolically, step down at the ''deposuit potentes de sede'' of the [[Magnificat]] ("he hath put down the mighty from their seat"), and the boy would take his seat at ''et exaltavit humiles'' ("and hath exalted the humble and meek").

After the election, the boy was dressed in full bishop's robes with [[mitre]] and [[crozier]] and, attended by comrades dressed as priests, made a circuit of the town blessing the people. Typically the chosen boy and his colleagues took possession of the [[cathedral]] and performed all the ceremonies and offices, except [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Originally, it seems, confined to the cathedrals, the custom spread to many parishes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Notwithstanding the intervention of various Church authorities (see [[Feast of Fools]]), the popularity of the custom made it resilient. In England it was abolished by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1542, revived by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in 1552 and finally abolished by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. On the continent of Europe it survived longest in [[Germany]], in the so-called {{Interlanguage link multi|Gregoriusfest|de}}, said to have been founded by [[Pope Gregory IV|Gregory IV]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The custom has given rise to some popular misconceptions, however, one of which is the traditional misidentification of a miniature episcopal tomb effigy at Salisbury as a boy bishop: this is more likely to commemorate a secondary burial (heart or viscera) of a real bishop.

==Revivals==
There have been some recent revivals both in the English-speaking world and on the continent. Most famous perhaps is that of [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]], revived in 1973 for a special children's service, with full and traditional ceremonies following annually since 1982.  The Boy Bishop preaches a sermon and leads prayers at various [[Diocese|Diocesan]] Advent services. A single revival took place in 1959 at St. George's Parish Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stgeorgestockport.org.uk/stgeorgesheaviley.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324140231/http://www.stgeorgestockport.org.uk/stgeorgesheaviley.htm |date=March 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stockport]]. Such ceremonies are now also found at [[Westminster Cathedral]], [[Salisbury Cathedral]], and a number of parish churches throughout England, including [[All Saints' Church, Northampton]], [[Claines]], Worcestershire, and also St Christopher's Parish Church, Bournemouth, (early 1950s), where the Boy Bishop was installed on St Christopher's Day, (July 25), and 'reigned' for one year, preaching and 'presiding' at youth events. The market town of Alcester, Warwickshire has its very own [http://www.stnicholasnight.org St Nicholas night] complete with the Boy Bishop on 6 December each year. 

The custom was likewise revived in [[Burgos]], [[Spain]], where the boy-bishop feast had been extremely popular before the [[Cathedral of Burgos|cathedral]] [[choir]] was closed in the 1930s. After its re-establishment, the boy bishop was revived in 1987, and has since been celebrated every year.&lt;ref&gt;Validivieso Arce, Jaime L. (1998). «La antigua fiesta infantil del Obispillo en Burgos». Revista de Folklore (Fundación Joaquín Díaz. Caja España) 18b (212):  pp. 58-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Spanish cities such as [[Palencia]] also hold the ceremony,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/agencias/efe/281439/el-obispillo-de-palencia-el-mas-antiguo-de-espana-recupera-su-tradicion |title=El "Obispillo" de Palencia, el más antiguo de España, recupera su tradición - Público.es |publisher=Publico.es |date=2009-12-28 |accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that carried on in the Monastery of Montserrat by [[L'Escolania]] is especially renowned.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (1998).

Siglo XXI de España Editores. pp. 91-92. {{ISBN|978-84-323-0969-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was also revived in [[Chavagnes International College]], a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] boarding school in [[France]].

In the [[United States]], one of the first adoptions of the custom took place in 1979 at the [[Cathedral of All Saints, Albany, New York|Cathedral of All Saints]] (Episcopal) in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as part of an annual medieval fair held in the great Gothic-revival style church.

In December 2009, a teenage girl from Wellingborough England was appointed Britain's first girl bishop at All Saints Church in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/new-eve-for-church-as-child-is-made-bishop-1-744539|title = New Eve for church as child is made 'bishop'|date = 7 December 2009|work = morthantstelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 the festival will be revived in Durham, which uniquely used to appoint two boy bishops who officiated in spring rather than winter. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of Early English Drama Northeast|url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/reed.ne/?page_id=1236|access-date=13 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032110/http://community.dur.ac.uk/reed.ne/?page_id=1236#|archive-date=17 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Byzantine culture}}
'''Byzantine art''' refers to the body of Christian Greek artistic products of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] (Byzantine) Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelis|1946}}; {{harvnb|Weitzmann|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the nations and states that inherited culturally from the empire. Though the empire itself emerged from Rome's decline and lasted until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitzinger|1977|pp=1‒3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history, if still imprecise. Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward.

A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]], which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century, and the [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century. Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence, such as [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. After the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] in 1453, art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

==Introduction==
[[File:Encaustic Virgin.jpg|thumb|200px|Icon of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Sinai]]

Byzantine art originated and evolved from the Christianized Greek culture of the Eastern Roman Empire; content from both Christianity and classical Greek mythology were artistically expressed through Hellenistic modes of style and iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelis|1946}}; {{harvnb|Ainalov|1961|loc="Introduction", pp. 3‒8}}; {{harvnb|Stylianou|Stylianou|1985|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Hanfmann|1962|loc="Early Christian Sculpture", p. 42}}; {{harvnb|Weitzmann|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of Byzantium never lost sight of its classical heritage; the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], was adorned with a large number of classical sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although they eventually became an object of some puzzlement for its inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cyril|1965|pp=53‒75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (however, Byzantine beholders showed no signs of puzzlement towards other forms of classical media such as wall paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ainalov|1961|loc="The Hellenistic Character of Byzantine Wall Painting", pp. 185‒214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The basis of Byzantine art is a fundamental artistic attitude held by the Byzantine Greeks who, like their ancient Greek predecessors, "were never satisfied with a play of forms alone, but stimulated by an innate rationalism, endowed forms with life by associating them with a meaningful content."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weitzmann|1981|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the art produced in the Byzantine Empire was marked by periodic revivals of a classical aesthetic, it was above all marked by the development of a new aesthetic defined by its salient "abstract", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach.

[[File:Byzantine - Saint Arethas - Walters 4820862.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] Saint Arethas depicted in traditional Byzantine style (10th century)]]

The nature and causes of this transformation, which largely took place during [[late antiquity]], have been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brendel|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Vasari]] attributed it to a decline in artistic skills and standards, which had in turn been revived by his contemporaries in the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Although this point of view has been occasionally revived, most notably by [[Bernard Berenson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berenson|1954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; modern scholars tend to take a more positive view of the Byzantine aesthetic. [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]], writing in the early 20th century, were above all responsible for the revaluation of late antique art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsner|2002|pp=358‒379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Riegl saw it as a natural development of pre-existing tendencies in Roman art, whereas Strzygowski viewed it as a product of "oriental" influences. Notable recent contributions to the debate include those of [[Ernst Kitzinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitzinger|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who traced a "dialectic" between "abstract" and "Hellenistic" tendencies in late antiquity, and [[John Onians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onians|1980|pp=1‒23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who saw an "increase in visual response" in late antiquity, through which a viewer "could look at something which was in twentieth-century terms purely abstract and find it representational."

In any case, the debate is purely modern: it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As [[Cyril Mango]] has observed, "our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of [[Phidias]], [[Apelles]], and [[Zeuxis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|1963|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister von Nerezi 001.jpg|thumb|260px|Frescoes in Nerezi near [[Skopje]] (1164), with their unique blend of high tragedy, gentle humanity, and homespun realism, anticipate the approach of [[Giotto]] and other proto-Renaissance Italian artists.]]

The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople. These preoccupations are partly a result of the pious and autocratic nature of Byzantine society, and partly a result of its economic structure: the wealth of the empire was concentrated in the hands of the church and the imperial office, which had the greatest opportunity to undertake monumental artistic commissions.

Religious art was not, however, limited to the monumental decoration of church interiors. One of the most important genres of Byzantine art was the [[icon]], an image of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint, used as an object of veneration in Orthodox churches and private homes alike. Icons were more religious than aesthetic in nature: especially after the end of iconoclasm, they were understood to manifest the unique "presence" of the figure depicted by means of a "likeness" to that figure maintained through carefully maintained canons of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belting|Jephcott|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination of manuscripts was another major genre of Byzantine art. The most commonly illustrated texts were religious, both scripture itself (particularly the Psalms) and devotional or theological texts (such as the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[John Climacus]] or the homilies of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]). Secular texts were also illuminated: important examples include the [[Alexander Romance]] and the history of [[John Skylitzes]].

The Byzantines inherited the [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] distrust of [[monumental sculpture]] in religious art, and produced only [[relief]]s, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from [[Carolingian art]] onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief.

The so-called "minor arts" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation [[Consular diptych]]s or caskets such as the [[Veroli casket]], [[hardstone carving]]s, [[Byzantine enamel|enamels]], [[Byzantine glass|glass]], jewelry, metalwork, and [[Byzantine silk|figured silks]] were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off [[Byzantine silver]].

==Periods==
[[File:Abside 00311.JPG|thumb|180px|Interior of the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda#Rotunda of Galerius|Rotunda of St. George]], [[Thessaloniki]], with remnants of the mosaics]]

Byzantine art and architecture is divided into four periods by convention: the Early period, commencing with the [[Edict of Milan]] (when Christian worship was legitimized) and the transfer of the imperial seat to Constantinople, extends to AD 842, with the conclusion of [[Iconoclasm]]; the Middle, or high period, begins with the restoration of the icons in 843 and culminates in the Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204; the Late period includes the eclectic osmosis between Western European and traditional Byzantine elements in art and architecture, and ends with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The term post-Byzantine is then used for later years, whereas "Neo-Byzantine" is used for art and architecture from the 19th century onwards, when the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire prompted a renewed appreciation of Byzantium by artists and historians alike.

[[File:IvoireJeuxCirqueConstantinopleMuséeCluny.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Leaf from an ivory diptych of [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus]], consul in Constantinople, 506. Areobindus is shown above, presiding over the games in the Hippodrome, depicted beneath ([[Musée national du Moyen Âge]])]]

Two events were of fundamental importance to the development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the [[Edict of Milan]], issued by the emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led to the development of a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of [[Constantinople]] in 330 created a great new artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], and [[Rome]], but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the [[Arabs]] and Rome to the [[Goths]] - that Constantinople established its supremacy.

Constantine devoted great effort to the decoration of Constantinople, adorning its public spaces with ancient statuary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and building a [[Forum of Constantine|forum]] dominated by a porphyry column that carried a statue of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowden|1991|pp=119‒131}}; {{harvnb|Bauer|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1971}}; {{harvnb|Henck|2001|pp=279‒304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major building campaign in Constantinople was sponsored by [[Theodosius I]]. The most important surviving monument of this period is the obelisk and base erected by Theodosius in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kiilerich|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the large silver dish called the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]], represents the classic examples of what is sometimes called the "Theodosian Renaissance". The earliest surviving church in Constantinople is the Basilica of St. John at the [[Stoudios]] Monastery, built in the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RabulaGospelsFol13vAscension.jpg|thumb|200px|Miniatures of the 6th-century [[Rabula Gospel]] (a Byzantine Syriac Gospel) display the more abstract and symbolic nature of Byzantine art.]]

Due to subsequent rebuilding and destruction, relatively few Constantinopolitan monuments of this early period survive. However, the development of monumental early Byzantine art can still be traced through surviving structures in other cities. For example, important early churches are found in Rome (including [[Santa Sabina]] and [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Thessaloniki]] (the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Rotunda]] and the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos|Acheiropoietos Basilica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spieser|1984}}; {{harvnb|Ćurčić|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important illuminated manuscripts, both sacred and secular, survive from this early period. Classical authors, including [[Virgil]] (represented by the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vergilius Romanus]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Homer]] (represented by the [[Ambrosian Iliad]]), were illustrated with narrative paintings. Illuminated biblical manuscripts of this period survive only in fragments: for example, the [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] is a small portion of what must have been a lavishly illustrated copy of [[1 Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levin|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of [[ivory carving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volbach|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory [[diptych]]s, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed [[consul]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delbrueck|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver plates were another important form of luxury art:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; among the most lavish from this period is the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Almagro-Gorbea|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarcophagi]] continued to be produced in great numbers.

===Age of Justinian I===
[[File:The mosaic of Emperor Justinian and his retinue.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Mosaic from San Vitale in [[Ravenna]], showing the Emperor [[Justinian]] and Bishop Maximian, surrounded by clerics and soldiers.]]
[[File:Byzantine ivory 801.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Archangel ivory]] of the early 6th century from Constantinople]]

Significant changes in Byzantine art coincided with the reign of [[Justinian I]] (527–565). Justinian devoted much of his reign to reconquering Italy, North Africa and Spain. He also laid the foundations of the imperial absolutism of the Byzantine state, codifying its laws and imposing his religious views on all his subjects by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maas|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant component of Justinian's project of imperial renovation was a massive building program, which was described in a book, the ''Buildings'', written by Justinian's court historian, [[Procopius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tr. H.B. Dewing, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Buildings/home.html  Procopius VII]'' (Cambridge, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian renovated, rebuilt, or founded anew countless churches within Constantinople, including [[Hagia Sophia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mainstone|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been destroyed during the [[Nika riots]], the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dark|Özgümüş|2002|pp=393‒413}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bardill|2000|pp=1‒11}}; {{harvnb|Mathews|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian also built a number of churches and fortifications outside of the imperial capital, including [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forsyth|Weitzmann|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Basilica of St. John in [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thiel|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major churches of this period were built in the provinces by local bishops in imitation of the new Constantinopolitan foundations. The [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], was built by Bishop [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximianus]]. The decoration of San Vitale includes important mosaics of Justinian and his empress, [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], although neither ever visited the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deichmann|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of note is the [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Poreč]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickerson.icomos.org/euf/euf-idx.htm Eufrasiana Basilica Project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries unearthed a large group of [[Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East]]. The eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Christian mosaic art flourished in this area from the 4th century onwards. The tradition of making mosaics was carried on in the [[Umayyad]] era until the end of the 8th century. The most important surviving examples are the [[Madaba Map]], the mosaics of [[Mount Nebo]], Saint Catherine's Monastery and the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]).

The first fully preserved illuminated biblical manuscripts date to the first half of the sixth century, most notably the [[Vienna Genesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wellesz|1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rossano Gospels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavallo|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sinope Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grabar|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Dioscurides]] is a lavishly illustrated botanical treatise, presented as a gift to the Byzantine aristocrat [[Julia Anicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazal|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important ivory sculptures of this period include the [[Barberini ivory]], which probably depicts Justinian himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cutler|1993|pp=329‒339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Archangel ivory]] in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1986|pp=75‒79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver plate continued to be decorated with scenes drawn from classical mythology; for example, a [[:Image:Hercule et le Lion de Némée 01.JPG|plate]] preserved in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris, depicts [[Hercules]] wrestling the [[Nemean lion]].

===Seventh-century crisis===
[[File:Meister der Demetrius-Kirche in Saloniki 002.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic from the church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] in [[Thessaloniki]], late 7th or early 8th century, showing [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrios]] with the bishop and the eparch]]
The Age of Justinian was followed by a political decline, since most of Justinian's conquests were lost and the Empire faced acute crisis with the invasions of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Slavs]], Persians&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persians"; link to a specific iteration of this topic. --&gt; and [[Arabs]] in the 7th century. Constantinople was also wracked by religious and political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant surviving monumental projects of this period were undertaken outside of the imperial capital. The church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] in Thessaloniki was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-seventh century. The new sections include mosaics executed in a remarkably abstract style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubaker|2004|pp=63‒90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of the Koimesis in Nicaea (present-day [[Iznik]]), destroyed in the early 20th century but documented through photographs, demonstrates the simultaneous survival of a more classical style of church decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1991|pp=43‒60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The churches of Rome, still a Byzantine territory in this period, also include important surviving decorative programs, especially [[Santa Maria Antiqua]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]], and the Chapel of San Venanzio in [[San Giovanni in Laterano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthiae|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine mosaicists probably also contributed to the decoration of the early [[Umayyad]] monuments, including the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Creswell|1969}}; {{harvnb|Flood|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important works of luxury art from this period include the silver [[David Plates]], produced during the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]], and depicting scenes from the life of the Hebrew king [[David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leader|2000|pp=407‒427}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable surviving manuscripts are [[Syriac language|Syriac]] gospel books, such as the so-called [[Syriac Bible of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leroy|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[London Canon Tables]] bear witness to the continuing production of lavish gospel books in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nordenfalk|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between Justinian and iconoclasm saw major changes in the social and religious roles of images within Byzantium. The veneration of [[acheiropoieta]], or holy images "not made by human hands," became a significant phenomenon, and in some instances these images were credited with saving cities from military assault. By the end of the seventh century, certain images of saints had come to be viewed as "windows" through which one could communicate with the figure depicted. [[Proskynesis]] before images is also attested in texts from the late seventh century. These developments mark the beginnings of a theology of [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubaker|1998|pp=1215‒1254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the debate over the proper role of art in the decoration of churches intensified. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/trullo.html Three canons] of the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 addressed controversies in this area: prohibition of the representation of the cross on church pavements (Canon 73), prohibition of the representation of Christ as a lamb (Canon 82), and a general injunction against "pictures, whether they are in paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the mind, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures" (Canon 100).

===Crisis of iconoclasm===
{{Main|Byzantine iconoclasm}}
[[File:Helios in His Chariot.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Helios]] in his chariot, surrounded by symbols of the months and of the zodiac. From Vat. Gr. 1291, the "Handy Tables" of [[Ptolemy]], produced during the reign of [[Constantine V]]]]

Intense debate over the role of art in worship led eventually to the period of "[[Byzantine iconoclasm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryer|Herrin|1977}}; {{harvnb|Brubaker|Haldon|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic outbreaks of iconoclasm on the part of local bishops are attested in Asia Minor during the 720s. In 726, an underwater earthquake between the islands of Thera and Therasia was interpreted by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] as a sign of God's anger, and may have led Leo to remove a famous icon of Christ from the [[Chalke Gate]] outside the imperial palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1980}}; The story of the Chalke Icon may be a later invention: {{harvnb|Auzépy|1990|pp=445‒492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, iconoclasm probably did not become imperial policy until the reign of Leo's son, [[Constantine V]]. The [[Council of Hieria]], convened under Constantine in 754, proscribed the manufacture of icons of Christ. This inaugurated the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic period]], which lasted, with interruptions, until 843.

While iconoclasm severely restricted the role of religious art, and led to the removal of some earlier apse mosaics and (possibly) the sporadic destruction of portable icons, it never constituted a total ban on the production of figural art. Ample literary sources indicate that secular art (i.e. hunting scenes and depictions of the games in the hippodrome) continued to be produced,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grabar|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the few monuments that can be securely dated to the period (most notably the manuscript of Ptolemy's "Handy Tables" today held by the Vatican&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1985|pp=355‒362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) demonstrate that metropolitan artists maintained a high quality of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryer|Herrin|1977|loc=Robin Cormack, "The Arts during the Age of Iconoclasm"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major churches dating to this period include [[Hagia Irene|Hagia Eirene]] in Constantinople, which was rebuilt in the 760s following its destruction by an earthquake in 740. The interior of Hagia Eirene, which is dominated by a large mosaic cross in the apse, is one of the best-preserved examples of iconoclastic church decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peschlow|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki was also rebuilt in the late 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theocharidou|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain churches built outside of the empire during this period, but decorated in a figural, "Byzantine," style, may also bear witness to the continuing activities of Byzantine artists. Particularly important in this regard are the original mosaics of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] (since either destroyed or heavily restored) and the frescoes in the Church of Maria foris portas in [[Castelseprio]].

===Macedonian art===
{{Main|Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian Renaissance}}
[[File:Nea Moni 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mosaics of [[Nea Moni of Chios]] (11th century)]]
[[File:Relieftafel 40 Märtyrer von Sebaste Bodemuseum.jpg|thumb|180px|An example of Macedonian-era ivorywork from Constantinople: the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]], now in the [[Bode Museum]], [[Berlin]]]]

The rulings of the Council of Hieria were reversed by a new church council in 843, celebrated to this day in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the "Triumph of Orthodoxy." In 867, the installation of a new apse mosaic in Hagia Sophia depicting the Virgin and Child was celebrated by the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]] in a famous homily as a victory over the evils of iconoclasm. Later in the same year, the Emperor [[Basil I]], called "the Macedonian," acceded to the throne; as a result the following period of Byzantine art has sometimes been called the "[[Macedonian Renaissance]]", although the term is doubly problematic (it was neither "[[Macedonia (terminology)|Macedonian]]", nor, strictly speaking, a "[[Renaissance]]").

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Empire's military situation improved, and patronage of art and architecture increased. New churches were commissioned, and the standard architectural form (the "[[cross-in-square]]") and decorative scheme of the Middle Byzantine church were standardised. Major surviving examples include [[Hosios Loukas]] in [[Boeotia]], the [[Daphni Monastery]] near [[Athens]] and [[Nea Moni]] on [[Chios]].

There was a revival of interest in the depiction of subjects from classical mythology (as on the Veroli Casket) and in the use of a "classical" style to depict religious, and particularly Old Testament, subjects (of which the [[Paris Psalter]] and the [[Joshua Roll]] are important examples).

The Macedonian period also saw a revival of the late antique technique of [[ivory]] carving. Many ornate ivory [[triptych]]s and [[diptych]]s survive, such as the [[Harbaville Triptych]] and a triptych at [[Luton Hoo]], dating from the reign of [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]].

===Komnenian age===
[[File:Anastasi Dafnis.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic of [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]

The Macedonian emperors were followed by the [[Comnenus|Komnenian dynasty]], beginning with the reign of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1081. Byzantium had recently suffered a period of severe dislocation following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor to the Turks. However, the Komnenoi brought stability to the empire (1081–1185) and during the course of the twelfth century their energetic campaigning did much to restore the fortunes of the empire. The Komnenoi were great patrons of the arts, and with their support Byzantine artists continued to move in the direction of greater humanism and emotion, of which the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], the cycle of mosaics at [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]], and the murals at [[Church of St. Panteleimon (Nerezi)|Nerezi]] yield important examples. Ivory sculpture and other expensive mediums of art gradually gave way to frescoes and icons, which for the first time gained widespread popularity across the Empire. Apart from painted icons, there were other varieties - notably the mosaic and [[ceramic]] ones.

Some of the finest Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Kiev]], [[Torcello]], [[Venice]], [[Monreale]], [[Cefalù]] and [[Palermo]]. For instance, Venice's [[San Marco di Venezia|Basilica of St Mark]], begun in 1063, was based on the great [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an echo of the age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the basilica is also a great museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., [[Pala d'Oro]]).

Centuries of continuous Roman political tradition and Hellenistic civilization underwent a crisis in 1204 with the sacking of Constantinople by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Kingdom of France|French]] knights of the [[Fourth Crusade]], a disaster from which the Empire recovered in 1261 albeit in a severely weakened state. Steven Runciman, a noted 20th-century historian of the Crusades, would write in 1954: "There was never a greater crime against humanity than the Fourth Crusade."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction by sack or subsequent neglect of the city's secular architecture in particular has left us with an imperfect understanding of Byzantine art.

Although the Byzantines regained the city in 1261, the Empire was thereafter a small and weak state confined to the Greek peninsula and the islands of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  During their half-century of exile, however, the last great flowing of Anatolian Hellenism began. As [[Nicaea]] emerged as the center of opposition under the [[Laskaris]] emperors, it spawned a renaissance, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from across the Byzantine world.  A glittering court emerged as the dispossessed intelligentsia found in the Hellenic side of their traditions a pride and identity unsullied by association with the hated "latin" enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ash|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recapture of the capital under the new [[Palaeologus|Palaeologan Dynasty]], Byzantine artists developed a new interest in landscapes and pastoral scenes, and the traditional mosaic-work (of which the [[Chora Church]] in [[Constantinople]] is the finest extant example) gradually gave way to detailed cycles of narrative frescoes (as evidenced in a large group of [[Mystras]] churches). The icons, which became a favoured medium for artistic expression, were characterized by a less austere attitude, new appreciation for purely decorative qualities of painting and meticulous attention to details, earning the popular name of the Paleologan Mannerism for the period in general.

[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] came to control [[Byzantine Crete]] by 1212, and Byzantine artistic traditions continued long after the Ottoman conquest of the [[Empire of Trebizond|last Byzantine successor state]] in 1461. The [[Cretan school]], as it is today known, gradually introduced Western elements into its style, and exported large numbers of icons to the West. The tradition's most famous artist was [[El Greco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Byron |author-link=Robert Byron |title=Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture |pages=160–174 |magazine=[[The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]] |volume=55 |issue=319 |date=October 1929 |jstor=864104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Angelo G. |last=Procopiou |title=El Greco and Cretan Painting |page=74 |magazine=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=94 |issue=588 |date=March 1952 |jstor=870678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Veneza118.jpg|thumb|[[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]], where imported Byzantine mosaicists were succeeded by Italians they had trained]]
[[File:Mural - Birth of Christ.jpg|thumb|Modern Orthodox mural from [[Israel]] using a depiction of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]] little changed in over a millennium]]

The splendour of Byzantine art was always in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most important movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit to stand next to both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]].  Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, and reached for example the royal [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Sutton Hoo burial]] in [[Suffolk]] of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. [[Byzantine silk]]s were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople.  There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at [[Castelseprio]] and miniatures in the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]], seem to have been produced by such figures.

In particular, teams of [[mosaic]] artists were dispatched as diplomatic gestures by emperors to Italy, [[Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy|where they often trained locals]] to continue their work in a style heavily influenced by Byzantium. [[Venice]] and [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman Sicily]] were particular centres of Byzantine influence. The earliest surviving panel paintings in the West were in a style heavily influenced by contemporary Byzantine icons, until a distinctive Western style began to develop in Italy in the [[Trecento]]; the traditional and still influential narrative of [[Vasari]] and others has the story of Western painting begin as a breakaway by [[Cimabue]] and then [[Giotto]] from the shackles of the Byzantine tradition.  In general, Byzantine artistic influence on Europe was in steep decline by the 14th century if not earlier, despite the continued importance of migrated [[Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance]] in other areas.

[[Islamic art]] began with artists and craftsmen mostly trained in Byzantine styles, and though figurative content was greatly reduced, Byzantine decorative styles remained a great influence on Islamic art, and Byzantine artists continued to be imported for important works for some time, especially for [[mosaic]]s.

The Byzantine era properly defined came to an end with the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, but by this time the Byzantine cultural heritage had been widely diffused, carried by the spread of Orthodox Christianity, to [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and, most importantly, to [[Russia]], which became the centre of the Orthodox world following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Even under Ottoman rule, Byzantine traditions in icon-painting and other small-scale arts survived, especially in the Venetian-ruled Crete and [[Rhodes]], where a "post-Byzantine" style under increasing Western influence survived for a further two centuries, producing artists including [[El Greco]] whose training was in the [[Cretan School]] which was the most vigorous post-Byzantine school, exporting great numbers of icons to Europe. The willingness of the Cretan School to accept Western influence was atypical; in most of the post-Byzantine world "as an instrument of ethnic cohesiveness, art became assertively conservative during the ''Turcocratia''" (period of Ottoman rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|1988|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian icon]] painting began by entirely adopting and imitating Byzantine art, as did the art of other Orthodox nations, and has remained extremely conservative in iconography, although its painting style has developed distinct characteristics, including influences from post-Renaissance Western art.  All the Eastern Orthodox churches have retained highly protective of their traditions in terms of the form and content of images and, for example, modern Orthodox [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Christ]] vary little in content from those developed in the 6th century.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ripoll was a soldier in the Spanish army during the [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814). He was captured by French forces and was a prisoner of war. While being held by the French he was taken to France and there he became aware of deism. He soon became a deist.&lt;ref name = "MartyrForDeism"&gt;

Upon returning to Spain, he used his position as a school master to teach others about deism. There he was soon accused by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of being a deist and of teaching his students about deism. He was later arrested for heresy and held in jail for close to two years.

==Accusation==
The Chairman of the Board of Faith from the Diocese of Valencia, Miguel Toranzo, an inquisitor, sent to the  [[nuncio]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Valencia]] a report that said Ripoll did not believe in [[Jesus Christ]], in the mystery of the [[Trinity]], in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[God the Son]], in the Holy [[Eucharist]], in the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], in the [[Gospel|Holy Gospels]], in the [[Infallibility of the Church|infallibility of the Holy Catholic Church]], or in the [[Apostolic succession|Apostolic Roman Congregation]].  Ripoll did not fulfill his [[Easter#Western Christianity 2|Easter duty]], he discouraged children from reciting the  '[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria Purisima]]' and suggested they need not bother making the [[sign of the cross]].  It was alleged that, according to Ripoll, it was not necessary to hear [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in order to save one's [[Soul#Christianity|soul]] from [[Damnation#Christianity|damnation]], and he failed to instruct them to give due reverence to the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church]], even  the ''[[Viaticum]]'' administered for the comfort of the sick and to pardon the dying that they might be [[Resurrection|resurrected]] into [[Heaven#Christianity|heaven]].

==Sentence==
For these grievous sins and his denial of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] the clergymen of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] demanded Ripoll be [[Death by burning#Spanish Inquisition against Moriscos and Marranos|burned at the stake]] for his [[religious offense]]s in order that he might recant in his agony and thus go to heaven. However, the [[civil authority]] chose to [[hanging|hang]] him instead.

Allegedly, the Church authorities, upset that Ripoll had not been burned at the stake, placed his body into a barrel, painted flames on the barrel and buried it in [[unconsecrated ground]]. Other reports state that the Church authorities placed his body into a barrel and burned the barrel, throwing the ashes into a river.&lt;ref name = "MartyrForDeism" /&gt;  Ripoll is recorded as being the last known person to have been executed under sentence from a Church authority for having committed the act of heresy.

Ripoll's famous last words were, "I die reconciled to God and to man."&lt;ref name="ChurchHistory"&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2195">'''Emancipation of Labour group''' (Освобождение труда) was the first [[Russia]]n [[Marxist]] group. Founded by [[Georgi Plekhanov]], Vasily Ignatov, [[Vera Zasulich]], [[Leo Deutsch]], and [[Pavel Axelrod]] in [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]) in 1883. Leo Deutsch left the group in 1884 when he was arrested and sent to Siberia. [[Sergey Ingerman]] joined the group at 1888. The group did a great deal to translate [[Marxist]] works into [[Russian language|Russian]] and distribute them, and later became the major adversary to the ideology of [[Narodism]]. 

Two drafts (1883 and 1885) of a program for the Russian [[Social Democrats]] were written by Plekhanov and published by the group, marking an important step to what would become the building of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). From the first congress of the [[Second International (politics)|Second International]] in [[Paris]] (1889) onwards, the group represented Russian Social-Democrats. 

The Emancipation of Labour group announced its dissolution during the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|second congress of the RSDLP]], on August 1903.

[[Lenin]] later wrote that the group "laid the theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and took the first step towards the working-class movement in Russia." The group was later followed by the  [[League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]] (Союз борьбы за освобождение рабочего класса).

[[File:Franek Kluski medium.jpg|thumb|right|Kluski with cloth phantom.]]
'''Franek Kluski''', real name '''Teofil Modrzejewski''' (1873-1943), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Mediumship|medium]].

==Career==
[[File:Franek Kluski mold.png|thumb|left|Hand mould from a Kluski seance.]]

Kluski was born in [[Warsaw]]. According to [[French people|French]] [[paranormal|psychical]] researcher [[Gustav Geley]], Kluski's claimed psychic powers manifested themselves during childhood and after undergoing a psychological change he became ''Franek Kluski''. Kluski's powers during [[séance]]s were said to include physical manifestation of human limbs and various animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Geley|Geley, Gustav]]; [[Stanley De Brath|Brath, Stanley De]]. (2003). ''Clairvoyance and Materialization''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0766163140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 8 November and 31 December 1920, Geley of the [[Institute Metapsychique International]] attended fourteen séances with Kluski in [[Paris]]. A bowl of hot paraffin was placed in the room and according to Kluski spirits dipped their limbs into the [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] and then into a bath of water to materialize. Three other series of séances were held in Warsaw in Kluski's own apartment, these took place over a period of three years. Kluski was not searched in any of the séances. Photographs of the moulds were obtained during the four series of experiments and were published by Geley in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Chéroux, Clément. (2005). ''The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult''. Yale University Press. p. 268. {{ISBN|978-0300111361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics have pointed out that the experiments were not conducted in fraud proof conditions and the moulds could have easily been produced by fraudulent techniques.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2003"&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]]. (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''. Prometheus Books. pp. 168-176. {{ISBN|978-1591020868}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Geley has been described as an unreliable investigator. Physician [[Antônio da Silva Mello]] noted that Geley "published many writings on ectoplasms and teleplastic phenomena, things which today are quite out of date and totally discredited."&lt;ref&gt;[[Antônio da Silva Mello|Mello, Antônio da Silva]]. (1960). ''Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Magicians have been able to easily replicate the "[[materialization (paranormal)|materialization]]" moulds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lycett|Lycett, Andrew]]. (2007). ''The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle''. Free Press. p. 433. {{ISBN|978-0743275231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magician [[Carlos María de Heredia]] revealed how fake materialization hands could be made by using a rubber glove, paraffin and a jar of cold water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos María de Heredia|Heredia, Carlos María De]]. (1923). [https://books.google.com/books?id=FNoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA14&amp;dq=Heredia+spirit+hands&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EIJ0UdS2ArCX0QXYp4CoCw&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Heredia%20spirit%20hands&amp;f=false ''Spirit Hands, "ectoplasm," and Rubber Gloves'']. ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Geley and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] objected to the medium having used a rubber glove. In response, [[Harry Houdini]] demonstrated that a glove was not needed as he replicated the Kluski materialization moulds by using his hands and a bowl of hot paraffin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]]. (2001). ''Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. pp. 71-73. {{ISBN|978-1573928960}} "At the time Houdini didn't press the argument further, but later on, experimenting with paraffin, he found no artifice was needed to duplicate Kluski's moulds. As a series of pictures for a newspaper of the time shows, he immersed his hand in the hot paraffin, let it dry, and then carefully removed the hand from it. When one experiments with this technique, one realizes that it is not the plaster cast that has to be removed from the thin wax mould, which would be impossible to do without breaking the mould. One almost forgets that what has to be removed is the living hand, possibly the best-suited object to slip out of a mould without damaging it. In fact, a real hand is even more effective than any other artifice dreamed up to substitute for it. First, the paraffin doesn't stick to skin, only to quite long hair. Nonetheless, if one moves the fingers very slowly, one will realize that every small bit one pulls out will gradually allow the rest of the hand to be removed; that's similar to what happens when one pulls off a tight glove."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry Price]] wrote regarding Kluski "His mediumship is unsatisfactory from the point of view that no scientific body has investigated the alleged miracles. On each of my two visits to Warsaw I attempted to obtain sittings with Kluski, without results."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (2003). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0766142428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have compared Kluski's mediumship to the medium [[Eva Carrière]] and have speculated that he introduced items in the séance room by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Franklyn, Julian. (2003). ''A Survey of the Occult''. p. 381. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0766130074}}&lt;/ref&gt; A psychical researcher sent a letter to [[Hereward Carrington]] claiming Kluski had been detected in fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington|Carrington, Hereward]]. (1988). ''Letters to Hereward Carrington from Famous Psychical Researchers''. Society of Metaphysicians. p. 89. {{ISBN|978-1852287986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massimo Polidoro]] and Luigi Garlaschelli have produced wax-moulds directly from one's hand which were exactly the same copies as Geley obtained from Kluski, which are kept at the Institute Metapsychique International.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2003"/&gt;

==Fraud incident==

In a notable incident during a séance that Paul Heuze attended the medium was requested to produce a face impression. However, a large-sized [[buttocks]] impression was found in the wax.&lt;ref name="Mello 1960"&gt;[[Antônio da Silva Mello|Mello, Antônio da Silva]]. (1960). ''Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged by a séance sitter that "Kluski dropped... his pants and placed his buttocks in the paraffin".&lt;ref&gt;Brower, M. Brady. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 171. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Heuze believed the impression was Kluski's. This was later confirmed as it was discovered that Kluski had suffered from a burnt buttocks for many days after the incident.&lt;ref name="Mello 1960"/&gt;

==Confession==

Some later authors have written about an alleged confession from Kluski. In his book ''Sixty Years of Psychical Research'' (1950), magician [[Joseph Rinn]] claimed that Kluski had confessed to fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Rinn|Rinn, Joseph]]. (1950). ''Sixty Years of Psychical Research: Houdini and I Among the Spiritualists''. Truth Seeker Company. p. 441. "The medium Kluski produced a paraffin hand of a spirit for Dr. Geley, but when Dr. Geley wanted to bring him to the United States, Kluski confessed he was a fraud."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, researcher [[Melvin Harris]] also noted that Kluski had confessed to fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvin Harris|Harris, Melvin]]. (1978). ''Strange to Relate''. Granada Publishing. p. 102. {{ISBN|0-583-30342-0}} "Doyle was also duped by Kluski, a medium who produced wax moulds, said to be made by 'spirit hands'! Yet Kluski later admitted that he was just a cunning trickster."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{USgovtPOV|date=March 2008}}
The [[Constitution of Turkmenistan|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]] and does not establish a [[state religion]]; however, in practice the Government imposes legal restrictions on all forms of religious expression. All groups must register in order to gain legal status; unregistered religious activity is illegal and may be punished by administrative fines. While the 2003 law on religion and subsequent 2004 amendments had effectively restricted registration to only the two largest groups, [[Sunni Muslim]] and [[Russian Orthodox]], and criminalized unregistered religious activity, presidential decrees issued in 2004 dramatically reduced the numerical thresholds for registration and abolished criminal penalties for unregistered religious activity; civil penalties remain. As a result, nine minority religious groups were able to register, and the Turkmenistan government has permitted some other groups to meet quietly with reduced scrutiny.

There was no substantial change in the degree of religious tolerance by the Turkmenistan government during the period covered by this report, and there were troubling developments in the treatment of some unregistered groups. Following a sharp decrease in harassment of both registered and unregistered groups in late 2006, mistreatment of some registered and many unregistered religious minority group members, similar to that in previous reporting periods, resumed in February 2007. On December 21, 2006, President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] died. The [[State Security Council]] appointed Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers and Minister of Health [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov]] Acting President; Berdimuhammedov was elected President in February, 2007. During the reporting period there were no indications the Turkmenistan government planned to rescind or modify previous policies regarding religious freedom. The Turkmenistan government threatened members of minority religious groups with fines, loss of employment and housing, and imprisonment because of their beliefs.

There were no reports of societal abuses or violence based on religious beliefs or practice. The overwhelming majority of citizens identify themselves as Sunni Muslim; ethnic [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] identity is linked to Islam. Ethnic Turkmen who choose to convert to other religious groups, especially the lesser-known [[Protestant]] groups, are viewed with suspicion and sometimes ostracized, but Turkmenistan society historically has been tolerant and inclusive of different religious beliefs.

==Religion in Turkmenistan==
{{main|Religion in Turkmenistan}}

The Turkmen of [[Turkmenistan]], like their neighbors in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iran]] are [[Muslim]].  As a whole, Turkmenistan is 89% [[Muslim]] and 9% [[Eastern Orthodox]].  Most ethnic [[Russians]] are [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox Christians]].  The remaining 2% is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;

The great majority of [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] readily identify themselves as [[Muslims]] and acknowledge [[Islam]] as an integral part of their cultural heritage.  However, there are some who only support a revival of the religion's status merely as an element of national revival.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]]; however, in practice the Government restricts these rights. The criminal code outlaws violations of religious freedom or persecution by private actors; in practice it is not enforced. In 2004 the Government published amendments to the 2003 law on religion that reduced numerical thresholds for registration from 500 members to 5, and made all minority groups eligible to register. The amendments established two categories of religious assemblies: religious groups (comprising at least 5 and fewer than 50 members of legal age) and religious organizations (comprising at least 50 members). The amendments leave significant gray areas in the law.

The 2003 law requires all religious organizations to register, made operation of unregistered religious organizations a criminal offense, further restricted religious education, and monitored financial and material assistance to religious groups from foreign sources. In response to international pressure, a 2004 presidential decree lifted criminal penalties. The remaining civil law continues to allow the Government to control religious life and to restrict the activities of all religious groups. The 2003 law did not codify religious activities in localities other than where a group was registered. In October 2005 the Government announced a temporary procedure for the registration of religious groups' regional branches by issuing powers of attorney. [[Ministry of Justice (Turkmenistan)|Ministry of Justice]] (MOJ) representatives also stated that amendments would be made to the 2003 law on religion that would codify the branch registration issue, but this did not happen during the reporting period.

Former President Niyazov signed a decree in 2004 that strengthened the 2003 law on religious practice and religious organizations and increased registration fees for religious organizations to $100 (2.5 million manat at the unofficial rate). In addition the decree relieved the MOJ of the obligation to publish in the local media a list of registered religious organizations for transparency. Without a published list, legally registered groups were more isolated and the public was less able to respond when authorities harassed registered groups. The law also gave the MOJ the right to cancel a group's registration based on vaguely defined charges.

The government-appointed [[Council on Religious Affairs]] (CRA) reports to the president and ostensibly acts as an intermediary between the government bureaucracy and registered religious organizations. It includes Sunni Muslim imams and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as government representatives, but no representatives of minority religious groups. In practice the CRA acts as an arm of the state, exercising direct control over the hiring, promotion, and firing of both Sunni Muslim and Russian Orthodox clergy as well as helping to control all religious publications and activities. Its writ is enforced by security forces, specifically the [[Sixth Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs]], and it has no role in promoting [[interfaith]] dialogue. Although the Government does not officially favor any religion, it has provided financial and other support to the CRA for the construction of new mosques. The Government also pays most Muslim clerics' salaries, approves all senior cleric appointments, and requires the latter to report regularly to the CRA.

Until June 2004 government entities at all levels, including the courts, had interpreted the laws in such a way as to discriminate against those practicing any faith other than Sunni Islam or Russian Orthodox Christianity, whose congregations represented the only two registered religious groups. A 2004 decree reduced the minimum required number of adherents for registration, however, and in the year following the decree, nine additional religious groups registered: the Evangelical Christian Baptist Church of Turkmenistan, Seventh-day Adventist Church of Turkmenistan, Baha'i Community of Turkmenistan, Society for Krishna Consciousness (Hare Krishnas), Full Gospel Christian Church of Turkmenistan (Pentecostals), Light of the East Church (Dashoguz Pentecostal Church), Greater Grace Church of Turkmenistan, International Church of Christ, and the New Apostolic Church of Turkmenistan. Each of these groups comprised fewer than 50 members.

Shi'a Muslims remained unregistered, and there were no reports that they tried to register since the March 2004 decree, although they remained in contact with the CRA.

In practice government policies, including those at the city level such as zoning regulations on the use of private residences, have created difficulties for some groups in finding places to hold worship services. According to the national residential code, no religious activity is allowed in private homes or in public halls located in residential areas. However, two registered religious groups, the Baha'i community and the Krishna Consciousness Society, were permitted to conduct worship meetings in homes.

Unregistered religious groups and unregistered branches of religious groups are forbidden to conduct religious activities, including gathering, disseminating religious materials, and proselytizing. Government authorities have disrupted meetings of unregistered religious groups. Participants in those groups are subject to fines and administrative (not criminal) arrest under the administrative code. The Government prohibits foreign missionary activity and foreign religious organizations; however, the law does not restrict the worship choices of foreigners.

The Government has incorporated some aspects of Islamic tradition in its effort to redefine a national identity. For example, the Government has built large, monumental mosques, such as the ones in Ashgabat, [[Gokdepe]], and [[Gypjak]]. Despite its embrace of certain aspects of Islamic culture, the Government is concerned about foreign Islamic influence and the interpretation of Islam by local believers. The Government promotes a moderate understanding of Islam based on Turkmen religious and national traditions. In April 2007, President Berdimuhammedov visited [[Saudi Arabia]] and performed [[umrah]] (minor pilgrimage) rituals in [[Mecca]], recalling former President Niyazov's 1992 umrah.

The CRA has urged [[imam]]s to accord greater attention to President Niyazov's spiritual-social books on culture and heritage, [[Ruhnama]] and [[Ruhnama II]], by teaching them as holy texts and placing them next to the [[Qur'an]] in some mosques. Although the country elected a new president in February 2007, this policy did not change. Phrases from the Ruhnama are inscribed on the large mosque in former President Niyazov's home village of Gypjak.

In 2003 the widely respected former [[mufti]] of the country, [[Nasrullah Ibn Ibadullah]], was replaced, secretly tried, and sentenced in 2004 to 22 years in prison. Ibn Ibadullah's replacement, [[Kakageldi Wepayev]], was subsequently placed under house arrest for "misbehavior"-allegedly including drinking and womanizing-and replaced in 2004 by then 27-year-old recent seminary graduate [[Rowshen Allaberdiyev]].

Mosques and Muslim clergy are state-sponsored and financed. The Russian Orthodox Church and other religious groups are independently financed. The Government recognizes only Sunni Muslim holy days as national holidays. These include [[Gurban Bairam]] ([[Eid al-Adha]]), a 3-day holiday commemorating the end of the [[Hajj]], and [[Oraza-Bairam]] ([[Eid al-Fitr]]), commemorating the end of [[Ramadan]], the Muslim month of [[fasting]].

The Government does not offer alternative civilian service for [[conscientious objectors]]; individuals who want to refuse military service for religious reasons are offered noncombatant roles within the military. Until June 2007, conscripted members of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] were returned home unharmed several days after being called up, although they were not given papers excusing them from military service, which are needed for employment. This policy changed in June 2007, however, when three Jehovah's Witnesses were arrested and charged with avoiding military service.

There is no official religious instruction in public schools; however, the Government requires all public schools and institutes of higher learning to hold regular instruction on the Ruhnama. The [[Ministry of Education (Turkmenistan)|Ministry of Education]] requires that each child bring a personal copy of the Ruhnama to school. President Berdimuhammedov raised the issue of education reform in January 2007 but there was no change in the Ruhnama policy by the end of the reporting period.

Article Six of the November 2004 law allows mosques to provide religious education to children after school for 4 hours a week with the approval of parents. Persons who graduate from institutions of higher religious education (the law does not specify domestic or international institutions) and who obtain CRA approval may provide religious education. Citizens have the right to receive religious education individually or with other persons; however, the law prohibits providing religious education in private, and those who do so are subject to punitive legal action. Although some independent [[religious education]] exists, the Government has done nothing to promote religious education beyond the official version incorporating the Ruhnama. Some Sunni mosques have regularly scheduled classes on the Qur'an.

The 2003 law prohibits the ROC from conducting religious education programs without CRA and presidential approval, and there were no reports that either the CRA or the President approved such programs. Homeschooling usually is allowed only in cases of severe illness or disability and not for religious reasons.

The Government, through the CRA, does little to promote interfaith understanding or dialogue beyond that between Muslims and Russian Orthodox Christians.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
The Government officially has banned only extremist groups advocating violence, but it also categorized Islamic groups advocating stricter interpretation of Islamic religious doctrine as "extremist." The activities of unregistered religious groups remained illegal, with violators subject to fines and administrative arrest under the administrative code.

During the reporting period, at least four religious groups, all of which sought several times to register, continued to be denied legal status; as in previous years, the Government delayed or denied applications, citing technical reasons, including the requirement that the head of the group have "higher education." The Roman Catholic Church remained unregistered because of a conflict with local law requiring that the head of the Church be a citizen of the country.

Other groups either remained fearful of registering, citing the amount and type of information the Government required, or refused on principle to do so.

Registered religious minority groups reported few instances of harassment. However, in two cases regional affiliates of registered groups experienced harassment by provincial and district law enforcement agencies. Some of these groups found that by routinely notifying the Government of their gatherings and events and inviting government representatives to attend, they experienced decreased government harassment.

The Government restricted unregistered religious groups from establishing places of worship, and violations constituted an administrative offense. Registered groups also experienced difficulties establishing and maintaining places of worship; several groups stated that their largest obstacle was a lack of funds to rent a public hall. Several groups said they would prefer to buy a worship center or land to establish a permanent one, but municipal authorities raised insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles. Five registered minority religious groups have established public places of worship; three were rented and two were private residential homes of group members. The Government did not restrict some worship services in private homes, and the CRA assisted several registered minority groups to locate suitable worship locations. The Government forbids unregistered religious groups or unregistered branches of registered religious groups from gathering publicly or privately and can punish individuals or groups who violate these prohibitions. Some unregistered congregations continued to practice quietly, largely in private homes.

The Government also controls access to Islamic education. The theology faculty at [[Turkmen State University]] in Ashgabat had been the only academic faculty to conduct Islamic education. In July 2005 the President dissolved the theology faculty and incorporated the theology students and curriculum into the university's history department, leaving no official Islamic academic faculty.

The Government does not officially restrict persons from changing their religious beliefs and affiliation, but ethnic Turkmen members of unregistered religious groups accused of [[proselytizing]] and disseminating religious material generally receive harsher treatment than nonethnic Turkmen. During this reporting period, there was one report of local government officials attempting to force an ethnic Turkmen Christian convert to renounce his faith.

There were three high-level officials in the Government with a Russian Jewish heritage, and at least one deputy minister who is Russian Orthodox. No representatives of other minority religious groups were known to be working at senior or mid-level government positions during the reporting period. Some minority religious group adherents remained members of the only political party but feared openly acknowledging their faith out of concern for political reprisal.

The Government monitored minority religious groups, particularly those perceived to have connections with or support from a supranational hierarchy. The law prohibits foreign missionary activity, although in practice both Christians and Muslims working in the country in other capacities engaged in religious outreach. The 2003 law on religion stipulated that religious groups must report any financial or material assistance received from foreign sources. The Government denies visas to foreigners suspected of conducting or intending to conduct missionary activity.

By decree, publishing religious literature was prohibited, limiting the availability of Qur'ans, [[Bible]]s and other religious literature. Sacred religious books were rarely available for purchase. In practice the CRA must approve imported religious literature. Since all members of the CRA are either government officials, Sunni Muslims or members of the ROC, minority religious groups were disadvantaged regarding importing of religious materials. When the CRA approves the importation of a publication, the number of imported copies cannot exceed the number of registered group members. The Dashoguz office of the CRA required that its officers stamp religious literature, including Bibles and Qur'ans, in order to authorize it. During the reporting period, a leader of an unregistered church in Dashoguz reported that officials confiscated religious literature from him on a train and intercepted religious literature that had been mailed to him.

The Government enforced the use of former President Niyazov's books, Ruhnama and Ruhnama II, in educational institutions, government offices, and mosques. Copies of the book were kept in most mosques, and authorities have pressured religious leaders to place it alongside the Qur'an and to preach Ruhnama in their services.

In 2004 the Government formally lifted the exit visa requirement, theoretically permitting travel by all those who wished to participate in the Hajj or other travel for religious purposes; however, the Government maintained a "black list" of individuals and continued to limit freedom of movement, including in cases where individuals wanted to travel outside the country in order to conduct religious study. The Government continued to limit participation in the annual pilgrimage to Mecca (the Hajj), specifying that only 188 pilgrims (one plane load) personally approved by the President, out of the country's quota of 4,600, would be allowed to travel to Mecca. The national airline provided transportation free of charge.

According to [[Forum 18]], the Government on January 6, 2007 refused to grant permission to [[Merdan Shirmedov]], a Protestant from an ethnic Turkmen fellowship in [[Dashoguz]], to leave the country to join his pregnant wife, Wendy Lucas in the [[United States]]. Lucas said that on April 10, 2007, Shirmedov tried to cross the border to Uzbekistan, but was prevented from leaving after Turkmenistan border guards found his name on a computerized exit blacklist. Officials refused to tell him why he was barred from leaving.

Foreign members of registered and unregistered religious groups continued to be denied entry visas.

Several registered religious minority groups reported that the Government monitored them by attending their gatherings; nonetheless, communities continued to engage in regular activities. Officers from the Sixth Department in Ashgabat, the division charged with fighting organized crime and terrorism, were still charged with monitoring members of religious minorities.

The Government continued to discriminate against members of religious groups with respect to employment.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
Following a sharp decrease in harassment of both registered and unregistered groups in late 2006, mistreatment of some registered and many unregistered religious minority group members resumed following the inauguration of President Berdimuhammedov in February 2007. The Government threatened members of minority religious groups with fines, loss of employment and housing, and imprisonment because of their beliefs. There were also reports of raids.

According to Forum 18, [[Ministry for National Security (Turkmenistan)|Ministry for National Security]] (MNB) officials arrested [[Vyacheslav Kalataevsky]], a Baptist leader from Turkmenbashy, on March 12, 2007, and on May 14 he was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in a [[labor camp]] on criminal charges of illegally crossing the border in 2001. In 2001, authorities had deported Kalataevsky without documents to [[Kazakhstan]], and after a week he crossed back into the country to rejoin his wife and children.

Forum 18 also reported the arrest on May 19 of the leader of a [[Council of Churches Baptist]] congregation in Turkmenbashy City, [[Yevgeny Potolov]]. The report speculated that Potolov, a Russian citizen, had also been arrested for entering the country illegally in 2001; authorities had deported Potolov to Kazakhstan, but he had returned to Turkmenistan to rejoin his wife and children.

During incidents involving police detaining and questioning members of unregistered minority religious groups, authorities took a range of actions including: filming those present; recording the names, addresses, and places of work of the congregants; threatening fines and imprisonment; and confiscating religious literature. With the exception of the Kalataevsky and Potolov cases, there were fewer reports of prolonged detention or physical abuse.

The fate of an estimated 30 suspected "[[Wahhabis]]" reportedly detained in [[Ashgabat]] in August 2005 remains unknown.

The country's former mufti, Nasrullah ibn Ibadullah, remained in prison serving a 22-year sentence. Ibadullah had been dismissed as mufti in 2003, reportedly in part for his refusal to teach the Ruhnama as a [[sacred]] text and in March 2004 was secretly tried and convicted, reportedly for his alleged role in a failed 2002 assassination attempt on Niyazov. Little was known about the whereabouts or the condition of Ibadullah, despite calls from the international community for access to him and for his release. [[Amnesty International]] reported in early 2007 that his family was increasingly concerned for his safety.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have reported a number of beatings, arrests, fines and imprisonments of its members in Turkmenistan for conscientious objection and other charges related to their religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/turkmenistan/jehovahs-witnesses-in-prison/ "Imprisoned for Their Faith"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/turkmenistan/dashoguz-judicial-police-abuses/ "Mother of Four-Year-Old Receives Unjust Prison Sentence in Turkmenistan"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2007, an unidentified official—possibly from the Sixth Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs—demanded and then fled with the travel documents of three members of an unregistered Mary-based group who were traveling by train to Dashoguz province to meet with a religious leader. A transportation official, finding the three group members without documents, returned them by train to Ashgabat the same day.

On April 19, 2007, officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Sixth Department raided a branch of the registered [[Evangelical Baptist Church of Turkmenistan]] in Turkmenbashy. The authorities came to a worship service, and took Bibles and hymnals from the congregation. That evening, police summoned two women to a local official's office and fined them approximately $90 (2.5 million manat), threatening further harassment if the women did not pay. The police gave no specific reason for the harassment, but suggested that the women ought to be attending a Russian Orthodox Church.

In early 2007 law enforcement officials reportedly raided a meeting of the registered group [[Svet Vostoka]] (Light of the East) Pentecostal church in Dashoguz.

On March 18, 2007, authorities raided a meeting of an unregistered religious group in [[Abadan]] and fined home owners.

On February 4, 2007, a group of law enforcement officers, who refused to show identification or a search warrant, raided the private house of the leader of an unregistered Christian group, where a wide circle of relatives and family friends were gathered. The inhabitants of the house were not conducting any religious activities. For five hours, the group of officers videotaped the people and belongings inside the house.

A [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] representative reported that harassment from officials had decreased since her group's registration; there were no reports of authorities beating Hare Krishnas during this reporting period. In October 2006, as part of a general annual prison amnesty, former President Niyazov released imprisoned Hare Krishna follower Ceper Annaniyazova, who had been sentenced to seven years in prison in November 2005 for having illegally crossed the border in 2002.

The Government did not destroy any mosques during the reporting period and, in fact, resumed renovation of a mosque in [[Mary City]] and on a mosque in the new president's home village. One mosque in Turkmenbashy was destroyed in 2006. In 2004 at least six mosques were destroyed, some for no stated reason, others ostensibly for Ashgabat city "beautification" plans. In 2004 a Sunni cemetery north of the capital was leveled. Another cemetery in Ashgabat was being encroached upon by a high-rise development. In 2004 Muslims in [[Bagyr]], a predominantly Kurdish suburb of Ashgabat, reported they could no longer bury their family members in traditional cemeteries but instead were obliged to use a centralized location. The Government restricts the number of mosques by requiring permission for construction. Government policy is that every community should have one mosque; however, in 2004 President Niyazov ordered that no more mosques were to be built without CRA approval and stated mosques would henceforth be led by state-appointed imams.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom

Registered minority religious groups generally continued to report lower levels of harassment.

In a May 2007 meeting with embassy officers, the Deputy Chairman of the CRA agreed in principle to hold another minority religious group roundtable to discuss pressing concerns, similar to the one held on October 20, 2005.

The CRA intervened on one occasion during the reporting period to release religious literature that had been embargoed by the Customs Department.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of general societal abuses based on religious belief or practice during the period covered by this report.

Many Muslims do not regularly attend mosques; however, the overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as "Muslim," and national identity is linked to Islam. (Turkmen society considers an individual to be born into an ethno-religious group.) Departures from the pattern are rare and either receive little support or are criticized. Ethnic Turkmen who choose to convert from Islam to other religious groups are viewed with suspicion and sometimes ostracized.

Despite strong ties between Islam and national identity, the society historically has been tolerant and inclusive of different religious beliefs. For example, in the early part of the 20th century Ashgabat was a refuge for Baha'is escaping persecution in Iran, and a [[Baha'i temple]] was built in the city at that time. Government repression of minority religious groups does not reflect doctrinal or societal friction between the Muslim majority and minority religious groups. Rather, it reportedly reflects the Government's concern that the proliferation of nontraditional religious groups could undermine state control, promote civil unrest, facilitate undue influence by foreign interests, and destabilize the Government. There is also a societal distrust of foreign-based religious groups and the belief that Islam from outside the country is "Wahhabist"—extremist.

'''Gedatsu Church of America''' is an American [[Buddhist]] [[Religion|church]] with branches in [[Japan]], [[Sacramento]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacramento365.com/venue/detail/5567/Gedatsu_Church_of_America |title=Gedatsu Church of America |publisher=Sacramento 365 |accessdate=August 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525172503/http://sacramento365.com/venue/detail/5567/Gedatsu_Church_of_America |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A nonsectarian spiritual movement, it is based on the Japanese [[Gedatsukai]], a new religious movement that was founded in 1929 by Japanese Gedatsu Kongo. The Church preaches about Gedatsu, a religious study that does not exclude any religions and beliefs. Gedatsu is the Japanese term for [[moksha]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/jjrs/pdf/162.pdf Heisig, James W. (1982).

'''Gatikachala''' is a hill near [[Sholingur]] in the [[Vellore]] district of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. It is a [[Hindu]] pilgrimage center and the site of an ancient temple dedicated to the God [[Narasimha]]. Lord Narasimha is the fourth incarnation ([[avatar]]) of the God [[Vishnu]].

The name of this place is Kadigachalam as known from ancient legend. Kadigai is the name of a period of Time. Sholingur is famous for the temples at its outskirts – one of Sri Yoga Narasimha Swami located on the top of the hill Ghatikachala and another of Sri Yoga Anjaneyar Swami. Tirukkadikai (Sholingur or Cholasimhapuram) is one of the '''108 Divya Desams''' - sacred places of [[Vaishnava]] Sect in Hinduism. Both the temples are located on two hillocks.

'''Yoga Anjaneyar'''

It is believed that Indirathuyman, the King of North Madurai killed the Asuran Nikumban and saved the Country Since, he helped the rishis and bhaktas, he was given the Vajrayudham by Indiran (Weapon of Indiran). Yoga Narasimhar asked Anjaneyar([[Hanuman]]) to help him and after the asura was killed, Anjaneyar was asked to stay in the hills to give boons to his devotees, in his yoga nithrai (posture). Sacred Thirumanjanam and poojas are performed for Lord Anjaneyar on all Sundays as the killing of the asura took place on a Sunday. The Brahma theertham well, which is full of water rich in minerals, gives cure for many diseases.

The Hanumath Jayanthi festival is celebrated in a very grand manner here. Large number of devotees visit the Smaller Hillock of the Anjaneyar Temple during this occasion. Anjaneyar, sitting in Yoga Muthra is facing the west, where the Yoga Narasimhar is in his abode.

'''Legend'''

After killing the mighty demon Hiranyakashipu ([[asura]]), Lord Narasimha couldn’t contain his anger and Lord [[Shiva]] only came to his help. To make Prahalaada happy, Yoga Narasimhar gave his seva for 1 Kadigai in Yoga Nilai (Bigger Hillock). Because of this, the place is also called as "Kadikasalam".

'''Utsavas''' (Festivals)

Sri Bhaktavatsala Perumal (Thakkan), Periyapiratiyar and Bhoomi piratiyar are found in Bhoga stage (Dhyanam stage) in the temple in Malai Adivaaram (foot hill). There are separate sannadhis for Andal, Alwars, Garuda Vagana Varadharaja Perumal, Erumbiyapa and Thottacharyaar. Both the God's in Periyamala and Chinnamala, Narasimar and Aajaneyar are in Santha Nilais (Yoga Stage). All Utsavams are conducted to Sri Bhakthavatsalar of the temple . Special Poojas for Thayaar (Amritha Valli)on every Friday are performed.

==Elevation as Jathedar of Akal Takht==
Singh joined [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC) as a [[Sewadar]] at Muktsar. He served 36 years at SGPC beginning in 1972 and became head priest at [[Amritsar]] before becoming Jathedar on 6 August 2008.

==Issues==

On December 5, 2011, [[Jathedar]]s of all five [[Panj Takht|Takhts]] including Jathedar of Akal Takht, Giani Gurbachan Singh awarded Panth Rattan Fakhr-e-Quam (literally "Jewel of the community, pride of the nation") to [[List of Chief Ministers of Punjab (India)|Chief Minister of Punjab]], [[Parkash Singh Badal]]. He was awarded this title at [[Akal Takht]] for his service towards the [[Sikh|Sikh Nation]] by creating many memorials pertaining to [[Sikhism|Sikhi]] such as [[Virasat-e-Khalsa]], besides being imprisoned for long time and having faced atrocities during various Akali movements. A [[Sarbat Khalsa]] held by Sikh organisations on November 10, 2015 stated that it was withdrawing the award due to allegations of Civil Rights Violations and failure to recognize the oppression faced by the [[Sikhs]] of [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Correspondent|first1=HT|title=Sarbat Khalsa appoints Jagtar Singh Hawara as Akal Takht jathedar|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/sarbat-khalsa-bhog-ceremony-of-akhand-path-performed-people-start-reaching-the-venue/story-4a7kGuwRRCaP8pPa6zugSL.html|accessdate=10 November 2015|agency=Hindustan Times|issue=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the [[Panj Pyare]] of [[Akal Takht]] (Bhai Satnam Singh Khanda, Bhai Mangal Singh, Bhai Tarlok Singh, Bhai Satnam Singh and Bhai Major Singh) issued a summon to the [[Jathedar]]s of the five [[Panj Takht|Takhats]] (Giani Gurbachan Singh, Giani Mal Singh, Giani Gurmukh Singh, Giani Iqbal Singh, Giani Ram Singh) to clarify their position on the pardoning of [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] for [[imitation]] of the [[Guru Gobind Singh|10th Sikh Guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=kal Takht Sahib Punj Piare Summon Appointed Jathedars|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PExQMBPLls|access-date=15 October 2016|work=Sikh24 News &amp; Updates|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Jathedar]]s refused to recognize the summon, the [[Panj Pyare]] of [[Akal Takht]] directed the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC) to relieve the [[Jathedar]]s from their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=231015 Sikh Channel News: Panj Pyare issue Gurmata regarding Panj Takht Jathedars.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcnW2jJIkI|access-date=15 October 2016|work=Sikh Channel|date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGPC ignored the [[Gurmata]] and suspended the [[Panj Pyare]] from [[Akal Takht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SGPC President's decision to suspend Akal Takht 'Panj Piare' draws flak|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/SGPC-Presidents-decision-to-suspend-Akal-Takht-Panj-Piare-draws-flak/articleshow/49495225.cms|access-date=16 October 2016|work=The Times of India|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sarbat Khalsa]] convened by radical Sikh organisations appointed [[Jagtar Singh Hawara]] as the jathedar of Akal Takht. [[SGPC]] President [[Avtar Singh Makkar]] however stated that its convening was against the principles of Sikhism and its decisions were null and void. He added that the removal of jathedars came under [[Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925]] and no one could challenge the SGPC's authority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/community/at-sarbat-khalsa-hardliners-appoint-hawara-akal-takht-jathedar/156857.html At Sarbat Khalsa, hardliners appoint Hawara Akal Takht Jathedar]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2018, Gurbachan Singh resigned from his post and the search for the next Jathedar was underway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/sgpc-emergency-meet-on-monday-to-take-call-on-new-takht-jathedar/story-9eC5IJt98tQBJUi7CMsIIN.html SGPC emergency meet on Monday to take call on new Takht jathedar]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Host desecration''' is a form of [[sacrilege]] in Christian denominations that follow the doctrine of [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. It involves the mistreatment or malicious use of a [[consecrate]]d [[Sacramental bread|host]]—the sacred bread used in the [[Eucharist]]ic service of the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. It is forbidden by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, as well as in certain [[Protestant]] traditions (including [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]]). In Catholicism, where the host is held to have been [[transubstantiation|transubstantiated]] into the body of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], host [[desecration]] is among the gravest of sins. Intentional host desecration is not only a [[mortal sin]] but also incurs the penalty of [[excommunication]] {{lang|la|[[latae sententiae]]}}. Throughout history, a number of groups have been accused of desecrating the Eucharist, often with grave consequences due to the spiritual importance of the consecrated host.

==Overview==
Accusations against [[Jews]] were a common reason given for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="je"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7906-host-desecration-of|title=Desecration of the Host|accessdate=7 May 2007|author=|date=|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accusations were made in [[Witch trials|witchcraft trials]]; witch-hunter's guides such as the [[Malleus Maleficarum]] refer to hosts as being objects of desecration by witches.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Montague, ed. ''The Malleus Maleficarum of Kramer and Sprenger'', 1948. Originally in Latin, Germany, 1487.  e.g. ''Part II, Question I, Chapter IV:"...they are bound to observe certain other abominable ceremonies at the command of the devils, such as to spit on the ground at the Elevation of the Host."''&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of many descriptions of the [[Black Mass]], both in ostensibly historical works and in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See the studies by: Rhodes, H.T.F. ''The Satanic Mass'', 1954 and Zacharias, Gerhard ''The Satanic Cult'', 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Host desecration1.jpg|thumb|upright=2.2|From a 15th-century German woodcut of the host desecration by the Jews of [[Passau]], 1477. The hosts are stolen and sold to the Jewish community, who pierce them in a ritual. When guards come to question the Jews, they (the Jews) attempt to burn the Hosts, but are unsuccessful, as the Hosts transform into an infant carried by angels.  The Jews, now proven guilty, are arrested, beheaded, and tortured with hot [[pincer (tool)|pincers]], the entire community is driven out with their feet bound and held to the fire, and the Christian who sold the hosts to the Jews is punished. At the end the Christians kneel and pray.]]

In Christianity, within the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]],&lt;ref name="Neal2014"/&gt; [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref name="ce"/&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref name="HarperMetzger2009"/&gt; [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]],&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"/&gt; [[Methodism|Methodist Church]],&lt;ref name="Neal2014"/&gt; and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref name="Houlden2003"/&gt; during the celebration of the [[Eucharist]], the offerings of bread and wine are changed or added to make the body and blood of [[Jesus]] by the action of God. The change effects the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], a doctrine which has been believed from the earliest days of the Church.&lt;ref name="realpresencefathers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp|title="Catholic Answers - The Real Presence (Fathers)", retrieved 15 May 2011|author=|date=|website=catholic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525132104/http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp|archivedate=25 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Middle Ages]], Roman Catholic theology offered the concept of [[transubstantiation]] to explain this change of [[Substance theory|substance]] which was believed to be actual and not merely symbolic. Transubstantiation, [[dogmatic definition|defined as a dogma]] at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215, holds that the substances of the offerings are literally transformed, while the appearance of bread and wine remain. Many Christians believe Jesus to be "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]." In the Catholic Church, therefore, his "body, blood, soul and divinity" in the form of the consecrated host are [[adoration|adored]]. Theft, sale, or use of the host for a profane purpose is considered a grave sin and sacrilege,&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13321a.htm |title="Sacrilege", ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1912, retrieved 7 May 2007 |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-02-01 |accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incurs the penalty of [[excommunication]], which is imposed [[Latae sententiae|automatically]] in the [[Latin Rite]] (See [[Code of Canon Law]], Latin Rite Code canon 1367, or Eastern Rite Code canon 1442.)

Some denominations, especially Lutherans, have similar beliefs regarding the Eucharist and the [[Real Presence]], though they reject the Roman Catholic concept of transubstantiation, preferring instead, the doctrine of the [[sacramental union]], in which "the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine...in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith."&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A.

Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the [[Coptic Church]], insist "on the ''reality'' of the change from bread and wine into the body and the blood of Christ at the consecration of the elements", although they have "never attempted to explain the ''manner'' of the change",&lt;ref name="HarperMetzger2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=Brad|last2=Metzger|first2=Paul Louis|title=Exploring Ecclesiology|date=1 March 2009|publisher=Brazos Press|isbn=9781587431739|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus rejecting philosophical terms to describe it.&lt;ref name="Houlden2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houlden|first=James Leslie |title=Jesus in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9781576078563|page=185|quote=The Copts are fearful of using philosophical terms concerning the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, preferring uncritical appeals to biblical passages like 1 Cor. 10.16; 11.23-29 or the discourse in John 6.26-58.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Methodist Church]] similarly holds that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist "through the elements of bread and wine", but maintains that how He is present is a Holy Mystery.&lt;ref name="Neal2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|title=Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life|date=19 December 2014|publisher=WestBow Press|language=English |isbn=9781490860077|page=111|quote=For Anglicans and Methodists the reality of the presence of Jesus as received through the sacramental elements is not in question.

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence. 

Host desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though "Le Messe Noir" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work [[The Satanic Rituals]] does include some elements.

Since the publication of a document called Memoriale Domini in 1969,&lt;ref name="ewtn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apolistic See of the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an "ancient custom".&lt;ref name="ewtn"/&gt; Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption. However, recent statements and practices of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]&lt;ref name="light of the world"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|title=In ‘Light of the World’, by Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict says: “I am not opposed in principle to Communion in the hand; I have both administered and received Communion in this way myself...The idea behind my current practice of having people kneel to receive Communion on the tongue was to send a signal and to underscore the Real Presence with an exclamation point."|author=|date=|website=ignatius.com|access-date=2012-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055319/http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have caused a recent shift in Catholic practice (notably at Papal Masses and amongst more traditional-minded Catholics) of receiving on the tongue while kneeling, which is also an ancient practice. (This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still received orally in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.)

==Medieval accusations against Jews==
[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]
{{Antisemitism}}
Accusations of host desecration (German ''Hostienschändung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="je"/&gt; The libel of "[[Jewish deicide]]": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.

It has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir (1990), p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics were being told, in the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, that they, by consuming the host, were eating human flesh and drinking human blood. To dispel their doubts about transubstantiation, Christians projected a system of belief onto Jews that was completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]] where strict dietary laws forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].

Jews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.&lt;ref name="je"/&gt;

The penalties for Jews accused of defiling hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, "confessed" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1247,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]] in 1389,&lt;ref&gt;"Blood libel accusations against Jews", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.&lt;ref&gt; Ocker (April 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Nichol in ''Christian Antisemitism'', "over 100 instances of the charge have been recorded, in many cases leading to massacres."

As mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1247 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam. Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th Century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Cloître et église des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at [[Deggendorf]], celebrated locally as part of the ''"Deggendorfer Gnad"'' until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, long celebrated in a special fest and depicted in artistic relics in the Church of St. Gudule, led to the burning of twenty Jews and expulsion in the [[Brussels massacre]]. In 1510, at [[:de:Knoblauch (Ketzin)|Knoblauch]] in [[Havelland]] 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from [[Brandenburg]].

An alleged host desecration in 1410, at [[Segovia]], was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Markman |first=Sidney David |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Jewish Remnants in Spain: Wanderings in a Lost World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62SGDeU0CzcC&amp;pg=PA50 |location=Mesa, AZ |publisher=Scribe Publishers |pages=50–51 |isbn=0972723706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at [[Laa an der Thaya|Laa]], Austria; 1298, at [[Röttingen]], near [[Würzburg]], and at Korneuburg, near [[Vienna]]; 1299, at [[Ratisbon]]; 1306, at [[St. Pölten]]; 1330, at [[Güstrow]]; 1338, at [[Pulkau]]; 1388, at [[Prague]]; 1401, at [[Glogau]]; 1420, at Ems; 1453, at [[Breslau]]; 1478, at [[Passau]]; 1492, at [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], in [[Mecklenburg]]; 1514, at Mittelberg, in [[Alsace]]; 1556, at [[Sochaczew]], in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to [[Jacques Basnage]], quoting from Manasseh b. Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Magda Teter |title=Sinners on Trial: Jews and Sacrilege after the Reformation|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-674-05297-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jew's wife, her unborn child, and her children look on in terror as the blood pours into the street in rivers while soldiers break through the door. The painting is structured around the Golden Section.]]

The accusation of host desecration gradually ceased after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when first [[Martin Luther]] in 1523 and then [[Sigismund August of Poland]] in 1558 were among those who repudiated the accusation. However, sporadic instances of host desecration libel occurred even in the 18th and 19th century. In 1761 in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], several Jews from [[Alsace]] were executed on a charge of host desecration. The last recorded accusation was brought up in [[Berlad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loeb |first=Isidore |title=La situation des israélites en Turquie, en Serbie et en Roumanie |page=143 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h4VCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 |year=1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]], in 1836.&lt;ref name="je"/&gt;

==2008 controversy in the US==
In his July 8 blog entry, [[University of Minnesota Morris]] biology professor [[PZ Myers|Paul Zachary Myers]] criticized the reaction to a [[University of Central Florida]] student's perceived act of host desecration (the student had attempted to bring the host to a friend who was curious about communion). Myers described the level of harassment against the student and expressed his intent to desecrate the wafer, which Catholics consider a [[mortal sin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/07/10/college-student-gets-death-threats-for-smuggling-lsquobody-christrsquo.html |title= College Student Gets Death Threats for Smuggling "Body of Christ" |accessdate=2016-08-22 |date=2008-07-10 |publisher= [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers expressed outrage that [[Fox News]] appeared to be inciting viewers to cause further problems for the student, and ridiculed reports that armed guards would attend the next Mass. Myers suggested that if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts for him, he would treat the wafers "with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web."&lt;ref name=frackincracker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php |title=IT'S A FRACKIN’ CRACKER! |accessdate=2008-07-11 |date=2008-07-08 |publisher=Pharyngula |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712015833/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php |archivedate=2008-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two Muslim reporters from ''Al-Islam'', a small [[Malaysia]]n magazine, participated in a Catholic Mass, while undercover writing an article on cases of [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy from Islam]] (''riddah'') and received Holy Communion.

==Desecration during a Black Mass==
A [[Black mass]] is a Satanic ritual designed to satirize or invert a traditional [[Catholic mass]]. Consecrated hosts are a common ingredient in black masses, becoming the subject of desecration. The hosts must first be stolen from the tabernacle of a Catholic church, and/or secreted away by people who are posing as parishioners taking communion.

In 2014, the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu held a public black mass at the Oklahoma Civic Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/black-mass-protest-oklahoma_n_5864216|title=Catholics Gather To Protest 'Black Mass' Event In Oklahoma City|first=Antonia|last=Blumberg|date=22 September 2014|publisher=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planned to include the desecration of a consecrated host, which was to be "stomped on". That did not transpire: instead, the host was returned through an attorney after the archdiocese filed a lawsuit for its recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/5333988|title=Lawsuit pits Catholic archbishop against satanist group over sacred item purported to be used for 'black Mass'|author=Carla Hinton|date=21 August 2014|website=newsok.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/satanists-return-stolen-host-to-archbishop-coakley|title=Satanists Return Stolen Host to Archbishop Coakley|author=|date=21 August 2014|website=ncregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/breaking-archbishop-files-lawsuit-against-black-mass-organizers|title=Archbishop Coakley Files Lawsuit Against Black Mass Organizers|author=Brian Fraga|date=20 August 2014|website=ncregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news9.com/story/26341267/consecrated-host-returned-okc-archbishop-drops-lawsuit|title=Consecrated Host Returned, OKC Archbishop Drops Lawsuit|first=|last=News9.com|date=21 August 2014|website=news9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam in Papua New Guinea''' is a minority religion, with over 5,000 followers.&lt;ref name=scottflower/&gt; The majority of the Muslims belong to the [[Sunni]] group, while a small number are [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asopa.typepad.com/files/islam-in-png.pdf | title=Islam in Papua New Guinea | accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The people of the island of [[New Guinea]] traded with China and the Malay empire, the latter of which was Muslim, beginning in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/3028825.stm Timeline: Papua New Guinea]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Muslims in Papua New Guinea set up the first Islamic center, with the help of a Malaysia-based Islamic organisation and the Saudi Ministry of Islamic affairs.  In 1996, three more Islamic centers were established, with the help of the [[Muslim World League]]. There are now seven Islamic centers in the nation. The first [[mosque]], known as the Baitul Kareem Mosque, was built in 1988 in [[Kimbe]], [[New Britain]], by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vladsokhin.com/work/islam-in-melanesia/#22]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam in present-day Papua New Guinea==
According to [[Isa Teine]], the general secretary for PNG's Islamic Society, many are drawn to Islam because of its similarities with Melanesian customs, and he predicts that "Once the religion itself spread I tell you, I'm just predicting in 20, 30 years' time, all Papua New Guinea will submit to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Growing numbers convert to Islam in PNG|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-17/growing-numbers-convert-to-islam-in-png/209456|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=ABC|date=18 Nov 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar opinions are voiced even by many of the non-Muslims of PNG, with a Seventh Day Adventist preacher from the highland [[Enga Province]] stating his belief that, “In the next 30 years all the PNG highlands will become Muslim because our culture is Islamic.”&lt;ref name="A Faith Grows In PNG"&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[Jo Chandler]]|title=A Faith Grows In PNG|url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/a-faith-grows-in-png/675/|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=The Global Mail|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research by Dr Scott Flower, a [[Melbourne University]] Islamic specialist, secondary reasons for conversion to Islam include the disillusionment and confusion at the competition between the many different Christian churches, and inconsistencies in their theology: “PNG people are quite fanatical about theology, they actually read the bible. They can quote chapter and verse. And the [[Internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]] they find in the bible are another major reason why people told me they converted.”.&lt;ref name="A Faith Grows In PNG"/&gt;

In Papua New Guinea, new Islamic [[missionary]] movements are beginning to proliferate. There are pockets of Muslims around Port Moresby, in [[Baimuru]], [[Daru]], [[Marshall Lagoon]], the [[Musa Valley]] and in the islands of New Britain and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]. It is in the [[Highlands Region|Highlands]] that Islam has seen the most growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=119 Events in Papua New Guinea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of muslims===
In 2001, there were less than 500 Muslims in PNG.&lt;ref name="A Faith Grows In PNG"/&gt; In 2007, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] estimated that there were about 2,000 [[Muslim]]s in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90150.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] cited that were more than 4,000 Muslims in the country, with reports of entire villages converting at the same time.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-17/growing-numbers-convert-to-islam-in-png/209456|title=Growing numbers convert to Islam in PNG|publisher=abc.net|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Scott Flower estimated that there were over 5000 Muslims, claiming a 500% increase since 2001.&lt;ref name=scottflower&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4134125/The_Growing_Muslim_Minority_Community_in_Papua_New_Guinea|title=The growing muslim minority community in Papua New Guinea|publisher=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Rogers''' (1627 - ?) was a [[Fifth Monarchist]] preacher of the 1650s, and later a physician.

[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - John Rogers (State 1).jpg|thumb|right|John Rogers in an engraving by [[Wenceslas Hollar]].]]

==Background==
He was born at [[Messing]] in [[Essex]], the second son of the clergyman [[Nehemiah Rogers]], by his wife Margaret. Because of his religious views, he was turned out by his father in 1642. He returned to studies of medicine, as a servitor at [[King's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=RGRS642J|name=Rogers, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First English Civil War]] had broken out, and the servitors were dismissed. Rogers almost starved, but in 1643 he obtained a post in a school in [[Lord Brudenel]]'s house in [[Huntingdonshire]], and afterwards at the free school at [[St. Neots]].&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;[[:s:Rogers, John (1627-1665?) (DNB00)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short time he became known in Huntingdonshire as a preacher, and, returning to Essex, he received [[presbyterian ordination]] in 1647. About the same time he married a daughter of Sir Robert Payne of [[Midloe]] in Huntingdonshire, and became 'settled minister' of [[Purleigh]] in Essex, a valuable living. Rogers engaged a [[curate]], and proceeded to London. There he renounced his presbyterian ordination, and joined the Independents. Becoming lecturer at [[St Thomas the Apostle College|St. Thomas Apostle]], he preached violent political sermons in support of the [[Long parliament]].&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

In 1650 he was sent to [[Dublin]] by parliament as a preacher. [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]] was assigned him by the commissioners as a place of worship. A schism arose in his congregation owing to the adoption by a party among them of [[Anabaptist]] principles; he wearied of the controversy, and returned to England in 1652. In the following year his parishioners at Purleigh cited him for non-residence, and he lost the living.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

Rogers was now no longer the champion of parliament. In 1653 Rogers published two controversial works, ''Bethshemesh, or Tabernacle for the Sun'', in which he assailed the [[presbyterians]], and ''Sagrir, or Doomes-day drawing nigh'', in which he attacked the 'ungodly laws and lawyers of the Fourth Monarchy,' and also the collection of [[tithes]]. The two books indicate the date of his change of views: ''Bethshemesh'' is written from the standard Independent standpoint, while in ''Sagrir'' he has developed the characteristics of a fifth-monarchy man. The forcible dissolution of the Long parliament met with Rogers's approval. Besides doctrinal differences, he had personal quarrels with prominent members: [[John Maynard (MP)|Sir John Maynard]] had appeared against him as advocate for the congregation at Purleigh, while [[Zachary Crofton]] had anonymously attacked his preaching in a pamphlet.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Taste of the Doctrine of Thomas Apostle''; at a later date Crofton renewed the controversy by publishing a reply to ''Bethshemesh'' styled ''Bethshemesh Clouded.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
After Cromwell's ''coup d'état'' Rogers occupied himself with two long addresses to him, in which he recommended a system of government very similar to that which was actually inaugurated. This accord did not survive the dissolution of Cromwell's first parliament and his assumption of the title of [[Lord Protector]]. Rogers addressed a cautionary epistle to Cromwell, and assailed him openly from the pulpit. Being denounced as a conspirator in 1654, his house was searched and his papers seized. This drew from him another denunciation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mene, Tekel, Perez: a Letter lamenting over Oliver, Lord Cromwell.''&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March he proclaimed a solemn day of humiliation for the sins of the rulers. His sermon, in which he likened [[Whitehall]] to [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] and demonstrated that Cromwell had broken the first eight commandments (time preventing his proceeding to the last two), procured his arrest and imprisonment in [[Lambeth]]. On 5 February 1655 he was brought from prison to appear before Cromwell. He held by his previous utterances, and desired Cromwell to remember that he must be judged. On 30 March he was moved to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], and on 9 October to the [[Isle of Wight]]. He was released in January 1657, and immediately returned to London.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

The fifth-monarchy men were then deep in conspiracy. Informations were repeatedly laid against Rogers, and on 3 February 1658 he was sent to the [[Tower of London]] on the Protector's warrant. This imprisonment lasted only till 16 April. Four and a half months later Cromwell died. The fifth-monarchy men followed [[Henry Vane the Younger|Sir Henry Vane]] in opposing [[Richard Cromwell]]'s succession, and Rogers denounced him vehemently from the pulpit. The remnant of the Long parliament was recalled to power, and Rogers involved himself in controversy with [[William Prynne]]. Both supported "[[the good old cause]]," but differed in defining it. Prynne remained true to the older ideal of [[limited monarchy]], while Rogers advocated a republic with Christ himself as its invisible sovereign.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Later life==
His faction now wanted him to proceed safely to Ireland to preach the gospel. The insurrection of [[George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer|Sir George Booth]]  intervened, and brought him the post of chaplain in [[Charles Fairfax (soldier)|Charles Fairfax]]'s regiment. He served through the campaign against Booth, and at its conclusion was relieved of his duties in Ireland. In October he was nominated to a lectureship at [[Shrewsbury]], but he was again in Dublin by the end of the year, and was imprisoned there for a time by the orders of the army leaders, after they had dissolved the remnant of the Long parliament. Parliament ordered his release immediately on regaining its ascendancy.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

At the time of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] he moved to the Netherlands. He resumed the study of medicine, at Leyden and Utrecht, and received a Utrecht M.D. In 1662 he returned to England and resided at [[Bermondsey]]. In 1664 he was admitted to an ''[[ad eundem]]'' degree of M.D. at Oxford. His date of death is not known.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; His oldest son and only surviving child was [[Sir John Rogers, 1st Baronet]].&lt;ref name = Kimber&gt;{{cite book | last = Kimber | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Kimber | publisher = Thomas Wotton | editor = Richard Johnson | title = The Baronetage of England: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of All the English Baronets | volume = vol.

'''Kong Chow Temple''' ({{zh|t=岡州古廟|s=冈州古庙|first=t|j=gong1 zau1 gu2 miu6|p=Gāngzhōu Gǔmiào}}) is a temple dedicated to [[Guan Di]], located in the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Chinatownology"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Kong Chow Temple, 冈州古庙 San Francisco, USA | work= | publisher=Chinatownology | url=http://www.chinatownology.com/kong_chow_temple.html | accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The temple was founded, in 1849, by members of the [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] population of San Francisco. In 1854, the temple was renamed Kong Chow Clan Association, to stress the social activities planned by the temple. The Association provided [[social welfare]] and religious needs for the community. Like many buildings in the area, it was destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], and the community worked together to rebuild it&lt;ref name="Chinatownology"/&gt; at its original location, 520 Pine, near St. Mary's Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sf.curbed.com/maps/mapping-chinatown-history |title=Mapping Chinatown History |date= |author= |publisher=Curbed San Francisco |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bess Truman's visit===
[[Bess Truman]] visited the temple in 1948, where she prayed for positive results to her husband, [[Harry S. Truman]]'s presidential run. While there, she also asked for a prediction about the results, due to the public's prediction that he would lose. While there, she held a container of [[Kau cim]] sticks, and shook them until one of the sticks fell to the ground. This stick was then exchanged for a piece of paper, which told a story, offering insight to her question. The prediction was favorable, and Truman would go on to win the presidential election. The prediction slip that was given to her is displayed in the temple.&lt;ref name="Chinatownology"/&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Kong Chow Temple.jpg|thumb|right|Sign detail]]
In 1977, the temple moved to its current building on [[Stockton Street (San Francisco)|Stockton Street]] in Chinatown,&lt;ref name="Chinatownology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fodor's2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fodor's|title=Fodor's Northern California 2009: With Napa, Sonoma, Yosemite, San Francisco &amp; Lake Tahoe|date=6 January 2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=1-4000-0805-0|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the Kong Chow Building. The association works closely with the elderly population, offers scholarships and other charitable projects for the neighborhood. They also organize prayer sessions, and participates in the [[Qing Ming Festival]]. Inside of the temple is a sculpture of Guan Di, which serves as the main altar.&lt;ref name="Chinatownology"/&gt;

'''Leo Garel''' (1917 – July 4, 1999) was an American artist. He illustrated cartoons for such notable magazines as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''.

==Early life==
Garel was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Max and Sarah Garil (née Kramer); his surname was changed from 'Garil' to 'Garel' to sound more American. Both of Garel's parents were [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants from an area of the [[Russian Empire]] near [[Kiev]].

==Career==
Garel was a mentor, instructor and friend to many who exhibited at and made art upstairs at the Lavendar Door, a Stockbridge tradition that was attached to the Austin Riggs Center.  Thus, Garel, in a natural way, helped hundreds of emotionally charged psychiatric patients paint their way out of difficulties that were often too complex for mere therapy to cure. So many of the lives he touched were literally turned around by the knowledge that if they applied themselves their art could gain an audience.  An audience not judgmental, in a field where most work is done alone:  a perfect combination for those trying to overcome the scars left by myriad unusual circumstances too awful to describe here. His art was superb, but his capacity as a lifesaver was unmatched.

==Later years==
He lived the later part of his life in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] until his death from [[cancer]]. He was survived by a brother, two children and two grandchildren.

!| Scientology symbol
||&lt;!--WP:NFC--&gt;
|| The "new-era" Scientology symbol is an "S" curving through two triangles. The "S" stands for Scientology. The top triangle represents a set of Scientology factors — knowledge, responsibility and control. Collectively the first three factors make up the KRC triangle. The lower triangle consists of the ARC triangle of affinity, reality and communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasmembership.org/scientology/symbol.html International Association of Scientologists Membership Homepage], by the International Association of Scientologists&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!| Dianetics symbol
|| [[File:Dianet.png|80px]]
|| The stripes of this symbol represent green for growth, and yellow for life. The four green stripes recall the four divisions of a human's urge to survive which are revealed in [[Dianetics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bonafidescientology.org/Chapter/04/page17.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!| Infinite Dianetics symbol
|| 
|| Scientology teaches that all beings have an "urge towards the infinite." This symbol reflects the belief in Scientology that Dianetic processing (the triangle) aids in the attainment of the infinite.  Some variants of this symbol have an [[infinity symbol]] overlapping a triangle, while others place the infinity within the triangle's boundaries, as on the front cover of some versions of Route to Infinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
|-
!| Operating Thetan symbol
|| 
|| The [[Operating Thetan]] symbol is patterned after the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphic]] of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]]. Scarab beetles were symbolic of resurrection and renewal, and are also an important part of [[Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/carl-teichrib/11scarab.htm Scarab - The Magical Beetle of Egypt], by Carl Teichrib&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NewAge/Hubbard_Occult.htm Factnet Report:  Hubbard and the Occult], by Jon Atack&lt;/ref&gt; The Operating Thetan symbol is prominently displayed on the side of the Scientology cruise ship ''[[Freewinds]]'' (see [[:Image:Freewinds logo.jpg]]).
Operating Thetans are said to be in a spiritual state above ''[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]''.  Scientologists say that one who has achieved the state of Operating Thetan is essentially a being able to operate free of the encumbrances of the material universe, as outlined in ''Scientology 8-8008''.
|-
!| Church of Scientology cross symbol
|align="center" | [[File:Scientology symbol.svg|80px|Stylized version of cross symbol]]
|| This symbol is mainly used to specifically denote the Church of Scientology, and may or may not represent the practice of Scientology in general. The cross's eight points represent the eight [[Scientology beliefs and practices#dynamics|dynamics]] in Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientology.org/faq/background-and-basic-principles/what-is-the-scientology-cross.html&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Scientology cross]] for more details on this symbol.
|-
!| Sea Org symbol
| style="text-align:center"|[[File:Sea Org logo.svg|75px|The Sea Org symbol]]
|| The [[Sea Org]] is the central management organisation of the Church of Scientology. The Sea Org was founded by Scientology leader L. Ron Hubbard in 1968, as an organisation for implementing Scientology technology around the world through the operation of a fleet of ships. Members of the Sea Org sign an employment contract with the organisation for one billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2005-12/21006456.pdf Copy of Sea Org agreement form], [[LA Times]].&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!| L. Ron Hubbard symbol
|| 
|| This symbol is a pictograph made of a cursive "L", "R" and "H". Designed to imitate an [[assay office]] [[hallmark]], it is used to authenticate L. Ron Hubbard's many works.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
|-
!| Church of Spiritual Technology logo
| align="center" | [[File:ChurchOfSpritualTechnologyLogo.svg|80px]]
||
The symbol for the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] is engraved into the Earth's surface in Scientology's [[Trementina Base]], in a mountainous region of New Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065_pf.html  A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles], Washington Post, 11/27/2005&lt;/ref&gt; large enough to be seen from a high altitude.

==Trademarks==
All official symbols of Scientology are trademarks held by the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC). They are said by the center to be used "on Scientology religious materials to signify their authenticity ... and provide a legal mechanism to ensure the spiritual technologies are orthodox and ministered according to Mr. Hubbard's Scripture. These marks also provide the means to prevent anyone from engaging in some distorted use of Mr. Hubbard's writings, thereby ensuring the purity of the religion for all eternity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidmiscavige.rtc.org/ENG/CORP/rtc.htm Biography of David Miscavige], from the Religious Technology Center, a Scientology organization&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''''Madhupayasa''''' is the [[Pali language|Pali]] term for honey-infused ''[[kheer]]'' or ''payasa'', a rice pudding dish dating back to [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]].

The dish is served in Thailand, where it arrived from India. In Thailand, people used to make small [[Glutinous rice|sticky rice balls]] for worship. The flavor and ingredients of these influenced Thai versions of madhupayasa, which is now used in many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies.

== Origin story ==
Sujata, a daughter of wealthy family, prayed to a [[Banyan|Banyan Tree]] for a baby boy to be her family's heir. After her prayer was granted, she gave thanks by returning to the tree with an offering of ''madhupayasa''. [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]], then in his [[Gautama Buddha#Renunciation and ascetic life|ascetic period]], was meditating under the tree and fainting from starvation. She gave him the food and he recovered, beginning to focus on [[Middle Way|moderation]] rather than extreme austerities. This story may have originated before the [[Buddhist Era]] (566 BCE) and become attached to the story of the Buddha.

== Use in Thai Buddhism ==
Madhupayasa use in Thailand started around the period of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] (1351 – 1767 CE), and in the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] period (1782 CE). The ingredients used have changed many times. There are possibly more than 60 types of the pudding, made with different ingredients such as fruits, taro, potato, etc.

A Phra-Song (Thai Buddhist monk) must make the ceremonial offering.  After the end of the ceremony, the puddings are given to monks and to other temples nearby, or can be eaten for both luck and fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phuttha.com/|title=Phuttha|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madchima.org/forum/index.php?topic=608.0|title=Madchima}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.tru.ac.th/inlop/lpcul/305-lpcul06.html|title=Library and Information Technology University Thepsatri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/sujata-s-great-gift-of-madhupayasa/story-AFY4jMKyBD4fy1f32UZv6K.html|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|title=Sujata's great gift of madhupayasa|date=24 January 2012|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swearer|first1=Donald K.|title=Becoming the Buddha : the ritual of image consecration in Thailand|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9780691114354|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitra|first1=Rajendralala|title=Buddha Gaya : the hermitage of Sakya Muni|date=2005|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|location=New Delhi|isbn=8177420623|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Mahāmudrā''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ''Chagchen'', [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''phyag chen'', contraction of ''Chagya Chenpo'', Wylie: ''phyag rgya chen po'') literally means "great seal" or "great imprint" and refers to the fact that "all phenomena inevitably are stamped by the fact of wisdom and emptiness inseparable".&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. vii, ix&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mahāmudrā is a multivalent term of great importance in later [[Indian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] which "also occurs occasionally in Hindu and [[Tangmi|East Asian Buddhist esotericism]]."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jackson |first=Roger R. |author-link=Roger R. Jackson |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=Mahāmudrā |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | edition = 2|url= |date=2005 |publisher=|volume= |location= |oclc= |pages=5596 |isbn=0-02-865733-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name also refers to  a body of teachings representing the culmination of all the practices of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism, who believe it to be the quintessential message of all of their sacred texts. The ''mudra'' portion denotes that in an adept's experience of reality, each phenomenon appears vividly, and the ''maha'' portion refers to the fact that it is beyond concept, imagination, and projection.&lt;ref name="Ray"&gt;[[Reginald Ray]], ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Mahāmudrā is also known as the teaching called “[[Sahaja|Sahajayoga]]” or “Co-emergence Yoga”.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], particularly the [[Kagyu]] school, this is sometimes seen as a different Buddhist vehicle ([[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]), the "Sahajayana" (Tibetan: ''lhen chig kye pa''), also known as the vehicle of self-liberation. &lt;ref&gt;Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, Mind at Ease: Self-liberation Through Mahamudra Meditation, pp 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and semantic field==
[[File:Sharaha British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A scroll painting of Saraha, surrounded by other Mahāsiddhas, probably 18th century and now in the British Museum]]

The usage and meaning of the term ''mahāmudrā'' evolved over the course of hundreds of years of [[India]]n and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] history, and as a result, the term may refer variously to "[[mudra|a ritual hand-gesture]], one of a sequence of 'seals' in [[tantra|Tantric]] practice, the nature of reality as [[Shunyata|emptiness]], a [[meditation]] procedure focusing on the nature of Mind, an innate blissful [[gnosis]] cognizing emptiness [[Nondualism#Nondual religious and spiritual traditions and teachings|nondually]], or the supreme attainment of [[buddhahood]] at the culmination of the Tantric path."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], the Indian theoretical sources of the mahāmudrā tradition are [[Yogacara]] [[Tathagatagarbha]] (Buddha-nature) texts such as the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra]] and the [[Uttaratantra]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual practice and lineage of mahāmudrā can be traced back to wandering [[mahasiddhas]] or great adepts during the Indian [[Pala Dynasty]] (760-1142), beginning with the 8th century siddha [[Saraha]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Saraha|Saraha's]] ''Dohas'' (songs or poems in rhyming couplets) are the earliest mahamudra literature extant, and promote some of the unique features of mahamudra such as the importance of [[Pointing-out instruction]] by a [[guru]], the non-dual nature of mind, and the negation of conventional means of achieving enlightenment such as samatha-vipasyana meditation, monasticism, rituals, tantric practices and doctrinal study in favor of mahamudra 'non-meditation' and 'non-action'.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Indian masters such as Padmavajra, [[Tilopa]], and [[Gampopa]] incorporated mahamudra into tantric, monastic and traditional meditative frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology in the tantras===
It has been speculated that the first use of the term was in the c. 7th century ''Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa'', in which it refers to a hand gesture.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; The term is mentioned with increasing frequency as Buddhist tantra developed further, particularly in the [[Yogatantra]]s, where it appears in ''Tattvasaṁgraha'' and the ''Vajraśekhara-tantra''. Here it also denotes a hand gesture, now linked to three other hand mudrās—the action (''karma''), pledge (''samaya''), and ''dharma'' mudrās—but also involves "mantra recitations and visualizations that symbolize and help to effect one’s complete identification with a deity’s divine form or awakening Mind (bodhicitta)."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; In [[Mahayoga|Mahāyoga]] tantras such as the [[Guhyasamāja tantra]], it "has multiple meanings, including a contemplation-recitation conducive to the adamantine body, speech, and Mind of the tathāgatas; and the object-—emptiness-—through realization of which 'all is accomplished,'" and it is also used as a synonym for awakened Mind, which is said to be "primordially unborn, empty, unarisen, nonexistent, devoid of self, naturally luminous, and immaculate like the sky."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

In the Yoginī or [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]s, mahāmudrā "emerges as a major Buddhist concept."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&gt; As scholar Roger Jackson explains,
{{quote|Though still connected there to creation-stage maṇḍala practice, it is more often related to completion-stage meditations involving the manipulation of mental and physical forces in the subtle body so as to produce a divine form and a luminous, blissful, nonconceptual gnosis. In the completion-stage discussions in such Tantric systems as the Hevajra, Cakrasaṁvara, and Kālacakra, mahāmudrā has three especially important meanings. First, it may refer to a practitioner’s female consort in sexual yoga practices. Second, as before, it is one of a sequence of mudrās corresponding to various Buddhist concepts, experiences, and path-stages. Here, though, it usually is the culmination of the series, a direct realization of the nature of Mind and reality that transcends and perfects other, more conventional seals, including those involving actual or visualized sexual yoga. Third, Mahāmudrā by itself connotes the ultimate truth, realization, or achievement of yoginī Tantra practice: the great seal that marks all phenomena and experiences; a synonym for suchness, sameness, emptiness, space, and the goddess Nairātmyā (no-self); unchanging bliss beyond object and subject, shape, thought, or expression; and the ultimate gnostic attainment, ''mahāmudrā-siddhī''.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;}}

[[Thubten Yeshe]] explains: "Mahāmudrā means absolute seal, totality, unchangeability. Sealing something implies that you cannot destroy it. Mahāmudrā was not created or invented by anybody; therefore it cannot be destroyed. It is absolute reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeshe|first=Lama Thubten|title=Becoming the Compassion Buddha: Tantric Mahamudra for Everyday Life|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2003|page=21|isbn=0-86171-343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aryadeva]] summarises: "The discussion of how to attain mahāmudrā entails methods for meditating on Mind itself as something having voidness as its nature".&lt;ref name="Gyatso"&gt;quoted in {{cite book|last=Gyatso|first=Tenzin |author2=Alexander Berzin|title=The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=New York|year=1997|page=119|isbn=1-55939-072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian sources ==
[[File:Tilopa.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Tilopa]].]]
[[File:Maitripa.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Maitripa]].]]
All of the various Tibetan mahāmudrā lineages originated with the [[Mahasiddha]]s of the [[Pala Empire]] of 8-12th century India. The earliest figure is the tenth century poet yogi [[Saraha]], and his student Nagarjuna (not to be confused with the earlier philosopher).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Saraha's collections of poems and songs, mostly composed in the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages#Apabhramsa|apabhramsa]] language are the earliest Indian sources for mahāmudrā teachings, aside from the [[Buddhist Tantras|Buddhist tantras]].   

Other influential Indian mahasiddhas include [[Tilopa]], his student [[Naropa]] and Naropa's consort [[Niguma]]. Tilopa's "Ganges Mahāmudrā" song is a widely taught short mahāmudrā text. Niguma is an important source for the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] lineage. 

Tilopa's pupil [[Maitripada|Maitripa]] became the principal master of mahāmudrā in India during his time and most lineages of mahāmudrā are traced from Maitripa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Maitripa was a very influential figure of the eleventh century, a scholar and tantrika who widely taught the [[Ratnagotravibhāga|Ratnagotravibhaga]], a text which is widely seen as bridging the sutric Mahayana and [[Anuttarayoga Tantra|Anuttarayogatantra]] views.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He composed commentaries on the buddhist dohas, and his works include a collection of 26 texts on "non-conceptual realization" (''amanasikara''), which are a key Indian source of mahāmudrā teachings that blend sutra and tantra and teach an instantaneous approach to awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Mathes, Klaus-Dieter, A Fine Blend of Mahamudra and Madhyamaka: Maitripa's Collection of Texts on Non-Conceptual Realization (Amanasikara), (Sitzungsberichte Der Philosophisch-Historischen Klasse), 2016, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Maitripa described mahāmudrā as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mahāmudrā, that which is unified and beyond the mind, is clear yet thoughtless, pervasive, and vast like space. Its aspect of great compassion is apparent yet devoid of any nature. Manifesting clearly like the moon in water; It is beyond all terms, boundaries or center. Polluted by nothing, it is stainless and beyond hope and fear. It cannot be described, like the dream of a mute."&lt;ref&gt;Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang; Khenpo Konchok Tamphel (translator), Water Crystal: A commentary on the Ganges Mahamudra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One of Maitripa's students was the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] scholar [[Atiśa|Atisha]], who taught mahāmudrā to his pupil [[Dromtön|Dromton]] (1004-63) who decided not to make mahāmudrā a part of the Kadam tradition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another pupil of Maitripa, [[Marpa Lotsawa]], also introduced mahāmudrā to Tibet and his disciple [[Milarepa]] is also a central figure of this lineage. Another important figure in the introduction of mahāmudrā to the area is Vajrapani, yet another student of Maitripa.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His student, Asu, also was a teacher of [[Rechung Dorje Drakpa|Rechungpa]] (1084-1161), one of Milarepa's pupils.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Gampopa]], a key figure of the Kagyu school, refers to three important cycles of Indian texts which discuss Mahāmudrā as his main sources:&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Mathes, Klaus-Dieter, A Fine Blend of Mahamudra and Madhyamaka: Maitripa's Collection of Texts on Non-Conceptual Realization (Amanasikara), (Sitzungsberichte Der Philosophisch-Historischen Klasse), 2016, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The Seven [or eight] Siddhiḥ Texts" ''(Saptasiddhiḥ,'' [[Tibetic languages|Tib]]. ''Grub pa sde bdun),'' which include Padmavajra's ''Guhyasiddhi'' and Indrabhuti's ''Jñanasiddhi.''
* "The Cycle of Six Heart Texts" or "Six works on essential meaning" (''Snying po skor drug''), including Saraha's ''Dohakosha'' and Nagarjunagarbha's ''Caturmudraniscaya''.
* Maitripa's "Cycle of Teachings on Non-Cognition" (''Yid la mi byed pa 'i chos skor'').

This classification existed since the time of [[Buton Rinchen Drub|Bu ston Rin chen grub]] (1290-1364).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Indian sources of mahāmudrā were later compiled by the [[Karmapa|seventh Karmapa]] ''Chos grags rgya mtsho'' (1454- 1506) into a three-volume compilation entitled "The Indian Mahāmudrā Treatises" ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]. ''Phyag rgya chen po 'i rgya gzhung''). This compilation includes the above three collections, along with the ''Anavilatantra'' and texts that teach a non-tantric "instantaneous"approach to the practice by an Indian master named Sakyasribhadra.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 65.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Tibetan traditions==
[[File:Bhutanese painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan]]
Mahāmudrā is most well known as a teaching within the [[Kagyu]] school of Tibetan Buddhism. However the [[Gelug]] and [[Sakya]] schools also practice mahāmudrā. The [[Nyingma]] school and [[Bon]] practise [[Dzogchen]], a cognate but distinct method of direct introduction to the principle of [[śūnyatā]]. Nyingma students may also receive supplemental training in mahāmudrā, and the [[Palyul]] Nyingma lineage preserves a lineage of the "Union of Mahāmudrā and Ati Yoga" originated by [[Karma Chagme]].

===Kagyu tradition===
[[File:Gampopa portrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Gampopa]] (1079–1153), Kagyu founder]]

[[Gampopa]] Sönam Rinchen (1079-1153), a Kadam monk who was a student of the lay tantric yogi Milarepa, is a key figure in the Kagyu tradition. He is responsible for much of the development of Kagyu monastic institutions and for recording the teachings of the lineage in writing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. v-vii.&lt;/ref&gt; He synthesized the Mahayana Kadam teachings with the tantric teachings he received from Milarepa and developed a unique system of mahāmudrā which he often taught without tantric [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]], relying instead on [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mahamudra is defined by [[Gampopa]] as "the realization of the natural state as awareness-emptiness, absolutely clear and transparent, without root". Gampopa also states that mahamudra is "the [[Prajnaparamita|paramita of wisdom]], beyond thought and expression."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gampopa taught mahamudra in a five part system to his disciples, one of his most well known disciples, [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] (1110-1170) became a very successful teacher who continued to teach this five part system and eight "junior" kagyu lineages are traced to him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This “Five-Part Mahāmudrā” system became one of the main ways that Mahāmudrā was transmitted in Kagyu lineages after Gampopa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   

The tradition which follows Gampopa is called [[Dagpo Kagyu|Dakpo Kagyu]]. A key Mahāmudrā author of this tradition is [[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal|Dakpo Tashi Namgyal]], well known for his ''Mahāmudrā: The Moonlight.'' [[Karma Kagyu]] [[Karmapa|Karmapas]] like the ninth Karmapa [[Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama|Wangchuk Dorje]] also composed important Mahāmudrā texts. A development of these later mahāmudrā writers is the integration of the common Mahayana teachings on [[samatha]] and [[Vipaśyanā|vipasyana]] as preliminaries to the practice of mahāmudrā.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Three types of teaching====
The Kagyu lineage divides the mahāmudrā teachings into three types, "sutra mahāmudrā," "tantra mahāmudrā," and "essence mahāmudrā," in a formulation that appears to originate with [[Jamgon Kongtrul]].&lt;ref&gt;"Blending the Sūtras with the Tantras: The Influence of Maitrīpa and his Circle on the formation of Sūtra Mahāmudrā in the Kagyu Schools" by Klaus-Dieter Mathes in ''Tibetan Buddhist Literature and Praxis : Studies in its Formative Period, 900-1400, PIATS 2003: Tibetan Studies: Proceedings of the Tenth seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies''. Oxford: 2003 pg 201&lt;/ref&gt; Sutra mahāmudrā, as the name suggests, draws its philosophical view and meditation techniques from the sutrayana tradition. Tantric mahāmudrā employs such [[tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric techniques]] as [[tummo]], [[dream yoga]], and [[ösel (yoga)|ösel]], three of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]]. Essence mahāmudrā is based on the direct instruction of a qualified lama, known as [[pointing-out instruction]].

====Blending of sutra and tantra====
The particular Kagyu propensity to blend sutric and tantric traditions of mahāmudrā became a point of controversy in 13th century Tibet. The possibility of sudden liberating realization and the practicing of mahāmudrā without the need for [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|tantric initiation or empowerment]] was seen as a result of this blending as well as a development stemming from Sino-Tibetan influences.&lt;ref&gt;Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, Bkra-śis-rnam-rgyal (Dwags-po Paṇ-chen) (2006), ''Mahamudra: The Moonlight - Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'', Wisdom Publications, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathes2" /&gt;{{refn|This is a reference to [[Moheyan|Hwashang]] and the [[Council of Lhasa]], in which Indian Buddhism and its gradual approach was chosen over the sudden approach of [[Chan Buddhism]]. See Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, Bkra-śis-rnam-rgyal (Dwags-po Paṇ-chen) (2006), ''Mahamudra: The Moonlight - Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'', Wisdom Publications, p.104-105.|group=note}}

According to Klaus-Dieter Mathes, the Kagyu tradition sought to base their teachings in Indian works:
{{quote| Later Bka´ brgyud pas defended their not specifically Tantric or sūtra mahāmudrā tradition by adducing Indian sources such as the Tattvadaśakaṭīkā or the Tattvāvatāra. These belong to a genre of literature which the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454–1506) called “Indian mahāmudrā-Works” (phyag chen rgya gzhung).&lt;ref name="Mathes" /&gt;}}

Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha's dohās, it is simply the realization of Mind's co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. [[Maitripada|Maitrīpa]] (ca. 1007– 085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. 

It is thus legitimate for later Kagyupas to speak of Saraha's mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.&lt;ref name="Mathes"&gt;"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa."

==== Kagyu mahāmudrā lineages ====
[[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama]] identified a number of mahāmudrā lineages, according to their main practices for achieving mahāmudrā. In his teachings on the First Panchen Lama's root text and auto-commentary the [[14th Dalai Lama]] delineated the Kagyu practice lineages as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gyatso|first=Tenzin |author2=Alexander Berzin|title=The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=New York|year=1997|pages=262–271|isbn=1-55939-072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Karma Kagyu]] "Simultaneously Arising as Merged" tradition - This is the tradition introduced by [[Gampopa]] with a main practice of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].
* The [[Shangpa Kagyu]] "Amulet Box" tradition - This tradition came from [[Khyungpo Naljor]] and its main practice is the Six yogas of [[Niguma]].
* The [[Drikung Kagyu]] "Possessing Five" tradition - [[Jigten Sumgön|Jigten Gonpo]] founded the school and mahāmudrā lineage whose main practice is known as the "fivefold mahāmudrā" consisting of bodhicitta, [[yidam]] practice, [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]], mahamudra and dedication.
* The [[Drukpa Lineage]] "Six Spheres of Equal Taste" tradition - [[Tsangpa Gyare]] founded this tradition which encompasses a range of practices, including the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].
* The [[Dagpo Kagyu]] "Four Syllables" tradition - This is the tradition that derives from [[Maitripada|Maitripa]]. The four syllables are ''a-ma-na-si'' which make up the Sanskrit word meaning 'not to take to mind' and passed through the [[Dagpo Kagyu]] branches, i.e. any that descend from the teachings of [[Tilopa]] rather than those of [[Niguma]], which in practice means all but the [[Shangpa Kagyu]].

===Gelug tradition===
[[File:4th Panchen Lama.jpg|thumb|200px|The Panchen Lama, [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen]]]]
The Gelug school's mahamudra tradition is traditionally traced back to the school's founder [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] (1357- 1419), who was said to have received oral transmission from [[Manjushri]], and it is also traced to the Indian masters like Saraha through the [[Drikung]] Kagyu master Chennga Chokyi Gyalpo who transmitted Kagyu Mahamudra teachings (probably the five fold Mahamudra) to Tsongkhapa.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jagchen Jampa Pal (1310-1391), a prominent holder of the 'jag pa tradition of the Shangpa teachings, was also one of the teachers of rje Tsongkhapa.

However, a specifically "Gelug" Mahamudra system was only recorded at the time of [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama]] (sometimes named the "1st Panchen Lama", 1570-1662), who wrote a root Mahamudra text on the "''Highway of the Conquerors: Root Verses for the Precious Geden [Gelug] Kagyu [Oral] Transmission of Mahāmudrā''" (''dGe-ldan bka'-brgyud rin-po-che'i phyag-chen rtsa-ba rgyal-ba'i gzhung-lam'') and its auto commentary (the ''Yang gsal sgron me, "Lamp re-illuminating Mahamudra"''), which is still widely taught and commented upon.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/tantra-texts/root-text-for-mahamudra Berzin, A root text for Mahamudra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thuken Losang Chokyi Nyima, The Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems, p 620.

&lt;/ref&gt; Before this work, Gelug writings on Mahamudra tended to follow orthodox Kagyu teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155''.&lt;/ref&gt; This text and its auto commentary have become a central work on Mahamudra in the Gelug school. The current [[14th Dalai Lama]] and [[Lama Yeshe]] are some of the modern Gelug figures which have written commentaries on this key Gelug Mahamudra text.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Yeshe, Mahamudra: How to Discover Our True Nature&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama &amp;nbsp;(Author), Alexander Berzin (Author), The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panchen Lama [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Chökyi Gyaltsen]], himself was influenced by Kagyu teachings, and wished to imitate great siddhas like [[Milarepa]] and Sabaripa.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Jan, Enlightened Beings: Life Stories from the Ganden Oral Tradition, p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He names various Mahamudra and Dzogchen lineages in his text, and comes to the conclusion that "their definitive meanings are all seen to come to the same intended point."&lt;ref&gt;Gyumed Khensur Lobsang Jampa; The Easy Path: Illuminating the First Panchen Lama's Secret Instructions, Calm abiding.&lt;/ref&gt; Chökyi Gyaltsen also sides with the Kagyu school against Sakya, arguing that there is a sutra level of Mahamudra.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, in his account, sutra Mahamudra is particularly associated with a gradual path and his presentation of insight practice (''vipasyana'') is uniquely Gelug.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Yongdzin Yeshe Gyaltsen (also known as Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, tutor of the 8th Dalai Lama, 1713–93) composed a commentary on [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Chökyi Gyaltsen]]'s Mahamudra text, entitled "The Lamp of the Clear and Excellent Path of the Oral Tradition Lineage" (''Yongs-'dzin ye shes rgyal mtshan'').&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan, Balancing the Mind: A Tibetan Buddhist Approach To Refining Attention, 2005, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; He also comments on Mahamudra in the context of Lama Chopa Guru Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Kachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, David Gonzales (translator), Manjushri's Innermost Secret: A Profound Commentary of Oral Instructions on the Practice of Lama Chopa&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sakya mahāmudrā===
Following the great [[Sakya]] exegete and philosopher [[Sakya Pandita|Sakya pandita]] (1182-1251), mahāmudrā in the Sakya school is seen as the highest [[Tantra|tantric]] realization, which means that mahāmudrā practice is only taken on after having been [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|initiated into tantric practice]] and practicing the creation and completion stages of [[deity yoga]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/tantra/mahamudra-dzogchen/what-is-dzogchen|title=What Is Dzogchen?|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|date=1995, revised July 2006|publisher=Study Buddhism|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stenzel, Julia, The Mahåmudrå of Sakya Pandita, Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies Volume 15 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In his "A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes" (''Sdom gsum rab dbye''), Sakya Pandita criticized the non-tantric "sutra" mahamudra approaches of the Kagyu teachers such as [[Gampopa]] who taught mahāmudrā to those who had not received tantric initiations and based themselves on the [[Ratnagotravibhāga|Uttaratantrasastra]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He argued that the term mahāmudrā does not occur in the sutras, only in the highest class of tantras and that only through tantric initiation does mahāmudrā arise: "Our own Great Seal consists of Gnosis risen from initiation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Sakya Pandita, through the four empowerments or initiations given by a qualified guru, most practitioners will experience a likeness of true mahāmudrā, though a few rare individuals experience true mahāmudrā.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the practice of the creation and completion stages of tantra, the tantrika develops this partial understanding of bliss and emptiness into a completely non-dual gnosis, the real Mahamudra, which corresponds to the attainment of the Path of Seeing, the first Bodhisattva bhumi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Sakya, this insight known as mahāmudrā is described variously as "the unity of lucidity and emptiness, the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of bliss and emptiness" and also "the natural reality (''chos nyid gnyug ma'') which is emptiness possessing the excellence of all aspects."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Practices and methods ==
A common schema used in the Kagyu school is that of Ground ([[buddha-nature]], [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]), Path (practice) and Fruition mahāmudrā ([[Buddhahood]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The advice and guidance of a qualified [[guru|teacher]] is considered to be very important in developing faith and interest in the dharma as well as in learning and practicing mahāmudrā meditation. Most often mahāmudrā (particularly essence mahāmudrā) is preceded by meeting with a lama and receiving [[pointing-out instruction]]. Some parts of the transmission are done verbally and through [[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerments]] and "reading transmissions." A student typically goes through various tantric practices before undertaking the "formless" practices described below; the latter are classified as part of "essence mahāmudrā."&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 273-274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ngondro]] are the preliminary practices common to both mahāmudrā and [[dzogchen]] traditions and include practices such as contemplating the "four thoughts that turn the mind", prostrations, and [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]]. According to one scholar, most people have difficulty beginning directly with formless practices and lose enthusiasm doing so, so the tantric practices work as a complement to the formless ones.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 272-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to divide the practice of mahāmudrā is between the tantric mahāmudrā practices and the sutra practices. Tantric mahāmudrā practices involves practicing [[deity yoga]] with a [[yidam]] as well as [[subtle body]] practices like the [[Six Yogas of Naropa|six yogas of Naropa]] and can only be done after [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 271-272.&lt;/ref&gt; After the preliminary practices, the [[Kagyu]] school's sutra mahāmudrā practice is often divided into the ordinary or essential meditation practices and the extraordinary meditation practices. The ordinary practices are [[samatha]] (calming) and [[vipassana|vipasyana]] (special insight). The extraordinary practices include "formless" practices like 'one taste yoga' and 'non-meditation'. The tradition also culminates with certain special enlightenment and post-enlightenment practices.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reginald Ray]], the "formless" practices, also called "Essence mahamudra," is when "one engages directly in practices of abandoning discursive thinking and resting the mind in the clear, luminous awareness that is mahamudra."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that preparatory practices and "form" practices like deity yoga and [[Vipassanā|vipasyana]] are needed is because formless practices are quite difficult and subtle, and most practitioners are not able to enter into the simple essence of mind successfully without considerable mental preparation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Four yogas and five paths===
In the [[Dagpo Kagyu]] tradition as presented by [[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal]], Mahāmudrā is divided into four distinct phases known as the four yogas of mahāmudrā (S. ''catvāri mahāmudrā yoga'', {{bo|w=phyag rgya chen po'i rnal 'byor bzhi}}). They are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Mahamudra: The Moonlight: Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'' by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal Wisdom Publications; 2nd ed: 2006 {{ISBN|9780861712991}} pg 463&lt;/ref&gt;

# one-pointedness (S. ''ekāgra'', T. ''rtse gcig'')
# simplicity (S. ''niṣprapāncha'', T. ''spros bral'') "free from complexity" or "not elaborate."
# one taste (S. ''samarasa'', T. ''ro gcig'')
# non-meditation (S. ''abhāvanā'', ''sgom med'') The state of not holding to either an object of meditation nor to a meditator. Nothing further needs to be 'meditated upon' or 'cultivated at this stage.{{refn|group=note|See also [[Shikan-taza]], [[Turiya]], [[Sahaja]], and [[choiceless awareness]].}}

These stages parallel the [[Semde#Four Yogas of Semde|four yogas of Dzogchen semde]]. The four yogas of mahāmudrā have been correlated with the Mahāyāna [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|five paths]] (S. ''pañcamārga''), according to [[Tsele Natsok Rangdröl|Tsele Natsok Rangdrol]] (''Lamp of Mahāmudrā''):

*[[Ngöndro|Outer and inner preliminary practices]]: path of accumulation
*One-pointedness: path of application
*Simplicity: paths of seeing and most of the path of meditation (bhūmis one through six)
*One taste: last part of the path of meditation, most of the path of no-more-learning (bhūmis seven through nine)
*Nonmeditation: last part of the path of no-more learning (tenth bhūmi) and buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)

[[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal|Dakpo Tashi Namgyal]] meanwhile in his ''Moonlight of Mahāmudrā'' correlates them as follows:

*Outer and inner preliminary practices and one-pointedness: path of accumulation
*Simplicity: path of application
*One taste: paths of meditation &amp; no-more-learning
*Nonmeditation: path of no more learning &amp; buddhahood

According to Je Gyare as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (''Moonlight of Mahāmudrā''):

*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and part of the path no-more-learning (bhūmis two through eight)
*Nonmeditation: rest of path of no-more-learning, buddhahood (bhūmis nine through thirteen)

According to Drelpa Dönsal as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (''Moonlight of Mahāmudrā''):

*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and no-more-learning (bhūmis two through ten)
*Nonmeditation: buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)

===Ordinary meditation practices===
As in most Buddhist schools of meditation, the basic meditative practice of mahāmudrā is divided into two approaches: [[samatha|śamatha]] ("tranquility","calm abiding") and [[vipassana|vipaśyanā]] ("special insight"). This division is contained in the instructions given by [[Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama|Wangchuk Dorje]], the ninth [[Karmapa]], in a series of texts he composed; these epitomize teachings given on mahāmudrā practice.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Śamatha====
[[File:Karmapa9.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Wangchuk Dorje]] (1556–1603), 9th [[Karmapa]], composed various influential texts on Mahamudra.]]
Often associated with the yoga of one-pointedness, mahāmudrā śamatha contains instructions on ways to sit with proper posture, called the seven point posture of Vairocana.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The mahāmudrā shamatha teachings also include instructions on how to work with a mind that is beset with various impediments to focusing,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 274-275.&lt;/ref&gt; such as raising the gaze when one feels dull or sleepy, and lowering it again when one feels overly excited. Two types of mahāmudrā śamatha are generally taught: śamatha with support and śamatha without support.

Mahāmudrā śamatha with support involves the use of an object of attention to which the meditator continually returns his or her attention. Wangchuk Dorje mentions that  one can use a wide variety of supports, visual objects like a candle flame, but also sounds, a smell, etc.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

One of the main techniques involved in Mahāmudrā śamatha with support is [[Anapanasati|mindfulness of breathing]] (S. ānāpānasmṛti). Mindfulness of breathing practice is considered to be a profound means of calming the mind to prepare it for the stages that follow. For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahāmudrā, mindfulness of breathing is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipaśyanā on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra tradition by Dan Brown. Wisdom Publications: 2006 pg 221-34&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent contemporary Kagyu/Nyingma master [[Chogyam Trungpa]], expressing the Kagyu Mahāmudrā view, wrote, "your breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is the portrait of your mind in some sense... The traditional recommendation in the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyu-Nyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath."&lt;ref&gt;''The Path is the Goal'', in ''The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Vol Two''. Shambhala Publications. pgs 49, 51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shamatha without support or objectless meditation refers to resting the mind without the use of a specific focal point or object of concentration. According to Reginald Ray, in this practice "the eyes are open and one gazes straight ahead into space, directing one's mind to nothing at all."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

In Gelug sutra mahāmudrā, the samatha techniques are similar to the Kagyu presentation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

====Vipaśyanā====
The detailed instructions for the insight practices are what make mahāmudrā (and [[Dzogchen]]) unique in Tibetan Buddhism. In Mahāmudrā vipaśyanā, Wangchuck Dorje gives ten separate contemplations that are used to disclose the essential mind within; five practices of "looking at" and five of "[[pointing-out instruction|pointing out]]" the nature of mind. They all presume some level of stillness cultivated by mahāmudrā shamatha. In retreat, each contemplation would typically be assigned specific time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five practices for "looking at" the nature of the mind are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 276-277.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Looking at the settled mind.'' One repeatedly looks at the mind's still state, possibly posing questions to arouse awareness, such as "what is its nature? It is perfectly still?"
* ''Looking at the moving or thinking mind.'' One tries to closely examine the arising, existence, and ceasing of thoughts, possibly posing oneself questions so as to better understand this process, such as "how does it arise? What is its nature?"
* ''Looking at the mind reflecting appearances.'' One looks at the way in which phenomena of the external senses occur in experience. Usually, a visual object is taken as the subject. One repeatedly looks at the object, trying to see just how that appearance arises in the mind, and understand the nature of this process. One possibly asks questions such as "what is their nature? How do they arise, dwell, and disappear? Is their initial appearance different from how they eventually understood?"
* ''Looking at the mind in relation to the body.'' One investigates questions such as "what is the mind? What is the body? Is the body our sensations? What is the relation of our sensations to our mental image of our body?"
* ''Looking at the settled and moving minds together.'' When the mind is still, one looks at that, and when the mind is in motion, one looks at that. One investigates whether these two stages are the same or different, asking questions such as "if they are the same, what is the commonality? If different, what is the difference?"

The practices for "pointing out the nature of mind" build on these. One now looks again at each of the five, but this time repeatedly asks oneself "What is it?" In these practices, one attempts to recognize and realize the exact nature of, respectively:
* The settled mind,
* The moving or thinking mind,
* The mind reflecting appearances,
* The relation of mind and body,
* The settled and thinking mind together.

The above practices do not have specific "answers"; they serve to provoke one to scrutinize experience more and more closely over time, seeking to understand what is really there.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelug sutra Mahāmudrā, as presented by [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Chökyi Gyaltsen]], practices a unique Gelug style of doing [[vipaśyanā]], based primarily on Gelug [[Madhyamaka]]. According to Roger Jackson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an actual meditation session, this involves, first of all, analyzing whether the meditator who has achieved tranquil equipoise actually can be found in an ultimate sense. Seeking the meditator both within and apart from the various elements, one encounters the meditator nowhere; seeking ultimacy in phenomena (dharmas), one encounters it nowhere. Thus, one comes to abide in a space-like awareness of the void nature of both the person and dharmas. Next (or, alternatively) one examines more carefully whether the mind itself can be found in an ultimate sense: it is discovered to have the conventional nature of a flow of awareness and clarity, but no ultimacy, no true existence. In short, one should recognize that any existent that arises, whether an object of the mind or the mind itself, is merely conceptual, is void and—as Chos rgyan quotes his guru, Sangs rgyas ye shes, as saying—”When . . . you are equipoised one-pointedly on that, marvelous!” (GBZL: 4a; trans. Dalai Lama and Berzin: 100; YSGM: 30b). In the period between meditation sessions (rjes thob), one should see all appearances as deceptive (sgyu ma), as existing differently than they appear, but one must at the same time recognize that their ultimate voidness does not preclude their conventional functioning, any more than conventional functioning gives them true existence.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 178''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Extraordinary meditation practices===
The practice of ordinary meditation eventually leads one to the yoga of simplicity, which according to Gampopa, is "understanding the essential state of that awareness [of one-pointedness] as nonarising [emptiness], which transcends conceptual modes of reality and unreality."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; One sees all phenomena just as they are, non-conceptually, beyond extremes of existence and non-existence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====One taste====
According to [[Gampopa]] the yoga of one taste is "understanding diverse appearances as being one, from the standpoint of their intrinsic nature."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, p 280.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] says: &lt;blockquote&gt;By meditating on the one taste of all things, the meditator will cognize the one taste of all these things. The diversity of appearances and nonappearances, mind and emptiness, emptiness and non-emptiness, Are all of one taste, undifferentiable in their intrinsic emptiness. Understanding and lack of understanding are of one taste; Meditation and nonmeditation are nondifferentiable; Meditation and absence of meditation are unified into one taste; Discrimination and lack of discrimination are one taste In the expanse of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Non-meditation====
[[Gampopa]] states that non-meditation is "an unceasing realization of the union of appearance and its intrinsic emptiness."&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, p 282&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] says: &lt;blockquote&gt;By perfecting this [nonmeditation] stage the meditator attains naked, unsupported awareness. This nondiscriminatory awareness is the meditation! By transcending the duality of meditation and meditator, external and internal realities, the meditating awareness dissolves itself into its luminous clarity. Transcending the intellect, it is without the duality of meditation and post-meditation. Such is the quintessence of mind. &lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pp 282-283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Six Words of Advice===
{{Main|Tilopa#Six_Words_of_Advice}}
[[Tilopa]] was a Bengali [[mahasiddha]] who developed the mahāmudrā method around 1,000 C.E. Tilopa gave [[Naropa]], his successor, a teaching on mahāmudrā meditation called the Six Words of Advice.

In the following chart a translation is given of the Tilopa's Six Words of Advice.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Ken McLeod]], the text contains exactly six words; the two English translations given in the following table are both attributed to him.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree is an important source of forage for bees, especially during the dry season and in the beginning of the wet season.

Like most plants in the [[Fabaceae]] family, ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' fertilizes the soil via [[nitrogen fixing bacteria]].&lt;ref name="exploitation"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exploitation of the potential of multipurpose trees and shrubs in agroforestry |year=1987 |publisher=worldagroforestry.org |isbn=929059036X |url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/units/library/books/PDFs/07_Agroforestry_a_decade_of_development.pdf |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tree is useful in fighting soil erosion and for reforestation.

''Mimosa tenuiflora'' is a very good source of fuel wood and works very well for making posts,&lt;ref name="exploitation"/&gt; most likely because of its high tannin content (16%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rivera-Arce E |title=Pharmacognostical studies of the plant drug Mimosae tenuiflorae cortex |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=400–8 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17709219 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2007.06.023 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Gattuso M |author3=Alvarado R |display-authors=3 |last4=Zárate |first4=E. |last5=Agüero |first5=J. |last6=Feria |first6=I. |last7=Lozoya |first7=X.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which protects it from rot.  Due to its high [[tannin]] content, the bark of the tree is widely used as a natural dye and in leather production.  It is used to make bridges, buildings, fences, furniture and wheels.  It is an excellent source of [[charcoal]] and at least one study has been done to see why this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lazaro Benedito da Silva |publisher=kew.org |url=http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/science/tropamerica/Prance_reports/Lazaro_Silva.doc |accessdate=2008-04-20 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090124204156/http://www.kew.org/science/tropamerica/Prance_reports/Lazaro_Silva.doc |archivedate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healing properties of the tree make it useful in treating domestic animals.  A solution of the leaves or bark can also be used for washing animals in the prevention of parasites.  Because the tree keeps most of its leaves during the dry season, it is an important source of shade for animals and plants during that time.

==Chemistry==
The bark is known to be rich in [[tannin]]s, [[saponin]]s, [[alkaloid]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[phytosterol]]s, [[glucoside]]s, [[xylose]], [[rhamnose]], [[arabinose]], [[lupeol]], [[methoxychalcone]]s, and [[kukulkanin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Camargo-Ricalde SL. |title=Description, distribution, anatomy, chemical composition and uses of Mimosa tenuiflora (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) in Mexico |journal=Rev Biol Trop. |date=Dec 2000  |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=939–54 |pmid=11487939}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, ''Mimosa hostilis'' contains [[labdane]] [[diterpenoid]]s.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

''Mimosa tenuiflora'' is an [[entheogen]] used by the Jurema Cult (''O Culto da Jurema'') in northeastern Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jurema Ritual in Northern Brazil|url=https://www.maps.org/news-letters/v08n3/08327yat.html|website=www.maps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dried Mexican ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' root bark has been recently shown to have a [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) content of about 1-1.7%.&lt;ref name="Rätsch"/&gt;  The stem bark has about 0.03% DMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jonathan Ott]] |year=1998 |title=Pharmahuasca: Human pharmacology of oral DMT plus Harmine |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=171–7 |doi=10.1080/02791072.1999.10471741 |url=http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/Articles/JO-Pharmahuasca.htm |accessdate=2013-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124034100/http://www.santodaime.it/Library/NATURALSCIENCES/ott98a_english.htm |archivedate=2012-01-24 |pmid=10438001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of the tree are traditionally used in northeastern Brazil in a [[psychoactive]] [[decoction]] also called [[:pt:Jurema (bebida)|Jurema]] or Yurema. Analogously, the traditional Western Amazonian sacrament [[Ayahuasca]] is brewed from indigenous ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|ayahuasca]]'' vines.
However, to date no β-[[carbolines]] such as [[harmala alkaloids]] have been detected in ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' decoctions, yet the Jurema is used in combination to several plants.&lt;ref&gt;da Mota, Clarice Novaes. ''Jurema's Children in the Forest of Spirits: Healing and ritual among two Brazilian indigenous groups''. Intermediate Technology, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOTA, Clarice Novaes da; ALBUQUERQUE, Ulysses P.. "As muitas faces da Jurema: de espécie botânica à divindade afro-indígena." ''Recife: Bagaço'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GRUNEWALD, R. Sujeitos da jurema e o Resgate da Ciência do Índio. In: LABATE, B. &amp; GOULART, S.(orgs). O uso Ritual das plantas de poder.

This presents challenges to the pharmacological understanding of how DMT from the plant is rendered orally active as an enthenogen,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} because the pyschoactivity of DMT requires the presence of a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI), such as a β-carboline. If an MAOI is neither present in the plant nor added to the mixture, the [[enzyme]] [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) will metabolize DMT in the human gut, preventing the active molecule from entering the blood and brain.

The isolation of the chemical compound [[yuremamine]] from ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' as reported in 2005 represents a new class of phytoindoles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vepsäläinen JJ, Auriola S, Tukiainen M, Ropponen N, Callaway JC |title=Isolation and characterization of yuremamine, a new phytoindole |journal=Planta Med. |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=1053–7 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16320208 |doi=10.1055/s-2005-873131}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain an apparent oral activity of DMT in Jurema.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Mimosa HostilisJurema.jpg|thumb|right|''Mimosa tenuiflora'']]
For outside planting, [[Hardiness zone|USDA Zone 9]] or higher is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Medicinal Herbs | edition = Second | author = James A. Duke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' "[...] fruits and seeds are disseminated by the wind in a radius of {{convert|5–8|m|abbr=on}} from the mother plant; rain carries them from slopes to lower plains and human activities contribute to their dissemination."&lt;ref name="Germinación"/&gt;

For cultivation, the seed pods are collected once they start to spontaneously open on the tree.  The collected pods are laid out in the sun so that the pods open up and release their seeds.  The seeds can then be planted in sandy soil with sun exposure.

[[Scarification (botany)|Scarification]] of the seed via mechanical means or by using [[sulfuric acid]] greatly increases the germination rate of the seeds over non-treatment.&lt;ref name="Germinación"/&gt;  The seeds can be sown directly into holes in the ground or planted in prepared areas.

The seeds can germinate in temperatures ranging from {{nowrap|10 to 30 °C}}, but the highest germination rate occurs at around {{nowrap|25 °C}} (about 96%), even after four years of storage.&lt;ref name="Germinación"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sara L.

It is also possible to propagate ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' via [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]].&lt;ref name="Rätsch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rätsch |first=Christian |authorlink=Christian Rätsch |title=Enzyklopädie der psychoaktiven Pflanzen. Botanik, Ethnopharmakologie und Anwendungen. |publisher=AT-Verl. |location=Aarau |url= |id= |isbn=978-3-85502-570-1 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trimming adult ''Mimosa tenuiflorae'' during the rainy season is not recommended because it can cause them to perish.&lt;ref name="kew.org"/&gt;

On 13 October 2015, Defensor Santiago [[Miriam Defensor Santiago presidential campaign, 2016|declared her candidacy]] for [[President of the Philippines]] in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 elections]] after her doctors from the United States declared her cancer 'stable' and 'receded', but lost in the elections.

Defensor Santiago was known as the '''Dragon Lady''', the '''Platinum Lady''', the '''Incorruptible Lady''', the '''Tiger Lady''', and most popularly, the '''Iron Lady of Asia'''.  She is colloquially known in Philippine pop culture as simply '''Miriam''' or '''MDS'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/interesting-facts-about-miriam-defensor-santiago/|title=15 Surprising Things You Didn't Know About Miriam Defensor-Santiago|date=5 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/139826/20151013/philippines-iron-lady-of-asia-miriam-santiago-runs-for-president-after-surviving-cancer.htm|title=Philippines: 'Iron Lady Of Asia' Miriam Santiago Runs For President After Surviving Cancer|work=Headlines &amp; Global News|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Defensor Santiago was born '''Miriam Palma Defensor''' in [[Iloilo City]], to Benjamin Defensor, a local judge, and Dimpna Palma, a schoolteacher. She was the eldest of seven children. She graduated [[valedictorian]] in grade school, high school, undergraduate school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Defensor Santiago|first=Miriam|title=Inventing Myself|publisher=New Day Publishers of the Christian Literature Society of the Philippines, Inc.|date=1994|isbn=971-10-0552-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated high school in [[Iloilo Provincial High School]] (now [[Iloilo National High School]]) and served as the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of the said high school's student publication "[[The Ilonggo]]". In 1965, Defensor Santiago graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]], ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from the [[University of the Philippines Visayas]]. After graduation, she was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] honor societies.&lt;ref name="uprotc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uprotc.org/directory/corps-sponsors/miriam-defensor-santiago.html|title=Miriam Defensor-Santiago|author=JA Media Solutions, Inc.

Defensor Santiago went on a fellowship to the [[United States]], and earned the degrees [[Master of Laws]] and [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degrees at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. She finished both degrees in a period of only one and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfa.gov.ph/main/index.php/newsroom/dmds-candidature/dr-miriam-defensor-santiago-cv |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219134533/http://dfa.gov.ph/main/index.php/newsroom/dmds-candidature/dr-miriam-defensor-santiago-cv |archivedate=19 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following school she took a position as special assistant to the justice secretary.

She has studied at several universities, including [[Oxford]] and [[Harvard]] law summer schools; [[Cambridge]]; and [[The Hague Academy of International Law]].  She earned the degree Master of religious studies (without thesis) at the [[Maryhill School of Theology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In Oxford, she was a research fellow at St. Hilda's College and also took a summer program in law at St. Edmund's Hall. At Cambridge, she was a research fellow at the Lauterpacht Research Centre for International Law.

==Department of Justice career==
She became a special assistant to the Secretary of Justice for ten years after her higher studies abroad. At a young age, she became a legal officer to the United Nations afterwards due to her constitutional and international law knowledge and experience.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==United Nations career==

Defensor Santiago served as Legal Officer of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at Geneva, Switzerland. She was assigned to the Conferences and Treaties Section.  She became skilled at treaty negotiation and drafting.  She resigned her position when her father in the Philippines developed prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Defensor Santiago|first= Miriam |title= Inventing Myself |publisher= New Day Publishers of the Christian Literature Society of the Philippines, Inc. |date= 1994|isbn= 971-10-0552-2 |page = 82.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judge during martial Law==

Defensor Santiago was appointed judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Metro Manila by President Ferdinand Marcos. She was the youngest judge appointed to Metro Manila, and exempted from the practice of first serving as a judge outside Metro Manila.&lt;ref name="rmaf.org.ph"/&gt; As a RTC judge, she quickly proclaimed a "no postponement" policy.  At that time, cases were tried in segments that were usually a month apart, resulting in trials that took years to finish.  Lawyers were prone to seek postponement of trial. As a result, trial judges scheduled ten or fifteen cases a day, so that they could make up for cases postponed. Defensor Santiago scheduled only five cases a day, heard each case, and disposed of the highest number of cases in her first year in office. {{citaiton needed|date=July 2018}}

Defensor Santiago became nationally famous when she issued perhaps the first decision to rule against martial law. At that time, alleged illegal public assemblies were declared as crimes and were punishable by death. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} A large group of activist students from the University of the Philippines and Ateneo, as well as activists in the film industry, staged a rally in a central business district, and denounced the First Lady for her excesses.  To retaliate, Marcos issued a Preventive Detention Action order which authorized the military to hold suspects indefinitely, without bail.  The students faced the dire prospect of missing their final exams and, for many of them, missing graduation. Defensor Santiago suspended hearings on all other pending cases, and conducted whole-day trials.  In the end, she ordered the military to allow the students to post bail.  After promulgating her decision at the end of the day, Defensor Santiago drove herself to the state university, where she was teaching law. The Philippine Jaycees, the Philippine Lions, and the YMCA Philippines all gave her awards for judicial excellence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Immigration Commissioner==
After martial law, in 1988, President [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed Defensor Santiago as commissioner of the [[Bureau of Immigration (Philippines)|Bureau of Immigration and Deportation]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At that time, the BID was one of the most corrupt government agencies in Southeast Asia. Defensor Santiago declared the Philippines as "the fake passport capital of the world", and directed raids against criminal syndicates, including the Yakuza.  She filled the CID detention center with alien criminals, and ordered construction of another detention center. She extended to legal aliens protection from widespread extortion by requesting President Aquino to issue an executive order that authorized the "alien legalization program".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/26/world/manila-journal-battling-the-culture-of-corruption-day-by-day.html?scp=7&amp;sq=miriam%20defensor%20santiago&amp;st=cse|title=Manila Journal; Battling the 'Culture of Corruption' Day by Day|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=26 May 1988|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each landowner was allowed to keep only five hectares, and each farmer received three hectares. Payment was in bonds of the Land Bank. To subvert the law, big landowners applied for conversion of the classification of their land as agricultural, to classification as commercial, residential, or industrial. The process became the widespread "conversion scandal of agrarian reform". The DAR officials themselves were the biggest culprits, because they sold conversion permits for bribes on a market rate set at certain amounts per hectare involved in the conversion. Defensor Santiago stopped the conversion scandal, and appeased the landowners by enhancing the incentives for voluntary offers by the landowners for the sale of their landholdings, which entitled them to an additional five percent cash payment. When asked if the hacienda belonging to the president's family should be covered by agrarian reform, Defensor Santiago replied that the family's hacienda should be distributed among the farmers. Shortly thereafter President Aquino accepted Defensor Santiago's resignation.&lt;ref name="miriam.com.ph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miriam.com.ph/aboutmiriam.php|title=About Miriam - The Official Website of Miriam Defensor Santiago|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430164032/http://miriam.com.ph/aboutmiriam.php|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1992 presidential elections==
{{main|Philippine presidential election, 1992}}
Defensor Santiago organized the [[People's Reform Party]] (PRP) and ran with a senatorial ticket during the 1992 presidential campaign. [[Ramon Magsaysay Jr.]] was her running mate. While campaigning on 28 April 1991, she was severely injured in car crash,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miriam.com.ph/aboutmiriam.php About Miriam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717033018/http://miriam.com.ph/aboutmiriam.php |date=17 July 2014 }}, Defensor Santiago's official website&lt;/ref&gt; which she claimed was an assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miriam.com.ph/newsblog/2010/11/30/the-philippine-senates-demi-moore/ THE PHILIPPINE SENATE'S "DEMI MOORE"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208223729/http://miriam.com.ph/newsblog/2010/11/30/the-philippine-senates-demi-moore/ |date=8 February 2015 }}, Defensor Santiago's official website&lt;/ref&gt; She was wearing a white bush jacket which became splattered with blood that gushed from a wound to her head.

Two months later, she was back on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="inquirer.net"/&gt;

Defensor Santiago has been dubbed as "The Iron Lady of Asia" and the "Dragon Lady" due to her scathing but bold eloquence both in leadership and writing. She cites physicist [[Marie Curie]] and former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as her major influences throughout her political career, with Thatcher praising her for her book ''Cutting Edge'' during their meeting while the Prime Minister visited the Philippines.&lt;ref name="spot-miriam10"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spot.ph/feed/rss/index.php/newsfeatures/the-latest-news-features/63969/10-facts-miriam-defensor-santiago | title=10 Surprising Things You Didn't Know About Miriam Defensor Santiago | work=Spot.PH | publisher=[[Summit Media]] | date=October 15, 2015 | accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defensor Santiago was leading the canvassing of votes for the first five days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Following a string of power outages, the tabulation concluded, and Ramos was declared president-elect. Defensor Santiago filed a protest before the Supreme Court as electoral tribunal, citing the power outages during the counting of votes as evidence of massive fraud. Her election protest was eventually dismissed on a technicality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.senate.gov.ph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shenon|first=Philip|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10617F835540C778DDDAC0894DA494D81&amp;scp=27&amp;sq=miriam%20defensor%20santiago&amp;st=cse|title=Front-Runners Are Nip and Tuck As Philippine Returns Trickle In|location=Philippines |publisher=Select.nytimes.com|date=14 May 1992|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/24/world/power-failures-slow-philippine-vote-count-and-feed-suspicions-of-fraud.html?scp=9&amp;sq=miriam%20defensor%20santiago&amp;st=cse|title=Power Failures Slow Philippine Vote Count|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=24 May 1992|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public outrage over the presidential results prompted ''Newsweek'' to feature her and her rival on the cover with the question: "Was the Election Fair?"  In another cover story, ''Philippines Free Press'' magazine asked: "Who's the Real President?". The quote, 'Miriam won in the elections but lost in the counting' was popularized by the masses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Senator==

===First term, 1995–2001===
Defensor Santiago was first elected senator in 1995. In 1997, her presidential rival [[Fidel Ramos]] initiated a "people's campaign" for an infinite presidential term. Defensor Santiago harshly criticized Ramos' campaign and went to court. In a landmark case, ''Defensor Santiago vs COMELEC'', she won and preserved the people's mandate for term limits. She again ran for president in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|1998 presidential elections]], with running-mate [[Francisco Tatad]], but lost amidst heavy propaganda concerning her mental health, which was later proven false.&lt;ref&gt;"Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago - Senate of the Philippines". {{cite web|url=http://www.Senate.gov.ph |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527115514/http://www.senate.gov.ph/ |archivedate=27 May 2014 |df=dmy }}; retrieved 13 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of the few senators who were against the opening of the brown envelope during the impeachment trial of then-President [[Joseph Estrada]], who was her foe in the 1998 presidential elections. She said afterwards:{{quote|At that time, I wanted to apply the rules of court technically. Since there is no allegation of wrongdoing in connection with the notorious second envelope, I voted that we should not open the second envelope until and after the complaint had already been amended [...] I was among those demonized because I voted against the opening of the second envelope – ''dahil ang paniwala ng taong bayan, kung ayaw namin buksan ang'' second envelope ''na 'yan, may tinatago kami''. (translation from Filipino: because in the belief of the masses if we don't want to open the envelope, then we are hiding something.)}}Estrada was ousted in the [[Second EDSA Revolution]] in 2001, but was sent free in 2007 by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] who was persuaded by senator [[Mar Roxas]]. Defensor Santiago lost re-election to the senate in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/245548/news/nation/miriam-learn-from-erap-trial-and-let-public-see-evidence|title=Miriam: Learn from Erap trial and let public see evidence|publisher=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third term, 2004–2016===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
Defensor Santiago ran for senator in 2004 and was elected. She focused on creating significant laws that changed the country as a whole. She ran again for senator in 2010 and won. During her three terms, she served as chair mostly of the foreign relations committee and the constitutional amendments committee. She was elected as official candidate of her party [[People's Reform Party]], serving also as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Commission on Appointments.  She exposed and named numerous ''jueteng'' (illegal gambling) lords and illegal-logging lords throughout her terms.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 2011, Defensor Santiago was elected as a judge of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) which hears cases against humanity for former heads of state. She was the first Asian from a third world country to be elected to such a post. She resigned in 2014 after being diagnosed with lung cancer. She was one of the senators who backed Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona during his impeachment trial; he was ultimately impeached due to corruption.

In December 2012, she exposed that the Senate president, [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], used Senate funds to give away as cash gifts.  Every senator, except Defensor Santiago and two others, received 2 million pesos as a chunk of the Filipino population lived in poverty. This led to the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scandal]], which put the Senate president behind bars with charges of plunder. Defensor Santiago's live Senate hearings in the case led to public outrage and support for Defensor Santiago's call to abolish the pork-barrel system.

She was the first Filipino elected as a commissioner for the [[International Development Law Organization]] (IDLO) in 2016. Her role in the organization was advisory to the international law community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/01/23/1545386/miriam-join-bill-gates-elite-law-group|title=Miriam to join Bill Gates in elite law group|first=Marvin|last=Sy|website=PhilStar.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 Presidential Elections==
In October 2015, Defensor Santiago announced her intention to run in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 Philippine presidential elections]] after her cancer was deemed 'stable' and 'receded' by doctors from the United States.&lt;ref name="inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/10/13/1510285/miriam-run-president|title=Miriam to run for president|work=philstar.com|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/miriam-wades-in/223725/|title=Miriam wades in - The Manila Times Online|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later confirmed that Senator [[Bongbong Marcos]] would serve as her running mate for [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Her campaign focused on the youth sector for which she heavily advocated, making use of social media. She was a landslide winner in numerous polls conducted in various public and private universities and colleges in the country.

==Retirement==
Even after retirement, Defensor Santiago continued to advocate the passage of many bills for the nation while in her [[Quezon City]] home. A few of these include: the anti-dynasty bill; an act institutionalizing an age-appropriate curriculum to prevent the abduction, exploitation, and sexual abuse of children; anti-epal bill; freedom of information bill; and the magna carta for Philippine internet freedom.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Before her death, various groups in the country have been lauding her to join the candidacy for the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] Secretary-General post where the elected Secretary-General will be positioned for 2018. Among other candidates for the position are AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes of Malaysia and an unstated representative from Brunei, which is the lead country for 2018–2022 according to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/airasia-chiefs-futile-bid-to-become-asean-secretary-general/|title=AirAsia chief's futile to become ASEAN Secretary-General|first=Arno|last=Maierbrugger|date=17 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:0165jfMedia coverage Wake ceremonies Cubao Cathedral Quezon Cityfvf 07.jpg|thumb|Wake of Miriam Defensor Santiago at the Cubao Cathedral.]]
At the age of 71, Defensor Santiago died in her sleep at exactly 8:52&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 29 September 2016 while she was confined at the [[St. Luke's Medical Center - Global City|St. Luke's Medical Center]] in [[Taguig]] from [[lung cancer]]; several reports cited that Defensor Santiago died in her residence in La Vista Subdivision, [[Quezon City]].&lt;ref name="miriamdiedinquirer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/820199/miriam-defensor-santiago-passes-away-at-71|title=Miriam Defensor-Santiago passes away at 71|first=Juliet Javellana, Maila|last=Ager|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="midiamdiedabscbn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/29/16/miriam-defensor-santiago-passes-away|title=Miriam Defensor Santiago passes away|publisher=ABS-CBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/miriam-defensor-santiago-a-shining-light-in-ph-politics-malacanang/|title=Miriam Defensor-Santiago, a "shining light" in PH politics – Malacañang|publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=September 29, 2016|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago's last words according to her husband were, "I accept this.

In June 2017, members of the [[People's Reform Party|Youth Reform Movement]] lobbied for the posthumous awarding of the [[Quezon Service Cross]] to Defensor Santiago. In September 2017, Senator [[Grace Poe]], her freedom of information (FOI) ally and 2016 presidential rival, nominated Defensor Santiago to be awarded the Quezon Service Cross, the highest honor in the entire Republic, subject for approval of both houses of Congress and by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], who was also her presidential rival. On the same month, Senator [[Sonny Angara]], who considers Defensor Santiago as his mentor, followed suit by filing another resolution nominating Defensor Santiago to become a laureate of the prestigious Quezon Service Cross, just days before Defensor Santiago's first death anniversary on September 29. The Senate expressed its full intent to confer Defensor Santiago the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/26/17/senators-nominate-miriam-defensor-santiago-for-highest-civil-service-award-days-before-death-anniversary|title=Senators nominate Miriam Defensor Santiago for highest civil service award days before death anniversary|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president, through the Presidential Palace, welcomed the proposal to bestow the award to Santiago once both houses of Congress have ratified the document conferring such award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/28/17/palace-welcomes-proposal-granting-highest-civil-service-award-for-miriam|title=Palace welcomes proposal granting highest civil service award for Miriam|first=Dharel Placido, ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives is the only body left that has yet to express its intent to bestow the award to Defensor Santiago. Most members of the House are against Defensor Santiago's anti-political dynasty bill which she introduced in Congress. Santiago's bill is backed by the Constitution itself, where it mandates both chambers of Congress to enact such a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/627525/palace-supports-senators-call-to-honor-miriam-highest-civilian-award/story/|title=Palace supports senators' call to honor Miriam highest civilian award|website=GMANetwork.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2017, the president officially nominated Defensor Santiago for the award, awaiting concurrence of both chambers of Congress to officially bestow the award. Santiago is the sixth person and the first and only woman to be nominated for the award. If bestowed the award, she would be the sixth person to be immortalized in the 69-year old national roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/190505-miriam-santiago-quezon-service-cross-nomination-duterte|title=Duterte nominates Miriam Santiago for Quezon Service Cross|website=Rappler.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/06/17/duterte-nominates-miriam-santiago-for-highest-civil-service-award|title=Duterte nominates Miriam Santiago for highest civil service award|first=Dharel Placido, ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 11, 2017, the Senate approved the bestowing of the award to Defensor Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/191060-senate-resolution-quezon-service-cross-miriam-defensor-santiago|title=Senate approves highest civilian award for Miriam Santiago|website=Rappler.com|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 20, 2018, the House of Representatives approved the bestowing of the award to Defensor Santiago.

==Political positions==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2016}}

===Domestic policy===

====Federalism====
{{see also|Federalism in the Philippines}}
Santiago is not in favor of Federalism, stating in one interview that, "The masses and the entire electorate will not choose who the president will be. We leave that choice to a group of politicians, and we know how those politicians act. Mostly, their actions are always attended by corruption."&lt;ref name="TRANSCRIPT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH  SEN. MIRIAM DEFENSOR SANTIAGO After her speech for the Maynilad Leadership Talk at GT-Toyota Center, UP Diliman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Defensor-Santiago |first1=Miriam |title=Press Release |url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2015/0325_santiago3.asp |website=Senate of the Philippines |publisher=Office of Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charter change====
{{see also|Constitutional reform in the Philippines}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Defensor Santiago was in favor of amending the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] to enhance foreign investments in the country and to mandate that all high posts in government (senator, congressperson, president, vice president, governor, mayor, vice mayor, secretaries, undersecretaries, etc.) should have additional qualifications which are 'a college graduate' and must pass a duly-accredited government examination. Numerous politicians in the country are only high school or elementary graduates, and most college graduate officials have never passed the Civil Service Examination for Professionals (CSE-P). She argues that positions in government like administrative assistant must pass the CSE-P as a qualification, 'why not higher posts too?'.

====Anti-political dynasty====
Defensor Santiago was the principal author of the ''Anti-Dynasty Bill'' in the Senate and had been pushing for its immediate passage in Congress for more than a decade. Unfortunately, most of the congresspersons in the House of Representatives, which are the bulk of Filipino politicians, are not in favor of its passage because they are part of political dynasties. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====West Philippine Sea dispute====
{{see also|Territorial disputes in the South China Sea}}
She stressed during a live debate that the [[West Philippine Sea]] is a sovereign territory of the Philippines and that the country should have a better military and police force and assets and should prioritize enhancing ties with allied nations, especially in the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). She was one of the international law experts who criticized China and aided in the Philippine case against China. The case was won by the Philippines in 2016. Despite this, China still does not recognize the ruling.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

====Mindanao====
{{see also|Moro conflict}}
Defensor Santiago was against the [[Bangsamoro Basic Law]], saying it is unconstitutional because it specifies that Bangsamoro will become a 'sub-state' of the republic which is illegal under the law. She prefers a more constitutional form of the Bangsamoro Basic Law which does not create a 'sub-state' government.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

====North Borneo dispute====
{{see also|North Borneo dispute}}
Defensor Santiago was in favor of appointing a third-party to conduct under international law "inquiry and fact-finding" to resolve the [[North Borneo dispute]], where the third-party is approved by both the national governments of Malaysia and the Philippines. She cited the 1907 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes as motivator of her legal position. She said that this can end the dispute as it did in the 1981 involvement of mercenaries in an invasion of the Seychelles, the 1987 use of chemical weapons in the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq, and the 1988 destruction of Korean Air Lines Boeing 747. She said that since no transfer of sovereignty was involved in the 1878 Deed, no transfer of sovereignty has ever passed to Malaysia. She added that the Philippines has never abandoned its claim over eastern Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/299478/news/nation/miriam-seeks-third-party-inquiry-on-sabah-crisis|title=Miriam seeks third-party inquiry on Sabah crisis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social policy===

====Divorce====
Defensor Santiago publicly advocated for the passage of a divorce law in the Philippines, saying, "Why would you force [couples] to be together if they want to kill each other by mere sight?" With respect to her position on divorce, she clarified that it should be restricted on two grounds: "an attempt on the life of the spouse by the other" and "when one spouse is already living with another person, that is adultery or [[concubinage]]." In the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential campaign]], despite being unable to attend the second debate citing health concerns, she reiterated on [[Twitter]] her position on divorce,&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://interaksyon.com/article/50813/sen--miriam-favors-divorce-only-on-two-grounds |title=Sen.

====Abortion and contraception====
Defensor Santiago took a critical perspective of [[abortion]] and supports maintaining laws against it: "No to abortion, never. I am a very avid supporter of RH [Reproductive Health] Law, but I will definitely fight to the death against abortion as a lawyer, not necessarily as a religious person. I equate it properly with the crime of murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/12/19/12/miriam-yes-divorce-law-no-abortion |title=Miriam: Yes to divorce law, no to abortion|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=December 20, 2012|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On contraception, she stressed the importance of its distribution, especially in poverty-stricken areas.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"/&gt; She was a strong proponent of the Philippines' [[Reproductive Health Law]], which guarantees universal access to methods on contraception, maternal health and [[sex education]].&lt;ref name="MDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/88686-miriam-reflections-god-religion|last=Macaraig|first=Ayee|title=Miriam on God, hell and the middle finger|work=[[Rappler]]|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, the bill was shelved for more than 13 years, citing the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic Church]]'s opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/18730-rh-law-the-long-and-rough-road|title=RH law: The long and rough road|author=Fonbuena, Carmela |work=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defensor Santiago expressed dismay when the RH Law had suffered a one-billion peso budget cut before the [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] in early 2016. She said if she will be elected, she will work for a full and conscientious implementation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/01/09/1540764/senators-slam-rh-budget-cut|title=Senators slam RH budget cut|author=Sy, Marvin|website=Philstar.com|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LGBT rights====
Defensor Santiago magnified the issues concerning the LGBT community before the Senate. In the wake of the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]] incident, she said on a Twitter post: "The mass shooting at a club in Orlando is appalling and heartbreaking" and "I long for the day when the LGBT community no longer has to live in fear of discrimination and hate crimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/13/1592548/senators-express-shock-over-orlando-mass-shooting|title=Senators express shock over Orlando mass shooting|author=Viray, Patricia Lourdes|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defensor Santiago was one of the senators who advocated the immediate investigation of [[Death of Jennifer Laude|the Jennifer Laude case]], wherein the American marine, Joseph Scott Pemberton, killed Laude, a Filipina [[transgender]], in Subic, Zambales. She also supported the passage of the anti-discrimination bill ([[SOGIE Equality Bill]]) which protects the rights of people of different sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. She was the first senator in Philippine history to push for the bill's legislation, filing it repeatedly since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/72528-miriam-barbie-senate-probe|title=Miriam wants 'Barbie' in Senate probe on Laude death|author=Fonbuena, Carmela|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capital punishment====
Defensor Santiago favored the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] but limited it to heinous crimes, while maintaining that the justice system should be improved.&lt;ref name="Miriamcandidate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/03/20/Pilipinas-Debates-2016-Santiago-Duterte-Poe-Binay-Roxas.html|title=Despite absence, Defensor Santiago makes presence felt through social media|website=CNN Philippines|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment====
Defensor Santiago vehemently opposed mining. She believes mining is one of the greatest reasons why local communities are impoverished as most of the profit coming from mining are siphoned by mining companies away from the local economy. In addition, mining has made numerous destructive advances in Philippine society and ecosystems, destroying watersheds and agricultural lands, as well as rivers and seas. According to an interview conducted by [[Haribon Foundation]] during the 2016 Presidential Campaign, the organization voted her as the "greenest" in all of the candidates. She was the main author of the Climate Change Law and the Renewable Energies Law in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/04/19/1574455/miriam-greenest-mar-meanest-environmentalists|title=Miriam 'greenest', Mar 'meanest' for environmentalists|author=Dumlao, Artemio|website=Philstar.com|date=19 April 2016|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet====
Defensor Santiago advocated the establishment of the Department of Information which is mandated to speed-up internet connectivity in the Philippines which she described "the worst internet speed in Asia". She also advocated for the passage of the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom which protects the rights and freedoms of Filipinos in cyberspace, while defining and penalizing [[cybercrime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/07/03/961171/its-miriams-internet-freedom-bill-vs-anti-cybercrime-law |title=It's Miriam's Internet Freedom bill vs Anti-Cybercrime Law |author=Bacani, Louis|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transportation====

==Personal life==
Defensor Santiago grew up in a middle-class erudite household with both parents having higher educational attainments. She is the eldest among her siblings: Benjamin, Nenalyn, Linn, and Paula Dimpna Beatriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/10/02/16/watch-miriams-sister-thanks-god-family-fans |title=WATCH: Miriam's sister thanks God, family, fans |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=October 2, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to Narciso "Jun" Santiago Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/focus/05/04/16/narciso-jun-santiago-miriams-shock-absorber|last=Alberto-Masakayan|first=Theas|title=Narciso 'Jun' Santiago, Miriam's shock absorber|work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]]|date=4 May 2016|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom she had two sons, Narciso III (Archie) and Alexander (A.R.); Alexander committed suicide in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/228820/%C2%91miriam-son-suicide%C2%92|title=Miriam son a suicide|work=''[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]''|date=22 November 2003|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple adopted four children; Megan Santiago, Mallory Santiago, Mackenzie Santiago, and Morven Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/people-people/595336/miriam-defensor-santiago-motherhood-also-becomes-her |title=Miriam Defensor Santiago: Motherhood also becomes her |author=Roco, Denise |website=Philstar.com |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband renewed their wedding vows on their 40th wedding anniversary in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/06/20/11/miriam-backs-divorce-bill-renews-vows|title=Miriam backs divorce bill, renews wedding vows|publisher=abs-cbn.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has close relationships with actress and visual artist, [[Heart Evangelista]], who she has mentored.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/09/29/16/heart-thanks-miriam-for-showing-her-so-much-of-the-world&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
In an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' years after the death of her son who committed suicide, she said:{{Quote|text=The only thing I know about God is that God is inscrutable. In other words, I don't know a single thing about God. I'm clueless about what God is. Maybe Jesus, or the other historical figures around which religions had been built, would be more approachable. But God itself, being on a divine level, I think it's just impermeable to human intelligence. And there is a very famous classical book called ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]''. There's always a cloud of unknowing over God. I think that, since God is inaccessible to people, we tend to portray Him in anthropomorphic terms. We think of the best qualities in every person and you try and project it on a giant scale on God. So in effect, God is a man-made concept. We have no clue what God is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esquiremagazine.ph/culture/miriam-defensor-santiago-is-not-insane|title=Miriam Defensor Santiago is not insane|author=Romulo, Erwin T.|work=Esquire|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She stated in a separate interview:{{Quote|text=I do not understand why God can be all love and still inflict this kind of pain on people. This God is an underachiever. He does not do whatever he is supposed to be doing, whatever his sex is. Whether he's an it or a she or a he or whatever. But I'm sure that if you were a god or if I were the God, I would be doing a better job. Therefore, the only conclusion can be that possibly, God does not exist.&lt;ref name="MDS"/&gt;}}

In the succeeding years, Defensor Santiago returned to her faith. She was quoted as saying, "Good things happen to those who love God."&lt;ref name="MDS"/&gt; Notwithstanding her defense of the [[Reproductive Health Law]], a law that has been opposed by the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alave|first1=Kristine L. |last2=Burgonio |first2=TJ |title=Massive Church rally set against RH bill|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/241737/massive-church-rally-set-against-rh-bill|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she asserted her [[Catholicism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Defensor Santiago|first1=Miriam|title=[[Stupid is Forever]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN Publishing]]|isbn=978-971-816-127-2|page=14|quote=I sponsored and defended the Reproductive Health Law, although I am a Catholic.

He eventually rose to head of the Taliban military committee for the districts of [[Darzab District|Darzab]] and Qush Tepa in Jowzjan,&lt;ref name="pashtun"/&gt; and was considered to be an "important" field commander for the insurgents.&lt;ref name="disastrous"/&gt; It is possible that Nemat took part in "Operation Badr", a major Taliban offensive in northern Afghanistan in 2011.{{efn|Afghan authorities claimed that "Mawlawi Nematullah", one of "two top Taliban leaders for Jawzjan", fought at the village of al Malik in Qush Tepa from 9 and 11 April 2011.

While visiting [[Pakistan]] in 2013, Nemat was arrested by the Taliban over these issues, and expelled from the rebel movement in 2014.&lt;ref name="pashtun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="more peace"/&gt;

In response, Nemat made a deal with Vice President Dostum&lt;ref name="pashtun"/&gt; in December 2014,&lt;ref name="more peace"/&gt; and officially surrendered to the Afghan government with 220&lt;ref name="rape"/&gt; of his followers in February 2015.&lt;ref name="precarious"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/precarious-consolidation-qari-hekmats-is-affiliated-island-survives-another-taleban-onslaught/ |title=Precarious Consolidation: Qari Hekmat’s IS-affiliated 'island' survives another Taleban onslaught |author=Obaid Ali |work=[[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] |date=4 March 2018 |accessdate=25 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2015/04/working-with-general-abdul-rashid-dostum/ |title=Working With General Abdul Rashid Dostum |author=Sultan Faizy |work=[[The Diplomat]] |date=24 April 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his fighters were promised salaries for six months, and help in finding new civilian jobs.&lt;ref name="more peace"/&gt; For the next two years, he stayed in [[Sheberghan]], hoping to gain an appointment as commander in the pro-government militias. Nemat also started a [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] [[madrasa]] called ''E'ya-ye Sunnat'' ("Rehabilitation of the [[Sunnah]]"), and organized classes for male and female students. His Salafist views aroused great opposition from the local religious establishment of [[Hanafi]] clerics, resulting in several public debates between Nemat and a number of his opponents. State authorities eventually shut down his madrasa and banned him from teaching in Jowzjan Province in November 2016.&lt;ref name="pashtun"/&gt; Believing that neither Dostum nor the rest of government had upheld their part of the agreement with him,&lt;ref name="Aided"/&gt; Nemat consequently resumed his insurgency.

==== Surrender ====
[[File:More Than 240 IS Militants Surrender to Afghan Government Forces.webm|thumb|right|''[[Voice of America]]'' report about the surrender, including an interview with Mufti Nemat ]]

Despite their military successes in 2017, ISIL-K remained threatened by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, as the latter repeatedly attempted to oust the Islamic State militants from Darzab. A major [[Battle of Darzab (2018)|Taliban offensive in July 2018]] eventually overwhelmed ISIL-K's defenses and brought the group's northern branch to the brink of destruction. The Taliban rejected offers for a ceasefire, and demanded that Nemat, alongside Mawlavi Habibul Rahman and Sibghatullah, ISIL-K's local head of finances be handed over to them. At this point, the northern ISIL-K branch split, with a substantial number of fighters defecting to the Taliban, while the three commanders and their loyalists decided to contact the Afghan government and offered their surrender in exchange for protection from the Taliban.&lt;ref name="island"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/qari-hekmats-island-overrun-taleban-defeat-iskp-in-jawzjan/ |title=Qari Hekmat's Island Overrun: Taleban defeat 'ISKP' in Jawzjan |author=Obaid Ali |work=[[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] |date=4 August 2018 |accessdate=25 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemat and his fellow fighters, along with their families, consequently fled to government lines in the night, protected by [[Commandos (Afghanistan)|Commandos]] and the [[Afghan Air Force]].&lt;ref name="surge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guests"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/08/taliban-says-islamic-state-is-completely-defeated-in-jawzjan.php |title=Taliban says Islamic State has been 'completely defeated' in Jawzjan |author=Bill Roggio |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=1 August 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/is-fighters-surrender-to-afghan-forces-after-taliban-assault/4508748.html |title=IS Fighters Surrender to Afghan Forces After Taliban Assault |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=1 August 2018 |accessdate=13 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his surrender, the ISIL-K militants were transported to [[Sheberghan]], where they were treated rather well despite the protests of many local civilians and soldiers. Nemat subsequently gave several interviews to the press, declaring that "[[fake news]]" were responsible for the Islamic State's bad reputation. He claimed that he and his followers had only launched an insurgency because they were met with hostility by the "whole world", and that he wanted people to accept ISIL's ideology "with their hearts, not by force". Regarding his future, Nemat said that the "Afghan government must save my life and provide me with security" as it promised to do so before the surrender, and that he was not guilty of any crimes.&lt;ref name="guests"/&gt; Despite these claims, several women had previously accused him of having abducted and raped them. This was notable, as it was "the first time Afghan women have come forward and accused IS fighters of rape". [[Rape in Afghanistan|Rape victims in Afghanistan]] usually do not speak out due to rape being a taboo topic in the country's society.&lt;ref name="rape"/&gt; Other civilians accused ISIL-K of having executed over one hundred civilians, including children, and of practising slavery in Darzab.&lt;ref name="guests"/&gt; The government was widely criticised for "its unexplained action of providing asylum and protection to IS-K militants", prompting officials to declare that the Islamic State fighters would be brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-government-under-fire-for-rescuing-islamic-state-militants/4515574.html |title=Afghan Government Under Fire for Rescuing Islamic State Militants |author=Ayaz Gul |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=6 August 2018 |accessdate=13 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avatars of Vishnu.jpg|thumb|"Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya" is a Mantra of [[Krishna]].]]
'''Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya''' ({{audio|Om_Namo_Bhavate_Vasudevaya_Pronunciation.ogg|listen}}) (in [[devanagari]]:  ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय) is one of the most popular [[Hindu]] [[mantra]] and the most important mantra in [[Vaishnavism]]. It is called as '''Dwadasakshari Mantra''' or simply '''Dwadasakshari''' meaning the "twelve-syllable" mantra dedicated to Lord Krishna/Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhāratīya Saṃskr̥ti, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qa8aAAAAMAAJ|author=Prabhakar Balvant Machwe|publisher=Bhāratīya Saṃskr̥ti Saṃsada|page=212|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2n4VDAAAQBAJ|author=Edwin F.

In Tantrik Tradition, the Rishi of the Mantra is [[Prajapati]], in Puranic Tradition the Rishi is [[Narada]]. Both, however, say it is the Supreme Vishnu Mantra.

Sharada Tilak Tantram says: {{cquote|"Dvadasharno mahamantrah pradhano Vaishnavagame"—

The view on the '''Prophets of God''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: نبي) in [[Ahmadiyya]] theology differs significantly from [[Prophets of Islam|Orthodox Islam]]. The main difference centres on the Quranic term ''[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]'' (lit. Seal of Prophets) with reference to [[Muhammad]] which is understood by Ahmadis in terms of perfection and testification of prophethood instead of finality (as understood within mainstream Islam).&lt;ref name="Ahmadiyya Muslim Community"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html|title=Finality of Prophethood {{!}} Hadhrat Muhammad (PUBH) the Last Prophet|publisher=[[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Muhammad is held to be the last prophet to deliver a [[sharia|religious law]] to humanity in the form of the Quran whose teachings embody a perfected and universal message. Although, in principle, prophets can appear within Islam, their prophethood is dependent upon and reflective of that of Muhammad, that is, ''within'' his Seal; and their role is merely that of reviving and purifying the faith. They cannot be prophets in their own right and cannot change, add to or subtract from the religious law of Islam.&lt;ref name="Ahmadiyya Muslim Community"/&gt; As such, Ahmadis, regard their founder [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as a prophet who appeared as the promised Messiah and [[Mahdi]] in accordance with Islam's [[Islamic eschatology|eschatological]] prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Moreover, unlike orthodox Islam, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community considers the term Messenger (''[[rasul]]'') and Prophet (''[[Prophets of Islam|nabi]]'') as being different aspects of the same office of a ''Khalifatullah'' (Representative of [[God]] on Earth). According to Ahmadiyya belief, the terms used in the [[Qur'an]] to signify divinely appointed individuals, namely, '''''Warner''''' (''Nazir''), '''Prophet''' (''Nabi''), '''Messenger''' (''Rasul''), are generally synonymous. Ahmadis however categorise prophets as law-bearing ones and non-lawbearing ones.

==Definition==
Ahmadis believe that when the world is filled with unrighteousness and immorality, or rather, when a specific part of the world displays these attributes, or when the followers of a certain law (religion) become corrupt or incorporate innovative and corrupted teachings into the faith (''[[Bid‘ah]]''), thus making the faith obsolete or in need of a Divine Sustainer, then a Prophet of God is sent to Earth by God to re-establish His Divine Will, that is, for humans to worship Him and to observe the rights of his creation.

Prophets, and the true followers of Prophets, according to the Ahmadiyya Community have always faced severe opposition and often persecution, especially so in the country/society in which they brought forth their Divine Message. This is in accordance with the history of the Prophets and also with the principle laid out in the Qur'an and parts of the [[Bible]] to this effect.

==Prophets as divine magnetizers==
The Prophets, according to the Ahmadiyya Community, inspire humans to such an extent that faith (''eiman'') translates into practical application of the faith (''a'maal''). The Prophets 'magnetize' and draw humans towards them and as a result of this, true faith – that is, ''eiman'' with a'maal (practical application) – is established amongst their followers.
It is written, however, that the 'magnetism' which draws forth people that a Prophet displays is for a limited time because, within a somewhat long time period after they die, the magnetism that the Prophet brought becomes less and less until it is absolutely non-existent. Thus, either God immediately appoints a Successor to the Prophet (who may be a Prophet himself) that has died or, after hundreds of years, when the magnetism is virtually non-existent, God sends forth another new Messenger to display that magnetism once more.
It is for this reason that, according to Ahmadiyya belief, followers of all faiths are not drawn to the magnetism of their founding Prophets because that has become non-existent over time. This also applies, according to Ahmadiyya belief, to [[Sunni|Orthodox Islam]] because it has been centuries since the founding Prophet [[Muhammad]] died and centuries still since Muhammad's original [[Caliphate]] ceased to exist.

===Caliphate===
According to Ahmadiyya belief, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the Ahmadiyya Community, was the Promised Messiah, sent by God as a Prophet to bring back that magnetism that draws forth humans. After he died in 1908, his first successor was elected and uptill today, this [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya Caliphate]] has spanned over a century, seen 5 Caliphs and is continuing, in the manner of the first 4 Caliphs of the [[Rashidun|Pious Caliphate]] of Muhammad. However, the Ahmadiyya Caliphate is seen as a re-establishment and continuation of the first Islamic Caliphate of Muhammad and the Ahmadiyya Caliphs as successors to the Promised Messiah as well as to Muhammad.
The Rightly-Guided Caliphs of [[Islam]] (Pious Caliphs and Ahmadiyya Caliphs) are thought to be chosen by God through the agency of pious believers. The Rightly-Guided Caliphs are considered to be guided by God after their election to this office. Thus, the present [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya Khalifa]], [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]] and also all other [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya Khulafa]] are seen as successors of both the Promised Messiah and Muhammad, though human and in no way incarnations of God or any other status which would jeopardize the concept of the [[tawhid|Unity of God]] (see: ''Non-divinity of Prophets''). Though the Caliphs, like the Prophets, are deemed completely pure and sinless,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alislam.org/books/my-relig/part2.html Islam: My Religion&lt;/ref&gt; much like in [[Shia Islam]] (see: [[Ismah|''‘Isma'']]), however, they, like Prophets, are not deemed immune from making mistakes pertaining to worldly affairs of everyday life or human errors in judgement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alislam.org/library/links/appoint_God.html The Khalifa Is Appointed by God,&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadiyya belief dictates that Prophethood is ''Qudrat Al-Awwal'' or the First Manifestation of God's Omnipotence and Rightly-Guided Caliphate (usually taken to mean the Ahmadiyya Caliphate) is a form of ''Qudrat Ath-Thaani'' or the Second Manifestation of God's Omnipotence. However, in no way does the Ahmadiyya Community deem the Ahmadiyya Caliphate to be better than the Pious Caliphate of Muhammad because it has spanned a longer time or seen more Caliphs.

==Non-divinity of Prophets==
The Prophets of God are not seen as incarnations of God but are seen as mortal humans, as they have all died, according to Ahmadiyya belief (including [[Jesus]],who, according to Ahmadiyya belief died and his body is not currently in Heaven right now as according to [[Sunni|Orthodox Islamic]] and [[Christian]] belief). Each Messenger is seen to have been an ordinary human who displayed righteousness and honesty to a degree that was not found even remotely in his society of the time. Then, according to Ahmadiyya belief, God is thought to have selected this pious human and told him his divine station of Prophethood. God would then, invest the Holy Spirit (Arabic: ''rohil-Quddos'') within the newly appointed Prophet and the Prophet would become a Man/Manifestation of God, though still a human being and not Divine in his own right.
Prophets are not regarded as God, God's Sons, incarnations of God, or in any other way which would put the Unity of God, the concept of Islamic (''[[tawhid]]'') or the [[Shahadah|declaration of faith]] in jeopardy. The first part of the [[shahadah]], the essential declaration of a Muslim, states: "There is no god but [[Allah]]" and another version of the same is "There is none worthy of worship except [[Allah]]". The word Allah, according to Ahmadiyya belief, is a personal name of God, is a proper noun and is not a combination or a derivative of any other Arabic words. The second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Movement made this abundantly clear in his ground-breaking commentary of the Qur'an. He writes:  "In the Arabic language, the word Allah is never used for any other thing or being. No other language has a distinctive name for the Supreme Being. The names found in other languages are all attributive or descriptive and are often used in the plural, but the word 'Allah' is never used in the plural number. It is a simple substantive, '''not derived'''. It is never used as a qualifying word."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=5&amp;region=E1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reflections of divine attributes==
Although Prophets are regarded as human beings, they are seen as having attained the highest rank of spirituality among all humans. According to the Ahmadiyya Community, only in spirituality (literally, "Nearness to God")  does one deserve any honour and that also usually only by God Himself and thus racism, sexism, nationalism and other ideologies such as these are condemned by the Ahmadiyya Community. 
The Prophets are seen to have resisted and overcome Satan, which is either Satan taking a corporeal form and inviting them to evil or the metaphorical Satan which is the base desires of humans (i.e. wealth, fame, lust, greed etc.).
The purpose of life, according to the Ahmadiyya Community, and in principle with the Qur'an, is to worship God. This worship is in two parts:

1.)	Direct Prayer with God to establish communion with Him, ''Zikr-Illahi'' (Remembrance of God) and other spiritual exercises.

2.)	Service to humanity. As humans are the creatures of God, service to them means that you are in part worshipping God. This service may be on any scale, from being polite or holding the door for people, to being a doctor or establishing/donating to a large humanitarian relief organization.   
The only way to worship God completely is to mimic His Divine Attributes (though unlimited, 99 of which are told of in the Qur'an which is the literal Word of God, according to the Ahmadiyya Community) which are able to be mimicked (i.e. some attributes such as Al-Khaaliq (the Creator) cannot be mimicked by humans). Thus God sends prophets to ease this task for humans because Prophets are those, according to the Ahmadiyya Community, that have mimicked God's Attributes and are thus Manifestations of God, or Manifestations of God's Attributes. They are seen as representatives of God on Earth and are invested with His Holy Spirit.
According to Ahmadiyya belief, out of all Prophets which are Manifestations of God, Muhammad reflected God's Attributes perfectly and was the Supreme Manifestation of His Attributes or the "Seal of the Prophets" as described in the Qur'an.

===Manifestations of God===
Prophets are viewed as 'representatives' of God. This is in accordance with the following Qur'anic verse:
"Those who bear the Throne and those who are around it, proclaim the praise of their Lord and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe…" (40:8)
The 'Throne' signified in this verse by the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word 'Arsh' means the transcendent Attributes of God ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Sifāt Tashbīhiyyah'')&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an Arabic Text with English Translation and Short Commentary, Edited by Malik Ghulam Farid. Published by Islam International Publications Limited. {{ISBN|1-85372-007-0}}, Chapter 7, Verse 55, pg. 322, Commentary footnote number 986&lt;/ref&gt; and thus, the Prophets are the manifestations of the attributes of God, or the Manifestations of God.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an Arabic Text with English Translation and Short Commentary, Edited by Malik Ghulam Farid. Published by Islam International Publications Limited. {{ISBN|1-85372-007-0}}, Chapter 40, Verse 8, pg. 948, commentary footnote number 2595&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an Arabic Text with English Translation and Short Commentary, Edited by Malik Ghulam Farid. Published by Islam International Publications Limited. {{ISBN|1-85372-007-0}}, Index, Pg. 1386, Under Heading: 'Prophets' and subheading: 'manifestation of God by,'&lt;/ref&gt;
This is also shown in that once, Ayesha, the wife of the Muhammad, was asked whether Muhammad or the Qur'an was better. She replied that Muhammad was the Qur'an personified (Qur'an in the flesh).
In this way, the Biblical quotation referring to Jesus is shown to mean the same thing:
"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God." (John 1:1)
Thus, as "the Word of God becoming flesh" is applied for both Muhammad and Jesus, it signifies that they were metaphorical Manifestations of God, but not actually God or sons/incarnations of God in any way. (see: ''Non-Divinity of Prophets''){{Citation needed|reason=july2009|date=July 2009}}

===Ahmadiyya writings===
The ''Review of Religions'', a magazine started by Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Community, to promote inter-faith dialogue and guide seekers of the truth, which is the longest running Ahmadi English language magazine in the world, elaborates in the Prospectus of its first issue under its first volume (1902) and gives a short overview of the points above concerning Prophets being 'Manifestations of God' and 'Divine Magnetizers'. The Non-Divinity of Prophets, the Mirror Analogy, Sun and Lake Analogy and Prophets as the Reflection of Divine Attributes:
"…how to be enfranchised from the bondage of sin, and how to get out of the impurities of life? There is only one answer to this all-important question. Such a regeneration can only be effected by the one who comes with a magnetism from '''heaven''', who on account of the extreme purity of his soul and the surpassing cleanliness of his heart is '''metaphorically called a Manifestation of God'''."&lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 8"&gt;Review of Religions Vol. 97, Num. 7, July 2002. Pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

"He (the Prophet) removes the poisonous matters, gives the elixir vitae in their stead, burns the carnal passions and low motives of worldly life and ennobles the soul with the pure and exalted divine morals." &lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 8"/&gt;

"Look at the sun and the moon: each new day requires a new appearance of the glorious orb of light." &lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 8"/&gt;

"The holy one that rose in the days of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] among the [[Jews]] (Jesus) was, no doubt, a sun of righteousness, but only so long as his magnetism attracted the hearts and his light worked a heavenly transformation in the souls of his followers. He is now a sun but one that has passed below the horizon. The radiant light which shone from his face and the brilliant luster which he cast around him is shorn of its beams and grown quite obscure, not the least trace of it being visible among those that call themselves after his name." &lt;ref&gt;Review of Religions Vol. 97, Num. 7, July 2002. Pgs. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

"The holy one that sheds such light is not and cannot be God, but there is no doubt that he is one with God (this is in accordance with John 10:30 of the Bible where Jesus stated 'I and the Father are one') and his soul is in constant and close communion with God. He is the fountainhead of the divine powers, and the rare and hidden manifestations of the powers of the Almighty which are not generally disclosed, are revealed through him. Such persons are called the manifestations, 'incarnations' and representatives of God. In the '''manifestation of the divine powers''' they sit on the throne of God's glory." &lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 9"&gt;Review of Religions Vol. 97, Num. 7, July 2002. Pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

"God is One and without any partner or rival, but persons of this type, the elect of God, whom the world has seen, may be counted by thousands. We may see a single face reflected in a thousand looking-glasses, and yet there are not really a thousand faces but only one face of which there are so many '''reflections'''. This world is a grand reflector; in other words, it is a place of glasses for the reflection of the 'face' of God and the face of Satan. God, so to speak, stands against some of the mirrors and therefore the 'image' of God is seen in them. Against others, Satan makes his appearance and his likeness is consequently witnessed in them. But from these reflections it should not be imagined that the images are so many different gods. There are thousands of the '''Manifestations of God''', and thousands of those of the Devil." &lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 9"/&gt;

"God made Adam in His image and after '''His likeness''', and the Prince of the Devils manifested himself in the person of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. The manifestations of the Deity and the Devil have since then been appearing in the world…" &lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 9"/&gt;

"Every age stands in need of new light and a new representative. Whenever this light grows dim in a people and the influence of a '''heavenly magnetizer''' is not felt among them, they bend down solely to the Earth and its mean cares. They are carried away by the current of carnal desires and drown in a flood of sins and impurities, unable to get out of it. History bears strong evidence to it." &lt;ref name="Religions Vol 2002. Pg. 9"/&gt;

==Prophet's relation to Divine Scriptures==
God would, according to Ahmadiyya belief, reveal the Prophet some knowledge of the unseen if He so wills, tell the Prophet to project his message across the people of his society, tell the Prophet to establish a gathering of his followers and continuously give the Prophet revelation expressing His Divine Will. Some, most or all of the revelation given to a Prophet is sometimes recorded as a Holy Scripture and thus, Ahmadis also believe in all those Books regarded as such, i.e. the Bible, [[Avesta]], [[Torah]], Qur'an etc.
Ahmadiyya belief states that some original Holy Scriptures such as the Scrolls of Abraham, are not to be found in contemporary times and that all Holy Scriptures, have undergone some form of interpolation or extraction by the followers of each independent faith and thus they are not reliable today as they were when they were first revealed. 
Only the Qur'an has not undergone any interpolation/corruption and it is the same book in its entirety exactly as it was when it was revealed to Muhammad. It is labeled, like Muhammad's status of "Seal of the Prophets" as the "Seal of the Books" ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Khatam-ul-Kutub'').

==Law-bearing and non law-bearing Prophets==
Prophets are divided into either 'law-bearing' or 'non law-bearing' categories. Law-bearing Prophets are known as those Prophets/Messengers that brought forth a new revelation by God, and a new Holy Scripture, thus often making the previous religion obsolete. Their laws, though essentially all part of the One and only religion by God, Islam, are suited for the specific time, place and societal needs of their independent civilizations. Thus, they would differ in minor details but remain with the essential principles of the One World Religion, Islam, that are, Unity and worship of God and service to humanity and/or all life on Earth. [[Noah]], [[Moses]] and Muhammad are examples of Law-bearing Prophets. Non law-bearing Prophets/Messengers do not bring forth any new revelation but are followers of a previous revelation given by a Law-bearing Prophet. They are usually Successors (Arabic: ''Khulafa'') of the previous Law-bearing Prophets in which they follow. Sometimes, they are not Successors of previous Prophets and are thus just contemporaries of Law-Bearing Prophets. The Prophets of the [[Old Testament]] ([[David]], [[Solomon]] etc.) are examples of Successor-Prophets of Moses and follow his Mosaic Law. [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]], a Prophet mentioned exclusively in the Qur'an, is an example of a contemporary Law-bearing Prophet, who in this case is Noah.

==Religious evolution==
The Ahmadiyya Writings reveal that Prophets have always been sent by God in the past to all nations of the world, as part of the single religion from God, which is Islam. 
Religion is taught to be progressive and the Prophets reveal teachings either more advanced than their preceding religions or suited for each specific time, place and society. If one were to strip all religions of their innovative teachings, one would find that they are all essentially identical, according to Ahmadiyya belief. 
All religions, according to the Ahmadiyya teaching of the evolution of religion, were part of Islam and were revealed in parts like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. But then, according to Ahmadiyya belief, God fully revealed the whole of Islam, in its perfect form, to Muhammad. Islam was thus called the 'Seal of the Religions' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Khatam-ud-Din'') just as Muhammad was called "Seal of the Prophets".
One of the earliest recorded expressions of this religious perennialism is found in the [[Bhagavad-Gita]], which the Ahmadiyya Community acknowledges as of Divine origin:
"I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness declines, O Bharata! When Wickedness is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take visible shape, and move a man with men, succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, and setting Virtue on her seat again." (Bhagavad-Gita, Chapter IV)

==Prophets as celestial beings==
"We have adorned the lowest heaven with an adornment – the planets." (37:7)

"And We have, indeed, made mansions of stars in the heaven and have adorned it for beholders." (15:17)

"Blessed is He Who has made in the heaven mansions of the stars and has placed therein a Lamp producing light and a moon that reflects light." (25:62)

"…And He created the sun and the moon and the stars – all made subservient by His command…" (7:55)

The above verses of the Qur'an, according to the Ahmadiyya Community, have many interpretations, one in which the verses reveal key astronomical knowledge about the stars, planets and other celestial bodies. Another interpretation of these verses (and the one used for the subject at hand) made by the Ahmadis is that the universe is the 'spiritual universe', the celestial beings (i.e. stars, planets, etc.) as the Prophets, the sun as Muhammad and the moon as Ahmad.

The moon is taken to be Ahmad because in every verse above where the moon is signified, the word ''Qamar'' is used and that word distinctly means Full Moon (see: 'Moon of the Prophets' below).

"By the heaven having mansions of stars. And the Promised Day, And the Witness and he to whom witness is borne." (85:2-4)

According to the Ahmadiyya interpretation of the above verse, the stars signify Prophets and the 'Promised Day' as the day of the coming of Ahmad (it is also interpreted as the Day of Resurrection). The Witness in this verse signifies Ahmad as he was a ''Shahid'' (Witness) as all other Prophets were and was a witness to the truth of the 'one to whom witness is borne' in this verse, or Muhammad as he was a Mashhud (One to whom witness is made) as all other prophets were.

Rejection of even one of the Prophets, results in the rejection of all prophets, according to the [[Ahmadiyya Community]].

===Seal of the Prophets===
The Qur'an refers to Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets" ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Khatam-un-Nabiyeen''). In the Qur'an, he is also known by the term ''Khatam-ul-Mursaleen'' (Seal of the Envoys).[[Islam|Muslims]] take this to mean that Muhammad was the final Prophet and that no prophet after him would be able to come at all. Ahmadis interpret this differently. According to Ahmadiyya belief, Muhammad is the "Seal of the Prophets" in that his law, as opposed to the nationalist laws of the preceding Prophets, was not aimed at a specific part of the world but to all of mankind, as according to the Qur'an:
"And We have sent thee (Muhammad) not but as a mercy for all peoples." (21:108)
Thus, Muhammad was the most perfect Prophet out of all Prophets, and his law, Islam, was perfect. All religions, according to the Ahmadiyya teaching of the evolution of religion, were part of Islam and were revealed in parts like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. But then, according to Ahmadiyya belief, God fully revealed the whole of Islam to Muhammad. This religion was to be the final religion for humans on Earth, chosen by God to establish His Unity.
According to Ahmadiyya belief, thus, non law-bearing prophets may come after Muhammad but only if they follow his final law of Islam.

==Prophets sent to all nations==

See also [[Criteria of True Prophet]]

A [[Hadith]] of Muhammad states that "124,000 Prophets" came before his advent .&lt;ref&gt;Musnad V. 266&lt;/ref&gt; This is in accordance with many Qur'anic verses, namely:
"And there is no people to whom a Warner (''Nazir'') has not been sent." (35:25) 
"And there is a guide for every people." (13:8)
"There are no people (in the world) to whom We have not sent a Warner." (32:25)
Each prophet brought forth a message suited for his own societal needs, time period and specific place on Earth, i.e. it is inconceivable that an Australian at the time of Moses be a Jew.
This is also in accordance with the Qur'anic verse:
"And We sent Messengers before thee among parties of ancient peoples." (15:11)
In accordance with this Qur'anic principle, there is the following verse of the Qur'an:
"We sent some Messengers whom We have already mentioned to thee and some Messengers whom We have not mentioned to thee" (4:165)
Thus, as the Qur'an only mentions 24 Prophets, these Prophets whom God has not mentioned in the Qur'an, according to the Ahmadiyya Community, would be the Prophets of the Bible not mentioned in the Qur'an and the Founders of the [[World Religions]] and other religious personages sent throughout the world.
[[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad]], who is called The Promised Son by Ahmadis, was also the Second [[Khalifa-tul-Masih]] of the Ahmadiyya Community writes:
"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Holy Qur'an there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America - all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Holy Qur'an. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an'' by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad. Part 2, Argument 4 Section labeled "A Grand Conception"&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Community wrote in his book ''A Message of Peace'':

"Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America." &lt;ref name="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad pg. 6"&gt;''A Message of Peace'' by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, pg. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad also wrote within the same book:

"God also made it clear in several places in the Holy Qur'an that His Messengers have been appearing in different lands all over the world. In fact He did not neglect any people or any country." &lt;ref&gt;''A Message of Peace'' by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unity of Prophethood==
All prophets are regarded as the One and of having the same essential message and disbelief in one of the Prophets is tantamount to disbelief in all of the Prophets.
"We make no distinction between any of His Messengers." (Qur'an 2:286)
Sometimes, however, Prophets are ranked higher or lower than other ones, as shown in the Qur'an:
"These Messengers have We exalted some of them above others; among them there are those whom Allah spoke; and some of them He exalted in degrees of rank..." (2:253)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">'''Public Affairs Committee''' (PAC) was founded in 1992 by the religious community and other pressure groups in [[Malaŵi]] to enter into a dialogue with [[Kamuzu Banda]]'s Presidential Committee on Dialogue in the transition period from the one-party to the multiparty system of government in Malaŵi. Most accounts of the transition credit PAC with a major role at this crucial point in the younger history of Malaŵi. 

After the referendum on multipartyism was won in 1993 and the first multiparty elections were scheduled to take place in 1994, a number of pressure groups (notably the [[United Democratic Front (Malawi)|United Democratic Front]] and the [[Alliance for Democracy (Malawi)|Alliance for Democracy]]) split from PAC to form political parties to contest in the elections. PAC has since carried on as an umbrella organisation for the major faith communities represented in the country by the [[Muslim Association of Malawi]], the [[Quadria Muslim Association of Malawi]], the [[Malawi Council of Churches]], the [[Evangelical Association of Malawi]] and the [[Episcopal Conference of Malawi]] . As such, it is the oldest and most well-known nongovernmental organisation in the country. PAC also is the national chapter of the [[World Conference on Religion and Peace]] (WCRP). The organisation’s mission statement is “to mobilise the general public through the religious community and other stakeholders in promoting democracy, development, peace and unity through civic education, mediation and advocacy”. After existing for over a decade, PAC has worked with a large number of partners (both local and international) in pursuance of this mission, and has put into practice a wide variety of activities.

The organisation has a national secretariat in [[Lilongwe]],  Malaŵi's capital city.

[[File:322 The Romance of King Arthur.jpg|thumb|The Questing Beast in [[Arthur Rackham]]'s illustration for [[Alfred W. Pollard]]'s ''The Romance of King Arthur'' (1917)]]

The '''Questing Beast''', or the '''Beast Glatisant''' (Barking Beast), is a [[monster]] from [[Arthurian legend]]. It is the subject of [[quest]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s undertaken by famous knights such as [[Pellinore|King Pellinore]], [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Sir Palamedes]], and [[Percival|Sir Percival]].

== Description and name ==
The strange creature has the head and neck of a [[snake]], the body of a [[leopard]], the haunches of a [[lion]], and the feet of a [[Hart (deer)|hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/student_orgs/arthurian_legend/quests/monsters/abeasts.html |title=Arthurian Legend - Monsters |publisher=Uiweb.uidaho.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109203139/http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/student_orgs/arthurian_legend/quests/monsters/abeasts.html |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the great noise that it emits from its belly, a barking like "thirty couple hounds questing". ''Glatisant'' is related to the French word ''glapissant'', 'yelping' or 'barking', especially of small dogs or foxes. The questing beast is a variant of the mythological [[medieval]] view on [[giraffe]]s, whose [[genus|generic name]] of ''[[Camelopardalis]]'' originated from their description of being half-[[camel]] and half-[[leopard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaudrey.com/myth/camelopard.htm |title=Dave's Mythical Creatures and Places |publisher=Eaudrey.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Goodwin |url=http://goodwinillustration.blogspot.com/2010/10/questing-beast.html |title=Chris Goodwin Illustration - "The Questing Beast" |publisher=Goodwinillustration.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early accounts==
[[Image:Arthur and the Questing Beast (full).jpg|thumb|''Arthur and the Questing Beast'' by [[Henry Justice Ford]] (1904)]]

The first accounts of the beast are in the ''[[Perlesvaus]]'' and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|Post-Vulgate]] ''Suite du Merlin''. The Post-Vulgate's account, which is taken up in [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', has the Questing Beast appear to [[King Arthur]] after he has had an affair with his half-sister [[Morgause]] and begotten [[Mordred]] (they did not know that they were related when the incestuous act occurred).

Arthur sees the beast drinking from a pool just after he wakes from a disturbing dream that foretells Mordred's destruction of the realm (no noise of hounds from the belly is emitted while it is drinking). He is then approached by [[King Pellinore]] who confides that it is his family quest to hunt the beast. [[Merlin]] reveals that the Questing Beast had been born of a human woman, a princess who lusted after her own brother. She slept with a [[devil]] who had promised to make the boy love her, but the devil manipulated her into accusing her brother of rape. Their father had him torn apart by dogs as punishment. Before he died, however, he prophesied that his sister would give birth to an abomination that would make the same sounds as the pack of dogs that was about to kill him.

==Other appearances==
The ''[[Perlesvaus]]'' offers an entirely different depiction of the Questing Beast than the best known one, given above. There, it is described as pure white, smaller than a fox, and beautiful to look at. The noise from its belly is the sound of its offspring who tear the creature apart from the inside; the author takes the beast as a symbol of [[Christ]], destroyed by the followers of the Old Law, the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]. 

[[Gerbert de Montreuil]] provides a similar vision of the Questing Beast in his [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#Gerbert's Continuation|Continuation]] of ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', though he says that it is "wondrously large" and interprets the noise and subsequent gruesome death by its own offspring as a symbol of impious churchgoers who disturb the sanctity of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] by talking. 

Later in the Post-Vulgate, the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']], and the sections of Malory based on those works, [[Saracen]] knight [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]] hunts the Questing Beast. It is a futile venture, much like his love for [[Tristan|Sir Tristan]]'s paramour [[Iseult]], offering him nothing but hardship. In the Post-Vulgate, his conversion to Christianity allows him relief from his endless worldly pursuits, and he finally slays the creature during the [[Holy Grail|Grail Quest]] after he, Percival, and [[Galahad]] have chased it into a lake. 

The Questing Beast appears in many later works as well, including stories written in [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].

==Modern versions==
[[Image:beastglatisant1.jpg|right|thumb|The Questing Beast as depicted in the TV series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'']]

* [[T. H. White]] re-envisions the Questing Beast's role in his novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. As King Pellinore describes it, the hunt of the beast has always been the burden of the Pellinores, and all Pellinores are in fact trained for the hunt from birth—a training which does not seem to extend much beyond finding the beast's [[fewmets]]. (Pellinore is more of a comic character as described by White than a great hunter or knight.) Having searched fruitlessly all his life for the beast, Pellinore is convinced by his friend Sir Grummore Grummursum to drop his quest. However, it turns out later that the beast is pining away for lack of attention, so King Pellinore nurses it back to health and resumes his [[Sisyphus|Sisyphean]] hunt. This account also appears in slightly different form in the original version of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. There, King Pellinore is imprisoned by Galapas the giant, but he is saved by the Beast who turns up to rescue him&amp;mdash;as well as Merlin and Arthur, who happen to be there at the time. Galapas ends up barricaded in his topmost tower, shrieking "let go of me you awful animal", and shouting to be rescued by the Fire Brigade.  Later, the Beast falls in love with Sir Palomides, who briefly disguised himself and Sir Grummore as the beast herself in order to raise Pellinore's spirits when he is pining for his lover. White explains that this is why it is Palomides who is seen pursuing the beast later in Malory's work.
* A 1967 television [[List of Lost in Space episodes|episode of ''Lost in Space'']] features the Questing Beast pursued by Sir Sagramonte.
* The Questing Beast appears in "[[Le Morte d'Arthur (Merlin)|Le Morte d'Arthur]]", the season finale of Season 1 of the BBC's series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Morte d'Arthur, Series 1, Merlin - BBC One|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g43r6|website=BBC|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Questing Beast also appears in the ''[[Thursday Next]]'' novel series by [[Jasper Fforde]], although it is not described. Here it is also hunted by King Pellinore as part of his family's tradition and burden.

'''María Rosalía Rita de Castro''' ({{IPA-gl|rosaˈli.a ðe ˈkastɾo}}; 24 February 1837 – 15 July 1885), was a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[Romanticism|romanticist]] writer and [[poet]].

Writing in Galego, the [[Galician language]], after the period known as the ''Séculos Escuros'' (lit. Dark Centuries), she became an important figure of the Galician [[Spanish Romance literature|Romantic]] movement, known today as the ''Rexurdimento'' ("Renaissance"), along with [[Manuel Curros Enríquez]] and [[Eduardo Pondal]]. Her poetry is marked by ''[[saudade]]'', an almost ineffable combination of nostalgia, longing and melancholy.

She married [[Manuel Murguía]], a member of the important literary group known as the [[Real Academia Galega|Royal Galician Academy]], [[historian]], [[journalist]] and editor of Rosalía's books. The couple had seven children: Alexandra (1859–1937), Aura (1868–1942), twins Gala (1871–1964) and Ovidio (1871–1900), Amara (1873–1921), Adriano (1875–1876) and Valentina (stillborn, 1877). Only two of Rosaía's children married, Aura in 1897 and Gala in 1922; neither they nor their siblings left any children, and thus, today there are no living descendants of Rosalía de Castro and her husband. Their son Ovidio was a promising painter, his career cut short by early death.

Rosalía published her first collection of poetry in Galician, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Cantares gallegos|gl}}'' ("Galician Songs"), on 17 May 1863. This date, 17 May, is now known as the ''[[Día das Letras Galegas]]'' ("Galician Literature Day"), and commemorates Rosalía's achievement by dedicating, every year, this special day to a different writer, who must also write in the Galician language, since 1963. [[Día das Letras Galegas]] is an official holiday in the Autonomous Community of Galicia. 

Relative poverty and sadness marked Rosalía's life, in spite of this, she had a strong sense of commitment to the poor and to the defenseless. She was a strong opponent of authoritative abuse or [[abuse of authority]] and an ardent defender of women's rights. Rosalia suffered from uterine cancer and died in Padrón, province of A Coruña, Spain, on 15 July, 1885.

She is buried in the ''Panteón de Galegos Ilustres'', a pantheon (mausoleum) in the [[Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval]] in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

==Legacy==
[[File:Rosalia de Castro Padrón.jpg|thumb|Statue of Rosalía de Castro at [[Padrón]].]]

Rosalia de Castro is today one of the unquestionable poet laureates of [[Galicia (Spain)]].  Highly educated, expected to speak and write in Spanish only, she took the bold, unconventional step of writing her early poems in the Galician language.  Her defiance earned her the contempt and spite of many that deemed Galician as a Spanish dialect fit "only for the illiterate and the churlish". However, Rosalía's defiant gesture won her the love and admiration of the common folk, who spoke Galician at home or on a daily basis.

The name Rosalía de Castro has been used by several institutions, public spaces and/or parks, and on consumer goods, thus showing the social influence and impact this poet has had on the region. Today, it is possible to find schools and universities named after the writer in the Spanish Autonomous Region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] as well as other parts of [[Spain]]. [[Russia]], [[Venezuela]] ([[Teatro Rosalía de Castro]]) and [[Uruguay]] also have places that bear the name of this distinguished poet. Furthermore, there are numerous parks, plazas and streets, cultural associations, prizes granted to people that are intimately linked with the Galician and Spanish languages, libraries, folk groups, choirs, and even a wine with the name ''Rías Baixas.'' There is also a plane from the airline [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], as well as an aircraft belonging to the [[Maritime Safety and Rescue Society]] (''Salvamento Marítimo),'' have been given the name of Rosalía de Castro. Moreover, there are a multitude of monuments, commemorative plaques and sculptures dedicated to her in many parts of the world.

On 23 October 1979, the last of the [[Banknotes of the Spanish peseta|500 peseta bills]] was printed, being that in 1987, this bill was to be substituted by a [[Spanish peseta|coin]] of the same value. The bill had the portrait of Rosalía de Castro displayed on the obverse side, created by Pablo Sampedro Moledo:  on the reverse side were the House/Museum of Rosalía located in Padrón and a few handwritten verses from Rosalía de Castro's work ''Follas Novas.'' With the printing of this bill, Rosalía de Castro became, along with [[Isabella I of Castile]], the only female (not allegorical) to be placed on the obverse side of a Spanish bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/billemone/peseta/peseta.pdf|title=Breve historia de la Peseta (Icónografia)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Real Casa de la Moneda|access-date=3 December 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412180143/http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/billemone/peseta/peseta.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/bde/en/areas/billemone/Publico_general/Billetes_y_moned/|title=Banco de España – Banknotes and coins – General public – Peseta banknotes and coins|website=www.bde.es|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Reverend Samson Occom''' (1723 – July 14, 1792; also misspelled as '''Occum''' and '''Alcom'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mohegan.nsn.us/Heritage/SamsonOccum.aspx |title = Samson Occum| publisher = The Mohegan Tribe | accessdate = December 24, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CuASAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Dartmouth | volume = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | Although the manuscripts show many spellings such Ockam, Alcom, Aukum, Aucum, Occum, and Aucom, he himself wrote it Samson Occom.{{Sfn | Love | 1899 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vG7oOpm6TSsC&amp;pg=PA21 | p = 21}}}}) was a member of the [[Mohegan]] nation, from near [[New London, Connecticut]], who became a [[Presbyterian]] cleric. Occom was the first Native American to publish his writings in English, and also helped found several settlements, including what ultimately became known as the [[Brothertown Indians]]. Together with the missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], Occom became one of the foremost missionaries who cross-fertilised Native American communities with Christianized European culture.

==Early life and education==
Born to Joshua Tomacham and his wife Sarah, Occom is believed to be a direct descendant of [[Uncas]],&lt;ref&gt;Indian Margaret Connell Szasz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kFkOxBRc6NwC&amp;pg=PA192 ''Education in the American Colonies, 1607-1783'']&lt;/ref&gt; the notable Mohegan chief. In 1743 at the age of 20, Occom heard the teachings of Christian evangelical preachers in the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]. He began to study theology at the "Lattin School" of Congregational minister [[Eleazar Wheelock]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Calloway | first = Colin Gordon | authorlink = Colin G. Calloway  | title = The Indian History of an American Institution: Native Americans and Dartmouth | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CNLMam3j_48C&amp;pg=PA4 | accessdate = 28 October 2012 | date = May 11, 2010 | publisher = Dartmouth College Press | location = [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] | isbn = 978-1584658443 | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed for four years until leaving to begin his own career. In addition to improving his English, Occom learned to read and speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. As a young man, the only book he owned was the Bible. From 1747 until 1749, Occum worked under and studied with the Reverend Solomon Williams in New London, Connecticut.

==Career==
Occom became a teacher, preacher, and judge to [[Pequot people|Pequot]] Native Americans in [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]], eastern [[Long Island]]. He married Mary Fowler, a local woman.&lt;ref name= Brooks /&gt; Occom helped the Pequot to assimilate and adopt European-style houses, dress and culture. He was officially ordained a minister on August 30, 1759, by the presbytery of [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]].&lt;ref name= Brooks /&gt; Occom was never paid the same salary as white preachers, although promised that he would be. The "Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge" also gave Occom a stipend, but he lived in deep poverty for much of his life. In 1761 and 1763, Occom traveled to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations of the Iroquois]] in upstate New York to preach. Winning few converts, he returned to teach at [[Mohegan, Connecticut]], near New London.&lt;ref&gt;Love, William DeLoss Samson, [https://archive.org/stream/samsonoccomchris00love#page/100/mode/1up ''Samson Occom and the Christian Indians of New England''], [[Chicago]]: Pilgrim Press: 1899, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1754, Wheelock had established an Indian charity school in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]], with a legacy from Joshua Moor, among others. Wheelock persuaded his former pupil to travel to England to raise money for the school. Occom preached his way across Britain from February 16, 1766, to July 22, 1767, delivering between three and four hundred sermons, drawing large crowds wherever he went, and raising over ₤12,000 (pounds) for Wheelock's project. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] donated 200 pounds, and [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth]], subscribed 50 guineas. However, Occom on his return learned that Wheelock had failed to care for Occom's wife and children while he was away. Furthermore, Wheelock moved to [[New Hampshire]] and used the funds raised to establish [[Dartmouth College]] (named after the generous aristocrat) for the education of Englishmen, rather than Native Americans as originally promised to Occom.

[[Image:BarberJohnWarnerSamsonOccamHouse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Occom's Mohegan home'', by [[John Warner Barber|John W. Barber]]]]
In 1768, Occom wrote the 10-page ''[[A Short Narrative of My Life]]'', a manuscript now held in Dartmouth College's archive collection; it was first published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Norton Anthology American Literature | volume = A | page = 446}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document expands upon a single page biography that Occom wrote before his preaching tour of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://algonkianchurchhistory.blogspot.com/2008/11/occoms-short-narrative-of-my-life.html| title=Occom's 'Short Narrative of My Life'| work=Algonkian Church History| date=November 22, 2008| last=Siemers| first=Jeff| accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occom also published ''Sermon at the Execution of Moses Paul'' and ''A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs'' in 1774. All provide a very different perspective on the relations between colonists and Native Americans from [[Mary Rowlandson]]'s narrative of her captivity in similar areas a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/mary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131024901/http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/mary.html |archivedate=2012-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry and later life==
Upon his return from England, Occom lived with the [[Mohegan people]]. After Wheelock's betrayal, Occom worked to organize Christianized Indians of [[New England]] and [[Long Island]] into a new tribe, located in western Connecticut. Under continuing pressure from settlers following the [[American Revolutionary War]], in 1785 they migrated at the invitation of Christians of the [[Oneida tribe]] to their reservation in central New York state. Occom, his son-in-law Joseph Johnson (Mohegan) (a messenger for General [[George Washington]] during the American Revolution), and his brother-in-law David Fowler ([[Montaukett|Montauk]]) led the emigrants who built a new settlement called "Brothertown" (originally nearby [[Waterville, New York]]). The Oneida also invited other Christian Indians to live with them, namely the [[Mahican|Stockbridge Mohican]] from western [[Massachusetts]] and two [[Lenape]] groups from southern [[New Jersey]]. The Mohicans founded what they called New Stockbridge in New York, near [[Oneida Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mohican-nsn.gov/Departments/Library-Museum/Mohican_History/origin-and-early.htm ''Origin &amp; Early Mohican History'', Stockbridge-Munsee Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912122346/http://mohican-nsn.gov/Departments/Library-Museum/Mohican_History/origin-and-early.htm |date=2009-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occom not only assured that these villages received civil charters in 1787, but also evicted white settlers from Brothertown on April 12, 1792.&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;Brooks, Joanna, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9ELRhEdupMC&amp;pg=PR25 ''The Collected Writings of Samson Occom''], 2006: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Occom died on July 14, 1792, in New Stockbridge. He is buried just off Bogusville Hill Road outside of [[Deansboro, New York|Deansboro]].

==Legacy==
In the 1820s, many [[Brothertown Indians]] and some Oneida accepted payment for their land from New York State and [[Indian removal|removed]] to what is now known as the town of [[Brothertown, Wisconsin|Brothertown]] in [[Calumet County, Wisconsin|Calumet County]], [[Wisconsin]]. In the modern era, the Brothertown Indians petitioned the federal government for recognition as a tribe, but were denied and have appealed.

Several locations around [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], are named after Occom, including Occom Pond and Occom Ridge on the college campus' northern edge.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical coordinates of Occom Pond and Occom Ridge: {{Coord|43.71099|-72.28783|display=inline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Duthu is the Samson Occom Professor and Chair of Native American Studies Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://native-american.dartmouth.edu/people/n-bruce-duthu| title=N. Bruce Duthu| work=Program in Native American Studies| publisher=Dartmouth College| accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Occom Commons community space is part of Goldstein Hall, in the recently opened McLaughlin Residential Cluster. [[Eastern Connecticut State University]] in [[Willimantic, Connecticut]], also named a residence hall for upperclassmen after Occom.

The [[Neighborhoods of Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich, Connecticut neighborhood of Occum]] is named for Samson Occom.

===Veneration===
Occom is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on July 14.

'''Simhasana''' ({{lang-sa|सिंहासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''Siṁhāsana'') or '''Lion Pose'''&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1705 | title = Yoga Journal - Lion Pose | accessdate = 2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[asana]].

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''simha'' (सिंह) meaning "lion", and ''asana'' (आसन, āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The asana resembles a seated lion, hence the name Simha (lion in Sanskrit) asana. The practitioner's facial expressions are modified to resemble a lion.

The '''Social Republican Party''' ({{lang-km|គណបក្សសង្គមសាធារណរដ្ឋ}}) or Socio-Republican Party ({{lang-fr|Parti social républicain}}; PSR: {{lang-km|Sangkum Sathéaranakrâth}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Cambodia]], founded by the then Head of State [[Lon Nol]] in June 1972 to contest the National Assembly Elections of the [[Khmer Republic]] held on September 3, 1972.

==History==

The Party was formed around Lon Nol's existing Socio-Republican Association, and was heavily influenced by his brother [[Lon Non]] and by the officers of the Khmer Republic's armed forces. It adopted the symbol of [[Angkor Wat]], previously used by Prince [[Norodom Norindeth]]'s Liberal Party from 1946&amp;ndash;56. Its platform was populist, nationalist and anticommunist, Lon Nol being determined to oppose [[North Vietnam]]ese and [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] influence in the region in the context of the [[Second Indochina War]]: its three principal values were declared to be "republicanism, social responsibility and nationalism". The party's main function, however, was to support and legitimise Lon Nol's leadership of the country; he was later to develop a rather ramshackle [[chauvinist]] and semi-mystical ideology called "Neo-Khmerism" to back his political agenda.&lt;ref name=kiernan348&gt;Kiernan, B. ''How Pol Pot came to power'', Yale UP, 2004, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

The party had, early on, developed two distinct factions. One, known as ''Dangrek'', was led by veteran rightist radical, and (since 18 March) Prime Minister, [[Son Ngoc Thanh]] and the left-wing academic [[Hang Thun Hak]].&lt;ref name=corfield&gt;Corfield, J. ''The History of Cambodia'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dangrek'' faction, named after the [[Dângrêk Mountains|mountain range]] in which Thanh's [[Khmer Serei]] guerrillas had been based, attracted those figures who had long been part of the republican and radical opposition to Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] in the period before the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|Republic's establishment]]. The other faction, known as ''Dangkor'', centred on Lon Non and the army.&lt;ref name="corfield"/&gt; Tension between these two factions would later prove a serious obstacle to stable government.

==1972 elections==

The two main opposition parties, the [[Democratic Party (Cambodia)|Democratic Party]] led by [[In Tam]] and the [[Republican Party (Cambodia)|Republican Party]] of [[Sirik Matak]], did not take part in the National Assembly Elections, saying that there were some dubious points in the election law. The Social Republican Party fielded 126 candidates and won all of the seats.&lt;ref name=ipu&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-f/reports/arc/KHMER_REPUBLIC_1972_F.PDF Khmer Republic 1972], Inter-Parliamentary Union&lt;/ref&gt; The only opposition were 10 candidates fielded by the ''[[Pracheachon]]'' group, a resurrected socialist party widely believed to have been organised by Lon Non as a token opposition.

In the elections to the Senate, the upper house of legislature, the 'token' opposition to the PSR was provided by a few candidates of the [[Sangkum]], the former party of Sihanouk, who had been deposed as Head of State by Lon Nol in 1970.&lt;ref name=corfield160&gt;Corfield, J. ''Khmers stand up!: a history of the Cambodian government 1970-1975'', p.160&lt;/ref&gt; The Sangkum had been formally dissolved in 1971, but as with the ''Pracheachon'' was resurrected by Lon Non to provide the appearance of a multiparty election.&lt;ref name="corfield160"/&gt;

==Political infighting==

Thanh's brief period as Prime Minister ended on 15 October 1972, shortly after an assassination attempt widely believed to have been organised by Lon Non.&lt;ref name="kiernan348"/&gt; The PSR's Secretary-General, Hang Thun Hak, was made Prime Minister in his place, but was to be forced out in early 1973 after a period of increasingly poor outcomes for the Republic in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. After a period in which In Tam served in the post, PSR member [[Long Boret]] was made Prime Minister in late 1973.

Lon Non attempted to strengthen his influence on the PSR, but was forced into exile in September 1973. He returned in 1974 and as late as March 1975 was still attempting to obtain the party's Secretary-Generalship, despite the Republic by this time holding little more than the city of [[Phnom Penh]].

In April 1975, the Socio-Republican Party, along with the rest of the Khmer Republic regime, fell to the [[Khmer Rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janda.org/ICPP/ICPP1980/Book/PART2/5-AsiaFarEast/51-Cambodia/Cambodia.htm Part II, p697&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/1972/1972-1-7.htm Situation in Indochina Peninsula&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spiral dance''', also called the '''grapevine dance''' and the '''weaver’s dance''', is a tradition [[group dance]] practiced in [[Neopaganism in the United States]], especially in [[feminist Wicca]] and the associated "[[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming]]" movement. 
It is designed to emphasize "community and rebirth", and is also used "to raise power in a ritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Starhawk |title= [[The Spiral Dance]] |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |edition= 20th anniversary |year= 1999 |page=258 |isbn= 0-06-251632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The spiral dance is a central ritual dance to Reclaiming Witches.  The first spiral dance was performed in Berkeley, CA, and was performed in a ritual intended to meld art, music, and politics as well as to celebrate the publication of ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'' by [[Starhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reclaimingquarterly.org/web/spiraldance/spiral4.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It turned into a yearly ritual, although a large portion of the politics were removed for later versions of the ritual and it currently exists as a [[Samhain]] celebration to honor the dead and celebrate rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reclaiming.org/rituals/samhain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
The spiral dance usually involves a drumming group and a chant or song in addition to the dancers.  All members present hold hands and follow a leader in a counter-clockwise motion using a [[Grapevine (dance move)|grapevine step]].  As the leader comes near closing the circle, he or she whips around and begins moving clockwise while facing the rest of the dancers.  By continuing this formation, every dancer in the line will eventually be face to face with every other dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Starhawk |title= [[The Spiral Dance]] |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |edition= 20th anniversary |year= 1999 |page=203 |isbn= 0-06-251632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some close-knit circles, where people are comfortable with the idea, a kiss is given to each person at the moment they pass each other in the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Starhawk |title= [[The Spiral Dance]] |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |edition= 20th anniversary |year= 1999 |page=258 |isbn= 0-06-251632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases kissing may be discouraged during large or public rituals, due to  disruptions of the rhythm of the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Starhawk |title= [[The Spiral Dance]] |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |edition= 20th anniversary |year= 1999 |page=278 |isbn= 0-06-251632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The 1990s [[adventure game]] ''[[Conquests of the Longbow: The Legend of Robin Hood]]'' depicts Maid Marian as a forest priestess whose duties include, among other things, a one-person spiral dance.

'''Stanley Donen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔː|n|ən}} {{respell|DAWN|ən}}&lt;!-- Are we sure it's not  {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|n|ən}} {{respell|DON|ən}}? --&gt;; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' and ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer [[Gene Kelly]]. Other noteworthy films include ''[[Royal Wedding]]'', ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'', ''[[Funny Face]]'', ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]'', ''[[Damn Yankees (film)|Damn Yankees!]]'', ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', and ''[[Two for the Road (film)|Two for the Road]]''. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director [[George Abbott]], where he befriended Kelly. In 1943 he went to Hollywood and worked as a choreographer before he and Kelly made ''On the Town'' in 1949. He then worked as a contract director for MGM under producer [[Arthur Freed]] producing hit films amid critical acclaim. In 1952 Donen and Kelly co-directed the musical ''Singin' in the Rain'', regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. Donen's relationship with Kelly deteriorated in 1955 during their final collaboration on ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]''. He then broke his contract with MGM to become an independent producer in 1957. He continued making films throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, often financial successes that were critically acclaimed. His film output became less frequent in the early 1980s and he briefly returned to the stage as a director in the 1990s and again in 2002.

Donen is credited with transitioning Hollywood musical films from realistic [[Backstage musical|backstage dramas]] to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals &amp;ndash; such as the extravagant and stylized work of [[Busby Berkeley]] &amp;ndash; were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers were part of a stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what he was doing was a "direct continuation from the [[Fred Astaire|Astaire]] – [[Ginger Rogers|Rogers]] musicals&amp;nbsp;... which in turn came from [[René Clair]] and from [[Ernst Lubitsch|Lubitsch]]&amp;nbsp;... What ''we'' did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal."&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wakeman|title=World Film Directors, Volume 2|publisher=The H. W. Wilson Company|year=1988|isbn=0-8242-0763-7|pages=273–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donen is highly respected by film historians, however his career is often compared to Kelly's and there is debate over who deserves more credit for their collaborations. Donen and Kelly's relationship was complicated, both professionally and personally, but Donen's films as a solo director are generally better regarded by critics than Kelly's. French Film critic [[Jean-Pierre Coursodon]] has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical "outshines anybody else's, including [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s"&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and [[David Quinlan (film critic)|David Quinlan]] called him "the King of the [[musical films|Hollywood musicals]]".&lt;ref&gt;Quinlan, David. ''The Illustrated Guide to Film Directors''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 1983. {{ISBN|0-389-20408-0}}. pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his awards are an [[Honorary Academy Award]] in 1998 and a [[Golden Lion#Golden Lion – Honorary Award|Career Golden Lion]] from the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2004. Donen married five times and had three children. His long term partner since 1999 is film director and comedian [[Elaine May]]. He is the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]].{{toclimit|3}}

==Early life and stage career==
Stanley Donen was born in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the daughter of a jewelry salesman.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|4–6}} His younger sister Carla Donen Davis was born in August 1937.&lt;ref name=Silverman&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephen M. |last=Silverman |title=Dancing on the Ceiling: Stanley Donen and His Movies |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-679-41412-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} Although born to [[Jew]]ish parents, he became an [[atheist]] in his youth.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|312}} Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy as one of the few Jews in Columbia,&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and he was occasionally bullied by [[anti-semitic]] classmates at school.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|8}} To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] musical ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]''. Donen said that he "must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where everything seemed to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me."&lt;ref name=Casper&gt;{{Cite book|first=Joseph A.|last=Casper|title=Stanley Donen|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1983|isbn=0-8108-1615-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} He shot and screened home movies with an [[Standard 8 mm film|8 mm]] camera and projector that his father bought for him.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance lessons in Columbia&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and performed at the local Town Theater.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|4}} His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw [[Broadway musical]]s and took further dance lessons.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; One of his early instructors in New York was [[Ned Wayburn]], who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|14}} After graduating from high school at sixteen, Donen attended the [[University of South Carolina]] for one summer semester, studying psychology.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|333}} Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart|Hart's]] ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', directed by the legendary [[George Abbott]]. The titular Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer [[Gene Kelly]], who became a Broadway star in the role.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Abbott cast Donen in the chorus of his next Broadway show ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]''. He became the show's assistant stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Eventually Donen was fired from ''Best Foot Forward'',&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|33}} but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show ''Beat the Band''.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/VisualHistory/Interviews/Stanley-Donen.aspx|title=Visual History with Stanley Donen|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for ''[[Call Me Mister]]''.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Film career==

===1943–1949: Hollywood choreographer===
In 1943 Arthur Freed, the successful producer of musical films at [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]], bought the [[film rights]] to ''Best Foot Forward'' and made a [[Best Foot Forward (film)|film version]] starring [[Lucille Ball]] and [[William Gaxton]]. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by [[Charles Walters]].&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|46}} At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was quickly becoming a popular supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to [[Columbia Pictures]] for a film, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} Kelly stated, "Stanley needed a job. I needed someone to count for the cameraman, someone who knew the steps and could explain what I was going to do so the shot was set up correctly."&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Sheridan &amp; Leon, Ruth. ''Gene Kelly: A Celebration'', p. 88, Pavilion Books Ltd. 1996. {{ISBN|978-1-85793-848-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in ''[[Cover Girl (1944 film)|Cover Girl]]''.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|58}} Donen came up with the idea for the "Alter Ego" dance sequence where Kelly's reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director [[Charles Vidor]] insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|58–66}} and Donen spent over a year editing it.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|63–64}}&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|10}} The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|65}} and choreographed several films there,&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirschhorn|first=Clive|title=Gene Kelly: a Biography |publisher=W.H. Allen |year=1984 |isbn=0-491-03182-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|242}}{{rp|247}} but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|67}}

In 1944 Donen and Kelly choreographed the musical ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'', released in 1945 and starring Kelly and [[Frank Sinatra]]. The film's most famous scene is when Kelly dances with the cartoon mouse [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]. The animation was supervised by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] and is credited to cartoonist [[Fred Quimby]], but the idea for the scene was Donen's.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|70}} Originally Donen and Kelly wanted to use either [[Mickey Mouse]] or [[Donald Duck]] for the sequence and met with [[Walt Disney]] to discuss the project; Disney was working on a similar idea in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' and was unwilling to [[license]] one of his characters to MGM.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|70–71}} The duo spent two months shooting Kelly dancing and Donen spent a year perfecting the scene frame by frame. According to Barbera "the net result at the preview of ''Anchors Away'' that I went to, blew the audience away."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|172}}

While Kelly completed his service in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval Air Service]] as a photographer from 1944 to 1946,&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Donen worked uncredited as a choreographer on musical films. Of this period Donen said, "I practiced my craft, working with music, track and photography. I often directed the sequences. I always tried to have an original idea about how to do musical sequences."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|17}} Donen has stated that he was excused from military service as [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F]] because of high blood pressure.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|76}} When Kelly returned to civilian life, he and Donen directed and choreographed Kelly's dance scenes in ''[[Living in a Big Way]]''.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|18}} They then began work on an original story about two baseball players in the early 20th century who spend their off-season as [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] song and dance men. This film would eventually become ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' in 1949. Kelly and Donen had hoped to co-direct the film, but Freed hired Busby Berkeley instead and they only directed Kelly's dance numbers. The film starred Kelly, Frank Sinatra and [[Jules Munshin]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

===1949: ''On the Town''===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stanley Donen - On the Town-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Donen (center) directing [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Gene Kelly]] in the opening number ''[[New York, New York (On the Town)|New York, New York]]'' from ''On the Town'']] --&gt;

After the success of ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'', Freed gave Donen and Kelly the chance to direct ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', released in 1949. The film was an adaptation of the [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] [[On the Town (musical)|Broadway musical]] about sailors on leave in New York City and was the first musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted to shoot the entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.

That week produced the film's famous opening number ''[[New York, New York (On the Town)|New York, New York]]''.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Away from both studio interference and sound stage constrictions, Donen and cinematographer [[Harold Rosson]] shot a scene on the streets of New York City that pioneered many cinematic techniques that would not be used again until they were popularized by the [[French New Wave]] ten years later. These techniques included spatial [[jump cuts]], 360-degree pans, hidden cameras, abrupt changes of screen direction and non-professional actors. Donen's biographer Joseph A. Casper stated that the scene avoids being gratuitous or amateurish, while still "developing plot, describing the setting while conveying its galvanizing atmosphere and manic mood, introducing and delineating character."&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Casper also said that "Today the film is regarded as a turning point: the first bona fide musical that moved dance, as well as the musical genre, out of the theater and captured it ''with'' and ''for'' film rather than ''on'' film; the first to make the city an important character; and the first to abandon the chorus."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|34}}

''On the Town'' starred Kelly, Sinatra and Munshin as three sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York whose romantic pursuits lead them to [[Ann Miller]], [[Betty Garrett]] and [[Vera-Ellen]]. The film was a success both financially and critically.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|34}} It won the [[22nd Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture]] and screenwriters Comden and Green won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for [[Writers Guild of America Awards 1949|Best Written American Musical]]. Like [[Orson Welles]], Donen made his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] at 25.&lt;ref name="Out to Lunch with Stanley Donen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/stanley-donan-singin-in-the-rain |title=Out to Lunch with Stanley Donen |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |work=Vanity Fair |date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donen stated that Kelly was "responsible for most of the dance movements. I was behind the camera in the dramatic and musical sequences."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|26}} Kelly believed that he and Donen "were a good team. I thought we complemented each other very well."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gene. ''Dialogue on Film. American Film 4, #4'' (February 1979) pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1949–1952: MGM contract director===
[[File:Astaire - You're All the World to Me.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Fred Astaire dancing on the walls and ceiling in ''Royal Wedding'', a special effect using a rotating reinforced-steel cylindrical chamber to film in]]
After the success of ''On the Town'', Donen signed a seven-year contract with MGM as a director. His next two films were for Freed, but without Kelly.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; After being replaced as director on ''Pagan Love Song'' over personal differences with star [[Esther Williams]], Donen was given the chance to direct his boyhood idol Fred Astaire.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|121–122}}

''[[Royal Wedding]]'' starred Astaire and [[Jane Powell]] as a brother-sister American dancing team performing in England during the [[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|royal wedding of Elizabeth and Philip]] in 1947. [[Judy Garland]] was originally cast in the lead role, but was fired for absenteeism due to illness and replaced by Powell.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|122–126}} In the film, Powell's love affair with a wealthy Englishman ([[Peter Lawford]]) threatens to ruin the brother-sister act, while Astaire finds his own romance with ([[Sarah Churchill (actress)|Sarah Churchill]]). The film is loosely based on Astaire's real-life career with his sister and early dancing partner [[Adele Astaire]], who retired after marrying an English lord in 1932 and includes one of Astaire's most famous dance sequences: the "[[You're All the World to Me]]" number where he defies gravity by dancing first on the walls and then on the ceiling. The shot was achieved by building the set inside a rotating reinforced-steel cylindrical chamber with the camera attached to the cylinder. Both Astaire and the film's lyricist [[Alan Jay Lerner]] claimed that they thought of the idea.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|131–132}} The film included music by Lerner and [[Burton Lane]] and was released in 1951.

Later in 1951 Donen made ''[[Love Is Better Than Ever]]''. The film stars [[Larry Parks]] as a streetwise show business agent who is compelled to marry an innocent young dance teacher ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]). Donen and Kelly appear in cameo roles.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Earl J.|last1=Hess|first2=Pratibha|last2=Dabholkar|title=Singin' in the Rain: The Making of an American Masterpiece|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2009|isbn=0-7006-1656-X |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|201}} The film remained unreleased for over a year after Parks admitted to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] that he had been a member of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and named other members&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|140}} and was unsuccessful at the box office.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

===1952: ''Singin' in the Rain''===
In 1952 Kelly was at the height of his fame after the release of ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]''. He then re-teamed with Donen to make ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', which would become one of the most highly praised films of all time. The film was produced by Freed, written by Comden and Green, photographed by Harold Rosson and starred Kelly, [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Donald O'Connor]] and [[Jean Hagen]].&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Freed wanted to make a musical using old songs that he and composer [[Nacio Herb Brown]] had written in the late 1920s and early 1930s.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|2}} He hired Comden and Green to write a script, with Donen and Kelly involved from the early development stages.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|28}} Comden and Green decided to write a story inspired by the time period in which the songs were written, and satirized Hollywood's transition from [[silent film]]s to "[[Sound film|talkie]]s" in the late 1920s. Comden, Green and Donen interviewed everyone at MGM who was in Hollywood during that period,&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|19}} poking fun at both the first movie musicals and the technical difficulties with early sound films.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|148–150}} This included characters loosely based on Freed and Berkeley&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|162}} and a scene that references silent film star [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]].&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|65}} Donen and Kelly also made use of MGM's large collection of sets, props, costumes and outdated equipment from the 1920s.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|80}}

In the film, Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are two silent film stars in Hollywood whose careers are threatened by the invention of "talkies". With help from his best friend Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) and love interest Kathy Selden (Reynolds), Lockwood saves his career by turning his latest film into a musical.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Filming was harmonious, but Donen thought Kelly's "Broadway Melody" ballet sequence was too long.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|164}} The ''Singin' in the Rain'' musical number took several months to choreograph, and Donen and Kelly found it necessary to dig holes in the cement to create puddles in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/08/stanley-donen-master-of-the-movie-musical/ |title=Stanley Donen: Master of the Movie Musical |accessdate=November 3, 2012 |work=ABC News |date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was a hit when it was released in April 1952, earning over $7.6 million.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|188}} Kelly's ''An American in Paris'' had been a surprise Best Picture winner at the [[24th Academy Awards|Oscars]] in March, and MGM decided to re-release it. ''Singin' in the Rain'' got pulled from many theaters to showcase the older film, preventing it from making further profits.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|169}} ''Singin' in the Rain'' was nominated for two [[25th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Hagen and Best Original Score. Donald O'Connor won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy]] and Comden and Green once again won the Writers Guild of America Award for [[Writers Guild of America Awards 1952|Best Written American Musical]].&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|187}} Initially the film received only moderate reviews from critics such as [[Bosley Crowther]]&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|141}}&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|183}} and did not begin to receive widespread acclaim until the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|169}} One of its earliest supporters was critic [[Pauline Kael]], who said that it "is perhaps the most enjoyable of all movie musicals – just about the best Hollywood musical of all time."&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; It was re-released in 1975 to critical and popular success.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|141}}&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|55}}

===1952–1955: ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' and break with MGM===
Now established as a successful film director, Donen continued his solo career at MGM with ''[[Fearless Fagan]]'' in 1952. Based on a true story, the film stars [[Carleton Carpenter]] as a GI who brings his tame lion with him when he joins the army. In 1953 Donen made the musical ''[[Give a Girl a Break]]''. The film stars Debbie Reynolds, [[Marge Champion]] and Helen Wood as three aspiring dancers competing for the lead in a new Broadway musical. [[Bob Fosse]], [[Gower Champion]] and [[Kurt Kasznar]] also appear, with music by Lane and [[Ira Gershwin]]. The most famous scene is the "Give a Girl a Break" dance between Reynolds and Fosse, which was choreographed backwards and then played in reverse to create the illusion that the two are surrounded by hundreds of balloons that instantly appear at the touch of their fingers.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|184}} Shooting the film became a bitter experience for Donen due to a major on-set fight over the film's choreography between Fosse and Gower Champion.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|182}} The film was not well reviewed upon release, but its reputation has grown over the years.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Donen solidified his solo career and scored another hit with the musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Based on a short story by [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], the film had music by [[Saul Chaplin]] and [[Gene de Paul]], with lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]] and choreography by [[Michael Kidd]]. Jane Powell plays Milly, an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ([[Howard Keel]]) only hours after meeting him. When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods, Milly discovers that her husband's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish. She makes it her mission to domesticate them and, upon Milly's sarcastic suggestion, the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them. The film was shot in the new [[CinemaScope]] format and is remembered for its dance sequences, particularly the "[[barn raising]] scene" in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|197}} and appeared on many critics' 10 Best Films lists. It was nominated for five [[27th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Picture and Best Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture), which it won.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|76}} Its success was a surprise to MGM, which had invested more money in two other musicals: ''[[Rose Marie (1954 film)|Rose Marie]]'' and ''[[Brigadoon (film)|Brigadoon]]'', starring Kelly.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|197}} ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' was more profitable than either film, as well as ''On the Town'' and ''Singin' in the Rain'', and its success was a major turning point for Donen's career.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|76}} The film was later criticized by novelist [[Francine Prose]], who described it as anti-woman, calling it "one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made" and a musical about rape.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|188}}

Later in 1954 Donen made ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]'', a biography of the Hungarian-born American [[operetta]] composer [[Sigmund Romberg]] starring [[José Ferrer]]. The film included cameos by many MGM contract actors, including the only screen pairing of Gene Kelly and his brother Fred. Although it received mediocre reviews, Romberg's cult status and popularity helped make the film a hit.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|202}}

In 1955 Donen teamed up with Kelly for their third and final directorial collaboration. The musical ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' was produced by Freed, written by Comden and Green and had music by [[André Previn]]. It starred Kelly, [[Dan Dailey]], [[Cyd Charisse]], Michael Kidd, and [[Dolores Gray]]. Originally envisioned as a sequel to ''On the Town'', Kelly, Dailey and Kidd play three ex-GIs who reunite 10 years after World War II and discover that none of their lives have turned out how they had expected.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Kelly approached Donen with the project and at first Donen was reluctant due to his own success. Their friendship deteriorated during production&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and Donen noted, "the atmosphere from day one was very tense and nobody was speaking to anybody."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|211}} He called it a "one hundred percent nightmare" which was a "struggle from beginning to end"&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite book | title=Singin' in the Rain: The Making of an American Masterpiece | publisher=University Press of Kansas |author1=Hess, Earl J |author2=Dabholkar, Pratibha A. | year=2009 | pages=203–205 | isbn=0700617574}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MGM did not allow the co-directors to shoot on location in New York.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|86}} ''It's Always Fair Weather'' was moderately profitable, but not as successful as their previous two films. It was Donen's last film with Kelly or Freed.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; After the its completion he fulfilled his MGM contract agreement by working with other studios. His last project for MGM was completing the final four days of shooting on ''[[Kismet (1955 film)|Kismet]]'' in July 1955 for director [[Vincent Minnelli]].&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|94}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/411149%7C97644/Kismet.html |title=Kismet (1955) |publisher=tcm.com |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956–1959: director and independent producer===
Donen's next film was at [[Paramount Pictures]] for producer [[Roger Edens]]. ''[[Funny Face]]'' contains four of the original [[George Gershwin|George]] and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated [[Funny Face (musical)|1927 Broadway musical of the same name]] that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer [[Richard Avedon]], who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by [[Leonard Gershe]] and included additional music by Gershe and Edens.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s Paramount contracts, the [[Warner Brothers]]-owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|229}} Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in [[Greenwich Village]] and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Donen, Avedon and cinematographer [[Ray June]] collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp [[VistaVision]].&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|231–233}} ''Funny Face'' was screened in competition at the [[1957 Cannes Film Festival]] and received good reviews from critics like Crowther.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|241}} ''Sight and Sound'', in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|104}}

While in pre-production on ''Funny Face'', Donen received a letter from his old boss George Abbott inviting him to make a film version of his stage hit ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' at Warner Brothers. As part of the deal to secure the Warner-owned Gershwin music he wanted for ''Funny Face'', Donen accepted the offer&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|229}} and he and Abbott co-directed the film version in 1957.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; ''[[The Pajama Game (film)|The Pajama Game]]'' stars [[Doris Day]] and [[John Raitt]], with music by [[Richard Adler]] and [[Jerry Ross (composer)|Jerry Ross]] and choreography by Bob Fosse. Raitt plays a plant supervisor at a nightwear factory who is in constant disputes with the plant's union organizer (Day), until they end up falling in love.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|248}} Donen described his working relationship with Abbott as relaxed, stating that "[Abbott would] play tennis, come watch on the set for an hour, then watch the rushes, then go home."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|247}} It was only a modest financial success,&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; but [[Jean-Luc Godard]] praised it and declared "Donen is surely the master of the movie musical. ''The Pajama Game'' exists to prove it."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|259}}

Donen's next film was ''[[Kiss Them for Me (film)|Kiss Them for Me]]''. He was personally asked by [[Cary Grant]] to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|261}} With a plot that strongly resembles ''On the Town'', the film features Grant, [[Ray Walston]] and [[Larry Blyden]] as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike ''On the Town'', ''Kiss Them for Me'' is a dark comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film was released in 1957 to mostly poor reviews.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|122}}

After three films in 1957 Donen became an independent producer and director. He had reluctantly agreed to direct ''Kiss Them for Me'' on condition that [[20th Century Fox]] buy out his remaining contract with MGM.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|263}} Now free from contractual obligations, he formed Grandon Productions with Grant and signed a distribution deal through Warner Brothers.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|269}} Donen would self-produce nearly all of his films for the rest of his career, sometimes under the name "Stanley Donen Productions". Donen and Grant inaugurated their company in 1958 with ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]'', based on a play by [[Norman Krasna]] and starring Grant and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Because of Bergman's schedule, the film was shot on location in London. Bergman plays a famous and reclusive actress who falls in love with the supposedly married playboy-diplomat Grant. When Bergman discovers that he has been lying about having a wife, she concocts a charade with another man in order to win Grant's full affection. The film's most famous scene involves Donen's clever circumvention of the strict [[Production Code]]. In the scene, Grant is in Paris while Bergman is still in London and the two exchange pillow talk over the phone. Donen used a [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] of the two stars with synchronized movements to make it appear as though they were in the same bed together. The film was a financial and critical success,&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|131}} and Donen was compared to such directors as [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and [[George Cukor]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Donen briefly returned to the musical genre in 1958 with ''[[Damn Yankees (film)|Damn Yankees!]]'', based on George Abbott's [[Damn Yankees|Broadway hit]]. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same hands-off collaboration as their first film.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|252}} Like ''The Pajama Game'' the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred [[Tab Hunter]], [[Gwen Verdon]], and Ray Walston. ''Damn Yankees!'' is an adaptation of the [[Faust (opera)|Faust]] legend about a fan of the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] who would sell his soul to give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays the Brooks Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter).&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Donen was able to shoot three real Senator-[[New York Yankees|Yankee]] games on location with seven hidden cameras.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|134}} The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|140}} It was also Donen's last musical film for many years.

===1960–1969: United Kingdom===
After ''Indiscreet'' Donen made England his home until the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|274}} Musicals' waning popularity caused Donen to focus on comedy films. He observed that his "London base afforded me the advantage of being away from the Hollywood rat race. Just going your own way in spite of whatever anyone else is doing or in spite of what you've done already was satisfying. I also had the advantage of the European influence: their way of looking at life, of making movies."&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; While in the UK in the early 1960s Donen was praised as an early influence on the then-emerging [[British New Wave]] film movement.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|180}}

In the late 1950s Donen signed a non-exclusive, three-film deal with Columbia Pictures.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|277}} His first film under this contract was ''[[Once More, with Feeling!]]'' in 1960. Adapted by [[Harry Kurnitz]] from his own stage play, the film was shot in Paris and starred [[Yul Brynner]] as a tyrannical orchestra conductor whose mistress ([[Kay Kendall]]) grows tired of his tantrums and plots to marry him in order to quickly divorce him for his money. Kendall was terminally ill with [[leukemia]] during the shoot and died before its release. The film was not successful financially or critically.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Donen quickly re-teamed with Brynner and Kurnitz for the film ''[[Surprise Package (film)|Surprise Package]]'', also released in 1960. In this film Brynner plays an American gangster who is deported to the Greek island of [[Rhodes]]. [[Mitzi Gaynor]] plays the "surprise package" who is sent to the island to appease Brynner, and [[Noël Coward]] plays the King of Rhodes whom Brynner plots to dethrone. The film was not a financial success, and Donen stated that it was made because he "desperately needed money for personal reasons."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|155}} These were the only two films that Donen completed for his Columbia contract. The studio cancelled the deal after their poor box office results, and Donen was unable to produce the projects that he was pursuing at that time: playwright [[Robert Bolt]]'s ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'' and ''[[Elizabeth Kata|A Patch of Blue]]'', both of which became successful films by other directors.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|277–278}}

Grandon Productions produced Donen's next film: ''[[The Grass Is Greener]]'', released through [[Universal Pictures]] in 1960. Cary Grant and [[Deborah Kerr]] play the earl and countess of a large estate in England who are forced to permit guided tours of their mansion in order to help their financial problems. [[Robert Mitchum]] plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and [[Jean Simmons]] plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the US, but successful in England where the original stage version had been a [[West End theatre|West End]] hit.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

[[File:Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in ''Charade'', Donen's most financially successful film]]

In 1963 Donen made one of his most praised films: ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, [[Walter Matthau]], [[James Coburn]], [[George Kennedy]] and [[Ned Glass]]. Donen has said that he had "always wanted to make a movie like one of my favorites, [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[North by Northwest]]''"&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|166}} and the film has been referred to as "the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://decentfilms.com/sections/reviews/charade.html |title=Charade (1963) |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Charade'' was produced by Stanley Donen Productions,&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|288}} released through Universal and adapted by [[Peter Stone]] from his own novel. Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) discovers that her husband has been murdered and (at least) three sinister men are all searching for the $250,000 in gold that he had hidden somewhere. Peter Joshua (Grant) befriends Reggie and helps her fight off the three thugs while the two begin to fall in love. The film was released in December 1963, only two weeks after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of US President John F. Kennedy]], and the word "assassinate" had to be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] twice.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|292–293}} It was Donen's most financially successful film&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|284}} and influenced a number of romantic comedy-thrillers released in the years following it.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Film critic [[Judith Crist]] called it a "stylish and amusing melodrama", and Pauline Kael said it had "a freshness and spirit that makes [it] unlike the films of any other country" and was "probably the best American film of [1963]".&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|294}} In 2002 it was remade as ''[[The Truth About Charlie]]'', directed by [[Jonathan Demme]].

In 1966 Donen made another Hitchcock-inspired film: ''[[Arabesque (1966 film)|Arabesque]]'', starring [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Sophia Loren]]. The film was written by Julian Mitchell and Stanley Price, with an uncredited rewrite by Peter Stone.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|294}} Peck plays an American professor at [[Oxford University]] who is an expert in ancient hieroglyphics. He is approached by a Middle Eastern prime minister to investigate an organization that is attempting to assassinate him and uses hieroglyphic codes to communicate. The investigation leads Peck to one mystery after another, often involving the prime minister's mysterious mistress (Loren). The film was Donen's second consecutive hit.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|294}}

In 1967 Donen made ''[[Two for the Road (film)|Two for the Road]]'', starring Audrey Hepburn and [[Albert Finney]] with supporting roles by [[Eleanor Bron]], [[William Daniels]], and [[Jacqueline Bisset]]. The film was conceived by Donen and written by novelist [[Frederic Raphael]], who was nominated for an Academy Award.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; It has been called one of Donen's most personal films, "with glints of passion never disclosed before", and "a veritable textbook on film editing."&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; The film's complicated and non-linear story is about the 12-year relationship between Hepburn and Finney over the course of four separate (but interwoven) road trips that they take together throughout the years in the south of France. It was moderately successful at the box office while the critical reception was extremely mixed.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|185}} Crowther called the film "just another version of commercial American trash."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|308}} The film attained a cult following&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and was cited as an early example of non-linear storytelling in film. It is also the film that Donen said he is most frequently asked about by film students.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|299}}

While living in England Donen became a fan of the British variety show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' and wanted to work with the show's comedy duo [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; The resulting film was ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'', an updated version of the Faust legend in 1967. It was written by Cook with music by Moore, and also starred Eleanor Bron and [[Raquel Welch]]. Moore plays a lonely young man whose unrequited love of his co-worker (Bron) drives him to attempt suicide. Just then the devil (Cook) appears and offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The film's fun-loving association with the [[Swinging London]] of the 1960s divided critics, but [[Roger Ebert]] called its satire "barbed and contemporary&amp;nbsp;... dry and understated", and overall, a "magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19680130/REVIEWS/801300301/1023 |title=Bedazzled |date=January 30, 1968 |publisher=The Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=December 28, 2011 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] called it the feeblest of all known variations on the Faust theme.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; The film was a hit&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|310}} and was especially popular among American college students.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|317}} Donen considered it a favorite among his own films&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and called it "a very personal film in that I said a great deal about what I think is important in life."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|191}} It was remade as ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]'' by director [[Harold Ramis]] in 2000.

In 1969 Donen directed ''[[Staircase (film)|Staircase]]'', an adaptation of the autobiographical stage play by Charles Dyer with music by Moore. [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Richard Burton]] star as a middle-aged gay couple who run a London barber shop and live together in a "bad marriage".&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; The film was shot in Paris for tax purposes and was not a financial success. It received poor reviews upon release, but was reevaluated by film critic [[Armond White]] in 2007. He called the film "a rare Hollywood movie to depict gay experience with wisdom, humor and warmth", and "a lost treasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypress.com/article-16861-bosom-buddies.html |title=Bosom Buddies |date=July 25, 2007 |publisher=New York Press |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103224342/http://www.nypress.com/article-16861-bosom-buddies.html |archivedate=January 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–2003: Later works===
After Donen's marriage to Adelle Beatty ended, he moved back to Hollywood in 1970.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|203}} Producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] asked Donen to direct an adaptation of the beloved children's book ''[[The Little Prince]]''. Lyricist Alan Jay Lerner and composer [[Frederick Loewe]] wrote the music and screenplay and filming was done on location in Tunisia.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; ''[[The Little Prince (1974 film)|The Little Prince]]'' stars Steven Warner in the title role, with [[Richard Kiley]], Bob Fosse, [[Gene Wilder]] and [[Donna McKechnie]]. It was Donen's first musical film since ''Damn Yankees!'' Although it contained very little dancing, Fosse choreographed his own dance scenes as the snake. Lerner stated that Donen "took it upon himself to change every tempo, delete musical phrases at will and distort the intention of every song until the entire score was unrecognizable".&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Alan J.. ''The Street Where I Live'', Coronet Books, London, 1978, {{ISBN|978-0-340-25453-0}}, pp. 242&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in 1974 and was a financial disaster.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Donen's next film was ''[[Lucky Lady]]'', starring [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Minnelli plays a Prohibition era bootlegger who smuggles alcohol from Mexico to California with the help of Hackman and Reynolds, who both compete for her affection. Donen has stated that he "really cared about [the film] and gave three years of my life to it&amp;nbsp;... I think it's a very good movie."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|220}} It went over budget and was unsuccessful at the box office. Most critics were unenthusiastic; however, [[Jay Cocks]] praised the film for having "the glistening surface and full-throttle frivolity that characterized Hollywood films in the 1930s."&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

Nostalgia for old Hollywood movies would be a theme of Donen's next film: ''[[Movie Movie]]'', produced by [[Lew Grade]]'s [[ITC Entertainment]] and scripted by [[Larry Gelbart]] and [[Sheldon Keller]]. The film is actually two shorter films presented as an old fashioned [[double feature]], complete with a fake movie trailer and an introduction by comedian [[George Burns]]. It starred [[George C. Scott]], [[Trish Van Devere]], [[Red Buttons]], Michael Kidd and [[Eli Wallach]] and premiered in competition at the [[29th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1978. The first of the two films is ''Dynamite Hands'', a black and white tribute to boxing – morality films. The second film is ''Baxter's Beauties of 1933'', a tribute to the extravagant musicals of Busby Berkely.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; Like Donen's previous two films, it was unsuccessful both financially and critically.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|228}}

In 1980, Donen made the [[science fiction]] film ''[[Saturn 3]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Farrah Fawcett]] and [[Harvey Keitel]]. Donen first read the script when its writer (and ''Movie Movie'''s set designer) [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|228}} According to Donen "only a tiny bit of what Barry shot ended up in the finished film."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|228}} It was a critical and financial disaster&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt; and initially Donen did not want to be credited as director.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|233}} In the early 1980s Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dead Zone (novel)|The Dead Zone]]'' and worked with writer [[Jeffrey Boam]] on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and [[David Cronenberg]] directed the [[The Dead Zone (film)|film]] a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to "connect with contemporary youthful audiences" and that the script that they worked on together was "very close to the script that David wound up making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-the-last-crusade-of-screenwriter-jeffrey-boam/ |title=Exclusive Interview: The Last Crusade of Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam |accessdate=March 5, 2013 |publisher=assignmentx.com |date=November 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donen's last theatrical film was the [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|May – December romance]] ''[[Blame It on Rio]]'' in 1984. The film is a remake of the 1977 [[Claude Berri]] film ''Un moment d'égarement''&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|363}} and was written by Gelbart and Charlie Peters. It stars [[Michael Caine]], [[Joseph Bologna]], [[Michelle Johnson (actress)|Michelle Johnson]], [[Valerie Harper]] and [[Demi Moore]] and was shot on location in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Caine and Bologna play wealthy executives on vacation with their families in Rio, where Caine has an affair with Bologna's teenage daughter (Johnson). It received poor reviews, but was a modest success financially.&lt;ref name=Wakeman273282/&gt;

In 1986, Donen produced the televised ceremony of the [[58th Academy Awards]], which included a musical performance of the song "Once a Star, Always a Star" with [[June Allyson]], [[Leslie Caron]], Marge Champion, Cyd Charisse, [[Kathryn Grayson]], Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, and Esther Williams. Also in 1986 Donen directed a musical sequence for an [[Big Man on Mulberry Street|episode]] of the popular TV series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' and directed the music video for [[Lionel Richie]]'s song "[[Dancing on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie song)#Music video|Dancing on the Ceiling]]".&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|336–337}} In 1989 Donen was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from the University of South Carolina. In his commencement address Donen stated that he thought he was unique in being the first tap dancer to be a doctor and then tap danced for the graduates.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|333–334}} At around the same time Donen taught a seminar on film musicals at the [[Sundance Institute]] at the request of [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|338}}

In 1993, Donen was preparing to produce and direct a movie musical adaptation of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' starring [[Michael Jackson]]. After allegations that Jackson had molested young boys at his Neverland ranch became a tabloid scandal, the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|337}} Later that year Donen directed a stage version of ''[[The Red Shoes (musical)|The Red Shoes]]'' at the George Gershwin Theater. He replaced the original director Susan Schulman just six weeks before the show opened. It closed after four days.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|337–338}} In 1998, Donen was awarded an Honorary Academy Award "in appreciation of a body of work marked by grace, elegance, wit and visual innovation." In his acceptance speech he danced with his Oscar statue while singing [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[Cheek to Cheek]]", a song first popularized by his boyhood idol Fred Astaire. [[Martin Scorsese]] presented the award and created a montage of Donen's films for the show.&lt;ref name="Out to Lunch with Stanley Donen"/&gt;

Donen's last film was the [[television film|made-for-TV movie]] ''[[Love Letters (1999 film)|Love Letters]]'', which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in April 1999. The film starred [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] and [[Laura Linney]] and was based on the [[Love Letters (play)|play]] by [[A.R. Gurney]]. Weber plays a successful US Senator who finds out that his long lost love (Linney) has recently died. The two had only corresponded through mail over the years, and Weber remembers Linney through his collection of old love letters.

During his career Donen's biggest rival was Vincente Minnelli, to whom he is often compared. Like Donen, Minnelli was a contract director at MGM known for the musicals he made in the Freed Unit. According to Donen biographer Stephen Silverman, critics tend to "express a distinct preference for Donen's bold, no-nonsense style of direction over Minnelli's Impressionist visual palette and Expressionist character motivations", while most film directors are said to prefer Minnelli's work.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|191–192}} Michael Kidd, who worked with both directors early in his career, describes Minnelli as being much less open to collaborative suggestions than Donen. The two directors' camera work differs in that Minnelli often used forward and backwards tracking shots while Donen preferred horizontal tracking shots and crane shots. Silverman said film critics consider Donen's approach to be better suited for dance sequences.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|191–192}}

[[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] dismisses most of his later comedy films, but praises him for leading "the musical in a triumphant and personal direction: out of doors&amp;nbsp;... Not even Minnelli can rival the fresh-air excitement of such sequences. And few can equal his integration of song, dance and story."&lt;ref name=Thomson274&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomson |first=David |title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film |edition=5 |publisher=Alfred A.

''Singin' in the Rain'' is Donen's most revered film and it was included in the first group of films to be inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1989 and has been included on [[Sight and Sound]]'s prestigious list of "Top Ten Films" twice, in 1982 and in 2002. Chaplin and Truffaut were among its earliest fans,&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|169}} and [[Billy Wilder]] called the film "one of the five greatest pictures ever made."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|146}}

==Cine-dance==
Donen made a host of critically acclaimed and popular films. His most important contribution to the art of film was helping to transition movie musicals from the realistic backstage settings of filmed theater to a more cinematic form that integrates film with dance. Eventually film scholars named this concept "cine-dance" (a dance that can only be created in the medium of film), and its origins are in the Donen/Kelly films.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Film scholar Casey Charness described "cine-dance" as "a melding of the distinctive strengths of dancing and filmmaking that had never been done before" and adds that Donen and Kelly "seem to have elevated Hollywood dance from simplistic display of either dancing or photographic ability into a perception that incorporates both what the dancer can do and what the camera can see&amp;nbsp;... [They] developed a balance between camera and dancer that&amp;nbsp;... encouraged both photographer and choreographer to contribute significantly to the creation and final effectiveness of dance."&lt;ref name=Charness&gt;{{Cite book |first=Casey |last=Charness |title=Hollywood cine-dance: a description of the interrelationship of camerawork and choreography in films by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly |publisher=New York University |year=1977 |isbn=0632043792}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

When "talkies" began to gain momentum in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films, such as ''[[Broadway Melody]]'' and Berkley's ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]''. These films established the [[backstage musical]], a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and the people involved in putting it on. They set the standard for the musical genre, placing their musical numbers either within the context of a stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|4–12}} Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were "a reaction against those backstage musicals."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|221}} Donen credits producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed "had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world into something else. He didn't quite know what to change it into, just that it had to change."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|8}} Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn/&gt;{{rp|156}}

===Techniques===
Donen and Kelly's films set new standards for special effects, animation, editing and cinematography. Their first collaboration ''Cover Girl'' firmly established their intentions, particularly in the "Alter Ego" dance sequence. It employed a special effect that could not be achieved with a live take, while advancing the story and revealing the character's inner conflict. Donen and Kelly tested the limits of film's potential with the Jerry the Mouse dance in ''Anchors Aweigh'', one of the most sophisticated combinations of live action and animation.

By the time they made ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' they had perfected what Martin Rubin called an "indication of changing trends in musical films" which differed from the Berkeley spectacles towards "relatively small-scale affairs that place the major emphasis on comedy, transitions to the narrative, the cleverness of the lyrics and the personalities and performance skills of the stars, rather than on spectacle and group dynamics."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|92}} Rubin credits Donen and Kelly with making musicals more realistic, compared to Berkeley's style of a "separation of narrative space from performance space"&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|94}} ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' was Berkeley's last film as a director and today can be viewed as a passing of the torch. Both Donen and Kelly found working with Berkeley difficult,&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|37}} and the director left before the film's completion. When Donen and Kelly directed their own work, they were able to realize their ambitions.

When Donen and Kelly released ''On the Town'', they boldly opened the film with an extravagant musical number shot on location in New York with fast-paced editing and experimental camera work, thus breaking from the conventions of that time. Their most celebrated film ''Singin' in the Rain'' is appropriately a musical about the birth of the movie musical. The film includes a musical montage that Donen says was "doing Busby Berkeley here, only we're making fun of him."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|161}} Charness stated that ''Singin' in the Rain'''s references to Berkeley "marks the first time the Hollywood musical had ever been reflexive, and amused at its own extravagant non-dancing inadequacy, at that" and that Berekeley's "overhead kaleidoscope floral pattern is predominantly featured, as is the line of tap-dancing chorines, who are seen only from the knees down."&lt;ref name=Charness/&gt;{{rp|100}} Charness also stated that the film's cinematography "moves the audience perspective along with the dance."&lt;ref name=Charness/&gt;{{rp|98–99}}

Charness singled out the film's famous title number and states, "it's a very kinetic moment, for though there is no technically accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance&amp;nbsp;... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes place at the same time Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon."&lt;ref name=Charness/&gt;{{rp|107}} He also complimented Donen's direction in the "Moses Supposes" number, including "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized&amp;nbsp;... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another."&lt;ref name=Charness/&gt;{{rp|103}} Although Donen credits earlier musicals by [[René Clair]], Lubitsch and Astaire as "integrated",&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|119}} he also states that "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|161}} Donen's ''Royal Wedding'' and ''Give A Girl A Break'' continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film ''Invitation to Dance''.

==Relationship with Gene Kelly==
Donen's relationship with Gene Kelly was complicated and he often spoke bitterly about his former friend and mentor decades after they worked together. Kelly was never explicitly negative about Donen in later years.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|204}} However, Silverman has asserted that Kelly's comments were often condescending and demonstrated "a long-standing attempt to diminish Donen's contributions to their collective work."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|48}} The reasons for their conflict were both personal (both men married dancer [[Jeanne Coyne]]) and professional (Donen always felt that Kelly did not treat him as an equal). They disagreed over who deserved more credit for their joint projects: three films as co-directors and four as co-choreographers.

===Jeanne Coyne===
At age 7 Coyne enrolled in the Gene Kelly Studio of Dance in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] and developed a schoolgirl crush on him&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref name=Yudkoff&gt;{{Cite book |last=Yudkoff |first=Alvin |title=Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams |publisher=Back Stage Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-8230-8813-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} In her twenties she was cast in ''Best Foot Forward'', where she reconnected with Kelly and first met Donen,&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|89}} later moving to Hollywood with them.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|91}} She and Donen eloped in 1948,&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|188}} but their marriage became strained.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|137}} They separated in 1950 and divorced in 1951.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|97}} During their marriage Donen confided to Coyne his frustration with Kelly while making ''On the Town'', only to find that she immediately took Kelly's side.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|202}} Coyne worked as Kelly's personal assistant on several films while married to Donen and continued assisting Kelly until her death. Rumors held that Kelly and Coyne were having an affair both during and after Coyne's marriage to Donen,&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|137}} as well as that Donen was in love with Kelly's first wife [[Betsy Blair]].&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|91}}{{rp|194}} Blair's autobiography makes no mention of an affair between Kelly and Coyne nor of any romantic relationship with Donen. However, she does state that Donen's marriage to Coyne was unhappy&lt;ref name=Blair&gt;{{Cite book |last=Blair |first=Betsy |title=The Memory of All That |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2003 |isbn=0-375-41299-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}} and that Donen was very close to both her and Kelly.&lt;ref name=Blair/&gt;{{rp|114–115}}

Kelly said that Donen's impulsive marriage to Coyne showed an emotional immaturity and lack of good judgment,&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|194}} and stated that "Jeannie's marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start. Because every time Stanley looked at Jeannie, he saw Betsy, whom he loved; and every time Jeannie looked at Stanley, I guess she saw me. One way or another it was all pretty incestuous."&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn/&gt;{{rp|235}} Kelly's marriage to Blair ended in 1957, after which he moved in with Coyne. They married in 1960 and had two children together.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|235–236}} Coyne died of leukemia in 1973.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|253}} In November 2012 the musical ''What A Glorious Feeling'' depicted both the making of ''Singin' in the Rain'' and the love triangle between Donen, Kelly and Coyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://centralpa.broadwayworld.com/article/Riverside-Theatres-WHAT-A-GLORIOUS-FEELING-Opens-1030-20121012 |title=Riverside Theatre's WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING Opens 10/30 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |publisher=broadwayworld.com |date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://brtstage.org/productions/what-glorious-feeling|title=What A Glorious Feeling|accessdate=March 11, 2012|date=October 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922022548/http://www.brtstage.org/productions/what-glorious-feeling|archivedate=September 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional conflict===
Donen and Kelly's relationship has been described as similar to that of the characters Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown in ''Singin' in the Rain'', with Kelly as the star performer and Donen as his trusted sidekick.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|45}} Kelly described Donen as being like a son to him&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|48}} and Donen initially idolized Kelly, while still finding him to be "cold, egotistical and very rough."&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn/&gt;{{rp|74}} Although Donen credited Kelly for "jump-starting his career as a filmmaker",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/10/04/stanley_donen_visits_town_this_week_during_a_retrospective_at_harvard_film_archive/?page=1 |title=Like his films, Donen exudes style and wit |date=April 10, 2009 |work=Boston Globe |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also stated that MGM producer Roger Edens was his biggest promoter.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|90}}

Many people believe that Donen owed everything to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having "no particular identity or evident talent&amp;nbsp;... and was just a kid from the south who wanted to make it in show business."&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|40}} Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord;&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|39}} other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|40}} Kelly would sometimes embarrass and patronize Donen in public,&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|194}} such as berating him for not being able to keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for ''Cover Girl''.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|134}} Donen has admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|5}} Despite Donen's growing resentment of Kelly,&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|193–194}} he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|202}} Tensions between the two exploded on the set of ''It's Always Fair Weather''. After Donen's recent hits ''Deep in My Heart'' and ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' he did not want to make another film with Kelly.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|206}} They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|233–234}} Donen almost quit the film,&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|212}} and his friendship with Kelly ended.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|84}}

Other tensions included Donen's hit films&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|232}} compared to Vincente Minnelli's ''Brigadoon'' (which Kelly was closely involved in and had wanted to direct&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|231–232}}) flop, and Kelly's own ambitious film ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to Dance]]'', both financially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|170–171}}&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|209}} During the shooting of ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'', Donen often complained about his budgetary constraints, while ''Brigadoon'' had a much larger budget.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|197}} Around that time Kelly's unsuccessfully attempted dramatic acting with ''[[The Devil Makes Three (film)|The Devil Makes Three]]'' and ''[[Seagulls Over Sorrento]]'' also flopped, and his marriage to Betsy Blair was ending.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|84}}

In later years Donen would state that he had nothing nice to say about Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/gene-kelly/filmmaker-interview-robert-trachtenberg/518/ |title=Gene Kelly: Filmmaker Interview – Robert Trachtenberg |date=August 6, 2006 |publisher=PBS.org |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1991 tribute to Comden and Green, Kelly said in a public speech that Donen "needed [him] to grow up with" but added "I needed Stanley at the back of the camera."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|214}} He also described Donen as being thought of as his whipping-boy at MGM.&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn/&gt;{{rp|156}} Although Donen often complained that Kelly never gave him enough credit for their work, Kelly did credit him for the Jerry the Mouse&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|146}} and "Alter Ego" dance sequences.&lt;ref name=Yudkoff/&gt;{{rp|134}} In 1992 Donen said "I'm grateful to him, but I paid back the debt, ten times over. And he got his money's worth out of me."&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|213}} Betsy Blair claimed to be "surprised and bemused" about Donen's bitterness towards Kelly.&lt;ref name=Blair/&gt;{{rp|116}}

===Directorial careers===
The relative importance of the two men's contributions has been debated by critics. David Thomson wrote about "the problem in assessing [Donen's] career: who did what in their collaboration? And what is Donen's real standing as a director?" Thomson remarked that "nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen's retreating crane shot."&lt;ref name=Thomson274/&gt; However set reports state that Kelly rode the camera boom between shots and during camera set-ups.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|207}} Donen stated that "by the time you hash it through from beginning to end ten million times, you can't remember who did what except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea."&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;{{rp|26}} Composer Saul Chaplin said that "Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an eager and talented pupil."&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, Saul. ''The Golden Age of Movie Musicals and Me''. University of Oklahoma Press. 1994. {{ISBN|0-8061-2652-3}}. pp. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; During the shooting of ''On the Town'', all memos and correspondence from MGM to the production were addressed exclusively to Donen and not to Kelly.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|106}}

However, actress [[Kathleen Freeman]] stated that when people visited set of ''Singin' in the Rain'' to relate their experiences during the silent era, they would ask to speak with Kelly.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|207}} ''Singin' in the Rain'' art director [[Randall Duell]] stated, "Gene ran the show. Stan had some good ideas and worked with Gene, but he was still the 'office boy' to Gene, in a sense, although Gene had great respect for him."&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|42}} Kelly became more involved with the ''Singin' in the Rain'' script during its third draft, which was when its structure began to resemble the final version.&lt;ref name=HessandDabholkar/&gt;{{rp|58–59}} Comparing Donen and Kelly's films as solo directors, Donen's were usually more critically acclaimed and financially successful than Kelly's films. Kelly's 1969 film ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' is credited with effectively killing the Hollywood musical.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|345}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Stanley Donen (left) interviewed by Mike Nichols.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Donen with [[Mike Nichols]] at a 2010 Lincoln Center retrospective]]
Donen married and divorced five times and had three children. His first wife was dancer, choreographer and actress Jeanne Coyne. They married on April 14, 1948 and divorced in May 1951.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|97}} Donen's second wife was actress [[Marion Marshall]], who had been the girlfriend and protégé of [[Howard Hawks]] and later married actor [[Robert Wagner]]. Donen and Marshall had two sons together: Peter Donen (1953-2003) and Joshua Donen, born in 1955. They provided the name of Cary Grant's character in ''Charade''. Donen and Marshall were married from 1952 until 1959. They had a lengthy custody battle over their two sons after Marshall married Wagner and Donen moved to England.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Robert. ''Pieces of My Heart – A Life''. New York: Harper Collins. 2008. {{ISBN|0-06-137332-X}}. pp. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Donen's third wife was Adelle, Countess Beatty. She had previously been the second wife of the [[David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty#Marriages and children|2nd Earl Beatty]]. They married in 1960, had one son (Mark Donen, born 1962), and lived together in London.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|275–276}} They separated in 1969 before divorcing in 1971.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;{{rp|276}} Donen's fourth wife was American actress [[Yvette Mimieux]].

'''Tangra Mountains''' (in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''Тангра планина'', 'Tangra planina' \'tan-gra pla-ni-'na\) ({{coord|62|40|00|S|60|06|00|W|}}) form the principal mountain range of [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]].  The range had been nameless until 2001, when it was named after the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] god [[Tengri|Tangra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/search_names_action.cfm Tangra Mountains.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220034212/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/search_names_action.cfm |date=20 December 2010 }} SCAR Composite Antarctic Gazetteer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangra Mountains are 30&amp;nbsp;km long between [[Barnard Point]] and [[Renier Point]], 8&amp;nbsp;km wide, and are bounded by [[Moon Bay]] and [[Huron Glacier]] to the north, [[Huntress Glacier]] to the northwest, [[False Bay, Livingston Island|False Bay]] to the west, and [[Bransfield Strait]] to the southeast, and is linked to [[Bowles Ridge]] by [[Wörner Gap]], and to [[Pliska Ridge]] by [[Nesebar Gap]].  The mountain is divided in three principal ridges: [[Friesland Ridge]] in the west, [[Levski Ridge]] in the centre, and [[Delchev Ridge]] in the east.

The peaks and slopes of Tangra are heavily glaciated, and drained by the glaciers Huron, Huntress, [[Ruen Icefall]], [[Peshtera Glacier|Peshtera]], [[Charity Glacier|Charity]], [[Tarnovo Ice Piedmont]], [[Prespa Glacier|Prespa]], [[Macy Glacier|Macy]], [[Boyana Glacier|Boyana]], [[Srebarna Glacier|Srebarna]], [[Magura Glacier|Magura]], [[Dobrudzha Glacier|Dobrudzha]], [[Ropotamo Glacier|Ropotamo]], [[Strandzha Glacier|Strandzha]], [[Pautalia Glacier|Pautalia]], [[Sopot Ice Piedmont]], and [[Iskar Glacier|Iskar]].

[[Camp Academia]] in the northwestern foothills of [[Zograf Peak]] is the perfect gateway to central Tangra Mountains via [[Catalunyan Saddle]] (1260&amp;nbsp;m) to the south and [[Lozen Saddle]] (437&amp;nbsp;m) to the east.  Catalunyan Saddle was occupied by a bivouac of the [[Tangra 2004/05|Tangra 2004/05 Exploration]] team on 14–16 December 2004.

'''''The Making of the Pentateuch''''' ("The Making of the Pentateuch: A Methodological Study", JSOT Press, Sheffield, 1987) by [[R. N. Whybray]], Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies at the University of Hull (UK), was a major contribution to the field of Old Testament studies, and specifically to theories on the origins and composition of the Pentateuch. Its originality lay in its detailed critique of the [[documentary hypothesis]], and it remains a standard text on many reading lists.

== Background ==
For almost a century prior to Whybray's book, a scholarly consensus had developed regarding the question of Pentateuchal origins{{snd}} the composition and dates of the first five books of the [[Old Testament]]. In the closing decades of the 19th century [[Julius Wellhausen]] published ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'', in which he had set out the definitive version of the historical development of the [[Hebrew bible]]. According to this hypothesis, the [[Pentateuch]]{{snd}} [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]{{snd}} was originally four separate documents, retelling the same episodes and stories, but with differing emphases designed to further the theological and political agendas of their authors. Their combination by a [[Redactor]] (editor) into a single narrative spread over five books had resulted in many inconsistencies and repetitious stories, which could be analysed through the methodology of [[source criticism]] to reconstruct the original documents.

Wellhausen had concentrated exclusively on the written text of the Pentateuch, but in the next generation [[Hermann Gunkel]] developed [[form criticism]], a methodology which he claimed could identify the various genres which had contributed to the text and thus reconstruct its [[tradition history]]. Gunkel and his followers, notably [[Martin Noth]], used this new methodology to discover the oral [[saga]]s which formed the basis of the written texts of the Pentateuch.

By the middle of the 20th century, Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis, the tradition history of Gunkel and Noth, and the [[Biblical archaeology]] of [[William F. Albright]], who claimed to have found physical proof of the 2nd millennium BC origins of Genesis, Exodus, and the other books of the Pentateuch, had merged to form a dominant paradigm, or consensual view, of the origins of the Pentateuch{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. It was this paradigm that was challenged by Whybray's "The Making of the Pentateuch".

== Summary ==

''The Making of the Pentateuch'' (in fact only Genesis–Numbers, as Whybray excludes Deuteronomy) is in three parts. Part 1 examines the methodology and assumptions of source criticism and the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]; Part 2 examines the methodology of form criticism and tradition history as developed by Noth and others; and Part 3 sets out Whybray's own suggestions for the process by which the Pentateuch came to be composed.&lt;ref name="j1518470"&gt;J. A. Emerton [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1518470 ''Vetus Testamentum''], Vol. 39, Fasc. 1 (Jan., 1989), pp. 110–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Whybray's attack on the documentary hypothesis addressed the basic methodology of source criticism, which relies on the existence of inconsistencies, repetitions and stylistic features such as alternative names for God to identify distinctive sources within the biblical text. The assumptions behind this methodology, Whybray says, are illogical and self-contradictory. If the authors of the original documents did not tolerate contradiction and repetition, why did the editors of the final work do so? And if the writers who created the final document did not mind such features, why should we suppose that the earlier sources did not contain contradiction and repetition? "Thus the hypothesis can only be maintained on the assumption that, while consistency was the hallmark of the various documents, inconsistency was the hallmark of the redactors" (p.&amp;nbsp;19). Similarly, the repetition and stylistic variation which the documentary hypothesis explains as the remains of distinct sources, may be understood quite differently. For example, since other religious texts use a variety of names for God, why should the change of divine name in Genesis from [[YHWH|Yahweh]] to [[Elohim]] signal a change of source? There could be a theological reason why one name is preferred to another, or the writer may just want a change. Repetition is often done for stylistic reasons, or for emphasis, or for rhetorical effect or in poetic parallelism. The task of form and tradition critics, according to Whybray, is even more difficult than that of source critics. Where the latter are dealing with partially extant texts, the former are dealing with hypothetical reconstructions for which we have no tangible evidence: "Much of Noth's detailed reconstruction of the Pentateuchal traditions was obtained by piling one speculation upon another." (p.&amp;nbsp;20)

His critique of scholars such as [[Rolf Rendtorff]] and [[Erhard Blum]] (a student of Rendtorff), who worked after Noth but in the same form and tradition-critical school was even more trenchant. These scholars contributed to what is known as the [[Supplementary hypothesis]].

According to Whybray:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Rendtorff has merely replaced the comparatively simple Documentary Hypothesis which postulated only a small number of written sources and redactors with a bewildering multiplicity of sources and redactors" (p.&amp;nbsp;21), while Blum's approach was, if anything, more complex and more dogmatic{{snd}} not to mention less demonstrable{{snd}} than Rendtorff's.&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"&gt;Gordon Wenham, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html#10 ''Pentateuchal Studies Today''], [[Themelios]] 22.1 (October 1996): 3–13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whybray's own, alternative hypothesis, is based not on the documentary model but on a fragmentary model. He suggests that the Pentateuch was the product of a single author (not the four authors and multiple editors of the documentary hypothesis) working at some time in the 6th century BC "[with] a mass of material, most of which may have been of quite recent origin and had not necessarily formed part of any ancient Israelite tradition" (p.&amp;nbsp;242). Whybray saw this author as a national historian, aware of contemporary Greek history and writing in conscious imitation of Greek models, with the aim of extending the existing [[Deuteronomic history]] backwards in time to create a national history of the Israelites from the creation of the world.&lt;ref name="j1518470"/&gt;

== Assessment ==

''The Making of the Pentateuch'' has been described as "the most compelling critique of the hypothesis" ever made, and its arguments are frequently cited by evangelical Christians who wish to state the case for Mosaic authorship (although Whybray explicitly rejects this notion and states that he regards the Pentateuch as fiction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/bibs/DJACcurrres/Whybray.html "Making Waves Gently: The Contribution of Norman Whybray to British Old Testament Study"], University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Wenham]], for example, writing in 1996, "Whybray's work on the Pentateuch could be viewed as the logical conclusion of the direction in which most pentateuchal criticism has been moving in the last three decades. ... His book is a powerful and valid critique of the methods that have been taken for granted in Pentateuchal criticism for nearly two centuries."&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"/&gt;

Egyptologist and Bible scholar [[James K. Hoffmeier]] has affirmed that although Whybray offers the most comprehensive critique of the documentary hypothesis within recent critical scholarship, he concludes that Whybray's view doesn't actually advance pentateuchal studies but instead revives a late 18th, early 19th century theory held by Alexander Geddes and J.S. Vater.&lt;ref&gt;James Karl Hoffmeier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3620">In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], the '''Wati kutjara''' (also '''Wati kutjarra''' or '''Wadi Gudjara''') are two young [[lizard]]-men ([[totem]]: [[goanna]]) who, in the [[Dreamtime|Dreaming]], travelled all over the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]]. In English, their [[songline]] is often called the ''Two Men Dreaming''.&lt;ref name="Mudrooroo"&gt;Mudrooroo (1994) ''Aboriginal Mythology''. Thorsons, London, p.167. {{ISBN|1-85538-306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wati kutjara are ubiquitous in the [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|mythology]] of the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]];&lt;ref name="Poirier"&gt;Poirier, S. (2005) ''A World of Relationships: Itineraries, Dreams and Events in the Australian Western Desert.'' Univ. Toronto Press, p.71-73.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, their journey extends for thousands of kilometres, stretching from the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] to [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Mudrooroo"/&gt;

==Narratives==
Wati kutjara is one of the most important [[Dreaming (story)|Dreamings]] around [[Balgo, Western Australia|Balgo]];&lt;ref name="Poirier"/&gt; in [[Kukatja]] narratives, the Wati kutjara are often likened to the wind, whose form they adopt when in danger.&lt;ref name="Poirier"/&gt; The men's first action is to sing about their names in order to establish their own identity.&lt;ref name="Cowan"&gt;Cowan, J. (1994) ''Wirrimanu - Aboriginal Art from the Balgo Hills'', Gordon &amp; Breach Arts International, p.32. {{ISBN|976-8097-75-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then they decide to travel about, and eventually decide to head south-east in order to enlighten the people there who do not possess the [[rituals]] known to the [[Dreamtime|Dreaming]] heroes. As they travel, they sing of the animals, plants and geographic features that they encounter, naming them and calling them into being.&lt;ref name="Cowan"/&gt; Filled with magical power, these two unmarried brothers eventually travelled all over the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]] destroying many dangerous evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, F.R. (1986) ''Pintupi Country, Pintupi Self: Sentiment, Place and Politics among Western Desert Aborigines'', Univ. California Press, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; They also created [[tjurunga|sacred objects]].&lt;ref name="Cowan"/&gt;

The Wati kutjara feature in innumerable stories, whose details vary from region to region. In one recension, they are credited with [[castration|castrating]] the Man in the Moon by throwing a magical [[boomerang]], [[Kidili]], because he tried to [[rape]] the first woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berndt|first=R. M.|date=1941|title=Tribal Migrations and Myths Centring on Ooldea, South Australia|jstor=40327930|journal=Oceania|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions, the Wati kutjara are the ones attempting to seduce the same group of women.&lt;ref name="Poirier"/&gt;

==Art and literature==
*Locations and events associated with the Wati kutjara are frequently the subject of [[Aboriginal Art]] from [[Balgo, Western Australia|Balgo]] and its outstations.&lt;ref name="Cowan"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">'''White Parker''' (1887&amp;ndash;1956) was a son of [[Mah-Cheeta-Wookey]] and [[Quanah Parker]], chief of the [[Comanches]]. He married Laura E. Clark (1890-1962), a daughter of Reverend and Mrs. M. A. Clark, a former [[Methodist]] missionary to the Comanches. They had at least three children: Patty Bertha, Cynthia Ann Joy, and Milton Quanah (1914-1930).

==Missionary work==
White Parker did Christian missionary work among the Comanche people. He studied for the ministry at Cook Bible School in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. After graduation, Parker joined the Methodist Conference. The Parkers were active in the 1920s and '30s Saturday afternoon street meetings in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]], which was led by Rev. J. Leighton Read, a European-American missionary from [[Colony, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Richard H. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v018/v018p328.html "THE MISSIONARY WORK OF THE REFORMED (DUTCH) CHURCH IN AMERICA, IN OKLAHOMA."] ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', Volume 18, No. 4, December 1940. Accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker had a varied religious background. His father was a member of and leader in the [[Native American Church]]. The Parker family brought the first non-Catholic church to the state of Texas. He received his education at a Presbyterian/Reformed institution, but affiliated with the Methodists when no Reformed missionary appointment was available.

==Acting career==
In 1920, Parker played a lead role in the silent film ''[[The Daughter of Dawn]]'', a silent film directed by Norbert A. Myles shot in the Wichita Mountains of Southwest Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191066/|title=The Daughter of Dawn (1920)|date=1 October 1920|work=IMDb|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story, played by an all-Indian cast of 300 Kiowas and Comanches, includes themes of love story, battle, dance, deceit, combat, and concludes with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.indiana.edu/?post_type=film&amp;p=4223#|title=The Daughter of Dawn: Calendar: IU Cinema: Indiana University Bloomington|work=indiana.edu|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a historically important film in American cinema as it is the first full-length movie of an American Indian story, and that uses all American Indian actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comanchemedia.com/?page_id=361|title=HugeDomains.com - Comanchemedia.com is for sale (Comanchemedia)|work=comanchemedia.com|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was restored by the Oklahoma Historical Society and has been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/research/daughterofdawn|title=Daughter of Dawn - OK Historical Society|work=okhistory.org|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/2013/04/21/2771920/rare-1920-film-featuring-300-comanche.html|title=Rare, 1920 film featuring 300 Comanche and Kiowa actors to premiere in Kansas|work=kansas|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yated Ne'eman''''' is a weekly English-language [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] newspaper and magazine based in [[Monsey, New York]] and distributed in most large metropolitan areas where [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] reside.[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/455408931.html?dids=455408931:455408931&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+31%2C+2003&amp;author=Herb+Keinon%2C+Gil+Hoffman%2C+Melissa+Radler&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;desc=Seven+days&amp;pqatl=google][https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/685248811.html?dids=685248811:685248811&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+29%2C+2004&amp;author=&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;desc=As+the+torch+goes+out&amp;pqatl=google] Israeli newspaper [[Haaretz]] describes ''Yated Ne'eman'' as one of the "most powerful" newspapers in the Haredi community.&lt;ref name=Chizhik-Goldschmidt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chizhik-Goldschmidt|first1=Avital|title=Inside the World of ultra-Orthodox Media: Haredi Journalists Tell It Like It Is|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/.premium-1.669916|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=Haaretz|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The American ''Yated Ne'eman'' was founded as a spinoff of its [[Israel]]i parent, also named [[Yated Ne'eman (Israel)|Yated Ne'eman]], which itself was established in 1985 by [[Elazar Shach]] over differences of editorial opinion with [[Hamodia]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (5 November 2001) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1361490/Rabbi-Eliezer-Schach.html "Obituary:Rabbi Eliezer Schach"], ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; This was a result of American [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] rabbis seeking an alternative outlet for their views, since the widely read Orthodox Jewish weekly in the [[New York (state)|New York]] area, ''[[The Jewish Press]]'', was privately owned, too independent, and expressed more of a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] and [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] point of view. The [[UJA]]-supported ''[[Jewish Week]]'' was similarly considered inappropriate.

The publication's name, supposedly attributed to [[Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky]], is derived from a phrase in [[Hebrew scripture]] which translates as 'a peg strongly anchored in terra firma'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 22:23. "ותקעתיו '''יתד''', במקום '''נאמן'''", translated as "And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place", or as "I will drive him like a peg in a firm place".&lt;/ref&gt; It is meant to  figuratively describe a secure connection or something which can be relied upon.&lt;ref name="Challenges"/&gt;
 
In the 1990s, the American Yated severed its relationship with the Israeli edition over perceived complex religious leanings there.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (8 September 2000) [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/13991/biblical-farming-law-creates-modern-controversy/ "Biblical Farming Law Creates Modern Controversy"], ''The Jewish News of Northern California''&lt;/ref&gt;

The current publisher is [[Pinchos Lipschutz]], who resides in [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], New York, where the ''Yated'' is also based.&lt;ref name="Clinton"&gt;Staff. (12 August 2016) [https://www.timesofisrael.com/haredi-paper-finds-modest-way-to-show-clinton-photo/ "Haredi Paper finds 'Modest' Way to Show Clinton Photo"], ''Times of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editorial policy==
''Yated Ne'eman's'' opinions generally reflect the positions and policies of [[Agudath Israel of America]] and its leadership body, the American [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] (Council of Torah Sages). Its views on [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish education]] for example are based upon the educational policies of the [[rabbi]]s that guide [[Torah Umesorah - National Society for Hebrew Day Schools]]. However, its right-wing tendency is sometimes at odds with the rabbinic leadership of Haredi Judaism, who often prefer a more pragmatic, nuanced approach to political issues. The publication, as do most of those within its genre, adhere to a strict interpretation of [[tzniut]] that prohibits photographs of women on its pages and website.&lt;ref name="Challenges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinton"/&gt;

===Israeli politics===
''Yated Ne'eman'' reports Israeli news extensively, keeping track of social trends, political developments, and military affairs. Its political stance tends to toe the party line of [[Degel HaTorah]], as can be evidenced by the frequent publication of photos extolling the activities of Degel's leaders, such as [[Chaim Kanievsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (6 August 2004) [http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2004/08/06/news/world/aaa.txt "UTJ:No to Shinui"], ''Cleveland Jewish News''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The growth of ''Yated Ne'eman'' reflects the emergence of a uniquely English-speaking [[yeshiva]] community in the United States that sees itself as independent from the non-Orthodox institutions of earlier generations. Its articles, editorials, photos and advertisements are strictly controlled by the editorial board to reflect the religious [[mores]] of the American yeshiva world, as practiced in institutions such as New Jersey's [[Beth Medrash Govoha]], New York's [[Yeshiva Torah Vodaas]] and [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], and Maryland's [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">In the [[Babylonia#Medicine|Babylonian magico-medical tradition]], '''Šulak''' is the '''Lurker of the [[Toilet (room)|bathroom]]''' or the '''demon of the [[outhouse|privy]]'''. Šulak appears in the Babylonian ''[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] Handbook'' (Tablet XXVII), in which various [[disease]]s are described and attributed to the "hand" of a [[god]], [[goddess]], or [[spirit]]. A "Lurker" is a type of [[demon]] who lies in wait in places where a potential victim is likely to be alone. When a man attends to [[Defecation|excretory functions]] or [[Urination|elimination]], he is exposed and hence vulnerable: "Šulak will hit him!" The "hit" may be a type of "[[stroke]]" (''mišittu''). The demon referred to as "The Hitter" or "Striker" elsewhere in the handbook may be Šulak identified by an [[epithet]]. A much earlier reference to this demon is found in a [[Hittite language|Hittite]] diagnostic text.&lt;ref&gt;Marten Stol, ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'' (Brill, 1993), pp. 17, 71, and 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "demon of the privy" ''(Sheid beit ha-Kisset)'' appears also in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]:

{{quote|The [[Rabbi]]s taught: On coming from a privy a man should not have [[sexual intercourse]] till he has waited long enough to walk half a ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|mil]]'',|&lt;ref&gt;An ancient unit of measure, approximately 1km.&lt;/ref&gt; because the demon of the privy is with him for that time; if he does, his children will be [[epilepsy|epileptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, [http://www.halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_70.html ''Gittin'' 70a.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stroke and epilepsy were closely related in ancient medicine. This law is not included in the [[Mishneh Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Shapiro, "[[Maimonides|Maimonidean]] [[Halakhah]] and [[Superstition]]," in ''Maimonidean Studies'' (Michael Scharf Publication Trust of Yeshiva University Press, 2000), vol. 4, pp. 88–89 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_PRAWUrhibEC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22demon+of+the+privy%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA88,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[toilet|lavatory]] demon takes the form of a [[goat]] in the [[Talmud]] (''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 67a, ''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berachot]]'' 62a).&lt;ref&gt;Fred Rosner, ''Encyclopedia of Medicine in the Bible and the Talmud'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "demon of the privy" is the type of [[unclean spirit]] that in the early [[Christian era]] was regarded as causing both physical and spiritual affliction.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Marcus, ''Mark 8–16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary'', Yale [[Anchor Bible]] series (Yale University Press, 2009), p. 652 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WPlh-D32yDMC&amp;pg=PA652&amp;dq=%22pneuma+alalon%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
