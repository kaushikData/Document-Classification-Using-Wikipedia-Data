The '''1910 World Missionary Conference''', or the '''Edinburgh Missionary Conference,''' was held on 14 to 23 June, 1910. Some have seen it as both the culmination of nineteenth-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missions]] and the formal beginning of the modern [[Christian ecumenism|Protestant Christian ecumenical movement]], after a sequence of interdenominational meetings that can be traced back as far as 1854.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/262878975|title=The World Missionary Conference, Edinburgh 1910|last=1953-|first=Stanley, Brian,|date=2009|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|isbn=9780802863607|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|oclc=262878975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edinburgh 1910==
Major Protestant denominations and missionary societies, predominantly from North America and Northern Europe, sent 1,215 representatives to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.  Delegation was usually based on the annual expenditure of the missionary societies; one hundred additional special delegates were appointed by the British, Continental, and American Executive Committees.  No [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] or [[Roman Catholic missionaries|Roman Catholic missionary]] organizations were invited. 18 delegates were from the non-Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/262878975|title=The World Missionary Conference, Edinburgh 1910|last=Stanley|first=Brian|date=2009|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|year=|isbn=9780802863607|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=|oclc=262878975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour]], of the [[Church of Scotland]], a former [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister]], was the President of the World Missionary Conference. American [[John Mott|John R. Mott]], an [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist]] layperson and leader of both the [[Student Volunteer Movement|Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions]] and the [[World Student Christian Federation]], chaired its proceedings. The main organiser was [[Joseph Oldham]], a leader in the [[Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|Student Christian Movement]]. The conference was held in the [[Assembly Hall of the United Free Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]].

The formal title of this conference should be called the "third ecumenical missionary conference," because the first and the second had already taken place in London in 1888 and New York in 1900 respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Before the conference convened, eight assigned commissions, each with twenty members, conducted two years of research on their assigned topic. Each commission produced a single volume report, which was distributed to all of the delegates before they headed to Scotland and discussed at the assembly during the Conference.

The Eight Commissions and their date of presentation at the Conference are as follows:
# Carrying the Gospel to all the Non-Christian World (June 15, 1910)
# The Church in the Mission Field (June 16, 1910)
# Education in Relation to the Christianization of National Life (Jun 17, 1910)
# Missionary Message in Relation to the Non-Christian World (June 18, 1910)
# The Preparation of Missionaries (June 22, 1910)
# The Home Base of Missions (June 23, 1910)
# Missions and Governments (June 20, 1910)
# Co-Operation and the Promotion of Unity (June 21, 1910)

A ninth volume, containing the proceedings and major speeches, was published after the conclusion of the Conference.

The spirit of the Conference was driven by the watchword of the Protestant Christian Missionary community at the time: "The Evangelization of the World in This Generation."  Thus, sentiments of obligation and urgency drove many of the commission reports, discussions and speeches at the Conference.  A call to unity among Protestant missionaries was also a common desire expressed at the Conference, although no common liturgy was celebrated among the delegates while in Edinburgh. In his 1947 book ''What Must the Church Do?'', [[Robert S. Bilheimer]] used the phrase "New Reformation" to refer to the ecumenical movement that resulted from the conference, and this usage became commonplace thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=215|title=Globalization: People, Perspectives, and Progress|author=William H. Mott|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2004|isbn=0275979172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
In the years following the Conference, Mott was especially energetic in promoting indigenisation of the evangelisation process. A Continuation Committee was formed under his leadership and he recruited thirty five members to carry out this mission. One important member was the only representative from China, [[Cheng Jingyi]], whose address to the Conference had been especially fervent on the issue of turning leadership of mission organizations to native leaders. &lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Bays, ''A New History of Christianity in China.'' (Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell,  2012), p. 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next few years, members of this committee, under Mott's direction, headed to India, Burma, Malaysia, China, Korea, and Japan to gather information.  The work of the Continuation Committee was interrupted by World War I, but formed the foundation for the establishment of the [[International Missionary Council]], established in 1921.  Later, in 1948, the [[World Council of Churches]] formed.

==Centennial 2010 meetings==
In celebration of its 100-year anniversary, a new World Missionary Conference was held in Edinburgh in 2010.  Like the 1910 original, it was preceded by discussions on reports written by nine appointed study groups. There was a delegate conference in Edinburgh from 2–6 June 2010, which included representatives of the Evangelical, Protestant, Orthodox and Pentecostal churches, and the Roman Catholic Church. It produced a Common Call to mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgh2010.org/fileadmin/files/edinburgh2010/files/conference_docs/Edinburgh%202010%20Common%20Call%20with%20explanation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising the global nature of modern Christianity and the wide appreciation of the Edinburgh 2010 legacy across churches and mission bodies, many other events and study processes took place throughout the year. The whole process was co-ordinated through the Edinburgh 2010 website, where documents, videos, photos, etc. are available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgh2010.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, three other major conferences were held to commemorate Edinburgh 1910. The first was held in Tokyo as a gathering of global mission leaders, from May 11-14th, called the [[Tokyo 2010|Global Mission Consultation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tokyo2010.org&lt;/ref&gt; The next gathering, the Third International Congress of the [[Lausanne Movement]], was held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 16–25 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lausanne.org/cape-town-2010/faq-basics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807053623/http://www.lausanne.org/cape-town-2010/faq-basics.html |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third gathering was held in Boston, from November 4–7.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.2010boston.org&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these four gatherings reflected on the significance and outcomes of Edinburgh 1910 over the last century.They also looked to the future of the Church's global mission in the century ahead. The meetings in Edinburgh and Boston were more ecumenical in representation, and the meetings in Tokyo and Cape Town were primarily evangelical. The Tokyo meeting was organized and designed for evangelical mission leaders, and the Cape Town meeting was organized and designed for a broad representation of Church and mission leaders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="728">'''Antitactæ''', or '''antitactici''', in antiquity, were a [[sect]] of [[gnosticism|gnostics]] who believe that [[God]] was good and [[justice|just]], but that one of his creatures had created evil, and had engaged humans to follow it, in order to set us in opposition to God. They believed that it was the duty of humanity to oppose this author of evil, in order to avenge God of his enemy. Their name is from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] for "I oppose; I am contrary".

[[File:Jesus-army-baptism.jpg|right|thumb| [[Immersion baptism|Immersion]] believer's baptism in [[Jesus Fellowship Church]], England]]
'''Believer's baptism''' (occasionally called '''credobaptism''', from the Latin word ''[[credo]]'' meaning "I believe") is the [[Christianity|Christian]] practice of [[baptism]] as this is understood by many [[evangelical]] denominations, particularly those that descend from the [[Anabaptist]] and English Baptist tradition. According to their understanding, a person is baptized on the basis of his or her profession of faith in Jesus Christ and as admission into a local community of faith.

The contrasting belief, held in nearly every other Christian tradition, is [[infant baptism]] (pedobaptism or paedobaptism, from the Greek ''paido'' meaning "child"), in which infants or young children are baptized if one or both parents are already members of the denomination. Such is the practice in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Coptic and Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches, Anglican and Episcopal Churches, and others.

Baptisms are performed in various ways: believer's baptism is typically only by ''[[Immersion baptism|immersion]]''  or pouring (also called ''[[affusion]]'') and infant baptism by either immersion, ''affusion'', and ''[[aspersion]]'' (sprinkling). Believer's baptism is often referred to as '''adult baptism''' due to the denial that faith can exist prior to the age of accountability. Believer's baptism is also often extended to children so long as they are old enough to earnestly profess their faith.

== History ==
The oldest surviving manual of church discipline, the [[Didache]], envisions the baptism of adults. Advocates of believer's baptism contend that non-Biblical records are not authoritative, and that no evidence exists from the Bible or early Christian literature that [[paedobaptism|infant baptism]] was practiced by the apostles.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Grenz, ''Theology for the Community of God'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 2000, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of infant baptism have attempted to trace the practice to the New Testament era, but generally acknowledge that no unambiguous evidence exists that the practice existed prior to the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dever, Jonathan Leeman, ''Baptist Foundations: Church Government for an Anti-Institutional Age'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, USA, 2015, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument posed by some advocates of believer's baptism focuses on the fact that most churches that practice infant baptism were heavily intertwined with the state in medieval and Reformation-era Europe.  In many instances, citizens of a nation were required under penalty of law to belong to the state church. Infant baptism marked the infant as a citizen of the nation and a loyal subject of the reigning political order as much as it marked the infant as a Christian. To denominations like the Baptists, which have historically stressed religious liberty, toleration, and separation of church and state, this practice is an unacceptable violation of the basic human right to self-determination in matters of spirituality and religion; but this argument does little to dissuade the many pedobaptistic churches today which are, as in the United States and most other Western nations, unburdened by any compulsion to baptize anyone because of a governmental demand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Patristics ===

==== Examples ====
Other advocates of credobaptism—who contend that non-Biblical records are not religiously authoritative—draw from biographical information contained in such records ([[patristics]]), to establish that the apostolic tradition was for children to become [[catechumen]]s and baptized only after being trained and discipled in the basics of Christian doctrine. Examples include the lives of St. [[John Chrysostom]], St. [[Basil of Caesarea]], St. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], St. [[Ambrose]], St. [[Augustine of Hippo]], St. [[Jerome]], [[Origen]] and others who were each baptized at adult age (sometimes 30 years or older), despite the fact of them having a Christian mother.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

==== Instructions ====
Further, credobaptists point to [[St. Cyril of Jerusalem]], [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]], [[St. John Chrysostom]], [[St. Augustine]] and others who wrote procedures for catechumenical instruction (contrasted to writing procedures for the baptizing of infants.) It is a widely held opinion that St. Augustine, who had no Christian father, was an ardent advocate for infant baptism.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}} However, his mother, Monica, was a Christian. St. Augustine was baptized at the age of 30 by St. Ambrose.

In addition, earlier patristical writings such as the [[Didache]] and [[Tertullian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Tertuallian | title = On Baptism | chapter = 18–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; prescribe baptismal candidates to fasting, prayer, confessions, etc. before being allowed to be baptized. Tertullian (son of a [[presbyter]]) writes, "Christians are made, not born." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Tertullian | title = Apology | page = xviii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Tertullian acknowledges that infant baptism was a common practice in his day. He opposes it not on doctrinal grounds but practical ones, suggesting that baptism be postponed until after marriage so that one can be cleansed of the fornication one commits before marriage in baptism. Tertullian later in life became a [[Montanist]] and the strict views on post-baptismal sin which that sect took affected some of his writing.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

==== In the church ====
Several ecclesiastical histories seem to omit any discussion of infant baptism. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (~260–340 AD) gives ample discussion of baptisms, but makes no reference to the baptism of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fathers | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2501.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Eusebius discusses the various positions, particularly during the time of [[Cyprian]], wherein it was discussed whether those who were baptized by [[heretics]] needed to be re-baptized.  This might be argued to be irrelevant if the individuals involved in heresy were baptized as infants, but the question was really whether a sacrament was valid if administered by a heretic, and so the question was whether a person baptized by a heretic should be [[Rebaptism|rebaptized]].{{Citation needed | date =March 2014}}

Likewise, the church history of [[Socrates Scholasticus]] (305–438 AD) mentions a handful of examples of baptisms, none of which describe the baptizing of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fathers | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2601.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by this time the practice of baptizing infants was common, as can be seen in the anti-[[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] writings of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].

Similarly, the church history written by [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] (431–594 AD) also provides descriptions of baptisms, none of which communicate the baptism of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fathers | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Evagrius_Scholasticus}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

The book ''[[Martyrs Mirror]]'' documents the history of credobaptists through 1660.

==== Reform ====
For the first 300 years of the church, the common requirement for baptism was a profession of faith following a conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;https://bible.org/question/what-are-historical-origins-infant-baptism&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of believers' baptism argue that this implies infants would not be baptized since they could not profess faith for themselves. Beginning with Augustine, the Catholic Church solidified the practice of infant baptism and there is little mention of competing practices until the 1500s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=David|title=Infant baptism in historical perspective : collected studies|date=2007|publisher=Paternoster Press|location=Milton Keynes, UK ; Waynesboro, Ga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine held the view that baptism was a requirement for the washing away of sins. He was faced with the issue of whether an unconscious or unwilling individual on their deathbed should be baptized; he felt it was better to err on the side of caution and baptize such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Allan|last2=Cavadini|first2=John C.|title=Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=9780802838438|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcVhAGpvTQ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century, the [[Anabaptist]] movement began demanding that baptismal candidates be able to make a confession of faith that is freely chosen, thus rejecting the [[baptism of infants]]. This and other doctrinal differences led both [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]] to persecute the Anabaptists, executing them by fire, sword, or drowning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-28/1525-anabaptist-movement-begins.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Anabaptist groups spread across Europe and later to Russia and the Americas. In 1609, the [[Baptist]] movement applies this practice in all its churches.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Johnson, ''A Global Introduction to Baptist Churches'', Cambridge University Press, UK, 2010, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
{{Baptist}}
Christians who practice believer's baptism believe that saving grace and church membership are gifts from God by the recipient's faith alone and cannot be imparted or transferred from one person to another (such as from parent to child) by sacraments such as baptism. These tenets render infant baptism meaningless within their belief system. Because infants cannot hear or believe the gospel message, they cannot repent nor profess Christ as the Son of God. Credobaptists have differing views concerning the status of children who are too young to profess faith (Matthew 19:14).{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

Believer's baptism is held by [[Baptists]], [[Mennonites]], and many other Christians to have no [[Baptismal regeneration|saving]] effect, but to be a public expression of faith, symbolically representative of the inner conversion of the person being baptized. Many other Christian churches hold baptism to have salvific value.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

The [[Churches of Christ]], [[Disciples of Christ]], and many "Bible" and non-denominational churches understand baptism to be an integral part of the [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion process]], rather than just a symbol of conversion.{{Sfn | Bryant | 1999 | p = 184}} Integral teachings of the Churches of Christ include the following:
* [[Baptism]] by immersion is a necessary part of salvation without which one cannot enter into the kingdom of God, John 3:3–5; 1 Peter 3:21{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}
* The church, set up by Christ with the keys given to the Apostles (Matthew 16:16–18, 18:18) was established on the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2 and required baptism for "remission of sins" among the penitent believers and promised the "gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38){{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}
* Without the indwelling Holy Spirit obtained at the time of immersion, there is no salvation, Acts 5:32, Romans 8:9–11, 16.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

There are many denominations and faith communities which hold to baptism for believers only, but do not hold that baptism contributes in any measure to salvation — which is also the view of some of the churches that do practice infant baptism.  With respect to the second bullet point above — that baptism was a commandment for the remission of sins — these believe that was specific to the Jewish believers being addressed at that point in time.  Their being baptized would be seen as publicly distancing themselves from the actions of the religious leaders who had participated in rejecting and then crucifying Jesus.  These do not hold that baptism is still required for Jewish believers today, but rather that baptism was a command to Jewish believers at that point in time.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

Later in the book of Acts, both when Samaritans joined the church for the first time (Acts 8:12ff), and when Gentiles joined the Church for the first time (Acts 10:44ff), baptism followed immediately and was even commanded in Acts 10. Whether or not these examples of baptism that are found in the New Testament proves that children are categorically ineligible for baptism is disputed.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

=== Arguments for credobaptism ===

==== Scripture ====
Advocates of believer's baptism argue that the New Testament does not describe instances of infant baptism, and that during the New Testament era, the early church required converts to have conscious, deliberate faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, page  131&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of infant baptism counter that the book of Acts records instances of the baptism of entire households. The assumption is that these household baptisms involved infants that are incapable of personal belief.{{Citation needed | date = March 2014}}
Defenders of infant baptism have claimed&lt;ref name="CathAns"&gt;{{cite web |title= Infant Baptism |publisher= [[Catholic Answers]] |url= http://www.catholic.com/library/Infant_Baptism.asp |accessdate= 2010-09-22 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100328005503/http://www.catholic.com/library/Infant_Baptism.asp |archivedate= 2010-03-28 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that baptism replaces the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Jewish practice of circumcision]], citing Colossians 2:11–13 as New Testament support, and is therefore appropriate for infants.  Advocates of believer's baptism counter that the [[Council of Jerusalem|Jerusalem council in Acts 15]] was called to clarify circumcision long after the practice of baptism was established. In the [[Old Covenant]], males were [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]]. In the [[New Covenant]], all — male and female, Jew and Greek, bond and free — may join the family of God.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}} The KJV says in {{bibleverse|Acts|8:36-37|KJV}}, "[...] and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." Modern Bible versions omit the 37th verse, which is used to argue that the requirements for baptism are to believe in Christ. Since infants cannot "believe with all [their] heart", infants are not baptized.

Many [[Reformed Baptists]] (Calvinistic Baptists) agree with the principles of [[Covenant Theology]] and agree that Baptism has, in a sense, replaced circumcision as the sign of covenant.  They disagree with the typical [[Reformed|Calvinist]] argument that, as the sign of the covenant in the Old Testament (namely [[circumcision]]) was administered to infants, so should the sign of the covenant in the New Testament church (namely baptism) be ministered to infants. They (Reformed Baptists) argue that the Old Testament covenent pertained to the actual descendents of Jacob which made up the physical nation of Israel, whereas the covenant community in the New Testament constitutes the spiritual sons of Abraham and thus form the spiritual Israel. Thus, they argue, the sign of the covenant should only be administered to spiritual sons. From Galatians 3:7, they (Reformed Baptists) argue that it is "people of faith who are the sons of Abraham" and baptism should be administered only to confessing believers and not infants, who are incapable of producing the requisite faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Celebration of Baptism | year = 1982 | type = sermon | url = http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/sermons/bydate/1982/342_A_Celebration_of_Baptism/ | publisher = Desiring God}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Baptists]] have similar views as Particular (Reformed) Baptists, but emphasize the [[Dispensationalism#Distinction between Israel and the Church|distinction between Israel and the Church]].

Theologians from churches that teach infant baptism point to Jesus' statement that children should be allowed to come to him. Advocates of believer's baptism counter that Jesus blessed the children and did not baptize them. While Jesus is recorded as baptizing in John 3:22–26, he called upon his followers to baptize "all nations." Advocates of believer's baptism do [[Evangelism|evangelize]] children, even if they do not baptize all of them.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}} Most Baptist evangelists, however, only limit ''infant'' baptism.

==Age of accountability==
Believer's baptism is administered only to persons who have passed the [[age of accountability]] or [[Age of reason (canon law)|reason]], which is based upon a reading of the New Testament that only believers should be baptized. Some claim that it is also based upon the Jewish tradition of [[Bar Mitzvah]] at the age of 12 or 13, at which point Jewish children become responsible for their actions and "one to whom the commandments apply."  This analogy is not very helpful since a Jew who is not ''Bar Mitzvah'' is nonetheless considered to be fully a Jew—whereas the notion of an "unbaptized Christian" is more problematic. Many Christian theologians{{Who| date= January 2010}}, including [[Zwingli]], regard baptism as analogous to the Jewish practice of [[circumcision]], rather than analogous to the Bar Mitzvah ceremony, although there are no explicit sections of the New Testament that support this idea.{{Citation needed | date=March 2014}}

Among credobaptists, differences in denominational practice (and in psychological development among children) can cause the "age of accountability" to be set higher or lower. Many developmentally challenged individuals never reach this stage regardless of age. Sometimes the pastor or church leader will determine the believer's understanding and conviction through personal interviews.  In the case of a minor, parents' permission will also often be sought.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

It is common for churches which practice believer's baptism to administer the ordinance to children aged eight or nine, following some training in the rudiments of the faith. Pedobaptists often question whether this abuses the belief that there is an "age of accountability," since that term traditionally has referred to the ability to discern between good and evil actions, not to the ability to comprehend and assent to all the complexities of the Christian faith which adults might reasonably be expected to affirm as a condition of receiving baptism.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

However, not all credobaptists believe in an "age of accountability." Furthermore, not all credobaptists believe in the doctrine of [[original sin]]. Many credobaptists believe that they are only held responsible for their personal sins, and that Jesus addressed the sins of Adam on the cross. As a result, according to these Christians, an infant does not need to repent and baptize away sins they have never personally committed.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

==Practice==
In areas where those who practice believer's baptism are the physical or cultural majority, the ritual may function as a [[rite of passage]] by which the child is granted the status of an adult. Most denominations who practice believer's baptism also specify the mode of baptism, generally preferring ''immersion'' (in which the baptisand is lowered completely beneath the surface of a body of water) over ''affusion'' (in which water or [[holy water]] is sprinkled or poured over the baptisand). Holy water may also be employed in [[exorcism]]s, purification of the living space, etc. and is not restricted to use in baptism. In the case of physical disability or inability to be totally submerged under water, as with the elderly, bedridden, and nearly dead, the pouring of water upon the baptismal candidate is acceptable to some despite the usual contention of credobaptists that unless there is immersion, the act cannot, by definition, be a baptism.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

In some denominations, believer's baptism is a prerequisite to full church membership. This is generally the case with churches with a [[congregationalist church governance|congregational]] form of church government. Persons who wish to become part of the church must undergo believer's baptism in that local body or another body whose baptism the local body honors. Typically, local churches will honor the baptism of another church, if that tradition is of similar faith and practice, or if not, then if the person was baptized (usually by immersion) subsequent to conversion.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

==Denominational connections==
Believer's baptism is one of several distinctive doctrines associated closely with the [[Baptist]] and [[Anabaptist]] (literally, ''rebaptizer'') traditions, and their [[theology|theological]] relatives.  Among these are the members of the American [[Restoration Movement]]. Churches associated with [[Pentecostalism]] also practice believer's baptism.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

In Holiness, Baptist and Pentecostal churches, a ritual known as Dedication or Infant Dedication supplements or replaces infant baptism.  However, unlike baptism, the rite is centered upon the parents, who dedicate the child to God and vow to raise him or her in a God-fearing home. Although Dedication often occurs at the same age as infant baptism, it is not considered a replacement for baptism nor is it considered salvific for the child.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

Believer's baptism is more prevalent in Christian traditions that maintain that there is a state of innocence from birth to the age of accountability (if the believer, because of mental or emotional disability, is not likely to gain the ability to judge the morality of his or her actions, this state of innocency persists for life). Credobaptism is less prevalent in traditions that maintain that the corruption of original sin is present at birth and is sufficient guilt in the eyes of God to cause the child to be damned or be in [[limbo]], should he die before baptism.{{Citation needed |date=March 2014}}

Many churches that baptize infants, such as the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Reformed]], [[Anglican]], [[Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], [[Moravian Church|Moravian]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] denominations, previously functioned as national, state-established churches in various European and Latin American countries. During the Reformation, the relationship of the church to the state was a contentious issue, and infant baptism was seen as a way to ensure that society remained religiously homogeneous. As a result, groups that rejected infant baptism were seen as subversive and were often persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eerdman | title = Handbook to Christian Belief | page=  443 | publisher = Lion | year = 1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Adherents.com has related that statistics based on membership totals reported by various denominations state that churches that practice infant baptism represent about 80% of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html | title = Major Branches of Religions Ranked by Number of Adherents | publisher = Adherents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological objections ==
One standard [[Theology|theological argument]] leveled against believer's baptism is that it makes the efficacy of the sacrament dependent upon the understanding of the baptism; that is, it depends upon what the baptized knows. This is said by paedobaptists to run counter to the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] belief that God saves whomever he wills, regardless of any worth or knowledge on the part of the saved.  [[Reformed Baptist]]s and other Calvinist theologians counter that believer's baptism is fully consistent with Calvin's doctrine of [[unconditional election]], and that when properly understood it is also the most appropriate expression of [[Covenant theology]].{{Citation needed | date = March 2014}}

Even in theological circles where some response to God's call is considered necessary for the convert (such as belief, confession, repentance, and prayer), a believer's baptism is sometimes categorized as a work instead of a response of faith, though not always (see [[Christian churches and churches of Christ#Baptism|Baptism in the Christian churches and churches of Christ]]).{{Citation needed | date = April 2007}}  Among the [[Churches of Christ]], for example, baptism is seen as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God."{{Sfn | Hazelip | Holloway | Harris | Black | 1998 | p = 112}}  While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a "sacrament," their view of it can legitimately be described as "sacramental."{{Sfn | Bryant | 1999 | p = 186}}{{Sfn | Foster | Dunnavant | Blowers | Williams | 2004 | p = 66 | ps =, ‘Baptism’}}  They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself,{{Sfn | Bryant | 1999 | p = 186}} and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion.{{Sfn | Bryant | 1999 | p = 184}}  A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation."{{Sfn | Foster | Dunnavant | Blowers | Williams | 2004 | p = 66 | ps =, ‘Baptism’}}  Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]].{{Sfn | Foster | 2001}}  However, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual.{{Sfn | Foster | 2001}}{{Sfn | Nettles | Pratt | Armstrong | Kolb | 2007 | p = 133}}{{Sfn | Foster | Dunnavant | Blowers | Williams | 2004 | pp = 630–31 | ps =, ‘Regeneration’}}  One author from the churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism: "''Faith'' is the ''reason why'' a person is a child of God; ''baptism'' is the ''time at which'' one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" (italics in the source).{{Sfn | Ferguson | 1996 | p = 170}}  Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance,{{Sfn | Ferguson | 1996 | pp = 179–82}} rather than a "work" that earns salvation.{{Sfn | Ferguson | 1996 | p = 170}}

==Biography==
Green was educated at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Modern History and later his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]]. He became a [[Order of St Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Monk#Roman Catholicism|monk]] of [[Ampleforth Abbey]] in 1975 and was [[Ordination#Roman Catholic.2C Orthodox.2C and Anglican churches|ordained]] a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="lourdesampleforth.org.uk"&gt;[http://lourdesampleforth.org.uk/Ampleforth_Hospitalite/Home_files/Ampleforth%20Lourdes%20Pilgrimage%20Newsletter%20June%2013%20Copy.pdf 'Fr Bernard Green OSB', in ''Ampleforth Hospitalité Our Lady of Lourdes: June 2013 Newsletter'', pp. 10-11.]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a history master at [[Ampleforth College]] from 1977 until 1995, and as housemaster of St Aidan's from 1992 until 1995.&lt;ref name="Peter Victor"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/priest-accused-of-dormitory-assault-1584000.html Peter Victor, "Priest accused of dormitory assault", ''The Independent'' (28 November 1995).]&lt;/ref&gt; Green later took an [[Master of Philosophy|MPhil]] in theology at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] in theology at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was appointed Fellow, Director of Studies, and Tutor in Theology at [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford]], Research Fellow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-benets.ox.ac.uk/news.htm News, St Benet's Hall, Oxford.

Green maintained for many years a connection with the Ampleforth [[Hospitalité Notre Dame de Lourdes]]. He first visited the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] aged 11 during a pilgrimage that he had undertaken with his mother. Green later took part in five consecutive pilgrimages with the Ampleforth Hospitalité, and in 1986, following the award of a medal in recognition of his five pilgrimages, he was appointed director of the Ampleforth pilgrimage. In 1991 he became a ''titulaire'' of the [[Hospitalité Notre Dame de Lourdes]]. Green resigned the directorship of the Ampleforth pilgrimage after the 1995 pilgrimage. The reason for this was because he would have been unable to continue to participate in the pilgrimage after he had relocated to [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Fr. Bernard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lourdesampleforth.org.uk/Ampleforth_Hospitalite/Latest/Entries/2013/4/15_Father_Bernard_an_appreciation.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130831025457/http://www.lourdesampleforth.org.uk/Ampleforth_Hospitalite/Latest/Entries/2013/4/15_Father_Bernard_an_appreciation.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 August 2013 |author1=Maire Channer |title='Fr Bernard - an appreciation' |date=15 April 2013 |publisher=Ampleforth Hospitalité of Our Lady of Lourdes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period following his resignation of the directorship Green is said to have 'remained in the background'. During the period before his death he served as the pilgrimage's spiritual advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lourdesampleforth.org.uk/Ampleforth_Hospitalite/Latest/Entries/2013/4/11_Father_Bernard_Green_OSB_(1953-2013).html 'Father Bernard Green OSB (1953-2013)' (Thursday, 11 April 2013) on the website of the Ampleforth Hospitalité of Our Lady of Lourdes.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712095551/http://www.lourdesampleforth.org.uk/Ampleforth_Hospitalite/Latest/Entries/2013/4/11_Father_Bernard_Green_OSB_%281953-2013%29.html |date=12 July 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Green was the author of ''Not Strangers but Pilgrims: A History of Ampleforth in Lourdes'' (Ampleforth: Ampleforth Abbey Press, in association with Way Books, Campion Hall, Oxford, 2009; 191 pages, including 1 illustration), described by [[Very Reverend|the Very Reverend]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] Terence Richardson, [[Order of St Benedict|OSB]], [[Prior#Monastic superiors|Prior]] of [[Ampleforth Abbey]], as 'the definitive history of the Ampleforth Pilgrimage … a work that was carefully researched, very readable and, at times, amusing and very effective in capturing the personalities of so many of the people who had been involved in the Pilgrimage over the years, while being very self-effacing about his own contributions.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Green also undertook pilgrimages to [[Our Lady of Medjugorje|Medjugorje]] and [[Garabandal apparitions|San Sebastián de Garabandal]].&lt;ref name="lourdesampleforth.org.uk"/&gt;

Green was a frequent contributor to ''[[The Tablet]]'', for which he wrote about forty book reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetablet.co.uk ''The Tablet''. Searched 4 April 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; His last review, of David Gwynn's ''Athanasius of Alexandria'', was published posthumously on 13 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Green, review of David Gwynn, ''Athanasius of Alexandria: Bishop, Theologian, Ascetic, Father'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), in ''The Tablet'', vol. 267 no. 8993 (13 April 2013), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green appeared in a television series about the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales#History|history of the Catholic Church in England]].&lt;ref name="lourdesampleforth.org.uk"/&gt;

==Indecent assault conviction and harassment allegations==

{{See also|Sexual abuse scandal in the English Benedictine Congregation}}

In 1995, while serving as a housemaster of St Aidan's at [[Ampleforth College]], Green [[Indecent assault|indecently assaulted]] a 13-year-old boy while the boy slept in his dormitory. As soon as the allegation was made Green was suspended by the headmaster, [[Leo Chamberlain]], who made the following statement: "The housemaster had entered a dormitory and touched a sleeping boy in a manner which he now recognises was inappropriate. We are conducting an immediate and full investigation. But our first concern is for the welfare of the boy concerned. Parents are being fully informed." At the same time, a spokesman for the school stated that the allegation was being investigated internally and that the school did not expect the allegation to become the subject of a police enquiry.&lt;ref name="Peter Victor"/&gt;

Green was arrested in response to an allegation that had been received by [[North Yorkshire Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/25th-november-2005/2/third-ampleforth-monk-convicted-of-abusing-pupils Simon Caldwell, "Third Ampleforth monk convicted of abusing pupils", ''Catholic Herald'' (25 November 2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have co-operated fully during the investigation by both police and social services.&lt;ref name="Cherwell.org"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130615111837/http://www.cherwell.org/archive/2005/10/05/benet-s-tutor-in-harassment-investigation Andrew Dagnall, "Benet's tutor in harassment investigation", ''Cherwell'' (5 October 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of February 1996 he was charged with indecent assault.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Chapman, "Top school suicide of the music star monk: choir leader's death shocks sex-charge college", ''The Mail on Sunday'' (3 March 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 Green pleaded guilty to this charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/archive/2005/11/17/The+North+East+Archive/7150277.Monk_admits_assaulting_boys/ "Monk admits assaulting boys", ''The Press'' (17 November 2005).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Monk admits sex assault", ''Daily Mail'' (17 April 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=361815 Michael Shaw and Cherry Canovan, "Scandal hits Ampleforth", ''TES'' (5 April 2002).]&lt;/ref&gt; During the court hearing the boy was said to have been 'petrified' during the incident. Green was sentenced to 50 hours' community service&lt;ref name="Cherwell.org"/&gt; and two years of [[probation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/18/publicschools.topstories3 Ian Cobain, "Silence and secrecy at school where child sex abuse went on for decades", ''The Guardian'' (18 November 2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his conviction statements were made stating, "Father Bernard will remain a Benedictine monk under the direct authority of the Abbot of Ampleforth. The Abbot will ensure that in future his work will not include any contact with or responsibility for children" and that "Father Bernard, in the light of his repentance and co-operation, will continue to live as a monk. Following the provisions of Church Law, any future exercise of his priesthood will be subject to canonical restrictions imposed by the Abbot of Ampleforth in Council. The restrictions will be designed to avoid any further problems with the young."&lt;ref name="Cherwell.org"/&gt;  Green was also barred by the [[Department for Education]] from teaching or undertaking any work with children or young persons under the age of 19.&lt;ref name='IICSA' /&gt;

In 1998, Green moved to St Benet's Hall, Oxford, and in 2000 began teaching at Oxford, in breach of his DfE ban.&lt;ref name='IICSA' /&gt; On 9 June 2005 an undergraduate at [[St Benet's Hall]] made a formal complaint of harassment against Green. The incident took place in the seventh week of the [[Trinity term]] during a picnic at [[Port Meadow, Oxford]] organised by St Benet's [[Common Room (university)|Joint Common Room]]. Other students supported the complainant's allegation. A formal investigation was conducted on behalf of St Benet's and the [[Proctor#Oxford University|proctors]] of the [[University of Oxford]] by a panel comprising one non-tutorial fellow of St Benet's and two independent members.&lt;ref name="Cherwell.org"/&gt; The panel found that he was guilty of serious misconduct, and he was issued a five‑year final written warning.&lt;ref name='IICSA'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ampleforth and Downside (English Benedictine Congregation case study) Investigation Report|url=https://www.iicsa.org.uk/key-documents/6583/download/Ampleforth%20and%20Downside%20Investigation%20Report%20August%202018.pdf|author=Alexis Jay, Malcolm Evans, Ivor Frank, Drusilla Sharpling|publisher=Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse|date=August 2018|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='LondonEconomic'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/must-reads/convicted-paedophile-monk-taught-at-university-of-oxford-for-12-years-after-being-banned-from-the-profession/14/08/|title=Convicted paedophile monk taught at University of Oxford for 12 years after being banned from the profession|author=Joe Mellor|work=The London Economic|date=14 August 2018|access-date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All parties were said to have been satisfied with the outcome and Green was reported to have made an apology.&lt;ref name="Cherwell.org"/&gt;

In April 2010, Ampleforth Abbey investigated further allegations made against Green regarding sexual misconduct towards two adult men, but the investigation was inconclusive.  In June 2012, Green was dismissed from St Benet's Hall after a review of the 1995 case revealed his teaching ban.&lt;ref name='IICSA' /&gt;

==Death==
Green died on 22 March 2013, having suffered a massive heart attack during the night.&lt;ref name="ox.ac.uk"/&gt; His funeral rites took place on 3 and 4 April 2013 at [[Ampleforth Abbey]]; he was interred in Monks' Wood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20130416101654/http://www.abbey.ampleforth.org.uk/our-news/fr-bernard-green-rip Ampleforth Abbey: Fr Bernard Green R.I.P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Birger A. Pearson''' (born 1934 in [[California]], United States) is an American scholar and professor studying [[early Christianity]] and [[Gnosticism]].  He currently holds the positions of [[Professor Emeritus]] of Religious Studies at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and Professor and Interim Director of the Religious Studies Program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Earlier life==
He has a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Classical languages]] from [[Upsala College]] in [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]], [[New Jersey]]; a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] in Biblical Studies and Theology from [[Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], CA; an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Greek from the University of California, Berkeley; and a [[Ph.D.]] in New Testament and Christian Origins from [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritas-ucsb.org/library/pearson/home.html veritas-ucsb]  ''Curriculum Vitae''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Pearson was one of the original translators of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], and was also involved with the 2007 translation by [[Marvin Meyer]]. In his writings, he explores the origins of Gnosticism and Christianity. Unlike many scholars, who see Gnosticism as a Christian heresy, Pearson believes that it emerged from [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mystics]] disaffected with the Jerusalem religious authorities, who were influenced by [[Platonism]] and [[mystery religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview in Coffee, Cigarettes and Gnosis #67 available as streaming audio at the [http://www.thegodabovegod.com/ Coffee, Cigarettes, and Gnosis Website] &amp; ({{ISBN|9781906834128}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buddhapad Hoard''' or ''Buddam Hoard'' is a large cache of [[Buddhist]] sculptures found near the town of [[Buddam, India|Buddam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], southern India. Since 1905, it has formed an important part of the [[British Museum]]'s South Asian collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=40193&amp;plaA=40193-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dating from 6th-8th centuries AD, the style of craftsmanship fuses the northern influences of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] with the southern traditions of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], which in turn greatly influenced Buddhist art in South East Asia in subsequent centuries.

==Discovery and original ownership==
The hoard was discovered in the late nineteenth century and it was described by the colonial historian [[Robert Sewell (historian)|Robert Sewell]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baptiste|first1=John Guy ; with essays by Pierre|last2=Becker|first2=Lawrence|last3=Bellina|first3=Bérénice|last4=Brown|first4=Robert L.|last5=Carò|first5=Federico|last6=Chirapravati|first6=Pattaratorn|last7=Douglas|first7=Janet G.|last8=Griffiths|first8=Arlo|last9=Indradjaya|first9=Agustijanto|last10=Lien|first10=Le Thi|last11=Manguin|first11=Pierre-Yves|last12=Murphy|first12=Stephen A.|last13=O'Connor|first13=Ariel|last14=Skilling|first14=Peter|last15=Stargardt|first15=Janice|last16=Strahan|first16=Donna|last17=Lwin|first17=U Thein|last18=Wade|first18=Geoff|last19=Kyaing|first19=U Win|last20=Woodward,|first20=Hiram|last21=Zéphir|first21=Thierry|title=Lost kingdoms : Hindu-Buddhist sculpture of early Southeast Asia|date=2014|isbn=1588395243|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1588395243|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artefacts was subsequently donated by the [[Secretary of State for India]] to the [[British Museum]] in 1905. Given the religious nature of the sculptures, the cache may have originally formed part of a ritual deposit from a Buddhist temple or [[monastery]].

==Description==
The 6th-8th century hoard&lt;ref name=book/&gt; is composed of fifteen bronze [[Buddhist]] images, the vast majority of which are either statuettes or parts of small figures. There are three relatively intact standing statuettes of the Buddha (the largest of which is 38&amp;nbsp;cm high), 4 bronze arms, two bases for standing figures (one of which has a [[Brahmi]] inscription), a representation of the god [[Tirthankara]], two small Buddha heads, two fragmentary figures of [[Parsvanatha]] and a bronze model of a [[stupa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1230">The first '''Croatian Buddhist''' group was founded in [[Zagreb]] in the 80's. Several groups have formed since, affiliated with different traditions. Estimates of the number of Buddhists in Croatia vary from 500 to 1000, depending on the definition. At present, active Buddhist groups are working to establish foundational practices and communities in major cities. Traditions represented presently are [[Nyingma]] and Rime (nonsectarian) of Tibetan Buddhism, [[Shingon]] and [[Zen]] of Japanese Buddhism, and [[Ch'an]] of Chinese Buddhism.

'''Buddhist Cultural Centre''' ('''BCC''') in Sri Lanka was founded by Ven. Kirama Wimalajhoti Thera who had returned to Sri Lanka after twenty years of dedicated missionary activity in Malaysia, Singapore and US. It was inaugurated on January 2, 1992 under the auspices of Ven. Dr. [[K. Sri Dhammananda]] Thera, the chief prelate of Malaysia and Singapore and a plethora of other internationally famed Buddhist scholar monks of the time. It sought to fill a need of the devoted Buddhists in Sri Lanka and the rest of the world. What made Ven. Wimalajhoti Thera start the BCC was the dearth of Buddhist publications in Sri Lanka notwithstanding its reputation as a country where Buddhism prevails in its pristine form. This fact was pointed to Ven. Wimalajhoti Thera by some of his foreign neophytes who had arrived in Sri Lanka to learn Buddhism when they had strolled quite unsuccessfully all over the outskirts of [[Colombo]] along with him in search of some Buddhist publications.

The BCC having thus begun in a small scale purporting to dispense the Dhamma among Buddhist devotees expanded massively with time thanks to the dedication and zeal of Ven. Wimalajhoti Thera. By now it has perhaps become the world’s largest [[Theravada]] Buddhist book collection. It dispenses not only Dhamma books but also other items venerated and frequently used by Buddhists such as images of the Buddha, requisites of Buddhist monks (Atapirikara), incense sticks and meditation cushions…etc.

In 1993 a meditation centre was set up on a 20-acre mountainous plateau amidst a salubrious sylvan environment as the first appendage to be added to the BCC network. It is situated in ''Dekanduwala'', [[Horana]] about 30 km away from Colombo. It has residential facilities and provides training in meditation for both local and foreign nationals since 1994. Among the programs it conducted, the two-week temporary ordination for young people carried out in 2003 became particularly popular. The training in Dhamma and meditation has also been provided for nuns both local and foreign since 2002. The management and execution of the training programs thereof are done by fifteen fully ordained [[bhikkhunī]]s. So far around 2000 foreigners have been trained by the centre besides local participants and nuns. This meditation centre is soon to be converted into a fully fledged internationally recognized "Bhikkhunī Training Centre" equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for training prospective nuns, which is to be affiliated to the BCC and is to be divested of government support.

In 1995 a printing press was amalgamated to the BCC to print and publish ancient but extant and rare [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] Dhamma treatises. In the same year, a mobile bookshop was launched to make the Dhamma books accessible particularly to those who live in rural areas and to promote the reading habit among the general populace.

In 2002 a branch of the BCC was started in the airport at the departure/transit lounge which was designated "Food for the Mind". It serves to disseminate Dhamma among interested foreigners and locals.

Since the very inception of the BCC, exhibitions have been held throughout the island with the intent of popularizing Dhamma books and it could be said with certainty that the effort has been very successful; now even other publishers have begun publishing a copious amount of Dhamma books as would be evident to anybody on visiting book exhibitions.

In 2011, a new building designated ''Sambuddhatva Jayanthi Mandiraya'' was erected at the heart of Colombo in commemoration of 2600 years of the advent of Buddhism. It consists of 16 storeys and includes auditorium facilities for conferences, seminars, convocations…etc. It also incorporates a bookshop operating under the BCC at Nedimala, Dehiwala, probably the largest of its kind containing books on Buddhism in the world. It is a centre of Buddhist activity wherein seminars and classes are held on various Buddhist themes as meditation and also correspondence courses in Buddhism are conducted for the benefit of those who are desirous of imbibing Buddhist wisdom. Moreover, local and foreign languages are taught there as well as a Buddhist counseling service is carried out; and many more facets to its multifarious Buddhist activities. 

BCC since its induction in 1992, it has the following achievements to its credit:
* Making available Buddhist books that are in print to the scholar and the ordinary Buddhist devotee.
* 	Printing and publishing ancient, hardly extant Dhamma treatises.
* 	Printing and publishing the whole Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka set which was largely construed as a government venture.
* 	Printing and publishing commentaries (Attakatha) in Pali and Sinhala.
* 	Printing and publishing some of the sub-commentaries (Tika) in Sinhala.
* 	Translation of some of the commentaries into English.
* 	Promoting meditation and the Buddhist way of life among the populace.
* 	Dispensing of Free Dhamma books.
* 	Making available various items frequently used by Buddhists such as images, lamps, posters and requisites of a monk (atapirikar), etc.
* 	All the activities connected with the Sambuddhatva Jayanthi Mandiraya.
* 	Numerous social services as providing a building for the Tangalle Hospital and an auditorium for a school in Kirama.
* 	Promoting Buddhism in English by publishing a series of books for students of International schools.

'''''Calgary Jewish News''''', the first community-run newspaper of the Jewish community of [[Calgary, Alberta]], was published from September 1962 to 1988.&lt;ref name="llevendel"&gt;Lewis Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press: 1880s-1980s'', Ottawa: Borealis Press, 1989, pp. 240-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first Alberta Jewish community-operated newspaper was ''Our Community News'' of [[Edmonton]], founded in 1958 (Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press: 1880s-1980s'', p. 243).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The first known Jewish settler arrived in Calgary in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rosenberg, "Calgary," ''Universal Jewish Encyclopedia'' vol. 2, New York: Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Inc., 1940, p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1954 that a Jewish community council was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1954/12/31/3042214/jewish-community-council-to-be-established-in-calgary “Jewish Community Council to Be Established in Calgary,”] [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], December 31, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; The Calgary Jewish Community Council, which united 17 disparate organizations,&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Group Re-Elects President," ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', April 6, 1963, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to date back to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Federations, Welfare Funds, Community Councils," ''American Jewish Year Book 1970'', vol. 71, New York: [[American Jewish Committee]], 1970, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Harry S. Shatz was hired as the council's first executive director.&lt;ref name="llevendel"/&gt; By 1961, Calgary's Jewish population had grown from around 400 families in 1930&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1930/12/03/2788735/20000-jews-in-western-canada-late-figures-show “20,000 Jews in Western Canada, Late Figures Show,”] Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Dec. 3, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; to an estimated 2,881 people.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Federations, Welfare Funds, Community Councils," ''American Jewish Year Book 1964'', vol. 65, New York: American Jewish Committee, 1965, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, most Canadian Jewish newspapers and magazines were independently owned and operated.&lt;ref&gt;See the list in ''American Jewish Year Book 1963'', vol. 64, New York: American Jewish Committee, 1965, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the monthly, tabloid-sized ''Calgary Jewish News'', according to Shatz, its first editor, was to unite the community and eliminate the redundancy of competing organizational publications.&lt;ref name="llevendel"/&gt;

===Expansion===
At the end of the 1970s, ''Calgary Jewish News'' expanded beyond its initial purpose. In 1979, it published articles in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hebrew]], and [[Yiddish]],&lt;ref&gt;''Calgary Jewish News'', October 1979, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the growth and diversity of the community; in 1980, it began subscribing for the first time to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|Jewish Telegraphic News Service]],&lt;ref&gt;''Calgary Jewish News'', February 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and also published a 24-page edition, its largest ever.&lt;ref&gt;''Calgary Jewish News'', April 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
By 1980, Canadian Jewish communities "were moving to take-over Jewish weeklies,"&lt;ref&gt;"Canada," ''American Jewish Year Book 1982'', vol. 82, New York: American Jewish Committee, 1981, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; but the trend was reversed in Calgary with the appearance that year of ''[[The Jewish Star (Alberta)|The Jewish Star]]'', the city's first independent Jewish newspaper. The ensuing uneasy relationship between the organized Calgary Jewish leadership and the independent ''Jewish Star'' mirrored tensions playing out in the 1980s and 1990s in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Toronto]] and elsewhere between a free press and Jewish federations.&lt;ref&gt;"Newspapers Say Federations Threaten Free Press," ''[[The Jewish Star (Alberta)|The Jewish Star]]'', Calgary Edition, March 30, 1984, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "Jewish newspaper war to shape American Jewry's integrity," ''[[Intermountain Jewish News]]'', July 13, 1984, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fitzgerald, "A fight for survival. Independent Jewish newspapers battling competitive threat from newspapers started and subsidized by Jewish charities," ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', July 21, 1984, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Black, "Federation vs. Independent Press," ''B'nai B'rith Messenger'' (Los Angeles), two parts, June 21, June 28, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Wm. Lippman, "The Jewish Press – Chronicle of the Contemporary Scene," ''Judaism'' vol. 36, Spring 1987, pp. 238-242.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the Calgary Council saw reports from within the community which it deemed unflattering.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Editorial, "An Embarrassment to Calgary's Jews," ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, March 6, 1981, p. 4 and Joe Spier, "A Response", April 3, 1981, p. 4; Avrim Namak, "Report on Centre was 'Misleading', Inaccurate," ''The Jewish Star'', March 5, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, in a move that saved the Council thousands of dollars on mailing costs, the ''Calgary Jewish News'' was inserted into, and delivered by mail with, ''The Jewish Star''.&lt;ref&gt;"New Distribution Method for Calgary Jewish News," ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, March 19, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing===
''Calgary Jewish News'' was discontinued in 1988, and followed by the Calgary Jewish Community Council's newsletter, ''Dor L'Dor''.&lt;ref name="llevendel"/&gt;

==Editors==
''Calgary Jewish News'' was edited by Harry S. Shatz from September 1962 to September 1978. Subsequent individuals named in the publication as editor included Gil August (1978–79); Douglas Wertheimer (1979–80); Avrim Namak (1980-82); and Rose Suissa (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Strathern adds Gary Kohn as another editor, between Shatz and August, without an indication of a timespan. ''Alberta Newspapers, 1880-1982: An Historical Directory'', [[University of Alberta Press]], 1988, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carbonari''' (Italian for "charcoal makers") was an informal network of [[secret society|secret revolutionary societies]] active in Italy from about 1800 to 1831. The Italian Carbonari may have further influenced other revolutionary groups in France, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Brazil and Uruguay.{{sfn|Galt|1994}} Although their goals often had a patriotic and liberal basis, they lacked a clear immediate political agenda.{{sfn|Smith|1988}} They were a focus for those unhappy with the repressive political situation in Italy following 1815, especially in the south of the [[Italian Peninsula]].{{sfn|Smith|1988}}{{sfn|Duggan|2008}} Members of the Carbonari, and those influenced by them, took part in important events in the process of [[Italian unification]] (called the ''[[Risorgimento]])'', especially the failed [[Revolutions of 1820|Revolution of 1820]], and in the further development of [[Italian nationalism]]. The chief purpose was to defeat tyranny and to establish constitutional government. In the north of Italy other groups, such as the Adelfia and the Filadelfia, were associate organizations.{{sfn|Smith|1988}}{{sfn|Duggan|2008}}
{{TOC limit|4}}

==Organization==
The Carbonari were a [[secret society]] divided into small [[covert cell]]s scattered across Italy. Although agendas varied, evidence suggests that despite regional variations, most of the membership agreed upon the creation of a liberal, unified Italy.&lt;ref name="Rath 1964 353–370"&gt;{{harvnb|Rath|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carbonari were [[anti-clerical]] in both their philosophy and programme. The Papal constitution [[Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo]] and the encyclical ''[[Qui pluribus]]'' were directed against them. The controversial document [[Alta Vendita]], which called for a liberal or modernist takeover of the Catholic Church, was attributed to the [[Sicily|Sicilia]]n Carbonari.{{sfn|''Rambler''|1854}}

== History ==

===Origins===
Although it is not clear where they were originally established,&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt; they first came to prominence in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Although some of the society's documents claimed that it had origins in medieval France,&lt;ref name="Rath 1964 353–370"/&gt; and that its progenitors were under the sponsorship of [[Francis I of France]] during the sixteenth century, this claim can not be verified by outside sources. Although a plethora of theories have been advanced as to the origins of the Carbonari, the organization most likely emerged as an offshoot of Freemasonry,&lt;ref name="Rath 1964 353–370"/&gt; as part of the spread of liberal ideas from the [[French Revolution]]. They first became influential in the Kingdom of Naples (under the control of [[Joachim Murat]]) and in the [[Papal States]], the most resistant opposition to the ''Risorgimento''.{{sfn|Galt|1994}} The Carbonari were probably an offshoot of the Freemasons, from whom they differed in important particulars, and first began to assume importance in southern Italy during the Napoleonic wars.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{harvnb|Villari|1911|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a secret society that was often targeted for suppression by conservative governments, the Carbonari operated largely in secret.  The name ''Carbonari'' identified the members as rural “charcoal-burners”; the place where they met was called a ''“baracca”'', the members called themselves “good cousin” while people who did not belong to the Carbonari were “pagani”. There were special ceremonies to initiate the members.{{sfn|Galt|1994}}

The aim of the Carbonari was the creation of a constitutional monarchy or a republic; they wanted also to defend the rights of common people against all forms of absolutism.{{sfn|Kirsch|1908}} Carbonari, to achieve their purpose, talked of fomenting armed revolts.

The membership was separated into two classes—apprentice and master. There were two ways to become a master: through serving as an apprentice for at least six months or by already being a Freemason upon entry.&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;{{harvnb|Kirsch|1908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their initiation rituals were structured around the trade of charcoal-selling, suiting their name.

In 1814 the Carbonari wanted to obtain a constitution for the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] by force. The Bourbon king, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]],  was opposed to them. The Bonapartist [[Joachim Murat]] had wanted to create a united and independent Italy. In 1815 Ferdinand I found his kingdom swarming with them. Society in the ''Regno'' comprised nobles, officers of the army, small landlords, government officials, peasants and  priests, with a small urban middle class. Society was dominated by the Papacy.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; On 15 August 1814, Cardinals [[Ercole Consalvi]] and [[Bartolomeo Pacca]] issued an edict forbidding all secret societies, to become members of these secret associations, to attend their meetings, or to furnish a meeting-place for such, under severe penalties.{{sfn|Kirsch|1908}}

===1820 and 1821 uprisings===
The Carbonari first arose during the resistance to the [[First French Empire|French occupation]], notably under [[Joachim Murat]], the Bonapartist [[King of Naples]]. However, once the wars ended, they became a nationalist organisation with a marked anti-[[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] tendency and were instrumental in organising [[revolutions]] in Italy in 1820–1821 and 1831.

The 1820 revolution began in Naples against King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]]. Riots, inspired by events in [[Cadiz]], Spain that same year, took place in Naples, bandying anti-absolutist goals and demanding a liberal constitution. On July 1, two officers, Michele Morelli and Joseph Silvati, (who had been part of the army of Murat under [[Guglielmo Pepe]]), marched towards the town of Nola in Campania at the head of their regiments of cavalry.

Worried about the protests, King Ferdinand agreed to grant a new constitution and the adoption of a parliament. The victory, albeit partial, illusory and apparent, caused a lot of hope in the peninsula and local conspirators, led by Santorre di Santarosa, marched toward [[Turin]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and 12 March 1821 obtained a constitutional monarchy and liberal reforms as a result of Carbonari actions.  However, the Holy Alliance did not tolerate such revolutionary compromises and in February 1821 sent an army that defeated the outnumbered and poorly equipped insurgents in the south. In Piedmont, King [[Vittorio Emanuele I]], undecided what to do, abdicated in favor of his brother [[Charles Felix of Sardinia]]; but Charles Felix, more resolute, invited an Austria military intervention. On April 8, the Habsburg army defeated the rebels and the uprisings of 1820–1821, triggered almost entirely by the Carbonari, ended up collapsing.&lt;ref&gt;George T. Romani, ''The Neapolitan revolution of 1820-1821'' (Northwestern University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 1821 Pope Pius VII with the bull Ecclesiam ''a Jesu Christo'' condemned the Carbonari as a [[Freemasonry in Italy|Freemason secret society]], excommunicating its members.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Reinerman,  "Metternich and the Papal Condemnation of the" Carbonari", 1821." ''Catholic Historical Review'' 54#1 (1968): 55-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the principal leaders of the Carbonari, Morelli and Silvati were sentenced to death; Pepe went into exile; [[Federico Confalonieri]], [[Silvio Pellico]], and Piero Maroncelli were imprisoned.

===1831 uprisings===
The Carbonari were defeated but not beaten; they took part in the revolution of July 1830{{sfn|Kirsch|1908}} that supported the liberal policy of King Louis Philippe of France on the wings of victory for the uprising in Paris. The Italian Carbonari took up arms against some states in central and northern Italy, particularly the Papal States and Modena.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Shiver, "The Carbonari." ''Social Science'' (1964): 234-241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciro Menotti was to take the reins of the initiative, trying to find the support of Duke Francis IV of Modena, who pretended to respond positively in return for granting the title of King of Italy, but the Duke made the double play and Menotti, virtually unarmed, was arrested the day before the date fixed for the uprising. Francis IV, at the suggestion of the Austrian statesman [[Klemens von Metternich]], had condemned him to death, along with many others among Menotti's allies. This was the last major effort by the secret group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Justin Goldstein|title=Political Repression in 19th Century Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fplSW2zNa0C&amp;pg=PT149|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
In 1820, the Neapolitan Carbonari once more took up arms, in order to wring a constitution from King Ferdinand I. They advanced against the capital from Nola under a military officer and the Abbot Minichini. They were joined by General Pepe and many officers and government officials, and the king took an oath to observe the Spanish constitution in Naples. The movement spread to Piedmont, and Victor Emmanuel resigned the throne in favour of his brother Charles Felix. It was only through the intervention of Austria. The Carbonari secretly continued their agitation against Austria and the governments in friendly connection with it. They formed a vendita. Pope Pius VII issued a general condemnation of the secret society of the Carbonari. The association lost its influence by degrees and was gradually absorbed into the new political organizations that sprang up in Italy; its members became affiliated especially with Mazzini's "Young Italy". From Italy the organization was carried to France where it appeared as the Charbonnerie, which, was divided into ventes. Members were especially numerous in Paris. The chief aim of the association in France also was political, namely, to obtain a constitution in which the conception of the sovereignty of the people could find expression. From Paris the movement spread rapidly through the country, and it was the cause of several mutinies among the troops; it lost its importance after several conspirators were executed, especially as quarrels broke out among the leaders. The Charbonnerie took part in the Revolution, 1830; after the fall of the Bourbons, its influence rapidly declined. After this a Charbonnerie démocratique was formed among the French Republicans; after 1841, nothing more was heard of it. Carbonari were also to be found in Spain, but their numbers and importance were more limited than in the other Romance countries.{{sfn|Kirsch|1908}}

In 1830, Carbonari took part in the [[July Revolution]] in France. This gave them hope that a successful revolution might be staged in Italy. A bid in [[Modena]] was an outright failure, but in February 1831, several cities in the [[Papal States]] rose up and flew the Carbonari tricolour. A volunteer force marched on Rome but was destroyed by Austrian troops who had intervened at the request of [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. After the failed uprisings of 1831, the governments of the various Italian states cracked down on the Carbonari, who now virtually ceased to exist. The more astute members realised they could never take on the Austrian army in open battle and joined a new movement, [[Giovane Italia]] ("Young Italy") led by the nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. Independent from French Philadelphians were instead the homonymous ''carbonara'' group born in Southern Italy, especially in Puglia [3] and in the Cilento, between 1816 and 1828. In Cilento, in 1828, an insurrection of Philadelphia, who called for the restoration of the Neapolitan Constitution of 1820, was fiercely repressed by the director of the Bourbon police Francesco Saverio Del Carretto: among the atrocities we remember the destruction of the village of Bosco.

This defeat made it clear to many Carbonari (such as Giuseppe Mazzini, one of the most acute Carbonari leaders) that militarily, especially if alone, they could not compete with Austria, one of the greatest powers of the Old Continent. They founded a new secret society called the Young Italy in which many members would trace their origins and inspiration to the Carbonari. Rapidly declining in influence and members, the Carbonari practically ceased to exist, although the official history of this important company had continued, wearily, until 1848.

==Prominent members==
Prominent members of the Carbonari included:
*[[Gabriele Rossetti]]
*[[Amand Bazard]]
*[[Silvio Pellico]] (1788–1854) and Pietro Maroncelli (1795–1846)
:both were imprisoned by the Austrians for years, many of which they spent in [[Spielberg fortress]] in [[Brno]], Southern [[Moravia]]. After his release, Pellico wrote a book ''Le mie prigioni'', describing in detail his ten-year ordeal. Maroncelli lost one leg in prison and was instrumental in translating and editing of Pellico's book in Paris (1833).
*[[Giuseppe Mazzini]]
*[[Marquis de Lafayette]] (hero of the American and French Revolutions),
*Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future French emperor [[Napoleon III]]) Almost certain but highly disputed.
*French revolutionary [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]].
*[[Lord Byron]]
*[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]

==Legacy==

=== In Portugal ===
{{main article|Carbonária}}
The Portuguese Carbonari (''{{lang|pt|Carbonária}}'') was first founded there in 1822 but was soon disbanded.

A new organization of the same name and claiming to be its continuation was founded in 1896 by Artur Augusto Duarte da Luz de Almeida. This organisation was active in efforts to educate the people and was involved in various antimonarchist conspiracies. Most notably, ''Carbonária'' members were active in the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] and his heir, Prince [[Luís Filipe, Duke of Bragança|Louis Philip]] in 1908. ''Carbonária'' members also played a part in the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] that deposed the Constitutional Monarchy and implemented the [[First Portuguese Republic|republic]].{{sfn|McCullagh|1910|p={{page number|date=April 2017}}}} One commonality among them was their hostility to the Church and they contributed to the republic's [[anticlericalism]].{{sfn|Birmingham|2003}}

===Elsewhere in Europe===
Two results of great importance in the progress of the European Revolution ([[Revolutions of 1848]]) proceeded from the events that occurred at [[Naples]] in 1820-21. One was the reorganization of the Carbonari, consequent upon the publicity given to their organization when it had brought about the revolution (and the secrecy in which it had hitherto been enveloped was no longer deemed necessary); the other was the extension of the organization beyond the [[Alps]]. When the Neapolitan revolution had been effected, the Carbonari emerged from their mystery, published their constitution statutes, and ceased to conceal their programme and their cards of membership.{{sfn|Frost|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_7GD-Nj3ZrQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA1 1]}}

In particular, the dispersion of the Carbonari leaders had, at the same time, the effect of extending their influence in France. General [[Guglielmo Pepe]] proceeded to Barcelona when the counter-revolution was imminent at Naples and his life was no longer safe there; and to the same city went several of the Piedmontese revolutionists when the country was Austrianized after the same lawless fashion. The dispersion of [[Scalvini]] and Ugoni that took refuge at Geneva and others of the proscribed that proceeded to London added to the progress which Carbonarism was making in France, suggested to General Pepe the idea of an international secret society, which would combine for a common purpose the advanced political reformers of all the European States.{{sfn|Frost|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_7GD-Nj3ZrQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA2 2]}}

===South America===
[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] has been called the "Hero of the Two Worlds" because of his military enterprises in [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Europe]]. In 1836, Garibaldi took up the cause of [[Riograndense Republic|Republic of Rio Grande do Sul]] in its attempt to separate from the [[Empire of Brazil]], joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins in the [[Ragamuffin War]] (1835-1845). In 1841, Garibaldi moved to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. In 1842, he took command of the Uruguayan fleet and raised an "Italian Legion" of soldiers for the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] (1839-1851). He aligned his forces with a faction composed of the Uruguayan Colorados and the Argentine Unitarios. This faction received support from the French and British Empires in their struggle against the forces of the Uruguayan Government and Argentine Federales.

===In literature===
The story [[Vanina Vanini]] by [[Stendhal]] involved a hero in the Carbonari and a heroine who became obsessed by this. It was made into a film in 1961.

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s story "[[The Pavilion on the Links]]" features the Carbonari as the villains of the plot.

[[Katherine Neville (author)|Katherine Neville]]'s novel ''[[The Fire (novel)|The Fire]]'' features the Carbonari as part of a plot involving a mystical chess service.

In [[Wilkie Collins]]' "[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]" the character of Professor Pesca is a member of 'The Brotherhood', an organisation placed contemporaneously with, and similarly featured as, the Carbonari. Clyde Hyder suspects that the model for Prof. Pesca was [[Gabriele Rossetti]], who was a member of the Carbonari, as well as an Italian teacher resident in London during the 1840s.

[[Anton Felix Schindler]]'s biography of [[Beethoven]] "Beethoven as I Knew Him" states that his close connection with the [[composer]] was begun in 1815 when the latter requested an account of Schindler's involvement with a riot of [[Napoleon]]'s supporters in [[Vienna]], who were agitating against the Carbonari uprisings.   Schindler was arrested and lost a year at college. Beethoven was sympathetic and, as a result, became a close friend of Schindler.

The Carbonari are mentioned prominently in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short story "[[The Adventure of the Red Circle]]" (1911), written by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].

The Carbonari are also mentioned briefly in the book "[[Resurrection Men]]" by [[T. K. Welsh]], in which the main character's father is a member of the secret organisation.

They feature in [[Tim Powers]]' ''[[The Stress of Her Regard]]'' as opponents of the vampire-backed Austrian Empire.

Mr. Settembrini's grandfather in [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'' is said to be Carbonari.

The Carbonari are mentioned in ''The Hundred Days'' by Patrick O'Brian, part of the Aubrey-Maturin series.

[[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Cemetery of Prague]]'' mentions the Carbonari, with the main character joining them as a spy.

'''Charles Davies''' (1849 &amp;ndash; January 1927) was a Welsh Baptist minister. His parents were Daniel and Margaret Davies of [[Llwynhendy]]. After completing his education at the Graig Academy grammar school in [[Swansea]], he moved to study at the Baptist College, [[Llangollen]]. Following his ordination in 1870 he took charge of Penuel, [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]]. In 1877 he moved to Everton Village, [[Liverpool]], before returning to Wales in 1888 to follow Nathaniel Thomas (1818 - 1888) as minister of [[Tabernacle Chapel, Cardiff]].

His published writings include ''Cyfrol o Bregethau'' (1910), and contributions to ''Y Geninen''.

'''Cheng Beng Buddhist Society''', also the [[Vimalakirti]] Buddhist Centre ({{zh|s=净名佛学社}}), is a [[Buddhist]] monastery in [[Singapore]]. The foundation was originally set up by Venerable [[Wen Ming Hu]]. The present premises are located at [[Geylang]], Singapore.

==History==

Cheng Beng Buddhist Society was founded as Singapore Buddhist Youth Group in 1961 by Wen Ming Hu and other lay Buddhists, and was renamed under its present name in 1962 when it was also relocated at an address offered by [[Chen Lu Niang]]. The society was named after the Buddhist [[bodhisattva]] [[Vimalakirti]], a householder devotee of the ancient [[Shakyamuni Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurman|first1=Robert A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24708">Objects used in Jewish rituals are known collectively as [[Judaica]]. The '''conservation and restoration of Judaica''' takes into account the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the written and oral [[Torah]] known as, [[halacha]] in order to properly care for these materials. This work involves identifying these objects and therefore knowing how any of these objects are traditionally handled, stored, exhibited, and generally cared for based on their use and significance. 

==Definition of culturally sensitive objects==
Traditional [[Judaism]] divides ritual objects into two main categories, those that carry holiness; and those that are essential to the performance of a particular ritual or commandment but that have no intrinsic quality that is defined as sacred or holy. Once they are no longer in ritual use and are in the possession of a museum, only some of the objects in the first category are traditionally treated differently from the way other collections are treated. For these pieces, repair or restoration done by a conservator is not common. It is common for almost all other objects, conservation, repair, or restoration to be carried out without restriction.&lt;ref name="Defining"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Virginia|title=Accessories of Holiness: Defining Jewish Sacred Objects|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic31-01-005.html||website=cool.conservation-us.org|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=January 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way the objects below are handled and preventatively conserved is all based on the laws and thoughts of the most strict sect of Judaism as is recommended.

Below is a list of both types of objects with definitions and descriptions to aid in identifying and therefore knowing how any of these objects might be handled and cared for due to their uses and significance. Additionally, these descriptions will aid in understanding the care and handling methods listed below them. 

References are made to [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi]], and [[Mizrachi Jews]] in this article. Ashkenazi Jews trace their ancestry to communities in central and eastern Europe while Sephardi Jews are those who came originally from the Iberian Peninsula. These Jews were expelled in 1492 during the Spanish Inquisition and settled in places like Greece, Turkey, and what is known as Israel today. Mizrachi Jews are those who trace their ancestry to the Arab world and Iran, as well as those whose families never left Palestine.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;

===Types of sacred and non-sacred objects===
Tashmishey Kedushah is the first category of ritual objects and is defined as "objects which carry holiness" or "accessories of holiness." The most common example of this is the [[Torah]] which is the Five Books of Moses.&lt;ref name=Defining/&gt;  [[File:Open Torah scroll.jpg|thumb|Open Torah scroll]]

The common feature of the objects in this group is that they contain words, specifically the name of God, but by extension, any words "divinely written" or inspired, from which the quality of holiness is derived. Because the nontextual objects surrounding these scrolls all come into contact with them, they also acquire some of the same quality of holiness. The transmission is not indefinite. It extends a maximum of two layers from the text.

Other objects in this category include:
* Torah curtains - Curtains that are in front of the Torah ark and are often decorative in nature but can also be plain. 
* Mantle - A piece of fabric often used to cover a Torah scroll and often made of velvet or another soft material with some type of embroidery. This is used most often by Ashkenazi communities.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;
* Torah binder - A strip of soft fabric, similar to the mantle, that keeps the Torah scroll closed.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; In Italy and in the Sephardi communities, the binder is known as a "fascia"; it is made of a costly material or of linen embroidered in silk thread.&lt;ref name="Virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Torah Ornaments|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/torah-ornaments|website=Jewish Virtual Library: A Project of AICE|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rimonim - Silver and gold ornaments that are placed on the wooden rollers or in Hebrew, "atzei chaim" (trees of life). Many times these are adorned with little bells and are very intricate.&lt;ref name="Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shekel|first1=Michal|title=The Making of a Torah Scroll|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/torah-scroll/|website=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breastplate - A metal shield placed in front of the mantle of the Torah scroll in Ashkenazi communities. This custom did not develop in Sephardi communities because their Torah scrolls were kept in a case (tik)  which did not lend itself to such additional decoration. Symbolic of, and sometimes similar to, the breastplate prescribed for the high priest, the object is often called "ḥoshen mishpat," the Hebrew word for breastplate.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* [[Yad]] - The pointer used by the Torah reader to keep one's place is known as a "yad," in Hebrew, or "hand" in English, in Ashkenazi communities and as the "moreh" or "pointer/teacher" or "Kulmus" or "quill" in Sephardi and Eastern communities. The pointer was originally a narrow rod, tapered at the pointing end, usually with a hole at the other end through which a ring or chain could be passed to hang the pointer on the Torah scroll. Now it looks like a hand with one finger pointing out. This is used so that no hands touch the actual scroll and transfer oils or dirt. Pointers are made for the most part of silver or silver-plated brass, but in a few European communities, they used to be made of wood. In such cases, the pointers were carved in the local folk-art style.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* Wood Torah case - Used by Sephardic Jews instead of a fabric mantle allowing the Torah to sit upright when not in use and without the use of a chair or holder as mentioned above. [[File:ShinMezuzahJosephSherman.jpg|thumb|ShinMezuzahJosephSherman]] &lt;ref name="Sephardim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Yehuda|title=Why Do Sephardim Keep Their Torahs in Cylindrical Cases|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3119530/jewish/Why-Do-Sephardim-Keep-Their-Torahs-in-Cylindrical-Cases.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chair or holder on which the Torah is placed when it is removed from the ark and not being read. 
* [[Tefillin]]  - Known in English as “phylacteries,” are worn by men in the Orthodox and Conservative movement during morning prayer and on weekdays. This includes a leather case, the biblical texts written on parchment that is inside, the leather straps used to fasten them to the head and arm during prayer (see image of soldier below), and any bag specifically made to hold them and used for that purpose on a regular basis. 
*[[Mezuzah]] - A metal, ceramic, or glass casing in which the handwritten text on parchment or "[[klaf]]" in Hebrew, is held. This object is fastened to the doorpost of a house and, traditionally, to interior doorways as well and marks the home of a Jewish family. 

Bibles, prayer books, volumes of the [[Talmud]], law codes, and commentaries, in a variety of languages, are now also included in this list. In some communities, any document of any kind written in Hebrew letters is also included. This can sometimes also include anything written in [[Yiddish]] which uses the same alphabet.

====Tashmishey Mitzvah====
Tashminey Mitzvah is a category that includes most other ritual objects essential to Jewish life.  Objects include:
*Wine or [[kiddush]] cups used on Sabbath and holidays 
*[[Hanukkah]] [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] 
*[[Seder plate]] 
*[[Shofar]] 
*[[Tallit]] with knotted fringes, called [[tzitzit]].
*[[Lulav]] or a palm branch in English, tied together with willow and myrtle and [[etrog]] (citron) to be used on the Jewish harvest holiday of [[Sukkot]], 
*[[Etrog]] containers - That keep the etrog safe from the "pitam" or "pitom" breaking off making the fruit less valuable and possibly not kosher. 
*Sabbath candlesticks - Used weekly during [[Shabbat]]
*Spice box and candle holder used for the [[Havdalah]] service that marks the end of the Jewish Sabbath, called [[Shabbat]]. 
*[[Challah]] and [[matzah]] covers - Used to cover bread for Shabbat and the holiday of Passover which tells the story of the exodus from Egypt. 
*[[Chuppah]] - or wedding canopy in English

==Preventative conservation ==
Once holy/sacred objects (tashmishey kedusha) leave the Jewish community and enter the care of a museum, it is common practice that this group of objects is divided into two sections. The first section contains the three written texts including the Torah scroll, tefillin, and klaf for the mezuza. (These all are, or contain, biblical texts that were handwritten on parchment, in a particular script, according to rigid rules, by men who are specially trained as scribes (sofrim)). The second section includes all other material, including printed or handwritten documents, Torah mantles, ark curtains, tefillin bags, Torah ornaments, and mezuza cases (see other section below).

In terms of preventative conservation and conservation itself, Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls traditionally are left as they are. According to [[halacha]], once they are no longer in use, there is no reason for them to be kosher—in proper condition to be used—and therefore no reason why missing or abraded letters are restored or minor repairs made to the parchment unless the museum wishes to do as they see it necessary for the safety of the object. 

The repair of other books and documents has often been done with the respect that would characterize any professional conservation treatment. In Judaism, the study of traditional texts is considered to be the equivalent of prayer. To restore any text, whether of aesthetic or historical value or not, to a state in which it can be studied is considered an act of merit whatever the religious or cultural affiliation of the person doing the work. This includes when it will just be on view in an exhibition.

===Torah, Klaf===
If, for the safety of a Torah scroll, it is determined that repairs must be done to the rollers on which the scroll is mounted, traditionally, these repairs are done by a scribe, who will then remounts the parchment onto the roller in the traditional manner. It has been proven that a Torah scroll that has a tear in the parchment does best when it is kept rolled to another part of the scroll. According to tradition, if two pages are separated the two parts of the scroll are most often wrapped and stored separately. If it is considered both possible (considering the condition of the parchment) and essential to rejoin the separated leaves.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

When Torah scrolls, prayer books, or volumes of the [[Talmud]] are in the possession of a Jewish institution, it is a common practice to only photograph (or making photocopies) of open scrolls or pages only for serious study or publication. Once the books and other documents are in an archive, or museum, the rules of the institution apply. These rules are usually based on condition and value, but restrictions on casual copying do exist in all cases.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Tefillin - phylacteries===
[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|IDF soldier put on tefillin]] 
It is against halacha to open tefillin unless it is necessary. According to Jewish tradition, the removal and examination of the klaf within the tefillin only occurs when the tefillin are being repaired. The style of the writing can give clues to the registrar or conservator to the time and place in which they were written. Many institutions exhibit tefillin in damaged condition if there is a special reason such as its association with a famous person, or in an exhibit of Holocaust-related material.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Other materials===
Objects in this group are commonly treated by any qualified conservator who will treat Jewish ritual material as anthropological material rather than as art, keeping conservation treatment to a minimum, and avoiding extensive restoration. Any ethical treatment is seen as permitted. It is noted that Conservators in private practice, who may not have the option of minimal treatment, may take on greater responsibility as a result of the above. Original fabric or trimming removed from an ark curtain have traditionally given to the owner for proper disposal. If the owner is unwilling to do this is it common for the responsibility to fall on the conservator to make other arrangements.  

===Holocaust related objects===
Alterations of any kind to an object that survived the Holocaust, unless absolutely necessary to ensure its physical survival, are not made out of respect for the victims. Conservators and collections staff traditionally attempt to do the least amount of conservation on an object from the Holocaust as the damaged state is part of what is seen as telling of the history of the object. Any intervention can be seen as causing a loss of historic and perhaps even esthetic information, and the greater the intervention the greater the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozdeba|first1=Suzzane|title=Uncertain Future|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/76089/uncertain-future|website=Tablet Magazine Online|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Holocaust museums and other museums carrying objects from concentration camps including fragile items like prisoners’ artwork and thousands of documents, shoes, and suitcases, teeth, hair, glasses, luggage, and more, preservation is viewed as an ethical and practical issue. Conservators and registrars alike wrestle with questions about the proper role of restoration. It has been noted that people coming to see these objects don't want to see a replica of how something might have once looked, but they are looking for what it looks like because of what it, and what its owner, went through.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sevy|first1=Dr. Rivka|title=Ethics in Conservation of Original Materials|url=https://ehri-project.eu/ethics-conservation-original-materials|website=ehri-project.eu|publisher=European Holocaust Research Infrastructure|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration camps themselves are also considered artifacts to be to preserved as close to how they originally looked while still conserving them. This includes the barracks and other buildings that are exposed to natural conditions like atmosphere, rain, cold, etc. When Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945, it covered 40 square kilometers, with three camps, sub camps, and an additional area that was supervised by SS administration. While some were hesitant to leave the camp as it was because of difficult memories, it was upon the request of former prisoners that the local government keep the former concentration camp intact as a memorial and the Polish government began initiatives to preserve the site, giving the Ministry of Culture and Art the authority to preserve parts of it.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

Alternatively, the conservation of audio or visual records (photographs, films, voice records) is different. The audio or visual recordings of past historical events that are caught as images or sound are not the original as there is no physical original. Because they are the only remaining representation of the events of the holocaust, such as the Nazi Book burnings in the Opernplatz in Berlin,  this media is commonly conserved as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

==Overarching ethical concerns==
Because of certain rules, restrictions, and traditions within the Jewish religion, certain ethical concerns are commonly top-of-mind when caring for sacred Judaica. 

===Kohen restriction===
Many restrictions were designed to maintain what is referred to as ritual purity for Jews who are of the "Priest" holy order in the Temple of Jerusalem. Today, most Jews will know if they come from that [[Kohen]] line, and one might be able to tell from the last name of Cohen, Kohn, Kahn, etc. Many of the laws and practices are still maintained in traditional Judaism. One law that might affect the conservation of objects is that Kohanim are forbidden to be in contact with dead bodies, or be under the same roof as a corpse or any part of one, except in the case of the death of a close relative. This could prevent a conservator or registrar (doing preventative conservation) from caring for objects that are of the human remain nature, but only if it bothers the professional because of his or her background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozovsky|first1=Lorne|title=Raise Your Hand if You're A Kohen|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/762109/jewish/Raise-Your-Hand-If-Youre-A-Kohen.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menstruation and women touching objects===
It is the practice in some ultra-orthodox sects of Judaism that women who are menstruating do not touch any sacred texts for purity reasons. This is only a custom and is not written into Jewish law. Because of this, female conservators are able to work with the texts but remain cognizant of this custom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkovitz|first1=Rahel|title=Can Women Touch the Torah? A Halackic View|url=https://www.jofa.org/Education/TorahTouching|website=Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placement of sacred texts and objects on the floor===
Materials containing: (a) God's name, (b) Three consecutive words of a biblical verse, when written on one line with the intent to quote the verse, or (c) Other written or printed Torah ideas or laws are considered to be holy and, according to Jewish law, are not placed on the floor for any reason. Schoolwork, homework and test papers may be included in this category if they contain any of the above. All these materials are considered holy objects whether they are in Hebrew or another language, in Braille, or on microfilm.&lt;ref name="Chabad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Posner|first1=Menachem|title=Proper Disposal of Holy Objects|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/475304/jewish/Proper-Disposal-of-Holy-Objects.htm%20Chabad.org|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stacking of sacred texts===
Additionally, any materials with God's name are not, according to halacha, stacked one on top of the other in any type of museum storage. Many consider this to be disrespectful to the holy objects.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Exhibition and storage==
While there are few restrictions on the exhibition of Jewish ritual objects and generally none on the examination of this material for purposes of study by anyone of any religion or culture, it is important to mention the exceptions below.

It has been proven that Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls do best if exhibited in an unrolled fashion unless they are deemed no longer fit for ritual use. These objects are generally stored covered with plain cloth or tissue paper in a dark drawer or cabinet and are separated from their holders if a conservator or registrar feels it is unwise to leave them in the same place. A reason for this is if the mantle is deemed unfit to stay on the Torah scroll. It is common practice for a Tefillin that needs to be separated from its bag to be kept in a plain cloth bag for storage. Small Torah scrolls are commonly stored lying down while large ones are kept upright on a rack specifically made to hold their weight.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

Mezuzah scrolls are traditionally kept in their cases or wrapped in tissue.

===Handling and long-term care===
Generally, when taken out for any reason, such as to be examined by a researcher, tashmishey kedusha is treated with respect as any object that is still being used in rituals. The surface on which the objects are placed is covered with a clean cloth or appropriate non-acidic paper, and the objects are covered when not being examined. Any scrolls being examined are re-rolled up when not in use.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

It has been proven that if the parchment is in good enough condition, it's best for the preservation of Torah scrolls and other rolled documents to be completely rolled front to back (or vice versa) and back to the center, once every year or two. This is most commonly done by two people who are experienced in this procedure and under the supervision of a conservator.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==
In many Jewish institutions, if it is decided that an object has reached the point of needing conservation, a [[registrar (museum)|museum registrar]] will connect a conservator with an expert in the type of object or in the Judaica field. This pairing of Rabbi with a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]], a religious expert with conservator, or a professor with conservator, is known to creates a more trustworthy situation where the Museum does not have to worry that all Jewish rules are followed. If the conservator has any questions on process, or on what to do and not do, he or she can refer to the assigned expert. 

Instead of contacting a conservator if there are issues with a Torah, specifically involving the writing on the parchment, a registrar or curator will traditionally connect with a [[Sofer Stam]], or a scribe in English. This expert is trained in transcribing the Torah, tefillin, and mezuzahs, and other religious writings. According to Jewish law, or halacha, they are the only people allowed to touch these texts.  Scribes also assemble the Torah scrolls, sewing the sheets of parchment together and mounting them on the rollers, and make the cases for tefillin.&lt;ref name="Strassfeld"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=R.|last2=Strassfeld|first2=M.|last3=Strassfeld|first3=S.|title=The Jewish Catalogue|date=1973|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-accessioning==
When it comes to the deaccessioning process of museum objects that a conservator or other museum professional deems beyond repair, these said objects can be disposed of through destruction. They will be destroyed by the curator or his/her designee. When it comes to disposal of Judaica, there are different rules depending on whether the object is deemed still holy or longer holy and whether they are fit for ritual use, or not fit for ritual use. 

===Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Kedushah)===
If collections professionals have artifacts that are holy Jewish objects containing the name of God (tashmishey kedusha) that have been determined to be beyond conservation and the museum no longer wants them in the collection and would otherwise dispose of them, this is, according to halacha, not allowed. Jewish law instructs how these types of objects are to be "put away"  (O.H. 154.3; Mishneh Torah, II 10.3). 

Traditionally, Ashkenazi Jews fulfill this requirement of "putting away" a holy object through burial, either in a specific part of a Jewish cemetery or, in some places, next to or along with a man of exceptional piety and learning.

Many Sephardic/Mizrachi Jewish communities put these objects instead into a special room in the synagogue, called a [[geniza]] (from the root meaning “conceal,” “hide,” or “preserve”). Because this group of objects includes books that are both handwritten and printed, documents, and traditional items, the storage rooms can get quite full.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; The most famous geniza is in the Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. It held more than 200,000 pages, some dating to the founding of the synagogue in 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica|date=1971|publisher=Keter Publishing House.|location=Jerusalem, Israel|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Mitzvah)===
For the most part, objects that fall under tashmishey mitzvah are discarded when they are no longer fit for ritual use. This is because they have no intrinsic quality of holiness. even though they have value when it comes to Western aesthetics of beauty. One exception to this law is the [[tallit]]. The Shulchan Arukh, a medieval law code (first published 1565) and still considered authoritative by traditional Jews, states that [[tzitzit]], the strings that hang from a tallit are just as holy as the tallit itself and is treated as such.

'''Cybersectarianism''' is the phenomenon of [[new religious movements]] and other groups using the [[Internet]] for text distribution, recruitment, and [[information sharing]].

==As an organizational type==
The term, as coined by political scientist Patricia M. Thornton at the [[University of Oxford]], describes "a unique hybrid form of politico-religious mobilization" adopted by a handful of syncretic [[qigong]] (气功) groups that emerged in the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and were subjected to extreme repression following the crackdown against banned religious and spiritual organizations in 1999.

Cybersectarianism as an organizational form involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era." In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In China==
Transnational Chinese cybersects include the group commonly known in the West as [[Falun Gong]] (法轮功), [[Zhong Gong]] (中华养生益智功), and the Taiwan-based group founded by Suma [[Ching Hai]], commonly referred to in the PRC as [[Guanyin Famen]] (观音法门), but rendered in English by the Ching Hai World Society as Quan Yin.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "Manufacturing Dissent in Transnational China:  Boomerang, Backfire or Spectacle?" In Kevin J. O’Brien, ed., ''Popular Contention in China'' (Harvard University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Some new transnational Protestant groups also subjected to persecution in the PRC, like [[Eastern Lightning]],  have likewise taken to the internet to ensure group survival, and taken on some of the characteristics of cybersects elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Emily C. Dunn, "Netizens of heaven: contesting orthodoxies on the Chinese Protestant web," ''Asian Studies Review'' 31, 4 (2007), pp. 447–58&lt;/ref&gt; Like the New Cyberreligious Movements (NCRMs) described by Karaflogka,&lt;ref&gt;Karaflogka, Anastasia.

Karaflogka cites the cyber-diocese of [[Partenia]] and [[Falun Gong]] as two examples of cyberreligions.&lt;/ref&gt; cybersect participants rely upon [[computer mediated communication]] (CMC) in their personal religious or spiritual practice, performing cyberpilgrimages, participating in cybermeditation sessions online, and/or cyberevangelism in third-party chatrooms.

Some cybersect members of groups, including [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and [[al Qaeda]], engage  in "repertoires of electronic contention,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sasha|last=Costanza-Chock|authorlink=Sasha Costanza-Chock|chapter=Mapping the Repertoire of Electronic Contention|editor1-first=Andrew|editor1-last=Opel|editor2-first=Donnalyn|editor2-last=Pompper|title=Representing Resistance: Media, Civil Disobedience and the Global Justice Movement|publisher=Greenwood|date=2003|pages=173–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; using websites and e-mail to mobilize participants for protest and contention, as well as [[hactivism]] (acts of electronic disruption) and even [[cyberterrorism]]{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} (acts of physical harm caused by the disruption of power grids, traffic control, and other systems of resource delivery and public safety).

==Among Muslims==
More recently, [[Sunni]]- and [[Shia]]- affiliated hackers have attacked and counter-attacked hundreds of websites in a vast struggle over cyberspace that has been characterized as an outbreak of cybersectarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Cyber-sectarianism," ''The Layalina Review on Public Diplomacy and Arab Media,'' Vol. IV, No. 22 (10–23 October 2008), pp. 5-6, available at [http://www.layalina.tv/press/PR_IV.22_1023_08.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaeldin Maghaireh describes two principal types of cyber-sectarian conflict in Muslim cyberspace: "Cyber-Islamist Advocacy," which consists of "religious publications, debates, emails awareness, lectures and videos;" and "Islamist Hactivism," which involves "cyber attacks against other religious or non-religious websites."&lt;ref&gt;Alaedin Maghaireh, "Shariah Law and Cyber-Sectarian Conflict: How can Islamic Criminal Law respond to cyber crime?," p. 338, available at [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache%3A86c43kpJs8AJ%3Acyber.kic.re.kr%2Fdata%2Falaeldinijccdec2008.pdf+%22cyber+sectarian%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pli=1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Dru C. Gladney]] describes how Muslim netizens in the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] have turned to the internet to explore and express their desires for independence with the broader, transnational Uyghur communities, culminating in what Gladney describes as a groundswell of "cyber-separatism."&lt;ref&gt;Dru C. Gladney, ''Dislocating China: Reflections on Muslims, Minorities and Other Subaltern Subjects'' (C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2004), see Chapter 11, "Cyber-separatism," pp. 229-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other groups==

When taken to the airwaves and posted on the internet, divisive sectarian language among Catholic and Protestant residents of post-agreement [[Northern Ireland]] has also been described as an outbreak of cybersectarianism by [[Ballymena]]-born [[BBC]] reporter, Declan Lawn, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Des Blackadder, [http://www.ballymenatimes.com/news/Your-views-Panorama-in-Ballymena.3958433.jp "Your Views: Panorama in Ballymena,"] ''Ballymena Times'', 8 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dermod Moore, [http://bonhom.ie/2006/03/bootboy-gougers-langers-and.html "Bootboy: Gougers, langers and victimology,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119043235/http://bonhom.ie/2006/03/bootboy-gougers-langers-and.html |date=19 November 2007 }} Dublin theatre reviews… and other passions (10 March 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the use of the term to describe the migration of political and religious sectarian divisions to cyberspace, see also Bernd Biege, [http://goireland.about.com/b/2007/11/05/failte-second-ireland.htm "Bernd's Ireland Travel Blog: Fáilte Second Ireland,"] 5 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the term is also commonly used to describe the internecine internet-based partisan splintering among various factions of the [[Socialist Party of America]],&lt;ref&gt;See [http://americansocialdemocrats.blogspot.com/2008/06/garland-wrote-does-this-partyorg-have.html "What's In A Name. Rose By Any Other Name Still Belongs In A Fist,"] New America: Welcome to the blog of the [[Social Democrats USA]], standing in the legacy of the [[Socialist Party of America]] (17 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;aka Bootboy, [http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2854905.html "I predict a riot"],  Hot Press Hot Press (14 March 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and among members of the [[Communist League]].
There is some evidence to suggest that the heavy reliance of such groups on the internet, a medium that not only facilitates but also encourages user interactivity and [[peer-to-peer]] information sharing, may present serious challenges to the maintenance of internal coherence and policing of orthodoxy by a central core of leaders.

Cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] likewise described the [[San Diego]]-based UFO religious group [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] as a cybersect, due to the group's heavy reliance on [[computer mediated communication|CMC]] as a mode of communication prior to the group's 1997 collective suicide;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Virilio,''The Information Bomb'' (Verso, 2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; while Rita M. Hauck of Fort Hays University considers "cybersect" to be a new but widely used term that "implies cyborgs or cybernauts with a collaborative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Rita M. Hauck, "Stratospheric Transparency: Perspectives on Internet Privacy, ''Forum on Public Policy'' (Summer 2009) [http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/summer09/archivesummer09/hauck.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420215019/http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/summer09/archivesummer09/hauck.pdf |date=20 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datura has been used in [[traditional medicine]] to relieve [[asthma]] symptoms and as an [[analgesic]] during [[surgery]] or [[bonesetter|bonesetting]]. It is also a powerful [[hallucinogen]] and [[deliriant]], which is used [[entheogen]]ically for the intense [[vision (spirituality)|visions]] it produces. However, the [[tropane alkaloid]]s responsible for both the medicinal and hallucinogenic properties are fatally toxic in only slightly higher amounts than the medicinal dosage, and careless use often results in hospitalizations and deaths.

== Description ==
[[File:Thorn-apple.jpg|thumb|left|Mature (left) and immature (right) seed pods]]
''Datura stramonium'' is a foul-smelling, erect, [[Annual plant|annual]], freely branching herb that forms a bush up to {{convert|2|to|5|ft|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall.&lt;ref name=Stace&gt;{{Cite book| last = Stace | first = Clive | authorlink = Clive Stace |title = New Flora of the British Isles | publisher =Cambridge University Press | page = 532 | year = 1997| isbn = 0-521-65315-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henkel-1911-p30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henkel, Alice|chapter=Jimson weed|title=American Medicinal Leaves and Herbs|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1911|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maud-desc"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grieve, Maud|title=A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs, &amp; Trees with All Their Modern Scientific Uses, Volume 2|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=978-0-486-22799-3|page=804|url=https://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/t/thorna12.html#des}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[root]] is long, thick, fibrous, and white. The [[Plant stem|stem]] is stout, erect, leafy, smooth, and pale yellow-green to reddish purple in color. The stem forks off repeatedly into branches, and each fork forms a leaf and a single, erect flower.&lt;ref name="maud-desc" /&gt;

The leaves are about {{convert|3|to(-)|8|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, smooth, toothed,&lt;ref name="Henkel-1911-p30" /&gt; soft, and irregularly undulated.&lt;ref name="maud-desc" /&gt; The upper surface of the leaves is a darker green, and the bottom is a light green.&lt;ref name="Henkel-1911-p30" /&gt; The leaves have a bitter and nauseating taste, which is imparted to extracts of the herb, and remains even after the leaves have been dried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grieve, Maud|title=A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs, &amp; Trees with All Their Modern Scientific Uses, Volume 2|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=978-0-486-22799-3|page=805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgfHxvGFHAoC&amp;pg=PA805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Datura stramonium'' generally flowers throughout the summer. The fragrant flowers are trumpet-shaped, white to creamy or violet, and {{convert|2+1/2|to(-)|3+1/2|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, and grow on short stems from either the [[axils]] of the leaves or the places where the branches fork. The [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] is long and tubular, swollen at the bottom, and sharply angled, surmounted by five sharp teeth. The [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], which is folded and only partially open, is white, funnel-shaped, and has prominent ribs. The flowers open at night, emitting a pleasant fragrance, and are fed upon by nocturnal [[moths]].&lt;ref name="maud-desc" /&gt;

The egg-shaped seed [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] is {{convert|1|to(-)|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter and either covered with spines or bald. At maturity, it splits into four chambers, each with dozens of small, black seeds.&lt;ref name="maud-desc" /&gt;

== Range and habitat ==
''Datura stramonium'' is native to [[North America]], but was spread to the Old World early.&lt;!-- .{{bywhom|date=October 2014}} --&gt;  It was scientifically described and named by Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753, although it had been described a century earlier by [[botany|botanists]] such as [[Nicholas Culpeper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Culpeper | first = Nicholas | title = Culpeper's Complete Herbal | publisher = W Foulsham &amp; Co Ltd | location = Slough | pages = 368–369 | date = 1653 | isbn = 0-572-00203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it grows wild in all the world's warm and moderate regions, where it is found along roadsides and at dung-rich livestock enclosures.&lt;ref name="Preissel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veblen|first=K.E.|title=Savanna glade hotspots: Plant community development and synergy with large herbivores|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|year=2012|volume=78|pages=119–127|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oudhia P., Tripathi R.S.(1998).Allelopathic potential of Datura stramonium L.. Crop. Res. 16 (1) : 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, it is found as a weed on wastelands and in garbage dumps.&lt;ref name="Preissel"&gt;{{Cite book| authors = Preissel, Ulrike &amp; Hans-Georg Preissel | title = Brugmansia and Datura: Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2002 | pages = 124–125 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fRlIAAAAYAAJ| isbn = 1-55209-598-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seed is thought {{by whom|date=October 2014}} to be carried by birds and spread in their droppings. Its seeds can lie dormant underground for years and germinate when the soil is disturbed.  The [[Royal Horticultural Society]] has advised worried gardeners to dig it up or have it otherwise removed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hortweek.com/deadly-harry-potter-plant-devils-snare-turns-suffolk-pensioners-garden/landscape/article/925855|title=Deadly Harry Potter plant devil's snare turns up in Suffolk pensioner's garden|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while wearing gloves to handle it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawlishnewspapers.co.uk/article.cfm?id=279&amp;headline=There's%20a%20devil%20in%20my%20garden...&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2009|title=There's a devil in my garden...|work=Dawlish Newspapers|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicity ==

All parts of ''Datura'' plants contain dangerous levels of the [[tropane alkaloids]] [[atropine]], [[hyoscyamine]], and [[scopolamine]], which are classified as [[deliriant]]s, or [[anticholinergic]]s. The risk of fatal [[overdose]] is high among uninformed users, and many hospitalizations occur amongst recreational users who ingest the plant for its [[psychoactive]] effects.&lt;ref name="Preissel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini,''Drugs of Abuse--Second Edition''. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Corporation, pp.48-51.  {{ISBN|1-57066-053-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of toxins varies widely from plant to plant. As much as a 5:1 variation can be found between plants, and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Preissel" /&gt; Additionally, within a given datura plant, toxin concentration varies by part and even from leaf to leaf. When the plant is younger, the ratio of [[scopolamine]] to [[atropine]] is about 3:1; after flowering, this ratio is reversed, with the amount of [[scopolamine]] continuing to decrease as the plant gets older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nellis, David W.|title=Poisonous Plants and Animals of Florida and the Caribbean|publisher=Pineapple Press|year=1997|isbn=978-1-56164-111-6|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8xJE2NfQpIC&amp;pg=PA237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'' was critical to minimize harm.&lt;ref name="Preissel" /&gt; An individual datura seed contains about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg of atropine, and the approximate fatal dose for adult humans is &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mg atropine or &gt;2–4&amp;nbsp;mg scopolamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnett AM|title=Jimson Weed (Datura stramonium) poisoning |work=Clinical Toxicology Review |date=December 1995 |volume=18 |issue=3 |url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura_info5.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Datura'' intoxication typically produces [[delirium]], [[hallucination]], [[hyperthermia]], [[tachycardia]], bizarre behavior, and severe [[mydriasis]] with resultant painful [[photophobia]] that can last several days. Pronounced [[amnesia]] is another commonly reported effect.&lt;ref name="Freye"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Freye | first = Enno | title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs | publisher = Springer Netherlands | date = 21 September 2009 | location = | pages = 217–218 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u42k03r4v3234615/ | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of symptoms generally occurs around 30 to 60 minutes after ingesting the herb. These symptoms generally last from 24 to 48 hours, but have been reported in some cases to last as long as two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Pennachio, Marcello|title=Uses and Abuses of Plant-Derived Smoke: Its Ethnobotany As Hallucinogen, Perfume, Incense, and Medicine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-537001-0|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pr9fgQIr5LkC&amp;pg=PA7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other cases of [[anticholinergic]] poisoning, [[intravenous]] [[physostigmine]] can be administered in severe cases as an [[antidote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Goldfrank, Lewis R.  |author2=Flommenbaum, Neil|title=Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147914-1|page=677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvJuLqBxGUcC&amp;pg=PA677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ayurveda]], datura has long been used for [[asthma]] symptoms. The active agent is [[atropine]]. The leaves are generally smoked either in a [[cigarette]] or a [[smoking pipe|pipe]]. During the late 18th century, James Anderson, the English Physician General of the [[East India Company]], learned of the practice and popularized it in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barceloux, Donald G.|chapter=Cascara|title=Medical Toxicology of Natural Substances: Foods, Fungi, Medicinal Herbs, Plants, and Venomous Animals|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-1-118-38276-9|page=1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTTBPedwFfAC&amp;pg=PT1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pennachio-2010-p6"&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Pennachio, Marcello|title=Uses and Abuses of Plant-Derived Smoke: Its Ethnobotany As Hallucinogen, Perfume, Incense, and Medicine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-537001-0|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pr9fgQIr5LkC&amp;pg=PA6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Gerard]]'s ''Herball'' (1597) states,
{{quote|[T]he juice of Thornapple, boiled with hog's grease, cureth all inflammations whatsoever, all manner of burnings and scaldings, as well of fire, water, boiling lead, gunpowder, as that which comes by lightning and that in very short time, as myself have found in daily practice, to my great credit and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs, &amp; Trees with All Their Modern Scientific Uses, Volume 2|author=Grieve, Maud|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

William Lewis reported in the late 18th century that the juice could be made into "a very powerful remedy in various [[convulsive]] and [[spasmodic]] disorders, [[epilepsy]] and [[mania]]," and was also "found to give ease in external inflammations and [[haemorrhoids]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lewis (scientist)|William Lewis]], [https://chestofbooks.com/health/materia-medica-drugs/Experimental-History-Materia-Medica/Stramonium.html "An Experimental History Of The Materia Medica: Stramonium"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, [[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|''The Serpent and the Rainbow'']], [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]] identified ''D. stramonium'', called "zombi cucumber" in [[Haiti]], as a central ingredient of the concoction [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] priests use to create [[zombie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clairvius Narcisse]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;

The common name "datura" has its origins in [[India]], where the sister species [[Datura metel]] is considered particularly sacred — believed to be a favorite of [[Shiva]] in [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;name="Pennachio-2010-p6"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
Datura prefers rich, [[calcareous]] soil. Adding [[nitrogen fertilizer]] to the soil will increase the concentration of [[alkaloid]]s present in the plant. Datura can be grown from seed, which is sown with several feet between plants. Datura is sensitive to frost, so should be sheltered during cold weather. The plant is harvested when the fruits are ripe, but still green. To harvest, the entire plant is cut down, the leaves are stripped from the plant, and everything is left to dry. When the fruits begin to burst open, the seeds are harvested. For intensive plantations, leaf yields of {{convert|1100|to|1700|kg/ha|lb/acre|-2}} and seed yields of {{convert|780|kg/ha|abbr=on}} are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chopra, I.C.|title=Indigenous Drugs of India|publisher=Academic Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9788185086804|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HyC4-GJ50YC&amp;pg=PA134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The genus name is derived from the plant's [[Hindi]] name धतूरा ''dhatūra'', ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] धत्तूर ''{{IAST|dhattūra}}'' 'white thorn-apple'.&lt;ref name="MWSD"&gt;{{MWSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stramonium'' is originally from Greek {{lang|grc|[[strychnos|στρύχνος]]}} "nightshade" and {{lang|grc|μανιακός}} "mad".&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/jimsonweed/jimsonweed.html |accessdate=2010-02-12 |title=Datura species |work=Plants Poisonous to Livestock |publisher=Cornell University Department of Animal Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the plant is called "jimsonweed", or more rarely "Jamestown weed"; it got this name from the town of [[Jamestown, Virginia]], where British soldiers consumed it while attempting to suppress [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. They spent 11 days in altered mental states:
{{quote|The James-Town Weed (which resembles the Thorny Apple of Peru, and I take to be the plant so call'd) is supposed to be one of the greatest coolers in the world. This being an early plant, was gather'd very young for a boil'd salad, by some of the soldiers sent thither to quell the rebellion of Bacon (1676); and some of them ate plentifully of it, the effect of which was a very pleasant comedy, for they turned natural fools upon it for several days: one would blow up a feather in the air; another would dart straws at it with much fury; and another, stark naked, was sitting up in a corner like a monkey, grinning and making mows [grimaces] at them; a fourth would fondly kiss and paw his companions, and sneer in their faces with a countenance more antic than any in a Dutch droll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this frantic condition they were confined, lest they should, in their folly, destroy themselves—though it was observed that all their actions were full of innocence and good nature. Indeed, they were not very cleanly; for they would have wallowed in their own excrements, if they had not been prevented. A thousand such simple tricks they played, and after eleven days returned themselves again, not remembering anything that had passed.|[[Robert Beverley, Jr.]], ''The History and Present State of Virginia, Book II: Of the Natural Product and Conveniencies in Its Unimprov'd State, Before the English Went Thither'', 1705&lt;ref name="Beverley"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Robert | last=Beverley | authorlink= Robert Beverley, Jr. | title=Book II: Of the Natural Product and Conveniencies in Its Unimprov'd State, Before the English Went Thither | date= | publisher=University of North Carolina | url =http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/beverley/beverley.html | work =The History and Present State of Virginia, In Four Parts | page = 24 (Book II) | accessdate = 2008-12-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Dawson College shooting''' occurred on September 13, 2006 at [[Dawson College]], a [[CEGEP]] located in  [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]] [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The perpetrator, [[Kimveer Gill]], began shooting outside the [[de Maisonneuve Boulevard]] entrance to the school, and moved towards the atrium by the cafeteria on the main floor.&lt;ref name="toronto_daily_1"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Montreal Killer Was a Death-Obsessed Goth | work = Toronto Daily News | date = 2006-09-14 | url = http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.php/WorldNews/2006091420montreal-gunman | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316090826/http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.php/WorldNews/2006091420montreal-gunman | archivedate = 2008-03-16 | accessdate = 2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gunman opens fire at Dawson College |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |date=2006-09-13 |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=6332c17e-c92a-4427-a98d-4678301674e3 |accessdate=2006-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021021906/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=6332c17e-c92a-4427-a98d-4678301674e3 |archivedate=2006-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One victim died at the scene, while another 19 were injured, eight of whom were listed in critical condition, with six requiring surgery.&lt;ref name="SPVM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Press Release|work=Service de police de la ville de Montréal|date=September 13, 2006&lt;!-- 11:21pm EDT--&gt;|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/fr/documentation/3_1_2_communiques.asp?nocomm=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 7-Gunman kills one, wounds 19 at Montreal college|work=[[Reuters]]|date=September 13, 2006&lt;!-- 7:23pm EDT--&gt;|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlebusiness.aspx?type=tnBusinessNews&amp;storyID=nN13394701|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204004211/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlebusiness.aspx?type=tnBusinessNews&amp;storyID=nN13394701|archivedate=2008-02-04|accessdate=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman, gunman dead in Montreal school rampage|work=[[CBC News]]|date=2006-09-13|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/13/shots-dawson.html|accessdate=2006-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooter later committed [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head, after being shot in the arm by a police officer.&lt;ref name="cbc-autopsy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Montreal gunman killed himself: autopsy|work=[[CBC News|CBC]]|date =2006-09-14 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/14/qc-dawsoninvestigation.html|accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third fatal [[school massacre|school shooting]] in Montreal, after the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] in 1989 and the [[Concordia University massacre|shooting spree]] at [[Concordia University]] in 1992.

At 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], Gill parked his car on de Maisonneuve Boulevard near the college campus and was seen removing weapons from his trunk by bystanders. Gill briefly took a passerby hostage and forced him to carry a bag containing a fourth gun and additional ammunition. Gill opened fire at students outside on the steps of Dawson College at its rear entrance with a [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] carbine, and the passerby fled the melee, leaving Gill's bag.&lt;ref name="lcn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/regional/archives/2006/09/20060915-200401.html |title=Le geste de Kimveer Gill était prémédité |accessdate=2007-08-06| author= |date=2006-09-15|publisher=LCN|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill then entered the school and made his way to the cafeteria, almost directly ahead of the school entrance. He positioned himself in the corner of the building, near the microwave oven, and set his bag on the floor. He loaded a pistol, fired a shot into the floor and then shot students who were standing in front of him. He then raised his weapon and ordered the remaining students to lie down on the floor. He continued shooting at students until confronted by two police officers who had been visiting the school at the time regarding an unrelated incident. The police officers entered after hearing the gunfire, and rushed to the cafeteria. Additional police officers surrounded the campus. Confronted by police officers in the school cafeteria, Gill briefly took two more people hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/regional/archives/2006/09/20060914-221128.html |title=Le drame minute par minute  |accessdate=2007-08-05| author= |date=2006-09-14|publisher=LCN|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was shot in the arm by police officer Denis Côté and then committed suicide via a gunshot wound to the head at 12:48 EDT.&lt;ref name="cbc-autopsy" /&gt; The police officers attempted to resuscitate him, but failed. At 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., police officers dragged his body outside the building, covered it with a yellow bag, then continued the evacuation and the search for possible accomplices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Couvrette|first=Phil|title=Montreal Shooting Rampage Kills Student|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2006-09-13&lt;!-- EDT --&gt;|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/ap/2006/09/13/ap3015809.html|accessdate=2006-09-14}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunman in Montreal College shooting called himself 'angel of death'|work=[[CBC News|CBC]]|date=14 September 2006&lt;!-- 07:06:28 EDT--&gt;|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/14/gunman-shooting.html|accessdate=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authorities concluded the attack was premeditated, after a short [[suicide note]] was found on Gill's body during the autopsy.&lt;ref name="lcn2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/regional/archives/2006/09/20060915-165141.html |title=Anastasia De Sousa a reçu neuf balles  |accessdate=2007-08-05| author= |date=2006-09-15|publisher=LCN|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immediate aftermath ===
{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--two longest paragraphs have no references--&gt;
Police cordoned off the campus area with orange police tape and swept the school for students left inside.&lt;ref name="CanWest"&gt;

Students and faculty were evacuated from the campus or left the vicinity of the shooting.

Two shopping centres adjacent to Dawson, [[Place Alexis Nihon]] and [[Westmount Square]], directly linked to the [[Atwater (Montreal Metro)|Atwater metro station]], were evacuated and [[Line 1 Green (Montreal Metro)|the green line]] of the Montreal Metro was shut down for several hours between [[Lionel-Groulx (Montreal Metro)|Lionel-Groulx]] and [[McGill (Montreal Metro)|McGill]].&lt;ref name="cyberpresse"&gt;{{cite news|title=La fusillade a fait deux morts et 19 blessés |work=[[Canadian Press]] |publisher=cyberpresse.ca ([[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]]) |language=French |date=2006-09-13 |url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20060913/CPFRONTPAGE/60913099/5032/CPACTUALITES |accessdate=2006-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006140323/http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20060913/CPFRONTPAGE/60913099/5032/CPACTUALITES |archivedate=October 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pepsi Forum]] entertainment centre, opposite the eastern corner of Dawson, was open when many of the students came running into the premises to seek refuge moments after the shooting began. Shortly afterward, the Pepsi Forum went into lockdown under the directives of the Montreal Police. Eventually, one of the Forum's entrances onto St. Catherine Street re-opened under police/security guard to allow monitored access and egress.

A large number of the evacuees were also directed to the nearby [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]], where the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is located. The CSU cancelled all remaining Orientation activities, and instead used its venues to temporarily shelter the evacuated Dawson students and provide them with food, water, blankets, and phones to reach other loved ones. A coordination team was put in place from the CSU and the DSU used the Sir George Williams campus as a temporary crisis centre and offered counselling (psychologist, psychiatrist) to traumatized students and staff. [[Claude Dauphin (politician)|Claude Dauphin]] (Mayor of the borough of Lachine and Vice-President of the City of Montreal executive committee) had a very close relationship with both of the student unions during the night of the events; Dauphin went to the CSU office's the night of the shooting to meet with both unions to inform them of what the city was doing, and to ask how he could help.

The police also established several phone numbers for parents and friends of the students.&lt;ref name="mps-press2"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Shooting at Dawson College: preliminary statement (press release 2)|publisher=[[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal|Montreal Police Service]]|date=2006-09-13|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/EN/documentation/3_1_2_communiques.asp?noComm=387|accessdate=2006-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police reported that they needed a few days to process the crime scene. As a result, officials from Dawson College stated that the school would be closed until Monday, September 18, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dimanno|first=Rosie|title=Mayhem and murder on Montreal campus, again|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2006-09-14&lt;!-- EDT --&gt;|url=https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1158184238766&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;col=968793972154|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152915/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1158184238766&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;col=968793972154|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-29|accessdate=2006-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; scheduled to open its doors at 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and remain open until 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and have an "Open House" feel to the day. Classes were scheduled to resume as usual on Tuesday, September 19, 2006.

During a police search at Gill's home, an apology note to his family was found. In addition, police seized [[firearm]] accessories including holsters and manuals, including those of [[Beretta CX4 Storm|the firearm]] he used during attack; they also found a letter praising the actions of [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine shooters]] [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Details of Kimveer Gill's apology note revealed | url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070320/gill_note_070320/20070320/ | date = 2007-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firearms===
Gill was armed with a [[carbine]] [[rifle]],&lt;ref&gt;Firearms Reference Table, Policing Support Services, Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Version 4.2 Canadian February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Glock]] [[pistol]], and a [[shotgun]]. He fired sixty shots, ten of which were fired outside the school. With the exception of five shots from his pistol, including the one to kill himself, all the shots came from the rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gun club opened door to Gill, Fabrikant|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|date=2006-09-15|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=1d0f80b2-abf1-456b-bc09-3392d71ecb4b|accessdate=2006-09-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103113915/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=1d0f80b2-abf1-456b-bc09-3392d71ecb4b|archivedate=2007-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports of an additional firearm in a bag that he forced a hostage to bring along as he arrived near the campus site. According to TVA's crime reporter [[Claude Poirier]], Gill briefly held a lawyer hostage and demanded that he bring the bag containing the fourth gun and additional [[ammunition]]. When the first shots were fired and police arrived, the lawyer fled the scene and hid Gill's bag.&lt;ref name="lcn"/&gt;

Gill had a restricted firearm license. His firearms were registered with the [[Canadian gun registry]]. The transportation, storage, and use of his firearms in the incident were not legal as per [[Gun politics in Canada]], despite the acquisition and possession being legal.

{{Main|Kimveer Gill}}

Gill was a 25-year-old Canadian born in [[Lachine, Quebec]], Canada. His parents were of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] descent, and moved to [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec]] from India in early 1981.&lt;ref name="who was"&gt;Montreal Gazette, Sue Montgomerey [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=b80740cf-e43e-411d-a131-b07ebaa8335b "Who was Kimveer Gill?" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034421/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=b80740cf-e43e-411d-a131-b07ebaa8335b |date=2014-08-16 }} /www.Canada.com/montrealgazette&lt;/ref&gt;  The family later settled in the [[Fabreville]] area of Laval, Quebec in 1987. Kimveer attended Twin Oaks Elementary School in Laval from 1988 to 1993.

Gill later attended [[Rosemere High School]], where he was remembered by teachers as quiet and unassuming. Despite early media reports, he performed well academically, and most students remember him as having friends and certainly never being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=d1933b65-8a0c-454f-bff0-9e072f8918b5&amp;p=1|title=Who Was Kimveer Gill?

He enrolled in [[Vanier College]] with his friend Steven Kulczycki after graduation; however, he dropped out in January 1999.

Gill briefly received military training from the [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]], from January 17 to February 16, 1999. He had told his friends he wished to eventually become a [[mercenary]]. He did not complete his basic training for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt;  He was deemed unsuitable for military service and was voluntarily discharged before receiving extensive weapons training.

Gill was a member of a rifle club and visited the Ville Saint-Pierre facility the day prior to the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2006/09/16/les-parents-du-tireur-se-confient|title=Les parents du tireur se confient|work=TVA Nouvelles|date=16 September 2006|accessdate=21 March 2016|language=fr}}

== Response ==

=== Students and faculty ===
Some student leaders criticized the immediate response of the Dawson College administration. ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' reported that "if it hadn't been for help from the Student Union at nearby Concordia University... many of the Dawson students would have had no one to turn to for help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/daily/2006/09/2006091502n.htm |title=A Day After Rampage at Montreal College, Dark Details of the Gunman Emerge |accessdate=2006-08-25 |last=Payne |first=Doug |date=2006-09-15 |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606071710/http://chronicle.com/daily/2006/09/2006091502n.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Site requires that you be subscribed.

Dawson's director-general Richard Filion called the student charges harsh.
"We did our best to evacuate the building. We were in a state of shock. We were scattered everywhere around the city," Filion said, noting many staff members were out on lunch break.
Dawson does have an emergency plan, he said, but it was designed with fire safety in mind.&lt;ref&gt;PEGGY CURRAN, MARISSA LAROUCHE-SMART and BRENDA BRANSWELL.

Filion announced that staff and faculty would return to the College on Friday, September 15, and that classes would resume on Tuesday, September 19, 2006. The school invited all students to join them on Monday, September 18, 2006 to meet with staff and faculty for information and support, as well as to retrieve belongings that had been left behind. It was announced that grief counseling and support services would be available on an ongoing basis.

In addition, one of the victims, 18-year-old Hayder Kadhim, who received two bullet wounds to the head and neck, challenged Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] to a gun control debate in a public speech on CBC in response to the shooting.&lt;ref name="cbc_ca_1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2006/11/01/kadhim-guncontrolcampaign.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103043403/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2006/11/01/kadhim-guncontrolcampaign.html|title=Dawson shooting victim launches national gun control campaign|archivedate=3 November 2006|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2006-11-01| date = 1 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complaints about media coverage ===

====Jan Wong controversy====
An immediate controversy arose about an article regarding the Dawson shootings by journalist [[Jan Wong]], of the [[Toronto|Toronto-based]] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Three days after the event, Wong, who was born and raised in Montreal and is the daughter of [[China|Chinese]] immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled ''Get under the desk'', in which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the [[École Polytechnique massacre|École Polytechnique]], the [[Concordia University massacre|Concordia University]] and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of Quebec society under its protective [[Charter of the French Language|language laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060916.SHOOTMAIN16/TPStory/TPNational/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070313143539/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060916.SHOOTMAIN16/TPStory/TPNational/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-03-13 |title=Get under the desk  |accessdate=2007-08-05| author=Jan Wong |date=2006-09-16|publisher=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong suggested the fact that the three perpetrators were not old-stock French Quebecers (the shooters were Algerian, Belarusian, and Indian in descent) was related to their murderous actions since, she claimed, they were alienated from a Quebec society concerned with "[[racial purity]]." Accused of "[[Quebec bashing]]," Wong's writing soon created public outcry in Quebec and political condemnation. Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] called the article a "disgrace", stating that it "betrays an ignorance of Canadian values and a profound misunderstanding of Québec."&lt;ref name="wongcharest"&gt;{{cite news

Wong's writing followed the comments of Professor [[Elliott Leyton]], a [[Anthropology|social-anthropologist]] who is a widely consulted expert on [[Serial killer|serial homicide]].&lt;ref name="Professor Elliott Leyton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1123592030758_54 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050811010344/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1123592030758_54 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-08-11 |title=''Looking into the minds of serial murderers '' |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2005-09-09 |publisher=CTV NEWS |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Interviewed by [[CBC Newsworld]] on September 14, 2006 about the Dawson College shooting, Leyton stated that because all three such murderous rampages in [[Quebec]] involved a killer who was either an [[immigrant]] or a child of immigrants, it warranted an examination of government and societal attitudes.

====Broadcast Code violation====
In 2007, the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] faulted [[CKNW (AM)|CKNW]], a radio station in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] for airing "potentially dangerous information" during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had [[simulcast]] content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content could have told the gunman where the students were. The council said that as a result of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megadeth===
Gill mentioned the song "[[À Tout le Monde]]" by the [[thrash metal]] band [[Megadeth]] on his blog on VampireFreaks.com on the day of the shooting. Megadeth was blamed for the shooting by many news outlets and watchdog groups as a result.

Later in 2006, Megadeth performed live in Montreal, and responded to the blame that had been placed on the band and their music as a result. Band leader [[Dave Mustaine]] told the crowd:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The guy who went to Dawson College and shot everyone, it's terrible. Aside from the fact that what he did was wrong, we have a relationship with Montreal, and that really pissed us off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Before the concert in an interview for CBC News Mustaine said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I was so angry that this guy would use my song, and that he would try and turn that beautiful song into something ugly and nasty. It's for those who lost their lives, and it's a gift to those who are in the process of healing (...) and Gill was not worthy of being a Megadeth fan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2006/09/29/megadeth-criticize-fan-who-shot-up-dawson-college/|title=Megadeth Criticize Fan Who Shot Up Dawson College|author=|date=|work=Chart Attack|access-date=2013-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001732/http://www.chartattack.com/news/2006/09/29/megadeth-criticize-fan-who-shot-up-dawson-college/|archive-date=2013-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the ninth mass killing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/20/artsfeatures1|title=Natural born copycats|author=Xan Brooks|date=|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; to implicate the movie ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', per the gunman's blog at vampirefreaks.com, which he called one of his favourites. At some point prior to September 20, 2006, the blog was deleted.

==Long-term effects==
A follow-up study conducted by the McGill University Health Centre Research Institute found that 30% of Dawson students at the time of the shooting suffered mental health consequences including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], major [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[alcohol dependence]], and [[social phobia]], a level twice that found in the general population. Approximately 18% of respondents developed a mental health disorder despite never having had one before.&lt;ref&gt;Branswell, Brenda.

'''Footsteps''' is a not-for-profit organization based in [[New York City]] that provides educational, vocational, and social support to people who have left or want to [[Yetzia bish'eila|leave an ultra-Orthodox]] or [[Orthodox Jewish]] community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ari Shapiro]]. [https://www.npr.org/2011/08/08/139220021/leaving-the-fold Young Ultra-Orthodox Jews Struggle Against Tradition], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', August 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
According to its website, Footsteps provides educational, vocational, professional, social, and legal support to those seeking to enter or explore the world beyond the insular ultra-religious communities in which they were raised. Some people from the ultra-orthodox and Chasidic communities who choose to enter mainstream America may feel like cultural immigrants. They may face cultural disorientation and isolation coupled with a lack of practical and marketable skills. Founded in December 2003, Footsteps aims to assist individuals who choose to make this difficult transition. Individuals frequently refer to themselves as “[[off the derech]]”, or OTD, reclaiming the dismissive term given to leavers by members of the orthodox communities they have left.&lt;ref name="newyorker2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavin|first1=Talia|title=Off the Path of Orthodoxy|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/off-the-path-of-orthodoxy|website=New Yorker|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt2017/&gt;

== History ==
Footsteps was founded in December, 2003, by Malkie Schwartz, a former [[Chabad]] Hasid from [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], while enrolled as a student at [[Hunter College]] in New York City. According to Schwartz, 20 people showed up to the first meeting, announced on flyers around the Hunter campus and through word of mouth.&lt;ref name="unp"&gt;Orli Santo. [http://www.unpious.com/2010/08/the-departed/ The Departed], ''Unpious.com'', August 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Footsteps began as an informal social group and soon developed an [[General Educational Development|educational study]] group and a [[Sex education in the United States|sex education]] and relationships group, members finding they had been denied access to basic sex education instruction within the ultra-orthodox community. 

As the organization grew it became a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c) non profit]] with a broad remit of support and education for ex-ultra orthodox Jewish individuals and their families.&lt;ref name="nyt2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brodesser-Akner|first1=Taffy|authorlink=Taffy Brodesser-Akner|title=The High Price of Leaving Ultra-Orthodox Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/magazine/the-high-price-of-leaving-ultra-orthodox-life.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footsteps can also provide counseling and has partnered with [[New York Legal Assistance Group]] to provide legal assistance and advice in divorce and custody cases.&lt;ref name=jw2017/&gt;

As of summer 2015 Footsteps has a permanent staff of 10, a membership of over 1000 and an annual budget in excess of $1 million.&lt;ref name="jw2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Amy Sara|title=Lani Santo, 35|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/lani-santo-35/|website=Jewish Week|publisher=Times of Israel|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current director is Lani Santo.&lt;ref name=newyorker2017/&gt; The organization's program director is [[Chani Getter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/nyregion/orthodox-jewish-divorce-custody-ny.html|title=When Living Your Truth Can Mean Losing Your Children|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/formerly-orthodox-and-struggling-for-parental-rights-1407810872|title=Formerly Orthodox, and Struggling for Parental Rights|first=Melanie Grayce|last=West|date=12 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gay Block''' (born 1942) is a [[fine art]] [[portrait]] [[photographer]], who was born in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2013/BABA "Gay Block "Love: South Beach in the 80's"], NY Art Beat. Retrieved 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is shown in books, and is collected by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], the [[El Paso Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =  http://www.gayblock.com/exhib.html|title = Gay Block CV|date = |accessdate = 13 March 2015|website = Gay Block|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam.nmartmuseum.org/view/objects/asimages/People$00404124?t:state:flow=b238d1c4-ae31-46d9-9674-313a8f9d97b2|publisher=New Mexico Museum of Art|accessdate=27 December 2013|title = SAM: Searchable Art Museum|date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Block had been interested in photography since she was a pre-teen, when she started taking pictures of her friends and family using a [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]] box camera.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Texas 100: Selections from the El Paso Museum of Art|last = |first = |publisher = El Paso Museum of Art Foundation|year = 2006|isbn = 0978538307|location = El Paso, Texas|pages = 23|editor-last = Dura|editor-first = Lucia}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalls that she enjoyed taking candid photos and collaborating with her subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.gayblock.com/the.html|title = The Universe of Gay Block|last = Block|first = Gay|date = October 2003|journal = THE Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s she began taking pictures of members of her own affluent [[Jewish]] community in Houston.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She later photographed an older Jewish Community of [[retirees]] in [[South Beach|South Miami Beach]], many of whom were [[Holocaust survivor]]s. Block also photographed girls at [[summer camp]]. In 2006, Block re-photographed women who were the girls in her 1981 series from Camp Pinecliffe, twenty-five years earlier.

Block collaborated with author, Rabbi [[Malka Drucker]], and created ''Rescuers: Portraits of Moral Courage in the Holocaust'', both a book and traveling exhibit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Block and Drucker traveled to eleven countries and photographed over 100 [[Christian]]s who had helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exhibit has been seen in over fifty venues in the US and abroad, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|NY]], in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/1992|title = MoMA Exhibitions|date = 2002|accessdate = 13 March 2015|website = Museum of Modern Art|publisher = |last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030220000742/http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/1992/|archivedate = 20 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Block's 30-year series of portraits of her mother, in photographs, video, and words, ''Bertha Alyce: Mother exPosed'', was published by [[University of New Mexico Press]] and continues as a traveling exhibit. The book, ''Bertha Alyce'',  was cited as one of "Twelve Great Books Published During The Year 2003" by the editors of RALPH (The Review of Arts, Literature, Politics, and the Humanities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ralphmag.org/CM/dozen-best.html|title = Twelve Great Books Published During the Year 2003|last = |first = |date = 2004|journal = RALPH: The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 March 2015|issue = 109|editor-last = Lark|editor-first = Lolita}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her video of the material, "Bertha Alyce", was awarded People's Choice and Best Documentary by the Madrid International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival, [[Spain]]. The photographs of Bertha Alyce are not considered a conventional representation of a mother/daughter relationship; instead Block's relationship with her mother is unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=12377709&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Gay Block at University of New Mexico Art Museum|last = Reed|first = Arden|date = March 2004|journal = Art in America|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 March 2015|volume = 92|issue = 3|page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block's documentary technique is considered by the critic to be "assured, if reminiscent of Duane Michaels or [[Nan Goldin]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''The Great Hymn to the Aten''' is the longest of one of a number of hymn-poems written to the [[solar deity|sun-disk]] deity [[Aten]]. Composed in the middle of the 14th century BC, it is attributed to the [[18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], who radically changed traditional forms of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] by replacing them with [[Atenism]].

The hymn-poem provides a glimpse of the religious artistry of the [[Atenism|Amarna period]] expressed in multiple forms encompassing literature, new temples, and in the building of a whole new city at the site of present-day Amarna as the capital of Egypt. Egyptologist [[Toby Wilkinson]] said that "It has been called 'one of the most significant and splendid pieces of poetry to survive from the pre-Homeric world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Toby|title=The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1408810026|pages=289–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptologist John Darnell asserts that the hymn was sung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnell&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/archaeology/f.johndarnell.html]|first=John|title=Tutankhamun's Armies: Battle and Conquest During Ancient Egypt's Late Eighteenth Dynasty|isbn=978-0471743583|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various courtiers' [[rock-cut architecture|rock tombs]] at [[Amarna]] (ancient Akhet-Aten, the city Akhenaten founded) have similar prayers or hymns to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] Aten or to the Aten and [[Akhenaten]] jointly. One of these, found in almost identical form in five tombs, is known as ''The Short Hymn to the Aten''. The long version discussed in this article was found in the [[Southern Tomb 25|tomb]] of the courtier (and later Pharaoh) [[Ay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtheim|first=Miriam|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume II: The New Kingdom|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520248434|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[18th dynasty]] Pharaoh Akhenaten forbade the worship of other gods, a radical departure from the centuries of Egyptian religious practice. Finally, Akhenaten issued a royal decree that the name Aten was no longer to be depicted by the hieroglyph of a solar disc emanating rays but instead had to be spelled out phonetically. Akhenaton's religious reforms (later regarded [[heretical]] and reverted under his successor [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]]) have been described by some scholars as [[Monotheism|monotheistic]], though others consider it to be [[Henotheism|henotheistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Douglas j.|title=Egypt and the Egyptians|year=2 edition (22 Feb 2007)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85150-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evudwvrKErEC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=elevation+of+the+king+and+his+queen+Nefertiti#v=onepage&amp;q=elevation%20of%20the%20king%20and%20his%20queen%20Nefertiti&amp;f=false|author2=Emily Teeter|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, the Trunk of the Tree.

==Excerpts of the hymn-poem to Aten==
From the middle of the text:
:''How manifold it is, what thou hast made!''
:''They are hidden from the face (of man).''
:''O sole god, like whom there is no other!''
:''Thou didst create the world according to thy desire,''
:''Whilst thou wert alone: All men, cattle, and wild beasts,''
:''Whatever is on earth, going upon (its) feet,''
:''And what is on high, flying with its wings.''

:''The countries of Syria and Nubia, the land of Egypt,''
:''Thou settest every man in his place,''
:''Thou suppliest their necessities:''
:''Everyone has his food, and his time of life is reckoned.''
:''Their tongues are separate in speech,''
:''And their natures as well;''
:''Their skins are distinguished,''
:''As thou distinguishest the foreign peoples.''
:''Thou makest a Nile in the underworld, ''
:''Thou bringest forth as thou desirest ''
:''To maintain the people (of Egypt)''
:''According as thou madest them for thyself,''
:''The lord of all of them, wearying (himself) with them,''
:''The lord of every land, rising for them,''
:''The Aton of the day, great of majesty.''&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, James B., ed., ''The Ancient Near East – Volume 1: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1958, pp. 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the last part of the text, translated by [[Miriam Lichtheim]]:
:''You are in my heart,''
:''There is no other who knows you,''
:''Only your son, [[Akhenaten|Neferkheprure, Sole-one-of-Re [Akhenaten]]],''
:''Whom you have taught your ways and your might.''
:''[Those on] earth come from your hand as you made them.''
:''When you have dawned they live.''
:''When you set they die;''
:''You yourself are lifetime, one lives by you.''
:''All eyes are on [your] beauty until you set.''
:''All labor ceases when you rest in the west;''
:''When you rise you stir [everyone] for the King,''
:''Every leg is on the move since you founded the earth.''
:''You rouse them for your son who came from your body.''
:''The King who lives by Maat, the Lord of the Two Lands,''
:''Neferkheprure, Sole-one-of-Re,''
:''The Son of Re who lives by Maat. the Lord of crowns,''
:''Akhenaten, great in his lifetime;''
:''(And) the great Queen whom he loves, the Lady of the Two Lands,''
:''Nefer-nefru-Aten Nefertiti, living forever.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtheim|first=Miriam|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume II: The New Kingdom|year=2nd Ref. Ed. 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520248434|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nS-7WUndel4C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=There+is+no+other+who+knows+you,+Only+your+son,+Neferkheprure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DMDLYjH0rb&amp;sig=dh-VhT8YvdFUP4Pppj2bhylFWSY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F3UnUIXsEceP0AXptoCoCg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=There%20is%20no%20other%20who%20knows%20you%2C%20Only%20your%20son%2C%20Neferkheprure&amp;f=false|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Analyses of the poem are divided between those considering it as a work of literature, and those considering its political and socio-religious intentions.

[[James Henry Breasted]] considered Akhenaten to be the first monotheist and scientist in history. In 1899, [[Flinders Petrie]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If this were a new religion, invented to satisfy our modern scientific conceptions, we could not find a flaw in the correctness of this view of the energy of the solar system.  How much Akhenaten understood, we cannot say, but he certainly bounded forward in his views and symbolism to a position which we cannot logically improve upon at the present day. Not a rag of superstition or of falsity can be found clinging to this new worship evolved out of the old Aton of Heliopolis, the sole Lord of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Flinders Petrie, ''History of Egypt'' (edit. 1899), Vol. II, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Miriam Lichtheim]] describes the hymn as "a beautiful statement of the doctrine of the One God.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtheim|first=Miriam|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume II: The New Kingdom|year=2nd Ref. Ed. 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520248434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|Henry Hall]] contended that the pharaoh was the "first example of the scientific mind."&lt;ref&gt;H. R. Hall, ''Ancient History of the Near East'' (1913), p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Reflections on the Psalms'', [[C.S. Lewis]] compared the Hymn to the [[Psalms]] of the Judaeo-Christian canon, as did Breasted (who broke them up into stanzas to resemble Western poems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montserrat|first=Dominic|title=Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415301862|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam Lichtheim commented about an alleged resemblance with [[Psalm 104]]&lt;!-- For comparison to Psalm 104, see Pritchard, James B. "The Ancient Near East, An anthology of Texts and Pictures", Princeton University Press, 1958, page 227. --&gt; saying that "The resemblances are, however, more likely to be the result of the generic similarity between Egyptian hymns and biblical psalms. A specific literary interdependence is not probable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtheim|first=Miriam|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume II: The New Kingdom|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520248434|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholar [[Mark S. Smith]] has commented that "Despite enduring support for the comparison of the two texts, enthusiasm for even indirect influence has been tempered in recent decades. In some quarters, the argument for any form of influence is simply rejected outright. Still some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, argue for Egyptian influence on both the [[Amarna correspondence]] (especially in EA 147) and on Psalm 104."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Mark S.|title=God in Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World|date=2010|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0802864338|page=70|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yvWlC0kUlkYC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=great+hymn+to+the+aten+psalm+104&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipybqFofrUAhXmIsAKHR5nByUQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=great%20hymn%20to%20the%20aten%20psalm%20104&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Egyptologist [[Dominic Montserrat]] discusses the terminology used to describe these texts, describing them as formal poems or royal eulogies. He views the word 'hymn' as suggesting "outpourings of emotion" while he sees them as "eulogies, formal and rhetorical statements of praise" honoring Aten and the royal couple. He credits [[James Henry Breasted]] with the popularisation of them as hymns saying that Breasted (erroneously) saw them as "a gospel of the beauty and beneficence of the natural order, a recognition of the message of nature to the soul of man"(quote from Breasted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montserrat|first=Dominic|title=Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415301862|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montserrat argues that all the versions of the hymns focus on the king and suggests that the real innovation is to redefine the relationship of god and king in a way that benefited Akhenaten, quoting the statement of Egyptologist [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]] that "Amarna religion was a religion of god and king, or even of king first and then god."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montserrat|first=Dominic|title=Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415301862|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amenhotep III: Perspectives on His Reign|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|author=John Baines|editors=David O'Connor, Eric Cline|page=281|chapter=The Dawn of the Amarna Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald B. Redford]] argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time had claimed the same relationship and priestly role. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as "thy son who came forth from thy limbs", "thy child", "the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc", and "thine only son that came forth from thy body".  The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of "his father", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers.  He is his father's image on earth and as Akhenaten is king on earth his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Since only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.&lt;ref name="redford"&gt;"The Monotheism of the Heretic Pharaoh: Precursor of Mosiac monotheism or Egyptian anomaly?", [[Donald B. Redford]], ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', May–June edition 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Redford concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a Christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away one by one as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development—one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death.&lt;ref&gt;"Aspects of Monotheism", Donald B. Redford, ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hathuwa Raj''' was a feudal estate belonging to [[Bhumihar]]s of Baghochia dynasty. It encompassed 1,365 villages, was inhabited by more than 391,000 people, and produced an annual rental of almost a million rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[Saran Division]] of [[Bihar]].Earlier seats of the Raj included Huseypur, Kalyanpur, Balchowra and Baghoch. The Kalyanpur chieftaincy was subjugated by the Mughal Emperor Akbar during late 16th century. The ruling dynasty has a history of over 2000 years and one of the deepest genealogy in India.

Sir Kishen Pratap Sahi Bahadur who was Bhumihar and [[Maharaja]] between 1874 to 1896 was an ascetic. Soon after his coronation, he set out on a pilgrimage to the shrines of [[Northern India]]. Later on he used to regularly go on traveling and pilgrimage, mostly in [[Benares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Due to its central location, Hathwa was the seat of the raja's residential palace and its nearby villages housed most of the key retainers of the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In addition to the estate ''Kachcheri'' (office), located in the Hathwa cluster of villages, were the estate manager's bungalow, the Diwan's house, the Hathwa Eden School, the post office, the Raj dispensary, the Durga medical hall and the temple called Gopal mandir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By the 1840s Hathwa was described as having large bazaars and bi-weekly markets. By the early nineteenth century, there were forts, palaces, and several temples constructed. An early twentieth-century account describes Hathwa as an impressive standard market, its shops offering a range of agricultural and consumer goods and its specialists providing a variety of services. The presence of schools and temples further accentuated its centrality in the locality. The estate collected ₹1400 annually as professional tax from traders stationed at Hathwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Ramallah woman 15029v.jpg|right|thumb|A woman from [[Ramallah]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in embroidered clothes, 1929–1946]]

'''Embroidery''' was [[Islamic art|an important art]] in the [[Islamic world]] from the beginning of [[Islam]] until the [[Industrial Revolution]] disrupted traditional ways of life.

==Overview==
[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fly mask]] embroidered with silver thread. [[Fez, Morocco]]. 18th–19th century]]

Early Islam took over societies where the [[embroidery]] of clothes for both sexes and other textiles was very popular. Both the [[Byzantine]] and Persian [[Sasanian]] empires used clothing embroidered with designs including rather large human figures as well as animals, with effects comparable to those of modern [[teeshirt]]s. The exterior of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] was already before Islam "covered on the outside with multi-coloured textile hangings",&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, 20&lt;/ref&gt; very likely including embroidery as their modern Islamic equivalents often have. [[Muhammad]] objected to animal designs, perhaps embroidered, he saw on cushions when visiting his wife [[Aisha]]'s house.{{efn|Aisha reported in a [[hadith]] "I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When [[Allah]]'s Apostle saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] have I committed?' Allah's Apostle said. "What is this cushion?" I said, "I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline on it." Allah's Apostle said, "The makers of these pictures will be punished on the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]], and it will be said to them, 'Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).' " The Prophet added, "The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals)." [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|318}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} These types of design largely disappeared under Islam, though plant-based motifs often remained acceptable. 

The 17th century [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] called embroidery the "craft of the two hands".&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; Because it was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it had long been widely popular. In cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]], embroidery was visible on handkerchiefs, uniforms, flags, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], shoes, robes, tunics, [[Horse tack|horse trappings]], slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on leather belts. Craftsmen embroidered items with [[gold]] and [[silver]] thread. Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.skill.of.the.two.hands.htm |publisher=Aramco World |title=The Skill of the Two Hands |author=Stone, Caroline| volume=58 |issue=3 |date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 16th century, in the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], his chronicler [[Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] wrote in the famous ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'':

[[File:18th century Ottoman barber apron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] barber's apron. Embroidery with silver and silk thread on wool. 18th century]]

{{quote|His majesty [Akbar] pays much attention to various stuffs; hence [[Iran]]i, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Mongolia]]n articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of ''Nakshi'', ''Saadi'', ''Chikhan'', ''Ari'', ''Zardozi'', ''Wastli'', ''Gota'' and ''Kohra''. The imperial workshops in the towns of [[Lahore]], [[Agra]], [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur]] and [[Ahmedabad]] turn out many masterpieces of workmanship in fabrics, and the figures and patterns, knots and variety of fashions which now prevail astonish even the most experienced travellers. Taste for fine material has since become general, and the drapery of embroidered fabrics used at feasts surpasses every description.&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Werner |first1=Louis |title=Mughal Maal |url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |publisher=Aramco World| volume=62 |issue=4 |date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Embroidery offered symbolic protection for the most highly valued objects, including babies, household possessions and things with religious significance. When in the 16th and 17th centuries in Turkey, men wore [[turban]]s as a sign of Islam, they placed their turbans under embroidered cloths.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

[[File:Turkish - Mirror Cover - Walters 83214 - Detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turkey|Turkish]] Mirror Cover with floral ornament based on Ottoman ceramics. A [[superstition]] warned against looking into a mirror at night. 18th century]]

A wide variety of embroidery techniques were used across the Islamic world, with an equally broad range of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 174–203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uyghurs|Uighur]] women embroider [[felt]] [[Taqiyah (cap)|skull caps]], for use on their own or as the base for a [[turban]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco and Tunisia, [[satin stitch]] was used for items such as decorative curtains and mirror covers.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; A form of satin stitch present in the [[Bedouin]] societies of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], sometimes referred to as ''khiyat al madrassa'' ("school embroidery"), was used for furnishings. Prior to the stitching process, a shape was drawn onto the fabric by a skilled artist. Designs incorporating natural themes such as birds or flowers were most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Saud|first=Abeer|title=Qatari Women: Past and Present|date=1984|isbn=978-0582783720|publisher=Longman Group|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface satin stitch, worked only on the upper surface, is a more economical but looser technique, vulnerable to wear, and so is mainly used for special occasions. In [[Punjab]], [[Phulkari]] (flower work) shawls were however daily wear for women in the countryside, while special ones, bagh, were completely covered with embroidery and were made by maternal grandmothers for their granddaughters' weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chain stitch]], which is adaptable and relatively easy to create, was used in Persia for [[Resht]] embroidery, with densely worked flowers and [[arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] on felted woollen cloths.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; A type of embroidery similar to heavy chain stitch, known as ''[[Kurar (embroidery)|kurar]]'', was previously used by Bedouin to create dresses for both men and women. It required four people, with each person carrying four threads which were either of varying colors or silver and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Saud|first=Abeer|title=Qatari Women: Past and Present|date=1984|isbn=978-0582783720|publisher=Longman Group|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Algerian - Turban Cover - Walters 83178.jpg|thumb|[[Algeria]]n [[turban]] cover. Silk embroidery on [[linen]]. 18th century]]

[[Cross stitch]] was used across the [[Middle East]] in [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], Palestine and [[Sinai]] to work wedding dresses with bold embroidery in red, with triangular [[amulet]]s or [[carnation]] flowers on a black background.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp.180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widely used technique, [[Herringbone stitch]], was used in [[Afghanistan]] to embroider [[bridegroom]]'s [[smock-frock|smock]]s with raised bands of red, green or white stitchery on a white background.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Couching]], the stitching of decorative cord on to the surface of a fabric, was used widely across the Islamic world. In Afghanistan, a [[velvet]] dress could be worked in military style with gold-coloured threads on the front, sleeves and hem. Chieftains in [[Montenegro]] could wear robes heavily couched in gold thread. In Palestine, dresses could be heavily worked in vertical panels with couched threads of metal and cotton. In Syria, jackets were couched with stylised flowers and trees. In the Northwest Frontier of [[Pakistan]], waistcoats were sewn with a combination of [[appliqué]] panels and couched metal [[braid]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Embroidery from Bukhara Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art 85.81.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Embroidered [[Suzani (textile)|Suzani]] from [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]. Cotton with silk threads. Late 19th century]]

In [[Central Asia]], Bokhara couching using continuous thread creates spectacular [[suzani (textile)|suzani]]s, hangings for wedding halls and bridal beds. Carnation and [[pomegranate]] motifs symbolised [[fertility]]. The technique was also used in Afghanistan and [[Uzbekistan]] for horse blankets and brazier covers.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blanket stitch]], [[buttonhole stitch]], and eyelet stitch all had the original function of strengthening the edges of textiles subject to daily wear and tear, but were adapted for decorative purposes. In North Africa and the Middle East, eyelet stitch is made using a spoked wheel pattern of stitches, or in the Algerian form without an enclosing circle. In [[Turkmenistan]], hook and tulip motifs could be worked in buttonhole stitch. In Afghanistan, men's shirts could be embroidered with herringbone and buttonhole stitches in white silk on white cotton, in elaborate arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afghanistan Smock detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of man's white [[satin stitch]] embroidered [[smock-frock|smock]] from Afghanistan. Mid 20th century.]]
[[Whitework]], the use of white thread on a white ground, covers a variety of techniques and materials, and is used in different forms around the world. In [[Algeria]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] women could wear whitework dresses. In [[Ghazni]], Afghanistan, men's smocks could be embroidered with geometric whitework stitching embellished with small circular mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Needlepoint]] (canvaswork) was used for brightly coloured geometrical [[Hazaras|Hazara]] dress panels in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smocking]] was used for men's smocks in [[Nuristan]] in the [[Hindu Kush]], the black stitching pulling the cloth into vertical bands with zigzag, crisscross and other simple geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Tambour work, a rapid form of embroidery using a fine ari hook instead of a needle, was one of the techniques used around [[Bokhara]] in Uzbekistan for suzanis.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

Embroidered motifs often carry symbolic meaning. A widespread symbol across the Islamic world (and also often found on [[Islamic carpet]]s) is the [[tree of life]], signifying birth, growth to maturity, death and rebirth. It can be shown in many forms, such as a deliberately stylised tree, sometimes flanked by pairs of birds or fruits such as pomegranates, or a vase of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, pp. 70–72, 88–89, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

[[File:Six cushions from Palestine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5&lt;!--size for multiple image--&gt;|Modern [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] [[cross-stitch]] cushions. From top left, clockwise: [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ramallah]], Ramallah, [[Nablus]], [[Beit Jalla]], [[Bethlehem]].]]

Embroidery was important in traditional cultures across the Islamic world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] made colourful clothing available more quickly and more cheaply, displacing crafts such as embroidery.&lt;ref name=Paine177&gt;Paine, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[masnat]] (enthronement) cloths of [[Hyderabad, India]] were made of velvet, hand-embroidered with glittering [[copper]] thread forming gold- and silver-coloured flowers (formerly actually of those metals). These were made for [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors and other rulers, and also for the bride and groom to sit on during weddings in Hyderabad. The technique derived from Turkey and Persia. A masnat takes between twelve days and two months to make, and can cost up to 100,000 rupees. Business declined during the 20th century, as fewer traditional cloths were ordered. Wedding providers offered a masnat as part of their service; machine-made cloths edged out handmade ones. As of 2012, only a few elderly masnat makers remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mohammed |first1=Syed |title=Technology rings death knell for masnat makers |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Technology-rings-death-knell-for-masnat-makers/articleshow/11680587.cms?referral=PM |publisher=[[Times of India]] |accessdate=16 December 2015 |date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embroidery researcher Sheila Paine concludes her book ''Embroidered Textiles'' by explaining that&lt;ref name=Paine177/&gt;

{{quote|once the social context no longer exists and the beliefs and fears that embroidery promoted or deflected no longer torment, once linen is no longer painfully cultivated, spun and woven, sheep are no longer the mainstay of life and exotic silks from other lands a precious luxury – then traditional embroidery is doomed.&lt;ref name=Paine177/&gt;}}

Among the causes of embroidery's decline are [[politics]] and [[economics]], but Paine suggests that the most powerful factor has been the [[education]] of young women. Embroidery is no longer the only way the young woman in Turkey or Baluchistan can secure her future by winning a husband; instead, she can aspire to a university degree and a career of her own. Paine argues that attempts to reinstate traditional embroidery, as with schools set up in Istanbul and [[Salamanca]], will inevitably fail once the necessary social environment that gave handmade artefacts meaning has collapsed. In future, she states, embroidery will carry individual meaning, as in the West, and perhaps new social purposes, as with the politically significant embroidered dresses of the Palestinians.&lt;ref name=Paine177/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sunbula&gt;{{cite web|title=Craft Traditions of Palestine |url=http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |publisher=Sunbula |accessdate=16 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111836/http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |archivedate=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Two Figures', oil on canvas painting by Jankel Adler, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Two Figures'', oil on canvas painting by Jankel Adler, 1944]]
'''Jankel Adler''' (26 July 1895 – 25 April 1949) was a [[Jewish]]-[[Poland|Polish]] painter and [[printmaking|printmaker]].

==Biography==
He was born as the seventh of ten children in [[Tuszyn]], a suburb of [[Łódź]]. In 1912 he began training as an [[engraving|engraver]] with his uncle in [[Belgrade]]. He moved in 1914 to Germany where he lived for a time with his sister in [[Barmen]], (now part of [[Wuppertal]]). There he studied at the college of arts and crafts with professor Gustav Wiethücher.

From 1918 to 1919 he went back to Łódź, where he was joint founder of "Jung Jidysz", a group of avant-garde artists. In 1920 he returned briefly to Berlin; in 1921 he returned to Barmen, and in 1922 he moved to [[Düsseldorf]].

In May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the "Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists".&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, “A Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists’ Groups” (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also joined [[Franz Seiwert]] and [[Otto Freundlich]] in an artists group known as the [[Cologne Progressives]].&lt;ref name="Benus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benus|first1=Benjamin|title=Figurative Constructivism, Pictorial Statistics, and the Group of Progressive Artists, c. 1920-1939|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/11152/Benus_umd_0117E_11708.pdf|website=DRUM|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a teacher at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Academy of Arts]], and became acquainted with [[Paul Klee]], who influenced his work. A painting by Adler received a gold medal at the exhibition "German art Düsseldorf" in 1928.

In 1929 and 1930 he went on study trips in [[Mallorca]] and other places in Spain. During the election campaign of July 1932 he published with a group of leftist artists and intellectuals an urgent appeal against the policy of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]] and for communism. As a [[modern art]]ist, and especially as a [[Jew]], he faced persecution under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] regime which took power in 1933. In that year, two of his pictures were displayed by the [[Nazi]]s at the [[Mannheim]]er Arts Center as examples of [[degenerate art]], and Adler left Germany, staying in [[Paris]] where he regarded his [[exile]] consciously as political [[Resistance movement|resistance]] against the fascist regime in Germany. In the years that followed, he made numerous journeys to Poland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1937, twenty-five of his works were seized from public collections by the Nazis and four were shown in the ''Entartete Kunst'' (Degenerate Art) exhibition in Munich.

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, he volunteered for the [[Polish army]] that had been reconstituted in France; in 1941 he was discharged for health reasons and lived thereafter in [[Kirkcudbright]] in [[Scotland]]. In 1943 he moved to [[London]]. Died in Whitley Cottage in [[Aldbourne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=David |last2=Shuttleworth |first2=Malcolm (Eds.)| year=2000 |title=The Millennium Book of Aldbourne - A Snapshot of the Parish in the Year 2000 |place=Aldbourne |publisher=Trustees of the Aldbourne Memorial Hall |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 April 1949 at the age of 53 years and with the bitter knowledge that none of his nine brothers and sisters had survived the [[Holocaust]].

==Work==
Adler was strongly influenced by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]]. He enjoyed experimenting with materials, for example sand admixtures. He often painted Jewish subjects, and painted some few abstract compositions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20174">[[Image:Po vodam.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Jesus walks on water'', by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] (1888)]]

'''Jesus walking on water''' is one of the [[miracles of Jesus]] recounted in the [[New Testament]]. There are accounts of this event in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], but is not included in the [[Gospel of Luke]].

This story, following the miracle of the [[Feeding the multitude|feeding of the five thousand]], tells how [[Jesus]] sent the [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] by ship back to the "other side" of the [[Sea of Galilee]] (the western side) while he remained behind, alone, to pray. Night fell and the sea arose as the ship became caught in a wind storm. After rowing against the wind for most of the night, the disciples saw Jesus walking on the sea. They were frightened, thinking they were seeing a [[spirit]], but when Jesus told them not to be afraid, they were reassured. After Jesus entered the ship, the wind ceased, and they arrived at land. 

According to the version in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] walked on the water towards Jesus, but he became afraid and began to sink, so Jesus rescued him.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|14:28–31|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical narrative==
The story of Jesus walking on water appears in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], but is not included in the [[Gospel of Luke]].
This episode is narrated towards the end of the [[Ministry of Jesus]] in Galilee before the key turning points halfway through the gospel narratives where Peter [[Confession of Peter|proclaimed Jesus as Christ]] and saw the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].&lt;ref name=CoxEasley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dDMQz5BVFbEC&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=five%20thousand&amp;f=false The Life and Ministry of Jesus: The Gospels]'' by Douglas Redford 2007 {{ISBN|0-7847-1900-4}} pages 189-207&lt;/ref&gt; In all three gospels it follows the feeding of the five thousand, where Jesus had withdrawn by ship to a desert place "belonging to"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|9:10|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethsaida]] after hearing of the death of [[John the Baptist]], but was followed by the crowds who travelled on foot.&lt;ref name=CoxEasley &gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhO5AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT270#v=snippet&amp;q=%22walking%20on%20the%20sea%22&amp;f=false HCSB Harmony of the Gospels]'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-1433669842}} pages 270-272&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the evening, the disciples boarded a ship to cross to the other side of the [[Sea of Galilee]], without Jesus who went up the mountain to pray alone. John alone specifies they were headed "toward [[Capernaum]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|6:17|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the journey on the sea, the disciples were distressed by wind and waves, but saw Jesus walking towards them on the sea. John's Gospel specifies that they were five or six kilometers away from their departure point. The disciples were startled to see Jesus, but he told them not to be afraid.&lt;ref name=CoxEasley /&gt;

Matthew's account adds that Peter asked Jesus, "if it is you", to tell him, or command him, to come to Jesus on the water (waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-gr|τὰ ὕδατα}}, ''ta hydata'' is plural, see [http://biblehub.com/greek/udata_5204.htm Englishman's Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Pulpit Commentary]], the word 'if' is not intended to imply any doubt on Peter's part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm Pulpit Commentary] on Matthew 14, accessed 19 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; After Peter came down out of the ship and walked on the water, he became afraid of the storm and began to sink. He called out to Jesus for help. Jesus caught him and reproved him for his lack of faith, and led him back to the ship, whereupon the storm stopped. Matthew also notes that the disciples called Jesus the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref name=CoxEasley /&gt; The fact that the John account also lacks this detail suggests that this account of "St. Peter's venture" &lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm Pulpit Commentary] on Matthew 14, accessed 19 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[redaction]]al addition by Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Nicholls, ''Walking on the Water: Reading Mt. 14:22-33 in the Light of Its Wirkungsgeschichte'' (BRILL, 2008) page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Saint Peter}}
In all three accounts, after Jesus got into the ship, the wind ceased and they reached the shore. Only John's account has their ship immediately reach the shore. Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people from the other side of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't know where he went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus how he came there, instead of answering the question, he told the crowd that they followed him, not because they had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.&lt;ref name=CoxEasley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingsbury&gt;Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer, 1999 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rn6wk-ipDVQC&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=%22another%20free%20meal%22&amp;f=false Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology]'', Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|978-0664257521}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
[[File:Amédée Varint - Christ marchant sur la mer.jpg|thumb|300px|''Christ walking on the sea'', by Amédée Varint]]

===Christian teachings===
The walking on the sea episode has specific interpretations within Christian teachings and has been viewed by scholars as important due to its perceived impact on the formation of Christian [[ecumenical creeds]], as discussed below.&lt;ref name=Bruner /&gt;

One aspect of the [[pericope]] (passage) is how it highlights the relationship between Jesus and his apostles. [[Merrill C. Tenney|Merrill Tenney]] states that the incident is in essence centered on that aspect, rather than their peril or the miracle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merrill Chapin (1997) ''John: Gospel of Belief'', {{ISBN|0-8028-4351-4}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight Pentecost]] and John Danilson state that this miracle was deliberately designed by Jesus to instruct his apostles and increase their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]].&lt;ref name="pentecost"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bh3M_AfgXZAC&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=The words and works of Jesus Christ |author=J. Dwight Pentecost |author2=John Danilson (photography)|year=2000 |work= |publisher=Zondervan |location= |page= |pages=234–235 |isbn=0-310-30940-9|accessdate=2011-10-04 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Cook and [[Craig A. Evans|Craig Evans]] note that "of little faith" is a somewhat common expression in Matthew (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#8:26|8:26]] when [[calming the storm]] or [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:8|16:8]] regarding bread and the Pharisees just before the [[Confession of Peter]]) and may mean "of no faith".&lt;ref name=CookEvans &gt;Cook, David C.; Evans, Craig A. (2003) ''Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke'', {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}}, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Cassidy states that this episode sheds special light on the position of Peter who had faith in Jesus and acknowledged Jesus' extraordinary powers, and by considering to walk on water himself, wanted to share in the act of Jesus before the other disciples for he considered himself closest to Jesus.&lt;ref name=Cassidy &gt;Cassidy, Richard J. (2007) ''Four Times Peter: Portrayals of Peter in the Four Gospels And at Philippi'', {{ISBN|0-8146-5178-X}}, p. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; Cook and Evans note that the "Lord Save me" cry of Peter is similar to {{bibleref2|Matthew|8:25|9}} and {{bibleref2|Mark|4:38|9}} in the calming the storm episode and again emphasizes the reliance of the disciples on Jesus.&lt;ref name=CookEvans /&gt;

Cook and Evans also echo Pentecost's interpretation that the detail regarding "many stadia away" and "battered by the waves" were intended to emphasize that Jesus could walk on the water far away from the shore, on a rough sea, thus establishing his dominance over nature.&lt;ref name="pentecost"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CookEvans /&gt; [[R.T. France]] has also pointed out that the details regarding the boat being a long way from the shore, and the portrayal of Peter sinking are intended as a confirmation of the depth of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=France |first=R. T. |authorlink= |title=The Gospel of Matthew |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ruP6J_XPCEC&amp;pg=PA567#v=onepage&amp;q=567&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=0-8028-2501-X |page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Ulrich Luz]] and separately [[Dale Allison]] view the pericope as instrumental in asserting the divinity of Jesus among early Christians.&lt;ref name=Bruner &gt;Bruner, Frederick Dale (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l8IxPFsFVdQC&amp;pg=PA75#v=snippet&amp;q=%22walking%20on%20the%20sea%22&amp;f=false Matthew: The Churchbook, Matthew 13-28]'', Eerdmans, {{ISBN|0-8028-2670-9}}, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Robinson sees the pericope as important in establishing the belief in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]] that the disciples viewed Jesus as the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Alan (2005) ''The Apostles' Creed: God's special revelation'', {{ISBN|1-898595-46-1}}, p. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Dale Allison states that Matthew's presentation emphasizes that [[God the Father]] is willing to share divine power with his son and that the impact of this pericope on the affirmation of the divinity of Jesus in the [[ecumenical creeds]] is undeniable.&lt;ref name=Allison &gt;Allison, Dale C. (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=m_OShrBh0I0C&amp;pg=PA241#v=snippet&amp;q=%22walking%20on%20the%20sea%22&amp;f=false Matthew: A Shorter Commentary]'', A&amp;C Black, {{ISBN|0-567-08249-0}}, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical-critical analysis===
[[File:Saint Pierre tentant de marcher sur les eaux by François Boucher.jpg|thumb|[[François Boucher]] Cathédrale Saint-Louis (1766) [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]]]
[[File:Beach of Sea of Galilee in summer 2011.JPG|thumb|250px|The beach of the Sea of Galilee, in Israel]]
Scholars who hold that the story records actual events do so on the basis that Jesus, as Son of God, was above the laws of nature; or, in a variation, that Jesus projected an image himself while actually remaining on the shore.&lt;ref name="Young 1999 2–3"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the episode is held to be inherent in its miraculous nature: "The meaning of the pericope (story) ... only has meaning ... if it is understood as relating a miraculous event which really took place" (Leopold Sabourin, 1975).&lt;ref name="Young 1999 2–3"/&gt;

In recent scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] has championed the view that in general, it is impossible to either prove or disprove supernatural events such as miracles using the [[historical method]], for proving them would require belief in a supernatural world not amenable to historical analysis, and disproving them would require historical evidence that is usually hard to come by.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (2008 )''A Brief Introduction to the New Testament'', {{ISBN|0-19-536934-3}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, some scholars have held the view that while this event took place, it was not miraculous: [[Albert Schweitzer]], for example, suggested that the disciples saw Jesus walking on the shore, but were confused by high wind and darkness; some scholars who accept this "misperception thesis" argue that Mark originally wrote that Jesus walked on the seashore rather than on the sea, and that John had a more accurate version.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have held that the entire episode is a "pious legend" ([[Harvie Branscomb|B.H. Branscomb]], 1937), based perhaps on some lost incident; perhaps Jesus waded through the surf (Vincent Taylor, 1957), or perhaps he walked on a sand bar (Sherman Johnson, 1972, J.D.M. Derrett, 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=9–10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=t54DzhncNE4C&amp;pg=PA9#v=snippet&amp;q=%22pious%20legend%22&amp;f=false page link]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally are those scholars who regard the story as an example of "creative symbolism", or [[myth]],&lt;ref name="Young 1999 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which probably was understood by a part of the audience literally and by others allegorically.&lt;ref name="collinsCulture" /&gt; [[Rudolf Bultmann]] pointed out that the sea-walking theme is familiar in many cultures.&lt;ref name="Young 1999 10"/&gt; Furthermore, the motif of walking on water was associated with kings like [[Xerxes II of Persia|Xerxes]] or [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander]], but also rejected and satirized as humanly impossible and as proverbial for the arrogance of the rulers by [[Menander]], [[Dio Chrysostom]] or in [[2 Maccabees]] 5:21.&lt;ref name="collinsCulture"&gt;Adela Yarbro Collins: ''Mark: a commentary''. Minneapolis, Fortress Press, 2007, p. 328-333. {{ISBN|978-0-8006-6078-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others look for an origin in the mythic world of the Old Testament itself (Christ's victory over the waters paralleling [[Yahweh]]'s defeat of the primeval Sea, representing [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within the New Testament, as an originally simple story later embellished with Hellenistic and Old Testament details.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hebrew Bible, God gives power over the sea, e.g. to [[Moses]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Exodus#14:21|Ex 14:21-29]]) or to [[Elijah]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Kings#2:8|2 kg 2:8]]).&lt;ref name="collinsCulture" /&gt;

[[Adela Yarbro Collins]] concludes that the text characterizes Jesus as Messiah and king of Israel endowed with divine properties.&lt;ref name="collinsCulture" /&gt;

===Literary-critical analysis===
{{See also|Subversive Symmetry}}
Biblical scholar George W. Young dismisses the [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] explanations, the traditional and the [[Historical-critical method|historical critical]] perspectives. He contends that these methods of [[exegesis]] rely on factual interpretations and fail to capture the full meaning of the text based on its structure. Instead, Young explores the pericope with [[Literary criticism|literary-critical methods]] as narrative art. Young views the text as [[fiction]], and uses tools and terms often associated with [[fantastic]] literature to analyze it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=1–6, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young analyses the pericope as the expression of three entangled, conflicting perspectives on reality: (i) the "conventional reality" based on [[sensory perception]]; (ii) the "impossible" [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Jesus resulting in the astonishment of the observers; (iii) the narrator's [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] comment in Mark 6:52 identifying Jesus as the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1999|pp=112–145, 149ff., 157f., 181–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gospel of Mark (c. 66-70 CE)===
{{quote|45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away. 46 And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray. 47 And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. 48 And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them: 49 but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; 50 for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. 51 And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves; 52 for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.

===Gospel of Matthew (c. 80-90 CE)===
{{quote|22 And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away. 23 And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone. 24 But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. 25 And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea. 26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear. 27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. 28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters. 29 And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus. 30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me. 31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? 32 And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased. 33 And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

{{quote|15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.

16 And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea; 17 and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 18 And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. 19 When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid. 20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. 21 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.|({{bibleref2|John|6:15–21|8}} American Standard Version)}}

'''Kumina''' is an [[Afro-Jamaican]] religion and practices that include secular ceremonies, dance and music that developed from the beliefs and traditions brought to the island by [[BaKongo]] [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved people]] and [[Indentured servitude|indentured labourers]], from the [[Congo Basin|Congo region]] of West Central Africa, during the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|post-emancipation]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJPBkj4P38wC|title=Three Eyes for the Journey: African Dimensions of the Jamaican Religious Experience|last=Stewart|first=Dianne M.|date=2005-07-07|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198039082|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is mostly associated with the [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|parish of St. Thomas]] in the east of the island. However, the practice spread to the parishes of [[Portland Parish|Portland]], [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|St. Mary]] and [[Saint Catherine Parish|St. Catherine]], and the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9h5KDRfZ-JgC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=kongo+immigrants+to+jamaica+kumina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O5RM-A-5Kl&amp;sig=WZW_4tBAqUQ2B_fFrsARGHikDQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis55G0q7TMAhXGeCYKHZiNDPgQ6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=kongo%2520immigrants%2520to%2520jamaica%2520kumina&amp;f=false|title=Afro-Caribbean Religions: An Introduction to Their Historical, Cultural, and Sacred Traditions|last=Murrell|first=Nathaniel Samuel|date=2010-01-25|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781439901755|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumina also gives it name to a drumming style, developed from the music that accompanied the spiritual ceremonies, that evolved in urban Kingston. The Kumina drumming style has a great influence on [[Rastafari#Music|Rastafari music]], especially the [[Nyabinghi drums|Nyabinghi drumming]], and Jamaican popular music. [[Count Ossie]] was a notable pioneer of the drumming style in popular music and it continues to have a significant influence on contemporary genres such as [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=liV8AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=kumina%20riddim&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 9: Genres: Caribbean and Latin America|last=Ryman|first=Cheryl|last2=|first2=|date=|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781441132253|editor-last=Horn|editor-first=David|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Kumina|editor-last2=Shepherd|editor-first2=John|editor 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kumina riddim]]'' is a dancehall [[riddim]] produced by [[Sly and Robbie|Sly &amp; Robbie]] in 2002. It has featured in recordings of over 20 artists including [[Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers]] and [[Tanya Stephens]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Beliefs==
{{Kongo religion sidebar}}
Spirits are separated into sky bound and earth bound deities. [[Nzambi a Mpungu|Oto King Zombi]] is the Supreme Creator. Other sky bound spirits of Kumina are [[Obei]] and [[Shango]]. Earth bound spirits in Kumina are found in the Old Testament David, Ezekiel, Moses, Cain, and Shadrak. Ancestral spirits are also important in Kumina. The term used to refer to these ancestral spirits is ''Zombi'', the term originates from the Kikongo word "''dzambi''". Only a person who has been possessed by a Zombi can become a Zombi after death. A Zombi had the privilege of returning to earth to preside over ceremonies and possess dancers and performing other duties. Unlike people who had been possessed by Zombies, those who had not been possessed would simply die and ascend to Oto King Zombi without chance of returning to earth.

==Organization==
Organization of Kumina communities follows the general local character of African religions in Jamaica. Kumina communities are small family based communities or nations. Some nations include ''Mondongo'', ''Moyenge'', ''Machunde'', ''Kongo'', ''Igbo'', and ''Yoruba''. People from Kumina families are given the title ''Bongo''. Marrying into a Bongo family is one avenue to become a part of a Kumina nation; special initiation is the other avenue. Kumina nations are led by a "King" and "Queen". [[Imogene "Queenie" Kennedy]] AKA Queenie III (c1920-1998) was a well-known Kumina Queen in the 20th century, born in St Thomas in the late 1920s she  later moved to Kingston and then Waterloo, St Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kumina Queen's Drum Repatriated To Jamaica|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140803/arts/arts2.html|website=Jamaican Gleaner|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Alexandria]], the ancient great port of [[Egypt]] and a first-rank Mediterranean metropolis in the Hellenistic world, was an influential early Christian diocese since 30 AD, founded and held by Saint [[Mark the Evangelist]].  The [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] ranked it after Rome, while the Greek fathers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] tried in canon 28 to demote it, giving it third place after Constantinople, although [[Pope Leo I]] of Rome rejected this canon.  However, following the same Council, the patriarchate was claimed by two parties, namely, a Greek Patriarch representing adherence to the dogmatic definitions of Chalcedon and a Coptic Miaphysite Patriarch rejecting them.  

While part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and under [[Islam]]ic domination, the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] patriarch always followed the Byzantine rite, while the non-Chalcedonian followed the Coptic rite.  The Greek Patriarch of Alexandria remained in communion with the See of Rome despite the [[Great Eastern Schism|rupture]] of communion between Rome and Constantinople in 1054.  In fact, the Bishop of Rome and Greek Bishop of Alexandria commemorated each other in their [[diptychs]] until the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman. ''The Eastern Schism.'' (Oxford, 1955). pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while in 1215, during the pontificate of [[Pope Innocent III]], there were Latin Patriarchs, rivaling or replacing the Greek ones in the formerly Crusader held cities of [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], and [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], Greek [[Patriarch Mark III of Alexandria]] was invited and sent representatives to participate in the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman. ''The Eastern Schism.'' (Oxford, 1955). pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Only in the early 14th century is there a record of a Latin Patriarch of Alexandria.  The title was merely [[Titular bishop|titular]] since he never occupied the See.  His patriarchal [[cathedral]] in Rome was the papal [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]].  Many incumbents would hold residential (arch)episcopal posts of various ranks in Catholic countries, and even (earlier and/or later) other Titular Latin patriarchates (Jerusalem, Constantinople).

The titular see would have its share of disputed nominations during the papal 'Babylonian Exile' in [[Avignon]].

Since 1724, the [[Melkite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East]] holds the title of Patriarch of Alexandria.  In 1895, the [[Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria]] was established out of the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria.  Thus, there remains a Patriarch of Alexandria for the [[Eastern Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. 

The Titular Latin Patriarchate was left vacant in 1954 and then abolished in 1964.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Vietnam]] comprises solely a [[Latin rite]] hierarchy, joint in a national [[episcopal conference]], comprising three metropolitan [[archdiocese]]s and 23 [[suffragan diocese]]s.

There are no Eastern Catholic, (missionary) pre-diocesan or other exempt jurisdictions.

There are no titular sees, all defunct jurisdictions have current Latin successor sees.

There formally is an [[Apostolic Delegation]] to Vietnam as papal diplomatic representation (Non-Residential, below embassy-level), but it is vested in the [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to [[Singapore]] in its national capital Singapore.

'''Living Enrichment Center''' ('''LEC''') was a [[New Thought]] organization and retreat center in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. It was founded in the farmhouse of senior minister Mary Manin Morrissey of [[Scholls, Oregon]], in the mid-1970s; the church moved to a 94,500 square foot (8,800 m²) building on a forested area of 95 acres (384,000 m²) in [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] in 1992. Over the course of its existence, the congregation grew from less than a dozen to an estimated 4,000, making it the biggest New Thought church in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Robbin, Janine. ''[[Willamette Week]]''. [http://wweek.com/story.php?story=5101 "The Profit Margin"]&lt;/ref&gt; Living Enrichment Center maintained an in-house bookstore, retreat center, café, kindergarten and elementary school, and an outreach television ministry.

Living Enrichment Center closed in 2004 as a result of a $10.7 million financial scandal. Edward Morrissey pleaded guilty to money laundering and using church money for the personal expenses of himself and his wife. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison. He was released in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koin.com/Global/story.asp?s%3D6615206 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090402/http://www.koin.com/Global/story.asp?s=6615206 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/oregonian/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1181267788141050.xml&amp;coll=7 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194338/http://www.oregonlive.com/oregonian/stories/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1181267788141050.xml&amp;coll=7 |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Living Enrichment Center dissolved in 2004, from which several ministries emerged including New Thought Center for Spiritual Living.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newthoughtcsl.org/ministers |title=Our Ministers &amp;#124; New Thought Center For Spiritual Living |website=Newthoughtcsl.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebration Church and Whole Life Center in Lake Oswego.

==Founding==
[[Image:Lecfromcopter.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Living Enrichment Center's facilities and grounds in Wilsonville]]

The origins of the Living Enrichment Center were in a church called The Truth Center that Mary Manin Morrissey and her first husband started in the living room of their small farm in rural Oregon in 1974.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book | last = Morrissey | first = Mary Manin | title = A Miracle in Motion: The Green Balloon Story |isbn = 1-886491-00-3 | publisher = Random House | year = 1997 | pages=13–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was not successful, and in 1979 Morrissey and her husband took the family and their ministry on the road, offering workshops on building self-esteem in churches around the country.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; After a year on the road, Morrissey founded a church in the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] Hall in [[Beaverton, Oregon]], after she felt she had received divine guidance to start a ministry.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; A church management consultant advised Morrissey and her husband to name the church after what they aimed to do; as they aimed to enrich people's lives, they called themselves the Living Enrichment Center.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

In November 1992, Living Enrichment Center acquired the former Callahan Center, in Wilsonville, which consisted of a three-level {{convert|94000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building on a {{convert|93|acre|m2|adj=on}} lot.&lt;ref&gt;''Living Enrichment Center: The 21st Century Church''. LEC staff. Intro. Retrieved April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The lot also included 13 cabins, with over 70 rooms, which were used for spiritual retreats conducted via the church's sister organization, Namaste Retreat Center. By 1997 the church were engaged in a campaign via a Portland Sunday TV message, advertising, and outreach programs, to grow the local congregation by an extra 200 members.&lt;ref&gt;''Living Enrichment Center: The 21st Century Church''. COMMUNICATION VEHICLES: 1. Local Congregation. 1997. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:Livingbookendds.jpg|thumb|Inside the Wilsonville campus.]]

Living Enrichment Center maintained an in-house bookstore, retreat center, cafe, kindergarten and elementary school, and an outreach television ministry.

The Namaste Retreat and Conference Center was started in 1994, and by 1996 the annual revenue was $1.5 million with an operating surplus.&lt;ref&gt;LEC staff. ''Living Enrichment Center: The 21st Century Church''. Internal document. Page 5. 1997. Retrieved April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The retreat center took its name from the [[sanskrit]] word [[namaste]]. In its literature, Namaste Retreat Center billed itself as "Oregon's leading spiritual retreat center."&lt;ref&gt;"1998 Retreat Events." Namaste Retreat and Conference Center. Living Enrichment Ministries. 1998. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Many personalities within the [[New Age]] and [[New Thought]] communities conducted retreats at Namaste Retreat Center. Retreat leaders included: [[Marianne Williamson]], [[Wayne Dyer]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[Jean Houston]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Shakti Gawain]], [[Stanislav Grof]], and [[Arun Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lao proverb |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/129/story_12909_1.html |title=Say Yes When Nobody Asked - Beliefnet - Lao proverb Quote - Say yes when nobody asked |website=Beliefnet.com |date=2016-05-10 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cristofori School was a kindergarten through third grade school that was headquartered at Living Enrichment Center during the mid-to-late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newtimes.org/issue/9706/97-06-mmm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418211240/http://www.newtimes.org/issue/9706/97-06-mmm.html |archivedate=2007-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were taught the usual age-appropriate lessons in math, reading, writing, etc. Students were also exposed to the [[ecumenical philosophy]] of [[New Thought]], which was the governing philosophy of Cristofori's governing institution Living Enrichment Center.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Life Keys programs==
[[File:Living Enrichment Center's The Welcoming Jesus statue.jpg|thumb|right|Living Enrichment Center had many statues, including "The Welcoming Jesus" by world-renowned sculptor [[Lorenzo Ghiglieri]].]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In April of (1997), LEC began a 1/2 hour weekly taped television show on commercial TV in Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay area, including Sacramento, Phoenix, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Seattle. LEC committed to spend $120,000 on this aspect of the ministry. It is anticipated that the broadening of this ministry will develop additional revenue from the sale of products and be an additional source of contribution revenue, taking the pressure off the local congregation and the retreat center to support the operation of the Center. Currently, 15% of the contributions LEC receives (approximately $300,000 a year) comes from outside the Portland metropolitan area." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Life Keys was a name brand created by Rev. Morrissey. Life Keys produced audio tapes, CDs, and video cassettes of Mary Morrissey's Sunday talks. The videos were broadcast on many [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] stations across the [[West Coast of the United States]]. The audio and video cassettes were also available for purchase in Living Enrichment Center's Living Bookends Bookstore. Often, audio cassettes of a Sunday service were available immediately after service. The audio tapes were also available via a mail subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstucson.org/whatsontv/projects/4999/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128234819/http://www.accesstucson.org/whatsontv/projects/4999/ |archivedate=2006-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The audio cassette and CD recordings produced by Life Keys were sold to an audience from all over the world. Though most of the talks in the Life Keys series were delivered by Mary Manin Morrissey, some were recordings of talks given by visiting speakers such as [[Arun Gandhi]], [[Marianne Williamson]], and [[Wayne Dyer]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Audio products fall into three categories: audio books, audio albums on a particular subject, and a weekly tape of Mary's Sunday talk. We have two audio publishers who have expressed interest in Mary's products. It is anticipated that we will self-publish the weekly message which, through subscription and the small group process, would become the basis for the national outreach. Currently the weekly message subscriptions are approximately $260/year. The weekly message will also be available soon by subscription on the Internet at a price of $3/week. This has the advantage of delivering the talk on audio with no additional cost for duplication, shipping and handling."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Life Keys'' series discontinued in 2004 when Living Enrichment Center filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors. Mary Manin Morrissey's last talk distributed in the ''Life Keys'' series was entitled ''The Right Questions to Ask'' and was recorded on August 1, 2004. It was also Morrissey's last talk as Senior Minister of Living Enrichment Center. In this last talk, Morrissey says her life is in "disarray", saying that her husband is in a mental hospital for depression and that she herself needs to take a break. During part of the talk she seems to be on the verge of tears.

==Financial scandal==
In early 2004, Mary Morrissey was sued by members of her congregation for unpaid loans. It was reported that the loans were often made personally to Morrissey,&lt;ref&gt;KATU: Mary Morrissey: Prophet of Profit. Investigation. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the personal finances of herself, her husband, Edward Morrissey, and Living Enrichment Center had not been treated separately. In an e-mail to ''[[Willamette Week]]'', Steve Unger, Morrissey's attorney, wrote that the Morrisseys had committed [[commingling]], and that "the finances of [the] LEC, New Thought Broadcasting, Mary Morrissey and Ed Morrissey were treated not separately, but as a kind of 'financial family.'"&lt;ref&gt;Robbin, Janine. "The Prophet Margin." ''[[Willamette Week]]''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 2004, the sum total of the debt was reported by ''Willamette Week'' and ''The Oregonian'' as totaling more than $20 million. Throughout the month of June, Mary Morrissey and Harry Morgan Moses conducted a series of talks called "Standing Firm While Your World is Shaking", for a "[[donation|love offering]]" of $15 per class or $100 for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-3505-the_enriching_quiz.html |title=The Enriching Quiz - Willamette Week |website=Wweek.com |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 2004, Living Enrichment Center held "Calling Forth a Miracle: A Benefit for Living Enrichment Center with Very Special Guests" and declared 2004–2005 as "The Year of the Miracle".

On April 17, 2005, Jeff Manning of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' wrote, "Edward Morrissey, husband of embattled former church pastor Mary Manin Morrissey, admitted in federal court Wednesday that he defrauded members of his wife's church in soliciting $10.7 million in loans. He pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering, a felony that could get him 36 months or more in federal prison.... Edward Morrissey's plea will probably not put to rest lingering questions over the deal that the Morrisseys cut with federal and state officials. Some former Living Enrichment parishioners were angered that Mary Morrissey eluded federal charges. Mary Morrissey leaned hard on parishioners to make the loans, some said, but she has claimed she had no knowledge of her husband's use of that money.... Mary Morrissey agreed to contribute 25 percent of her disposable income to retiring the debt until parishioners are fully repaid or for the next 20 years, whichever comes first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11010/edward-morrissey-pleads-guilty-in-taking-millions-from-church |title=Edward Morrissey pleads guilty in taking millions from church |author=Jeff Manning|work=[[The Oregonian]] |date=April 14, 2005  |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2005, Bend.com &lt;!--this appears to be a blog--likely a mirror of a reliable source--&gt; reported that a settlement deal between the Morrisseys and the Department of Consumer and Business Services had been reached: "As part of this settlement, neither of the Morrisseys may offer or sell securities. Further, Edward Morrissey agreed to plead guilty to a single federal count of money laundering. The plea agreement reached between Edward Morrissey and the U.S. Attorney's Office calls for the government to recommend a 36-month sentence, but that recommendation is not binding on the court."&lt;ref&gt;Bend.com, DCBS announces settlement in securities case, Apr. 6, 2005 [http://www.religionnewsblog.com/10835/dcbs-announces-settlement-in-securities-case] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year in prison at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], in August 2006, Edward Morrissey was transferred to a [[halfway house]] in [[Seattle]], Washington. Morrissey was released from the halfway house on February 2, 2007.&lt;ref name="Ed Morrissey inmate listing"/&gt; In the August 28, 2006, edition of the ''[[Wilsonville Spokesman]]'', editor Curt Kipp wrote that Mary Morrissey has repaid $24,000 of the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsonvillenews.com/WVSNews7.shtml |title=wilsonvillenews.com |website=Wilsonvillenews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to ''[[Willamette Week]]'' in 2004, the lawyer for Mary Morrissey's then-husband, Edward Morrissey, admitted that the couple had committed [[commingling]].&lt;ref&gt;"The fact is, unfortunately, that neither Mary nor anyone else at this point can answer questions about the disposition of funds loaned to Mary and [the] LEC," lawyer Steve Ungar wrote in an April 19 email to WW. "Why? Because the finances of [the] LEC, New Thought Broadcasting, Mary Morrissey and Ed Morrissey were treated not separately, but as a kind of 'financial family.'

Living Enrichment Center abandoned the Wilsonville facilities in June 2004. The church moved to Valley Theatre, a movie theater in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The first service at Valley Theatre was held on July 4, 2004.

Mary Manin Boggs Morrissey Dickey was the founder (along with her then-husband Haven Boggs) and senior minister of Living Enrichment Center. Edward Morrissey married Mary Manin Boggs (thereafter known as Mary Manin Morrissey) in the mid-1990s, and shortly after the marriage Edward Morrissey became the [[CFO]] of the church. In the October 16, 2006, ''[[The Oregonian|Oregonian]]'' article "Forgiveness, for minister, starts with self", staff writer S. Renee Mitchell indicated that Mary Morrissey and Ed Morrissey have divorced. Mitchell wrote, "When the smoke cleared, Morrissey &amp;mdash; who had once cozied up to the Dalai Lama and other world spiritual leaders &amp;mdash; was divorced, houseless and in debt for more than $10 million."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news/11608899046060.xml?oregonian?ylccsrm&amp;coll=7 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032828/http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F11608899046060.xml%3Foregonian%3Fylccsrm&amp;coll=7 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year in prison at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], in August 2006, Edward Morrissey was transferred to a halfway house in [[Portland, Oregon]].

Mary Manin Morrissey also operated two companies, "Life Soulutions" and "Evolving Life Ministries". ''[[The Oregonian]]'' reported in 2007, that the organization of Life Soulutions has prompted questions from the state of Oregon because Morrissey's partner, Karen Hanzlik, in the venture receives as much as 40% of revenue, meaning that this portion is not required to be diverted to the restitution fund. "State officials have asked Morrissey for documents detailing the corporate structure of LifeSoulutions," writes ''The Oregonian''. "Morrissey told them that on the advice of an attorney, there are no such documents. Nothing was put in writing. 'We're researching the law and considering our legal options,' Whang said.

Investigators from the state of Oregon want to make sure that Morrissey is not diverting money from her income, as a stipulation of her plea bargain with the state was that a portion of her income must be used to repay her debt to her former congregation. KATU reported in 2007, that Morrissey has repaid only $74,000 since her plea bargain was struck in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katu.com/news/specialreports/11128766.html KATU News: Prophet of Profit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106041150/http://www.katu.com/news/specialreports/11128766.html |date=2012-11-06 }} (11/8/07): "Manin-Morrissey said she is following those rules. Her current church operates as a for-profit business, according to the state. She would not talk specifically about her finances, but we tracked down where the online contributions go. They are sent to a UPS store on Barbur Boulevard - to a post office box controlled by Manin-Morrissey. State investigators told KATU News they want to make sure Manin-Morrissey is not diverting income because a portion of her pay is supposed to go into an account for victims. So far, there is $74,000 in the account. She and her ex-husband owe $10.7 million."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], a '''minister''' is a person authorized by a [[church body|church]], or other religious organization, to perform functions such as teaching of beliefs; leading services such as [[wedding]]s, [[baptism]]s or [[funeral]]s; or otherwise providing spiritual guidance to the community. The term is taken from [[Latin]] ''minister'' ("servant", "attendant"), which itself was derived from ''minus'' ("less").&lt;ref&gt;"Etymologically, a minister is a person of 'lower' status, a 'servant'. The word goes back via Old French ''ministre'' to Latin ''minister'' 'servant, attendant', which was derived from  'minus', 'less'." http://www.word-origins.com/definition/minister.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Lutheran|Nordic Lutheran]], and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, the concept of a [[priesthood]] is emphasised. In other [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Baptist]], [[Congregationalist]], [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Reformed]] churches, the term "minister" usually refers to members of the ordained [[clergy]] who leads a congregation or participates in a role in a [[parachurch]] ministry; such a person may serve as a presbyter, pastor, preacher, bishop, chaplain or elder.

With respect to [[ecclesiastical titles and styles|ecclesiastical address]], many ministers are styled as "[[The Reverend]]"; however, some use "[[Pastor]]" or "Father" as a title.

==Roles and duties==

The [[Church of England]] defines the ministry of priests as follows:
{{quote|Priests are called to be servants and shepherds among the people to whom they are sent. With their Bishop and fellow ministers, they are to proclaim the word of the Lord and to watch for the signs of God's new creation. They are to be messengers, watchmen and stewards of the Lord; they are to teach and to admonish, to feed and provide for his family, to search for his children in the wilderness of this world's temptations, and to guide them through its confusions, that they may be saved through Christ forever. Formed by the word, they are to call their hearers to repentance and to declare in Christ's name the absolution and forgiveness of their sins.

With all God's people, they are to tell the story of God's love. They are to baptize new disciples in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and to walk with them in the way of Christ, nurturing them in the faith. They are to unfold the Scriptures, to preach the word in season and out of season, and to declare the mighty acts of God. They are to preside at the Lord's table and lead his people in worship, offering with them a spiritual sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. They are to bless the people in God's name. They are to resist evil, support the weak, defend the poor, and intercede for all in need. They are to minister to the sick and prepare the dying for their death. Guided by the Spirit, they are to discern and foster the gifts of all God's people, that the whole Church may be built up in unity and faith.&lt;ref name="CommonWorship"&gt;{{cite book|title=Common Worship Ordination Services Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rr7DBVTy550C&amp;pg=PA123|year=2007|publisher=Church House Publishing|isbn=978-0-7151-2131-3|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Ministers may perform some or all of the following duties:
*assist in co-ordinating volunteers and church community groups
*assist in any general administrative service
*conduct [[marriage]] ceremonies, [[funerals]] and memorial services, participate in the [[ordination]] of other clergy, and confirming young people as members of a local church
*encourage local church endeavors
*engage in [[welfare]] and community services activities of communities
*establish new local churches
*keep records as required by [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] or [[church law]]
*plan and conduct services of [[worship|public worship]]
*[[preach]]
*[[prayer|pray]] and encourage others to be [[theocentric]] (that is, God-focused)
*preside over [[sacraments]] (also called ordinances) of the church. Such as:
** the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] (a name derived from 1 Corinthians 11:20), also known as the Lord's Table (taken from 1 Corinthians 10:21), or [[Holy Communion]], and
** the [[Baptism]] of adults or children (depending on the denomination)
*provide leadership to the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]], [[parish]] or church community, this may be done as part of a team with lay people in roles such as elders
*refer people to community support services, [[psychologist]]s or [[Physician|doctor]]s
*research and study religion, [[Scripture]] and [[theology]]
*supervise prayer and discussion groups, retreats and seminars, and provide religious instruction
*teach on spiritual and theological subjects
*train leaders for church, community and youth leadership
*work on developing relationships and networks within the religious community
*provide [[pastoral care]] in various contexts
*provide personal support to people in crises, such as illness, bereavement and family breakdown
*visit the sick and elderly to counsel and comfort them and their families
*administer [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Last Rites]] when designated to do so &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/Catholic/2005/04/What-Are-The-Last-Rites.aspx |title=Last Rites explanation |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the first style of ministering is the player coach style. In this style, the pastor is a "participant in all the processes that the church uses to reach people and see them transformed
* the second style of ministering is the delegating style, in which the minister develops members of the church to point that they can be trusted
* the third style of ministering is the directing style where the minister gives specific instructions and then supervises the congregation closely
* the last and fourth style of ministering is the combination style, which a minister allows directional ministering from a pastoral staff member
* mention prayer of salvation to those interested in becoming a believer

==Training and qualifications==
Depending on the denomination the requirements for ministry vary. All denominations require that the minister has a sense of [[Religious calling|calling]]. In regards to training, denominations vary in their requirements, from those that emphasize natural gifts to those that also require advanced [[tertiary education]] qualifications, for example, from a [[seminary]], [[theological college]] or [[university]].

===New Testament===
One of the clearest references is found in {{bibleref2|1 Timothy|3:1-16|KJV}}, which outlines the requirements of a [[bishop]] (''episkopos'': [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐπίσκοπος}}, interpreted as [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] by some denominations):
{{quote|This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Likewise must the [[deacon]]s be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.|[[King James Version]]}}

==Related titles and types of Christian ministries==

===Bishops, priests, and deacons===

The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]] and some [[Methodist]] churches have applied the formal, church-based leadership or an [[Ordination|ordained]] clergy in matters of either the church or broader political and sociocultural import. The churches have three orders of ordained clergy:

*[[Bishop]]s are the primary clergy, administering all sacraments and governing the church.
*[[Priest]]s administer the sacraments and lead local congregations; they cannot ordain other clergy, however, nor consecrate buildings.
*In some denominations, [[deacon]]s play a non-sacramental and assisting role in the liturgy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Until the Reformation, the clergy were the first estate but were relegated to the secular estate in Protestant [[Northern Europe]]. After compulsory celibacy was abolished during the Reformation, the formation of a partly hereditary priestly class became possible, whereby wealth and clerical positions were frequently inheritable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Higher positioned clergy formed this clerical educated upper class.

[[Anglo-Catholicism|High Church Anglicanism]] and [[High Church Lutheranism]] tend to emphasise the role of the clergy in dispensing the Christian sacraments. The countries that were once a part of the [[Swedish Empire]], i.e. [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltics]], have more markedly preserved Catholic traditions and introduced far less [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] (that is, [[Calvinist]]ic or [[Zwinglian]]) [[theology]] and hence the role of bishops, priests and deacons are notably more visible.

Bishops, priests and deacons have traditionally officiated over of acts worship, reverence, rituals and ceremonies. Among these central traditions have been  [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]], [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], [[Anointing of the Sick]], [[Holy Orders]], marriage, the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or the [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], and [[coronation]]s. These so-called "social rituals" have formed a part of human [[culture]] for tens of thousands of years. Anthropologists see social rituals as one of many [[cultural universals]].

The term ''[[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]'' (from the [[Latin]] word for ''ruler'') or [[vicar]] may be used for priests in certain settings, especially in the Roman Catholic and Anglican traditions.

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, a parish, which is responsible for its own finances, is overseen by a rector. A bishop is nominally in control of a financially assisted parish but delegates authority to a vicar (related to the prefix "vice" meaning substitute or deputy).

===Pastors===
The term "[[pastor]]" means "shepherd" and is used several times in the [[New Testament]] to refer to church workers. Many Protestants use the term as a prenominal title (e.g., Pastor Smith) or as a job title (like Senior Pastor or Worship Pastor).

===Clergy===
The English word ''clergy'' derives from the same root as ''clerk'' and can be traced to the Latin ''clericus'' which derives from the Greek word ''kleros'' meaning a "lot" or "portion" or "office". The term '''Clerk in Holy Orders''' is still the technical title for certain Christian clergy, and its usage is prevalent in [[canon caw]]. [[Holy Orders]] refer to any recipient of the Sacrament of Ordination, both the Major Orders ([[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s and [[deacon]]s) and the now less known Minor Orders ([[Acolyte]], [[Lector]], [[Exorcist]] and [[Ostiarius|Porter]]) who, save for certain reforms made at the Second Vatican Council in the Roman Catholic Church, were called clerics or ''Clerk'', which is simply a shorter form of ''Cleric''. Clerics were distinguished from the laity by having received, in a formal rite of introduction into the clerical state, the ''[[tonsure]]'' or ''corona'' (crown) which involved cutting hair from the top and side of the head leaving a circlet of hair which symbolised the ''Crown of Thorns'' worn by Christ at His crucifixion.
 
Though Christian in origin, the term can be applied by analogy to functions in other religious traditions. For example, a [[rabbi]] can be referred to as being a clergy member.

''Parson'' is a similar term often applied to ordained priests or ministers. The word is a variant on the English word ''person'' from the Latin ''persona'' ("mask") used as a legal term for one having jurisdiction.

{{anchor|dominie}}

===Dominie, Dominee, Dom, Don===
The similar words "Dominie", "Dominee" and "Dom", all derived from the Latin ''domine'' (vocative case of Dominus "Lord, Master"), are used in related contexts.
[[Dominie]], derived directly from Dutch, is used in the United States, "Dominee", derived from Dutch via [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] is used in South Africa as the title of a pastor of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. In Scottish English dominie is generally used to mean just schoolmaster. In various [[Romance languages]], shortened forms of Dominus (''Dom, Don'') are commonly used for Catholic priests (sometimes also for lay notables as well) for example [[Benedictine]] [[Monk]]s are titled ''Dom'', as in the style ''Dom Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Dominie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Dom}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Dom or Dominus, as well as the English equivalent, Sir were often used as titles for priests in England up to the 17th century who held Bachelor of Arts degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Sir}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Chaplains and padres===
[[Chaplain]] as in English or [[almoner]] (preferred in many other languages) or their equivalents refer to a minister who has another type of pastoral "target group" than a territorial parish congregation (or in addition to one), such as a military units, schools and hospitals.

The Spanish word [[Military Chaplain|Padre]] ("father") is often informally used to address military chaplains, also in English and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ([[Brazil]]).

===Elder===
[[Elder (religious)|Elder]]s (in Greek, πρεσβυτερος [presbuteros]; see [[Presbyter]]) in Christianity are involved in the collective leadership of a local church or of a denomination.
*{{anchor|Presbyterianism}}Some Presbyterian denominations call their ministers [[teaching elder]]s. [[Ruling elder]]s are ordained laymen who govern the church along with the teaching elders as the [[Session (Presbyterianism)|Church session]].
*{{anchor|Assemblies of God|Metropolitan Community Church}}In the [[Assemblies of God]] and the [[Metropolitan Community Church]] Elders are the most senior leaders serving, leading, and supervising the worldwide denomination. In the Metropolitan Community Church an Elder can be a lay person or clergy.

===Types of ministries in non-denominational church===
* Such as men's ministry, women's ministry, youth ministry, kids ministry, singles and campus ministries, married couples ministry, because it gives each congregation member of different backgrounds and age groups to have a chance to fellowship with people in a closer life group to them.

==Leaders and pastoral agents==
[[Laity|Lay]] people, [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, pastoral agents, community [[leader]]s are responsible to bring teaching the gospel in the forefront helping the clergy to evangelize people. Agents ramify in many ways to act and be in touch with the people in daily life and developing religious projects, socio-political and infrastructural.

*{{anchor|Jehovah's Witnesses|JW}}[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] consider every baptized Witness to be a "minister"; the religion permits any qualified baptized adult male to perform a baptism, funeral, or wedding.&lt;ref&gt;"Applying the General Priesthood Principle", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1964, page 86, "Among the witnesses of Jehovah any adult, dedicated and baptized male Christian who is qualified may serve in such ministerial capacities as giving public Bible discourses and funeral talks, performing marriages and presiding at the Lord's evening meal or supper. There is no clergy class."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, however, each such service is performed by an [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|elder]] or a "[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Ministerial servants|ministerial servant]]" (that is, a [[Ministerial servant|deacon]]), one of the men appointed to "take the lead" in local congregations. Witnesses do not use "elder" or any other term as a title, and do not capitalize the term.&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Sheep Need Tender Care", ''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1996, page 15, "Christian elders are appointed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, and care is exercised not to use such terms as "pastor," "elder," or "teacher" as titles."&lt;/ref&gt; They do not accept payment and are not salaried employees or considered "paid clergy". They support themselves financially. Appointments are made directly by Circuit Overseers under the authority of the local Branch, and Governing Body ; appointment is said to be "by [[Holy spirit#Jehovah's Witnesses|holy spirit]]" because "the qualifications [are] recorded in [[God]]'s [[Bible|spirit-inspired Word]]" and because appointing committees "pray for holy spirit".&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 4: Why Respect Authority?", ''"Keep Yourselves in God's Love"'', ©2008 Watch Tower, page 43, "Elders are appointed by holy spirit. ([[Acts 20:28]]) How so? In that such men must first meet the qualifications recorded in God's spirit-inspired Word. (1&amp;nbsp;Timothy 3:1-7, 12; Titus 1:5-9) Further, the elders who evaluate a brother's qualifications pray earnestly for the guidance of Jehovah's holy spirit."&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{anchor|Evangelical|Evangelicalism}}In many evangelical churches a group (multiple elders as opposed to a single elder)&lt;ref&gt;See Acts 20:17; Titus 1:5; James 5:14; 1 Peter 5:1 for examples of a [[Plurality (church governance)|plurality of elders]] in a church&lt;/ref&gt; of (non-staff) elders serve as the spiritual "shepherds" or caretakers of the congregation,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Acts 20:28]]; 1 Peter 5:2&lt;/ref&gt; usually giving [[spiritual direction]] to the pastoral staff, enforcing church discipline, etc. In some denominations these elders are called by other names, i.e.; traditionally "Deacons" in many Baptist churches function as spiritual leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Though this is changing as many churches desire to become increasingly "influenced by a more biblically informed hermeneutic" http://www.xpastor.org/cases/2006_deacons_mark_%20hudgins.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816054614/http://www.xpastor.org/cases/2006_deacons_mark_%20hudgins.pdf |date=2009-08-16 }}, see pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases these elders are elected and serve fixed terms. In other cases they are not elected but rather they are  "recognized by the congregation as those appointed by the Holy Spirit ([[Acts 20:28]]) and meeting the qualifications of 1 Timothy 3:1-7."&lt;ref&gt;Biblical Eldership, A.Strauch, Littleton, CO: Lewis &amp; Roth, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monsignor===
Monsignor is an [[ecclesiastical]] title of honor bestowed on some [[priests]].

===Prelate===
*A [[prelate]] is a member of the clergy having a special canonical jurisdiction over a territory or a group of people.
*Usually, a prelate is a [[bishop]]. Prelate sometimes refers to the clergy of a state church with a formal hierarchy, and suggests that the prelate enjoys legal privileges and power as a result of clerical status.

===Father===
*"Father" is a term of address for priests and deacons in some churches, especially the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Anglican]] traditions.
*"[[Military Chaplain|Padre]]" (Spanish word for father, used in Brazil too) is frequently used in the military of English-speaking countries.
*A priest of the [[regular clergy]].
*A pre-Scholastic Christian writer accepted by the church as an authoritative witness to its teaching and practice (see [[Fathers of the Church]]: those who were not completely orthodox but nonetheless had a major impact on Christianity, such as [[Origen]] and [[Tertullian]], are called "ecclesiastical writers" instead).
*"Mama" is the local native language term for English speaking Anglican priests in the Anglican [[Church of Melanesia]]. It means "father" in several local languages in [[Vanuatu]] and the [[Solomon Islands]].

===Archbishop===
*In Christianity, an [[archbishop]] is an elevated [[bishop]], responsible for all churches belonging to a religious group of a particular district.
*A bishop at the head of an [[Ecclesiastical Province|ecclesiastical province]] or one of equivalent honorary rank.

==Issues==
There are contrasting views on the level of compensation given to ministers relative to the religious community. There is often an expectation that they and their families will shun ostentation. However, there are situations where they are well rewarded for successfully attracting people to their religious community or enhancing the status or power of the community.

The  [[ordination of women]] has increasingly become accepted within many global religious faith groups, with some women now holding the most senior positions in these organizational hierarchies. There is disagreement between various global church denominations, and within membership of denominations, regarding whether women can be ministers.

There was notable contention over the issue of [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|ordination of practicing homosexuals]] in the 1980s within the [[United Church of Canada]], and in the 1990s and early 21st century within the [[PCUSA|Presbyterian Church USA]]. [[The Episcopal Church]], the American branch of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], was {{As of|2016|lc=y}} divided over the issue of ordination of practising homosexuals. This conflict severely damaged relationships between Anglicans in North America and in the [[Third World|third world]], especially [[Africa]] and southeast [[Asia]], and has [[Continuing Anglican movement|caused a schism in the American Anglican church]].

==Styles and forms of address==
{{Main|Ecclesiastical titles and styles}}
In the majority of churches, ordained ministers are styled "[[The Reverend]]". However, as stated above, some are styled "Pastor" and others do not use any religious style or form of address, and are addressed as any other person, e.g. as Mr, Ms, Miss, Mrs or by name.

===Anglican===
[[File:Canterbury Cap.jpg|thumb|An Anglican minister delivers a homily, dressed in choir habit with [[Canterbury cap]]]]
In Anglican churches the style for ordained ministers varies according to their office, as below.&lt;ref&gt;See "How to address the Clergy" in [http://www.crockford.org.uk/standard.asp?id=116 Crockford Clerical Directory], including the online version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forms of clerical address outlined at [http://www.debretts.co.uk/forms-of-address/professions/religion/church-of-england.aspx Debretts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723194807/http://www.debretts.co.uk/forms-of-address/professions/religion/church-of-england.aspx |date=2012-07-23 }} etiquette guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Priests and deacons, from ordination onwards—''The Reverend''
*Priests and deacons appointed as [[Canon (priest)|canons]]—''The Reverend Canon''
*Deans (or Provosts) of a cathedral church—''The Very Reverend''
*Archdeacons of a diocese or region—''The Venerable''
*Bishops (diocesan, suffragan, or coadjutor)—''The Right Reverend''
*Archbishops (and other [[Primate (bishop)|primate bishops]])—''The Most Reverend''

In all cases, the formal style should be followed by a Christian name or initial, e.g. the Reverend John Smith, or the Reverend J. Smith, but never just the Reverend Smith.

These are formal styles. In normal speech (either addressing the clergy or referring to them) other forms of address are often used. For all clergy this may include the titles "Father" (male) or "Mother" (female), particularly in the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition, or simply the appropriate secular title (Mister, Doctor, etc.) for that person, particularly in the evangelical tradition; it is also increasingly common to dispense with formal addresses and titles in favour of verbal address simply by given name. Bishops may be addressed as "My Lord", and less formally as "Bishop". Similarly, archbishops may be addressed as "Your Grace", and less formally as "Archbishop". The titles "My Lord" and "Your Grace" refer to the places held by these [[prelates]] in the [[Church of England]] within the [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|order of precedence]] of the state; however, the same titles are also extended to bishops and archbishops of other Anglican churches, outside England.
As Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion, its presbyterate includes priests who consider themselves no different in any respect from those of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], some parishes and dioceses in "[[Low Church]]" or Evangelical circles prefer to use the title ''[[presbyter]]'' or "minister"  in order to distance themselves from the more sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the word "priest". While priest is the official term for a member of the presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide, the ordination rite of certain provinces (including the [[Church of England]]) recognizes the breadth of opinion by adopting the title ''The Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minister or Priest?|author=Anglican Church of Canada|url=http://www.anglican.ca/help/faq/minister-or-priest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic===
In the Roman Catholic Church the form of address depends on the office the person holds, and the country in which he is being addressed as they are usually identical to the titles used by their feudal or governmental equals. In most English-speaking countries the forms of address are:
*A priest is usually referred to as ''Father'', and sometimes as ''Your Reverence'' or ''Reverend Father''.
*A [[monsignor]] is addressed as "Monsignor."  
*A bishop is addressed as ''Your Excellency'' or, less formally, ''Excellency''. In Britain and some other countries they are formally addressed as ''My Lord'' or ''My Lord Bishop''.
*An archbishop is also addressed as ''Your Excellency'' or, less formally, ''Excellency''. In Britain and some other countries they are formally addressed as ''Your Grace''.
*A cardinal is addressed as ''Your Eminence''.
*The [[Pope]] of the Roman Catholic Church is often addressed as ''Holy Father'' or ''Your Holiness''.
In France, secular priests (diocesan priests) are addressed "Monsieur l'Abbé" or, if a parish priest, as "Monsieur le Curé". In Germany and Austria priests are addressed as "Hochwürden" (meaning "very worthy") or with their title of office (Herr Pfarrer, i.e. Mr. Parson). in Italy as "Don" followed by his name (e.g. "Don Luigi Perrone").

Religious priests (members of religious orders) are addressed "Father" in all countries (Père, Pater, Padre etc.).

Up until the 19th century secular clergy in English-speaking countries were usually addressed as "Mister" (which was, in those days, a title reserved for gentleman, those outside the gentry being called by name and surname only), and only priests in religious orders were formally called "Father". In the early 19th century it became customary to call all priests "Father".

In the Middle Ages, before the Reformation, secular priests were entitled as knights, with the prefix "Sir". See examples in Shakespeare's plays like Sir Christopher Urswick in Richard III. This is closer to the Italian and Spanish "Don" which derives from the Latin "Dominus" meaning "Lord;" in English, the prefix "Dom" is used for priests who are [[monk]]s, a prefix which was spelled "Dan" in Middle English. The French "Monsieur" (like the German "Mein Herr", the Italian "Signor" and the Spanish "Señor") also signifies "My Lord", a title commonly used in times past for any person of rank, clerical or lay.

The term "minister" is used by the Catholic Church in some cases, such as the head of the Franciscans being the Minister General.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek-Catholic Church, all clergy are called "Father", including deacons, who are titled "Father Deacon", "Deacon Father", or simply "Father". Depending on the institution, seminarians may be titled "Brother", "Brother Seminarian", "Father Seminarian" or simply "Father". Their wives are  usually addressed as "presvytera", "matushka" or "khourriyye" as in the Orthodox world and also by their first names. Greek-Catholic Patriarchs are addressed as ''Your Beatitude''. Eastern clergy are usually addressed by their Christian or ordination name, not their surname.

===Orthodox===

====Greek and other Orthodox churches====
The form of address for Orthodox clergy varies according to order, rank and level of education. The most common forms are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goarch.org/special/usvisit2004/clergy/salutations |title=Greetings &amp; Salutations to Orthodox Clergy |access-date=2008-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612190208/http://www.goarch.org/special/usvisit2004/clergy/salutations |archive-date=2011-06-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">A '''nemeton''' was a [[place of worship|sacred space]] of [[Celtic polytheism|ancient Celtic religion]]. ''Nemeta'' appear to have been primarily situated in natural areas, and, as they often utilized [[tree]]s, they are often interpreted as [[sacred groves]].&lt;ref name=Koch1350&gt;Koch, p. 1350.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other evidence suggests that the word implied a wider variety of ritual spaces, such as [[shrine]]s and [[temple]]s.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowden134&gt;Dowden, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for nemeta consists chiefly of inscriptions and [[toponymy|place-names]], which occur all across the [[Celts|Celtic]] world. Toponyms related to the word ''nemeton'' occur as far west as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in the Iberian peninsula, as far north as [[Scotland]], and as far east as central [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; The word is related to the name of the [[Nemetes]] tribe living by the Rhine between the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] and [[Lake Constance]] in what is now [[Germany]], and their goddess [[Nemetona]].&lt;ref name=Koch1350/&gt;

==Contemporary description==
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] wrote that [[druid]]s did not meet in stone temples or other constructions, but in sacred groves of trees. In his ''[[Pharsalia]]'' Lucan described such a grove near [[Marseilles|Massilia]] in dramatic terms more designed to evoke a shiver of delicious horror among his Roman hearers than meant as proper natural history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;no bird nested in the nemeton, nor did any animal lurk nearby; the leaves constantly shivered though no breeze stirred. Altars stood in its midst, and the images of the gods. Every tree was stained with sacrificial blood. the very earth groaned, dead yews revived; unconsumed trees were surrounded with flame, and huge serpents twined round the oaks. The people feared to approach the grove, and even the priest would not walk there at midday or midnight lest he should then meet its divine guardian.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples==
Descriptions of such sites have been found all across the Celtic world. Attested examples include ''Nemetobriga'' near [[Ourense]] in northwestern [[Spain]], ''Drunemeton'' in [[Galatia]], and ''Medionemeton'' near the [[Antonine Wall]] in what is now [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

* ''Mars Lucetius'' ("Shining Mars")&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), 2nd edition, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nemetona appear as a divine couple in Roman-era inscriptions. At the [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] site in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], a dedication was made to Mars Loucetius and Nemetona by a pilgrim who had come from the continental [[Treveri]] of [[Gallia Belgica]] to seek healing.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Birkham, entry on "Loucetius," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', edited by John Koch (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 1192; [[Bernhard Maier]], ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Boydell Press, 1997, 2000, originally published 1994 in German), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Mars Rigonemetis'' ("Mars, King of the Sacred Grove") appears in the context of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]] in a dedication discovered at [[Nettleham]] ([[Lincolnshire]]) in 1961. He may have been a god belonging to the tribe of the [[Corieltauvi]].&lt;ref&gt;Miranda J. Green. "Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend" (Thames and Hudson Ltd., 1997), p. 142.&lt;!--needs checked--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* A nemeton is in the Roman placename ''Vernemeton'' (now Willoughby-on-the-Wolds, Nottinghamshire), in Roman ''Aquae Arnemetiae'' (now [[Buxton]], Derbyshire), and in the 1194 reference to Nametwihc, "Sanctuary-Town," ([[Nantwich]], Cheshire).&lt;ref&gt;E.Ekwall, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Place-Names'' (Oxford) 1936:320 col. a.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Scotland, ''nemeton'' place-names are quite frequent,&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Watson, ''History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland'' (Edinburgh) 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; as they are in [[Devon]], where they appear in modern names containing Nymet or Nympton, and have been identified with the name ''Nemetostatio'' in the [[Ravenna Cosmography]].
*A well known nemeton site is in the [[:fr:Névet|Névet forest]] near [[Locronan]] in [[Brittany]] (cf. Modern Breton ''neved'' 'sanctuary', Welsh ''nyfed''). [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]], in the Oise department of France, also houses the remains of a nemeton. Echoes of the word ''nemeton'' survive in many French place-names such as ''Novionemetum'' (''noviios'' 'new') that evolved to [[Nonant]], [[Nonant-le-Pin]], etc., ''*Nemeto-pons'', with Latin ''pons'' 'bridge' : [[Nampont]] and ''Nemetodurum'' 'door' or 'forum of the temple' : [[Nanterre]]. In Paris, a case has been made for "Namet" in a line of doggerel of about 1270, as the ancient name for the ''Quartier du Temple'' on the Right Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Herbert Gray|Louis H.

A '''new religious movement''' ('''NRM'''), also known as a '''new religion''' or '''alternative spirituality''', is a [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] group that has modern origins and is peripheral to its society's dominant religious culture. NRMs can be novel in origin or part of a wider religion, in which case they are distinct from pre-existing [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s. Some NRMs deal with the challenges posed by the modernizing world by embracing individualism, whereas others seek tightly knit collective means.&lt;ref name="Clarke, Peter B 2006"&gt;Clarke, Peter B. 2006. New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have estimated that NRMs now number in the tens of thousands worldwide, with most of their members living in Asia and Africa. Most have only a few members, some have thousands, and a few have more than a million members.&lt;ref name = barker1999&gt;[[Eileen Barker]], 1999, "New Religious Movements: their incidence and significance", ''New Religious Movements: challenge and response'', Bryan Wilson and Jamie Cresswell editors, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0415200504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New religions have often faced a hostile reception from established religious organisations and various secular institutions. In Western nations, a secular [[anti-cult movement]] and a Christian [[countercult movement]] emerged during the 1970s and 1980s to oppose emergent groups.  In the 1970s, the distinct field of new religions studies developed within the academic study of religion. There are now several scholarly organisations and peer-reviewed journals devoted to the subject. Religious studies scholars contextualize the rise of NRMs in modernity, relating it as a product of and answer to modern processes of secularization, globalization, detraditionalization, fragmentation, reflexivity, and individualization.&lt;ref name="Clarke, Peter B 2006"/&gt;

Scholars continue to try to reach definitions and define boundaries.&lt;ref name="cesnur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2001/mi_june03.htm |title=The Future of Religion and the Future of New Religions |accessdate=2006-12-13 |author=Introvi gne, Massimo |date=June 15, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no singular, agreed-upon criterion for defining a "new religious movement",{{sfn|Oliver|2012|pp=5–6}} but the term usually suggests that the group is of recent origin and is different from existing religions.&lt;ref name="cesnur" /&gt; There is debate as to how the term "new" should be interpreted in this context.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}} One perspective is that it should designate a religion that is more recent in its origins than large, well-established religions like [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}} An alternate perspective is that "new" should mean that a religion is more recent in its formation.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}} Some scholars view the 1950s or the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945 as the defining time, while others look as far back as the founding of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in 1830.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}}&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt; According to ''New Religious Movements: A Documentary Reader'', New Religious Movements are “new (or old) religious groups that may or may not claim to be religious, and that are organizations more often than they are movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OamONYGTiDUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=new+religious+movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiStMCy3PXeAhWUFTQIHRc3Bp4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20religious%20movements&amp;f=false|title=New Religious Movements: A Documentary Reader|last=Daschke|first=Dereck|last2=Ashcraft|first2=Michael|last3=Ashcraft|first3=W.

==History==
[[File:Swami Vivekananda at Parliament of Religions.jpg|thumb | right |250px| 1893 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]]]]
In 1830 the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was founded by [[Joseph Smith]].  It is now one of the most successful NRMs in terms of membership. In Japan, 1838 marks the beginning of [[Tenrikyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|title=The Doctrine of Tenrikyo|date=1954|publisher=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|location=Tenri, Nara, Japan|page=3|edition=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844 [[Bábism]] was established in [[Iran]] from which the [[Bahá'í Faith]] was founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 1863. In 1860 [[Donghak]], later [[Cheondoism]], was founded by Choi Jae-Woo in [[Korea]]. It later ignited the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="Yao"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yao | first = Xinzhong | title = An Introduction to Confucianism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0521644305 | pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Ahmadiyya]] an Islamic sect was founded by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]].  In 1891, the [[Unity Church]], the first [[New Thought]] denomination, was founded in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = siegler2007&gt;[[Elijah Siegler]], 2007, ''New Religious Movements'', [[Prentice Hall]], {{ISBN|0131834789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EBOnline&gt;{{cite web| title = Unity School of Christianity| work = Encyclopædia Britannica Online| publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| date = | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/617994/Unity-School-of-Christianity| doi = | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, the first [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] was held in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McRae|first=John R. |year=1991|title=Oriental Verities on the American Frontier: The 1893 World's Parliament of Religions and the Thought of Masao Abe|journal=Buddhist-Christian Studies|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|volume=11|pages=7–36|doi=10.2307/1390252|jstor=1390252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference included NRMs of the time such as [[spiritualism]] and [[Christian Science]]. The latter was represented by its founder [[Mary Baker Eddy]]. [[Henry Harris Jessup]] addressing the meeting was the first to mention the Bahá'í Faith in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/first_public_mentions_west First Public Mentions of the Bahá'í Faith]&lt;/ref&gt; Also attending were [[Soyen Shaku]], the "First American Ancestor" of [[Zen]],&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| title =Zen Master Who?| publisher =[[Wisdom Publications]]| year =2006| pages =59–62| url =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] preacher [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], and the [[Jainism|Jain]] preacher [[Virchand Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jain|first1=Pankaz|title=Virchand Gandhi, A Gandhi Before Gandhi |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=80894 |publisher=herenow4u |author2=Pankaz Hingarh |author3=Dr. Bipin Doshi and Smt.

In 1911, the [[Nazareth Baptist Church]], the first and one of the largest modern [[African initiated church]]es, was founded by [[Isaiah Shembe]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

New religious movements expanded in many nations in the 1950s and 1960s. Japanese new religions became very popular after the [[Shinto Directive]] (1945) forced a separation of the Japanese government and [[Shinto]], which had been the [[state religion]], bringing about greater [[freedom of religion]]. In 1954 [[Scientology]] was founded in the United States and the [[Unification Church]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt; In 1955 the [[Aetherius Society]] was founded in [[England]]. It and some other NRMs, have been called [[UFO religion]]s since they combine belief in [[extraterrestrial life]] with traditional religious principles.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher Hugh (ed.)

In 1966 the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] was founded in the United States by [[A. C.

[[File:Origins-GuangzhouPractice.jpg|left|thumb|Practitioners of Falun Dafa perform spiritual exercises in [[Guangzhou]], China.]]
In the late 1980s and the 1990s, the decline of communism and the [[revolutions of 1989]] opened up new opportunities for NRMs. [[Falun Gong]] was first taught publicly in [[Northeast China]] in 1992 by [[Li Hongzhi]]. At first it was accepted by the Chinese government and by 1999 there were 70 million practitioners in China.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Faison (27 April 1999) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest.html In Beijing: A Roar of Silent Protestors], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, many NRMs are using the [[Internet]] to give out information, to recruit members, and sometimes to hold online meetings and rituals.&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt; That is sometimes referred to as [[cybersectarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Virilio,''The Information Bomb'' (Verso, 2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rita M. Hauck, "Stratospheric Transparency: Perspectives on Internet Privacy, ''Forum on Public Policy'' (Summer 2009) {{cite web |url=http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/summer09/archivesummer09/hauck.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420215019/http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/summer09/archivesummer09/hauck.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabina Magliocco]], professor of Anthropology and Folklore at [[California State University, Northridge]], has discussed joining NRMs in terms of its growing popularity due to reading, social and political interests, and most importantly, the Internet. With more than 20,000 websites and chat rooms devoted to Pagan topics, young people are increasingly using the Internet to form communities around NRMs rather than meeting in person.&lt;ref&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. 2012. “Neopaganism.” In O. Hammer and M. Rothstein, Eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to New Religious Movements'', pp. 150-166''.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[J. Gordon Melton]], executive director of the Institute for the Study of American Religions at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that 40 to 45 new religious movements emerge each year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/nyregion/28religion.html?pagewanted=print Seeking Entry-Level Prophet: Burning Bush and Tablets Not Required], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, religious scholar Elijah Siegler said that, though no NRM had become the dominant faith in any country, many of the concepts they first introduced (often referred to as "[[New Age]]" ideas) have become part of worldwide mainstream culture.&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt;

As noted by Barker, NRMs cannot all be "lumped together" and differ from one another on many issues.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=1}}
Virtually no generalisation can be made about NRMs that applies to every single group,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=10}} with Barrett noting that "generalizations tend not to be very helpful" when studying NRMs.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=9}} Melton expressed the view that there is "no single characteristic or set of
characteristics" that all new religions share, "not even their newness."{{sfn|Melton|2004|p=76}} [[Bryan R. Wilson|Bryan Wilson]] wrote, "Chief among the miss-directed assertions has been the tendency to speak of new religious movements as if they differed very little, if at all, one from another. The tendency has been to lump them altogether and indiscriminately to attribute to all of them characteristics which are, in fact, valid for only one or two."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/115621228/Why-the-Bruderhof-is-not-a-cult-by-Bryan-Wilson|title=Why the Bruderhof is not a cult - by Bryan Wilson {{!}} Cult And Sect {{!}} Religion And Belief|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRMs themselves often claim that they exist at a crucial place in time and space.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=6}}

===Scriptures===
Some NRMs have their own unique [[scriptures]], while others reinterpret existing texts,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]], 2011, ''The Message and the Book'', UK, [[Atlantic Books]], page 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing a range of older elements.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=7}} They frequently claim that these are not new, but rather had been forgotten truths that are only now being revived.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=8}}  NRM scriptures often incorporate modern [[scientific]] knowledge, sometimes with the claim that they are bringing unity to science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Zeller | first=Benjamin | title=Prophets and Protons: New Religious Movements and Science in Late Twentieth-Century America | publisher=New York University Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-8147-9721-1 | pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some NRMs believe that their scriptures are received through the process of [[mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bloomsbury Companion to New Religious Movements, George D. Chryssides, Benjamin E. Zeller, A&amp;C Black, Jan 2, 2014, page 214&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Urantia Book]]'', the core scripture of the Urantia Movement, was published in 1955 and is said to be the product of a continuous process of [[revelation]] from "celestial beings" which began in 1911.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=11}}  Some NRMs, particularly those that are forms of [[occultism]], have a prescribed system of courses and grades through which members can progress.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=57}}

===Celibacy===
Many NRMs promote [[celibacy]], the state of voluntarily being unmarried, sexually abstinent, or both.  Some, including the [[Shakers]] and more recent NRMs inspired by [[Hindu]] traditions, see it as a lifelong commitment. Others, including the [[Unification Church]], as a stage in spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching New Religious Movements, [[David G. Bromley]], Oxford University Press, May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In some [[Buddhist]]  NRMs celibacy is practiced mostly by older women who become [[nuns]].&lt;ref&gt;New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response, Jamie Cresswell, Bryan Wilson, Routledge, Dec 6, 2012, page 153&lt;/ref&gt; Some people join NRMs and practice celibacy as a [[rite of passage]] in order to move beyond previous sexual problems or bad experiences.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, Volume 1, James R Lewis, OUP USA, Jul 17, 2008, page 385&lt;/ref&gt;  Groups that promote [[celibacy]] require a strong recruitment drive to survive; the Shakers established orphanages to bring new individuals into their community.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=67}}

===Violence===
Violent incidents involving NRMs are extremely rare and unusual. In those cases where large number of casualties resulted, the new religion in question was led by a charismatic leader.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=83}}  Beginning in 1978 with the deaths of 913 members of the [[Peoples Temple]] in [[Jonestown]], Guyana by both murder and suicide an image of "killer cults" came to public attention. A number of subsequent events contributed to this.  In 1994, a members of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] committed suicide in Canada and Switzerland. In 1995 members of the Japanese new religion [[Aum Shinrikyo]] murdered a number of people, including through a [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|sarin attack on the Tokyo subway]]. In 1997, 39 members of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] group committed suicide in the belief that their spirits would leave the Earth and join a passing comet.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=82}}   There have also been cases where members of NRMs have been killed because they engaged in dangerous actions while believing themselves to be invincible; in Uganda several hundred members of the [[Holy Spirit Movement]] were killed as they approached gunfire because its leader, [[Alice Lakwena]], told them that they would be protected from bullets by the oil of the [[shea tree]].{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=55}}

===Leadership and succession===
[[File:Mary Baker Eddy cph.3b20582.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Mary Baker Eddy]]]]
Many NRMs are founded and led by a charismatic leader.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} The death of any religion's founder represents a significant moment in its history.   Over the months and years following its leader's death, the movement can die out, fragment into multiple groups, consolidate its position, or change its nature to become something quite different that what its founder intended. In some cases a NRM moves closer to the religious mainstream after the death of its founder.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=58–60}}

A number of founders of new religions established plans for succession to prevent confusion after their deaths.   [[Mary Baker Eddy]], the American founder of [[Christian Science]], spent fifteen years working on her book ''The Manual of the Mother Church'', which laid out how the group should be run by her successors.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=66}} [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of [[Scientology]], promoted his follower [[David Miscavige]] to be in a position to take over leadership of the Scientology organization at his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gallagher  | first =  Eugene V.  |author2=W.

==Membership==
===Demographics===
NRMs typically consist largely of first-generation believers,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=11}} and thus often have a younger average membership than mainstream religious congregations.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=11–12}}  Some NRMS have been formed by groups who have split from a pre-existing religious group.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} As these members grow older, many have children who are then brought up within the NRM.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=12}}

In the [[Third World]], NRMs most often appeal to the poor and oppressed sectors of society.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=14}}  Within Western countries, they are more likely to appeal to members of the middle and upper-middle classes,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=14}} with Barrett stating that new religions in the UK and US largely attract "white, middle-class late teens and twenties."{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=98}}  There are exceptions, such as the [[Rastafari]] movement and the [[Nation of Islam]],  which have primarily attracted disadvantaged black youth in Western countries.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=14}}

A popular conception, unsupported by evidence, holds that those who convert to new religions are either mentally ill or become so through their involvement with them.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=55–56}}  [[Dick Anthony]], a [[forensics|forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] noted for his writings on the [[brainwashing]] controversy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorne L. Dawson|Dawson, Lorne L.]]. ''Cults in context: readings in the study of new religious movements'', Transaction Publishers 1998, p. 340, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0478-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Robbins, Thomas]]. ''In Gods we trust: new patterns of religious pluralism in America'', Transaction Publishers 1996, p. 537, {{ISBN|978-0-88738-800-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defended NRMs, and in 1988 argued that involvement in such movements may often be beneficial: "There's a large research literature published in mainstream journals on the mental health effects of new religions. For the most part the effects seem to be positive in any way that's measurable."&lt;ref name="Sipchen"&gt;Sipchen, Bob (1988-11-17). [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/vw-257_1_cult-battle/3 "Ten Years After Jonestown, the Battle Intensifies Over the Influence of 'Alternative' Religions"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining===
[[File:Casaemcasa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Evangelism|Jehovah's Witnesses evangelising]] from house to house]]
Those who convert to a NRM typically believe that in doing so they are gaining some benefit in their life. This can come in many forms, from an increasing sense of freedom, to a release from drug dependency, and a feeling of self-respect and direction. Many of those who have left NRMs report that they have gained from their experience. There are various reasons as to why an individual would join and then remain part of an NRM, including both push and pull factors.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=25–26}}  According to [[Marc Galanter (psychiatrist)|Marc Galanter]], Professor of Psychiatry at [[NYU]],&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Marc (Editor), (1989), ''Cults and new religious movements: a report of the committee on psychiatry and religion of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'', {{ISBN|0-89042-212-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; typical reasons why people join NRMs include a search for community and a spiritual quest. Sociologists [[Rodney Stark|Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge|Bainbridge]], in discussing the process by which people join new religious groups, have questioned the utility of the concept of ''conversion'', suggesting that ''affiliation'' is a more useful concept.&lt;ref&gt;Bader, Chris &amp; A. Demaris, ''A test of the Stark-Bainbridge theory of affiliation with religious cults and sects.'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 35, 285-303. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular explanation for why people join new religious movements is that they have been "[[brainwashing|brainwashed]]" or subject to "mind control" by the NRM itself.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=17}} This explanation provides a rationale for 'deprogramming', a process in which members of NRMs are illegally kidnapped by individuals who then attempt to convince them to reject their beliefs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=17}} Professional deprogrammers therefore have a financial interest in promoting the 'brainwashing' explanation.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=19}} Academic research however has demonstrated that these brainwashing techniques "simply do not exist".{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=3}}

===Leaving===
Many members of NRMs leave these groups of their own free will.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=18–19}} Some of those who do so retain friends within the movement.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=47}}  Some of those who leave a religious community are unhappy with the time that they spent as part of it.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=47}}  Leaving a NRM can pose a number of difficulties.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=54}} It may result in them having to abandon a daily framework that they had previously adhered to.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=55}} It may also generate mixed emotions as ex-members lose the feelings of absolute certainty that they had held while in the group.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=54}}

==Reception==
=== Academic scholarship ===
{{Main|Academic study of new religious movements}}
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Three basic questions have been paramount in orienting theory and research on NRMs: what are the identifying markers of NRMs that distinguish them from other types of religious groups?; what are the different types of NRMs and how do these different types relate to the established institutional order of the host society?; and what are the most important ways that NRMs respond to the sociocultural dislocation that leads to their formation?"|source=— Sociologist of religion [[David G. Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The academic study of new religious movements is known as 'new religions studies' (NRS).{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barker noted that there are five sources of information on NRMs: the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS utilises are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

Most research has been directed toward those new religions that attract public controversy. Less controversial NRMs tend to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions often avoid researching certain movements that scholars from other backgrounds study. The [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} {{See also|Is Theosophy a Religion?#Criticism}}

===Definitions  and terminology===
[[File:Rainbow Gathering Bosnia 2007.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A New Age [[Rainbow Gathering]] in Bosnia, 2007]]
[[J. Gordon Melton]] argued that, "new religious movements" should be defined by the way dominant religious and secular forces within a given society treat them. According to him, NRMs constituted "those religious groups that have been found, from the perspective of the dominant religious community (and in the West that is almost always a form of Christianity), to be not just different, but unacceptably different."{{sfn|Melton|2004|p=79}} Barker cautioned against Melton's approach, arguing that negating the "newness" of "new religious movements" raises problems, for it is "the very fact that NRMs are new that explains many of the key characteristics they display".{{sfn|Barker|2004|p=89}}

Scholars of religion [[Olav Hammer]] and [[Mikael Rothstein]] argued that "new religions are just young religions" and "not inherently different" from mainstream and established religious movements, with the differences between the two having been greatly exaggerated by the media and popular perceptions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=3}} Melton has stated that those NRMs that "were offshoots of older religious groups... tended to resemble their parent group far more than each other."{{sfn|Melton|2004|p=76}}  One question that faces scholars of religion is when a new religious movement ceases to be "new."{{sfn|Barker|2004|p=99}}   As noted by Barker, "In the first century, Christianity was new, in the seventh century Islam was new, in the eighteenth century Methodism was new, in the nineteenth century the Seventh-day Adventists, Christadelphians and Jehovah's Witnesses were new; in the twenty-first century the Unification Church, ISKCON and Scientology are beginning to look old."{{sfn|Barker|2004|p=99}}

Some NRMs are strongly [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] and 'alternative' in the society they appear in, while others are far more similar to a society's established traditional religions.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=5}} Generally, Christian denominations are not seen as new religious movements; nevertheless, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christian Science]], and the [[Shakers]] have been studied as NRMs.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition, ''New Religious Movements''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Olson, ''Public Perception of "Cults" and "New Religious Movements"'', Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 2006, 45 (1): 97-106&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also problems in the use of "religion" within the term "new religious movements".{{sfn|Oliver|2012|pp=14–15}} This is because various groups, particularly active within the [[New Age]] milieu, have many traits in common with different NRMs but emphasise [[personal development]] and [[humanistic psychology]], and are not clearly  "religious" in nature.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=15}}

[[File:Þingblót 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A procession of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathens]], members of a modern Pagan new religion, in Iceland]]

Since at least the early 2000s, most sociologists of religion have used the term "new religious movement" to avoid the pejorative undertones of terms like "[[cult]]" and "sect".{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=24}} These are words that have been used in different ways by different groups.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=19}} For instance, from the nineteenth century onward a number of sociologists used the terms "cult" and "sect" in very specific ways.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=23}} The sociologist [[Ernst Troeltsch]] for instance differentiated "churches" from "sect" by claiming that the former term should apply to groups that stretch across social strata while "sects" typically contain converts from socially disadvantaged sectors of society.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=23}}

The term "cult" is used in reference to devotion or dedication to a particular person or place.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=21}} For instance, within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] devotion to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] is usually termed the "[[Cult of Mary]]".{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=21–22}} It is also used in non-religious contexts to refer to [[fandom]]s devoted to television shows like ''[[The Prisoner]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=22}} In the United States, people began to use "cult" in a pejorative manner, to refer to [[Spiritualism]] and [[Christian Science]] during the 1890s.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=17}} As commonly used, for instance in sensationalist tabloid articles, the term "cult" continues to have pejorative associations.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=20}}

The term "new religions" is a [[calque]] of {{nihongo||新宗教|shinshūkyō}}, a Japanese term developed to describe the proliferation of [[Japanese new religions]] in the years following the [[Second World War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=19}} From Japan this term was translated and used by several American authors, including [[Jacob Needleman]], to describe the range of groups that appeared in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] during the 1960s.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=19}} This term, amongst others, was adopted by Western scholars as an alternative to "[[cult]]".&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "new religious movements" has failed to gain widespread public usage in the manner that "cult" has.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=6}} Other terms that has been employed for many NRMs is "alternative religion" and "alternative spirituality", something used to convey the difference between these groups and established or mainstream religious movements while at the same time evading the problem posed by groups that are not particularly new.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=2001|1p=24|2a1=Oliver|2y=2012|2p=13}}

The 1970s was the era of the so-called "cult wars," led by "cult-watching groups."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Eileen. 2010. "Stepping out of the Ivory Tower: A Sociological Engagement in ‘The Cult Wars.’" Methodological Innovations Online 6(1): 20. http://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology/pdf/Barker-Stepping-Out.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of the anti-cult movement condensed a [[moral panic]] around the concept of cults. Public fears around Satanism, in particular, came to be known as a distinct phenomenon, the "[[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic Panic]]."&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Jesper Aagaard. 2004. "Modern Satanism: Dark Doctrines and Black Flames." In Controversial New Religions, edited by James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aagaard Petersen. New York: Oxford University Press. doi: 10.1093/019515682X.003.0019&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, scholars such as [[Eileen Barker]], [[James T. Richardson]], [[Timothy Miller]] and [[Catherine Wessinger]] argued that the term "cult" had become too laden with negative connotations, and "advocated dropping its use in academia." A number of alternatives to the term "new religious movement" are used by some scholars. These include "alternative religious movements" (Miller), "emergent religions" (Ellwood) and "marginal religious movements" (Harper and Le Beau).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Paul J. Olson, ''The Public Perception of "Cults" and "New Religious Movements"'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion; Mar2006, Vol. 45 Issue 1, 97-106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian countercult movement====
In the 1930s, Christian critics of NRMs began referring to them as "cults".  The 1938 book ''The Chaos of Cults'' by Jan Karel van Baalen (1890–1968), an ordained minister in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]], was especially influential.&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.K.van Baalen, ''The Chaos of Cults'', 4th rev.ed.Grand Rapids: William Eerdmans Publishing, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[Christian Research Institute]] was founded in 1960 by [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] to counter opposition to evangelical Christianity and has come to focus on criticisms of NRMs.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=104–105}} Presently the [[Christian countercult movement]] opposes most NRMs because of [[Theology|theological]] differences.  It is closely associated with [[evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=97}} The UK-based [[Reachout Trust]] was initially established to oppose the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and what it regarded as "counterfeit Christian groups",{{cite quote|date=May 2018}} but it came to wider attention in the late 1980s and 1990s for its role in promoting claims about [[Satanic ritual abuse]].

====Anti-cult movement====
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a number of highly visible new religious movements... [These] seemed so outlandish that many people saw them as evil cults, fraudulent organizations or scams that recruited unaware people by means of mind-control techniques. Real or serious religions, it was felt, should appear in recognizable institutionalized forms, be suitably ancient, and – above all – advocate relatively familiar theological notions and modes of conduct. Most new religions failed to comply with such standards."|source=— Religious studies scholars Olav Hammer and Mikael Rothstein{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=2}} }}
In the 1970s and 1980s some NRMs,  as well as some non-religious groups, came under opposition by the newly organized [[anti-cult movement]], which mainly charged them with [[psychological abuse]] of their own members.&lt;ref name="siegler2007"/&gt; It actively seeks to discourage people from joining new religions (which it refers to as "cults"). It also encourages members of these groups to leave them, and at times seeking to restrict their freedom of movement.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=97}}

Family members are often distressed when a relative of theirs joins a new religion.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=41}}  Although children break away from their parents for all manner of reasons, in cases where NRMS are involved it is often the latter that are blamed for the break.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=45–46}} Some anti-cultist groups emphasise the idea that "cults" always use deceit and trickery to recruit members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=29}} The anti-cult movement adopted the term ''brainwashing'', which had been developed by the journalist [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]] and then used by [[Robert J. Lifton]] to apply to the methods employed by Chinese to convert captured U.S. soldiers to their cause in the [[Korean War]]. Lifton himself had doubts about the applicability of his 'brainwashing' hypothesis to the techniques used by NRMs to convert recruits.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=30}} A number of ex-members of various new religions have made false allegations about their experiences in such groups. For instance, in the late 1980s a man in [[Dublin]], Ireland was given a three-year [[suspended sentence]] for falsely claiming that he had been drugged, kidnapped, and held captive by members of ISKCON.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=39}} Anti-cultists assert that leaders of NRMs depended on underhanded methods also called “mind-control” or “thought-reform”, “to impair the initiative and decision-making capacity of members."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OamONYGTiDUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=new+religious+movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiStMCy3PXeAhWUFTQIHRc3Bp4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20religious%20movements&amp;f=false|title=New Religious Movements: A Documentary Reader|last=Daschke|first=Dereck|last2=Ashcraft|first2=Michael|last3=Ashcraft|first3=W.

Scholars of religion have often critiqued anti-cult groups of un-critically believing anecdotal stories provided by the ex-members of new religions, of encouraging ex-members to think that they are the victims of manipulation and abuse, and of irresponsibly scare-mongering about NRMs.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=108}} Of the "well over a thousand groups that have been or might be called cults" listed in the files of [[INFORM]], says Eileen Barker, the "vast majority" have not engaged in criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Eileen (2009).

===Popular culture and news media===
{{Main|New religious movements and cults in popular culture}}
New religious movements and cults have appeared as themes or subjects in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]], while notable representatives of such groups have produced a large body of literary works.  Beginning in the 1700s authors in the English-speaking world began introducing members of "cults" as [[antagonists]].  [[Satanists]], sects of the Mormon movement, and [[Thuggees]] were popular choices.  In the Twentieth century concern for the rights and feelings of religious minorities led authors to most often invent fictional cults for their villains to be members of.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Brubaker, Fatale #21, 2014, Image, pages 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional cults continue to be popular in film, television, and gaming in the same way; while some popular works treat new religious movements in a serious manner.

[[Tabloid journalism|Tabloid]] articles have repeatedly combined the word "cult" with other terms to make their coverage more sensational, thus referring to various new religions as a "sex cult", "evil cult", or "suicide cult".{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=20}}   An article on the categorization of new religious movements in U.S. print media published by ''The Association for the Sociology of Religion'' (formerly the American ''Catholic Sociological Society''), criticizes the print media for failing to recognize social-scientific efforts in the area of new religious movements, and its tendency to use popular or anti-cultist definitions rather than social-scientific insight, and asserts that "The failure of the print media to recognize social-scientific efforts in the area of religious movement organizations impels us to add yet another failing mark to the media report card Weiss (1985) has constructed to assess the media's reporting of the social sciences."&lt;ref&gt;van Driel, Barend and James T. Richardson. ''Research Note Categorization of New Religious Movements in American Print Media''. Sociological Analysis 1988, 49, 2:171-183&lt;/ref&gt;

New Religious Movements are objects of what is called “othering.” The media “constructs symbolic identity markers that define membership in particular communities, compiles representations or portayals of those communities, and through a process of Othering, sets apart certain communities that are in need of social control.” Such a process is at the heart of the relationship of the media with NRM’s. According to James R. Lewis, “NRMs become folk devils, and journalists become the moral entrepreneurs who problematize NRMs, thereby constructing moral panics about these groups.” Tami M. Bereska, writing in ''Scientology in Popular Culture'' finds that the “innocuous repetition” in fictional programs such as The Simpsons, South Park and Family Guy contain implicit arguments that have moral implications. These arguments have an influence on the attitudes of individuals, through what Bereska calls “narrative persuasion.” Studies in a wide range of topics have shown the efficacy of narrative persuasion. A study revealed that participants reading a short story called “Murder at the Mall” “caused research participants to perceive shopping malls as unsafe spaces and increased their negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders.” Another study showed that participants who viewed the film ''Camino'', a film that portrayed the [[Opus Dei]] negatively, had a disapproving attitude towards the religious group after viewing the film. Another example is the image of cigarette smoking in movies, which was found to be more influential then tobacco advertising and marketing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bereska |first1=Tami M. |title=Scientology in Popular Culture |chapter=Hollywood Bites |editor-last=Kent |editor-first=Stephen A. |editor2-last=Raine |editor2-first=Susan |accessdate=2018-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nouriel Roubini''' (born March 29, 1958) is an American [[economist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nourielroubini.blogspot.de/2012/08/nouriel-roubini-biography-by-himself.html "Nouriel Roubini Biography By himself"], Aug. 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches at [[New York University]]'s [[Stern School of Business]] and is chairman of Roubini Macro Associates LLC, an economic consultancy firm.

The child of [[Persian Jews|Iranian Jews]], he was born in [[Turkey]] and grew up in [[Italy]]. After receiving a BA in political economics at [[Bocconi University]], [[Milan]] and a doctorate in [[international economics]] at [[Harvard University]], he became an academic at [[Yale]] and a visiting researcher/advisor at the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Federal Reserve]], [[World Bank]], and [[Bank of Israel]]. Much of his early research focused on [[emerging market]]s. During the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]], he was a senior economist for the [[Council of Economic Advisers]], later moving to the [[United States Treasury Department]] as a senior adviser to [[Timothy Geithner]], who in 2009 became [[Treasury Secretary]].

==Early life and education==
Nouriel Roubini was born in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], to [[Persian Jews|Iranian Jewish]] parents.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; When he was an infant, his family lived briefly in [[Iran]] and [[Israel]]. From 1962 to 1983 he resided in [[Italy]], especially in [[Milan]], where he attended the local Jewish school and then the [[Bocconi University]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], ''[[summa cum laude]]'', in [[economics]]. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[international economics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1988, where his adviser was [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He is a U.S. citizen and speaks [[English language|English]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hebrew]], and conversational [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name=Timesonline&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article6543267.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "Fame and Fortune: Nouriel Roubini"] ''Times Online'', June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He is a cousin of leading technology expert and former PC Magazine lead technology analyst Jonathan Roubini.&lt;ref name=Labreviews&gt;[http://www.labreviews.com/about-us/#Jonathan "Lab Reviews: Jonathan Roubini"] ''Lab Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:05082012Global governance063.jpg|thumb|Roubini at the Global Governance event of the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]]]]
For much of the 1990s, Roubini combined academic research with policy making by teaching at [[Yale]] and then in New York, while also being employed at the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Federal Reserve]], [[World Bank]], and [[Bank of Israel]]. Currently, he is a professor at the [[Stern School of Business]] at [[New York University]]. Long study of [[emerging market]] blowouts in Asia and Latin America helped him spot the looming disaster in the U.S. "I’ve been studying emerging markets for 20 years, and saw the same signs in the U.S. that I saw in them, which was that we were in a massive credit bubble," he said.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg1&gt;{{cite news | first = Simon | last = Kennedy | title = Roubini Sees Global Gloom After Davos Vindication (Update1) | date = 2009-01-30 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a6A9lCHrtAqk | work = Bloomberg | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, he joined the Clinton administration first as a senior economist in the White House Council of Economic Advisers and then moved to the Treasury department as a senior adviser to [[Timothy Geithner]], then the undersecretary for international affairs, who in 2009 became Treasury secretary in the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg1/&gt;

Roubini returned to the IMF in 2001 as a visiting scholar while it battled a financial meltdown in [[Argentina]]. He cowrote a book on saving bankrupt economies entitled, ''Bailouts or Bail-ins?'' and launched his own consulting firm. He is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2007.

===Role models===
He credits a number of economists for his understanding of economics.  He said, &lt;blockquote&gt;One person who has had a great impact on me intellectually was my adviser at [[Harvard]], [[Jeffrey Sachs]]. For me he’s the model of a great intellectual. He is both a rigorous academic and very human, involved in big picture issues such as poverty, [[AIDS]], and [[Africa]]. He’s someone with a great mind that is also very engaged with the world. Another intellectual hero is [[Larry Summers]], the former President of Harvard, an amazing intellectual and academic, who is very deeply involved with the policy world. I worked for him for many years in the US Treasury during the [[Clinton Administration]].&lt;ref name=Janera&gt;{{cite web | url = http://janera.com/2007/05/02/talking-to-nouriel-roubini/ | title = Talking to Nouriel Roubini | accessdate = 2011-03-09 | date = 2007-05-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713084406/http://janera.com/2007/05/02/talking-to-nouriel-roubini/ | archive-date = 2011-07-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Global nomad===
Roubini likes to refer to himself as a "[[global nomad]]", and says, "You can be sitting still surfing the Internet, and experience other worlds, ideas and societies. But I’ve found that there is nothing better than visiting a different country, even if for three days. ... [Y]ou can’t only be a virtual Global Nomad, with goggles on, in a virtual reality. You have to be there. You have to see it, smell it and live it. You have to see people, travel, and interact."&lt;ref name=Janera/&gt;

Partly to fulfill this need, he formed [[Roubini Global Economics]], an economic consultancy for [[financial analysis]]. In describing the purpose of RGE Monitor, he said, "the world is my home, so everything about society and culture—no matter how {{sic|min|iscule}}—is worth knowing. I am an information junkie and created RGE Monitor to collect information about what’s happening around the world."&lt;ref name=Janera/&gt;

Speaking of his early influences, Roubini said, "I was born into a relatively orthodox Jewish family in Iran, lived in Israel and Turkey, and then moved to Italy as a child. By the age of six, instead of going to a [[yeshiva]], I went to a [[secular]] Jewish school where I interacted with kids from all sorts of different backgrounds. Had I gone to an [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] Jewish school, I would perhaps be orthodox now and may have never become a Global Nomad."&lt;ref name=Janera/&gt;

Roubini announced on [[Twitter]] in early 2014 his new practice of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/01/22/dr-om-or-dr-doom-roubini-gets-meditative-in-davos/ ‘Dr. Om’ or ‘Dr. Doom’? Roubini gets meditative in Davos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roubini is also a member of the [[Berggruen Institute]]'s 21st Century Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berggruen Institute|url=http://governance.berggruen.org/councils/21st-century-council/members|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal investments===
During an interview in June 2009, he was asked about his personal lifestyle expenses and other investments. He said, "I regularly save about 30% of my income. Apart from my mortgage, I don’t have any other debts. The credit crunch hasn’t affected me much. . . . I’ve always lived within my means and, luckily, have never been out of work. I would say I’m a frugal person—I don’t have very expensive tastes. . . . You don’t need to spend a lot to enjoy things."&lt;ref name=Timesonline/&gt;

Asked whether he invests in stocks, he replied, "Not as much these days. I used to have a lot in equities—about 75%—but over the past three years, I’ve had about 95% in cash and 5% in equities. You’re not getting much from savings these days but earning 0% is better than losing 50%. . . . I don’t believe in picking individual stocks or assets. . . . Never invest your money as though you are gambling at the casino. Buying and selling individual stocks is a waste of time."&lt;ref name=Timesonline/&gt;

===Economic forecast===
Roubini is one of few economists who predicted the housing bubble crash of 2007-2008. He warned about the crisis in an IMF position paper in 2006.
Roubini's predictions have earned him the nicknames "Dr. Doom" and "permabear" in the media.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Mihm |authorlink= |title=Dr. Doom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html |work=New York Times |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, ''Fortune'' magazine wrote, "In 2005 Roubini said home prices were riding a speculative wave that would soon sink the economy. Back then the professor was called a [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra]].

By highlighting some of his many past predictions as being accurate, Roubini has promoted himself as a major figure in the U.S. and international debate about the economy, and spends much of his time shuttling between meetings with [[central bank]] governors and [[finance minister]]s in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Although he is ranked only 985th in terms of lifetime academic citations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html ''Ideas'']&lt;/ref&gt; he was #4 on ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine's list of the "top 100 global thinkers."&lt;ref name=fptop100&gt;{{cite journal | date=December 2009 | title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers | journal=[[Foreign Policy]] | publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] | location=Washington, D.C. | issn=0015-7228 | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/11/30/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,3 | accessdate=November 30, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202064302/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/11/30/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,3 | archive-date=December 2, 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 and 2012, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine as one of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top 100 Global Thinkers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,27 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2017-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107222101/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,27 |archive-date=2014-11-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,28 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers |date=26 November 2012 |work=Foreign Policy |accessdate=28 November 2012 |archivedate=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CViUyRpk?url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,33 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013 Roubini was awarded by [http://www.globalthinkersforum.org/ Global Thinkers Forum] the honorary GTF 2013 Award for Excellence in Global Thinking. He has appeared before Congress, the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and the [[World Economic Forum]] at [[Davos]].

====U.S. economy====
In the 1990s, Roubini studied the collapse of [[emerging economies]]. He used an intuitive, historical approach backed up by an understanding of theoretical models to analyze these countries and came to the conclusion that a common denominator was the large [[current account]] deficits financed by loans from abroad. Roubini theorized that the United States might be the next to suffer, and as early as 2004 began writing about a possible future collapse.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; ''Business Week'' magazine writer Michael Mandel, however, noted in 2006 that Roubini and other economists often make general predictions which could happen over multiyear periods.&lt;ref&gt;March 21, 2006 [http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2006/03/the_problem_wit.html "The Problem With Prediction Registries"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, he foresaw the end of the real estate bubble: "When supply increases, prices fall: that’s been the trend for 110 years, since 1890. But since 1997, real home prices have increased by about 90 percent. There is no economic fundamental—real income, migration, interest rates, demographics—that can explain this. It means there was a speculative bubble. And now that bubble is bursting." In the Spring 2006 issue of ''[[International Finance (journal)|International Finance]]'', he wrote an article titled "Why Central Banks Should Burst Bubbles"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118555660/abstract Article Abstract, ''International Finance'', Spring 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that central banks should take action against asset bubbles. When asked whether the real estate ride was over, he said, "Not only is it over, it’s going to be a nasty fall."&lt;ref name=NYM&gt;[http://nymag.com/realestate/features/21675/ "The Descent"], ''New York Magazine'', Sept. 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2009, he felt that analysts expecting the U.S. economy to rebound in the third and fourth quarter were "too optimistic".&lt;ref name=Bloomberg5-7&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20603037&amp;sid=aw8ry7hR04m4&amp;refer=home "Global Crisis ‘Vastly Worse’ Than 1930s, Taleb Says"] ''Bloomberg'', May 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He expected the full recession to last 24 or 36 months, and believed in the possibility of an "[[L-shaped recession|L-shaped]]" slow recovery that Japan went through in The [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=ayVsI_55G8.0 "Roubini Says Recession May Continue Until End of 2010"] ''Bloomberg'', March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion, much of the current recession's cause is due to "boom-and-bust cycles," and he feels the U.S. economy needs to find a different growth path in the future. "We’ve been growing through a period of time of repeated big bubbles," he said. "We’ve had a model of 'growth' based on overconsumption and lack of savings. And now that model has broken down because we borrowed too much."  He feels that too much human capital went into financing the "most unproductive form of capital, meaning housing" and would like to see America create a model of growth  in more-productive activities. He feels that "sustainable growth may mean investing slowly in infrastructures for the future, and rebuilding our human capital," by investing in renewable resources. "We don’t know what it’s going to be," he says, "but it’s going to be a challenge to find a new growth model. It’s not going to be simple."&lt;ref name=Fallows/&gt;

;Recovery from recession

In August 2009, Roubini predicted that the global economy would begin recovering near the end of 2009, but the U.S. economy is likely to grow only about one percent annually during the next two years, which is less than the three percent normal "trend."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg7-23/&gt; He noted that the Fed is "now embarked on a policy in which they are in effect directly [[monetization|monetizing]] about half of the [[budget deficit]]," but that now "monetization is not inflationary," as banks were holding much of the money themselves and not relending it. When these attitudes reverse at the end of the recession, that would be time for an "exit strategy, of mopping up that liquidity" and taking some of the money back out of circulation, "so it doesn’t just bid up house prices and stock values in a new bubble. And that will be 'very, very tricky indeed,'" he stated.&lt;ref name=Fallows/&gt;

Also, in late July, he warned that if no clear exit strategy is outlined and implemented, there was the potential of a perfect storm: fiscal deficits, rising bond yields, higher oil prices, weak profits, and a stagnant labor market, which combined could "blow the recovering world economy back into a [[W-shaped recession|double-dip recession]]."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg7-23&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aeY.UV6r3uiE "Roubini Sees Risk of ‘Double Dip’ Global Recession"] ''Bloomberg News'', July 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global economy====

=====2006=====
In the summer of 2006, Roubini wrote that the U.S. was headed into a long and "protracted" recession due to the "collapse" of house prices, which he noted were already in freefall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.marketwatch.com/2006-08-23/news/30805733_1_housing-prices-housing-sector-roubini-global-economics "Recession will be nasty and deep, economist says"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130129021022/http://articles.marketwatch.com/2006-08-23/news/30805733_1_housing-prices-housing-sector-roubini-global-economics |date=2013-01-29 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', August 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to Europe, Roubini predicted that [[PIGS (economics)|Italy, and possibly a series of other eurozone countries (Portugal, Spain, Greece]]) might have to exit the eurozone if they did not implement "serious economic reforms." "[It] is not a foregone conclusion but, if Italy does not reform, an exit from EMU within 5 years is not totally unlikely. Indeed, like Argentina, Italy faces a growing competitiveness loss given an increasingly overvalued currency and the risk of falling exports and growing current account deficit. The growth slowdown will make the public deficit and debt worse and potentially unsustainable over time. And if a devaluation cannot be used to reduce real wages, the real exchange rate overvaluation will be undone via a slow and painful process of wage and price deflation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roubine|first=Nouriel|title=Italy’s Tremonti’s Temper Tantrums on EMU in Davos...a Sad Embarrassing Episode for Italy...|url=http://www.economonitor.com/nouriel/2006/01/28/italys-tremontis-temper-tantrums-on-emu-in-davosa-sad-embarrassing-episode-for-italy/|publisher=EconoMonitor|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2009=====
As of January 2009, he remained pessimistic about the U.S. and global economy. He said in September, 2008, "we have a [[subprime]] financial system, not a subprime mortgage market".&lt;ref name=CNNMoney&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/24/news/economy/Roubini_on_bailout/index.htm "Bailout: No cure for recession"], CNN Money, Sept. 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; "As the U.S. economy shrinks, the entire global economy will go into recession. In [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and the other advanced economies, it will be severe. Nor will [[emerging market]] economies—linked to the [[developed world]] by trade in goods, finance, and currency—escape real pain."&lt;ref name=FP/&gt; He was quoted in South Africa's 2009 budget speech for his role in predicting the current financial crisis in the developed markets.

Roubini notes that the subprime issues are a global, and not just a U.S. problem. In an interview with author [[James Fallows]] in late spring of 2009, he stated, "People talk about the American subprime problem, but there were housing bubbles in the [[U.K.]], in [[Spain]], in [[Ireland]], in [[Iceland]], in a large part of emerging Europe, like the [[Baltics]] all the way to [[Hungary]] and the Balkans. It was not just the U.S., and not just 'subprime.' It was excesses that led to the risk of a tipping point in many different economies."&lt;ref name=Fallows&gt;Fallows, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200907/roubini "Dr. Doom Has Some Good News"], ''The Atlantic magazine'', July/August, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

His pessimism is focused on the short-run rather than the medium or long-run.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In [[Foreign Policy (magazine)|''Foreign Policy'']] (Jan/Feb 2009), he writes, "Last year’s worst-case scenarios came true. The global financial [[pandemic]] that I and others had warned about is now upon us. But we are still only in the early stages of this crisis. My predictions for the coming year, unfortunately, are even more dire: The bubbles, and there were many, have only begun to burst".&lt;ref name=FP&gt;Roubini, Nouriel. [https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4591 Warning: More Doom Ahead] ''Foreign Policy'', January/February, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At a conference in [[Dubai]] in January, 2009, he said, the U.S. banking system was "effectively insolvent." He added that the "[[systemic banking crisis]].... The problems of [[Citi]], [[Bank of America]] and others suggest the system is bankrupt. In Europe, it’s the same thing."&lt;ref name=Bloom012009&gt;[http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a746r_1q9OOY&amp;refer=home "Roubini Predicts U.S. Losses May Reach $3.6 Trillion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122020044/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |date=2009-01-22 }} ''Bloomberg News'', January 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; To deal with this problem, he recommends that the U.S. government "do triage between banks that are illiquid and undercapitalized but solvent, and those that are insolvent. The insolvent ones you have to shut down." He adds, "We're in a war economy. You need command-economy allocation of credit to the real economy. Not enough is being done," he felt at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1882729,00.html "Roubini Sees More Economic Gloom Ahead"], ''Time'', March 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2010=====
In 2010, he again warned that despite an improved economy with rising stock markets, the crisis was not over and new bubbles were on the horizon:

:We are just at the next stage. This is where we move from a private to a public debt problem . . . We socialised part of the private losses by bailing out financial institutions and providing fiscal stimulus to avoid the great recession from turning into a depression. But rising public debt is never a free lunch, eventually you have to pay for it.&lt;ref name=Telegraph5-10&gt;{{cite news | first = Jonathan | last = Sibun | title = Nouriel Roubini said the bubble would burst and it did. So what next? | date = 2010-05-23 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7756684/Nouriel-Roubini-said-the-bubble-would-burst-and-it-did.-So-what-next.html | work = The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2010, markets around the world began dropping due partly to problems in Greece and the Eurozone. "Roubini believes Greece will prove to be just the first of a series of countries standing on the brink," writes the ''Telegraph.''&lt;ref name=Telegraph5-10/&gt; Roubini explains the new issues governments must deal with:

:We have to start to worry about the solvency of governments. What is happening today in Greece is the tip of the iceberg of rising sovereign debt problems in the eurozone, in the UK, in Japan and in the US. This ... is going to be the next issue in the global financial crisis.&lt;ref name=Telegraph5-10/&gt;

;China
Roubini met officials in China during spring 2009, and pointed out that many Chinese commentators blame American "overborrowing and excess" for dragging them into a recession. However, he stated that "even they realize that the very excess of American demand has created a market for Chinese exports." He adds that although Chinese leaders "would love to be less dependent on American customers and hate having so many of their nation’s foreign assets tied up in U.S. dollars," they’re now "more worried about keeping Chinese exporters in business. . . . I don’t think even the Chinese authorities have fully internalized the contradictions of their position."&lt;ref name=Fallows/&gt;

=====2011=====
Roubini and political scientist [[Ian Bremmer]] have described the 21st century world as fragmenting economically and politically, where the "old models of understanding global dynamics are struggling" to keep up with rapid changes. In an article in ''Foreign Affairs'' magazine, they describe what they call a "[[G-Zero world]]," where the  United States no longer has the resources to continue as the primary provider of global public goods.  As a result, there is likely to be more conflict than cooperation between countries, creating a "[[zero-sum game]]," a "game in which my win is your loss." They explain their rationale:
:Europe is fully occupied for the moment with saving the [[eurozone]]. Japan is likewise tied down with complex political and economic problems at home. None of these powers’ governments has the time, resources, or domestic political capital needed for a new bout of international heavy lifting. Meanwhile, there are no credible answers to transnational challenges without the direct involvement of emerging powers such as Brazil, China, and India. Yet these countries are far too focused on domestic development to welcome the burdens that come with new responsibilities abroad.

:We are now living in a G-Zero world, one in which no single country or bloc of countries has the political and economic leverage—or the will—to drive a truly international agenda. The result will be intensified conflict on the international stage over vitally important issues, such as international macroeconomic coordination, financial regulatory reform, trade policy, and [[climate change]]. This new order has far-reaching implications for the global economy, as companies around the world sit on enormous stockpiles of cash, waiting for the current era of political and economic uncertainty to pass. Many of them can expect an extended wait.&lt;ref&gt;Roubini, Nouriel, and Bremmer, Ian. [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67339/ian-bremmer-and-nouriel-roubini/a-g-zero-world "A G-Zero World"], ''Foreign Affairs'', March/April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennington, Ash.

=====2014=====
By May 2014 Roubini had become bullish, arguing many of the risks to the global economy had receded. He pointed to an improving European economy and stronger euro, steadying of the economy in Japan, and a marked improvement in the United States. He praised the Federal Reserve for its [[unconventional monetary policy]], which he forecast would last for a few more years, supporting equity markets.&lt;ref name="DrBoom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Dr Doom becomes optimistic|url=http://www.theusnews.com/index.php/sid/222083329/scat/9d7afd9766a94f28/ht/Former-Dr-Doom-becomes-optimistic|accessdate=May 18, 2014|publisher=''The US News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2017=====
At the start of 2017, Roubini speculated that the election of [[Donald Trump]] as President may portend a geopolitical shift away from globalization and more toward isolationism, a change which he feels could lead to global instability and rising military conflicts among other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Roubini, Nouriel. [https://www.project-syndicate.org/print/trump-isolationism-undermines-peace-worldwide-by-nouriel-roubini-2017-01 "'America First' and Global Conflict Next"], Project Syndicate, Jan. 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2018=====
At the Fluidity Summit in New York, Roubini cast serious doubt on [[bitcoin]] and [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] during a debate with ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin.&lt;ref&gt;https://bitsonline.com/fluidity-summit-debate-afterthoughts-debunking-nouriel-roubini/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fluidity Summit|title=Fluidity Summit: Will Cryptocurrency Flourish or Fail?|date=2018-05-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NAxArmenyc|accessdate=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, he delivered a blistering attack on cyrptocurrency to a [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development|U.S. Senate Banking Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roubini%20Testimony%2010-11-18.pdf Roubini Senate Blockchain Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oh My Gods!''''' is a [[webcomic]] written and illustrated by Shivian Montar Balaris. It deals with the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]], [[Paganism|Pagan]], and [[Wicca]]n faiths. The interaction of followers of these faiths with [[Christian]] [[fundamentalist]]s and followers of other religions is the main concern of the story.

It debuted on 7 March 2002. The strip initially featured four main [[cartoon]] characters whose outlook on life was [[stereotypical]]: Stan the [[gay]] man, Vera the [[lesbian|bull-dyke]], Winston the [[nerd]], and Victor the [[Moron (psychology)|moron]]. These four have since outgrown their initial "cookie cutter" molds and taken on lives of their own. The cast has since expanded to include additional characters such as Fundie, Kay, and Reiki Master.

Within the strip all characters are assumed to be Pagan, unless labelled otherwise by [[Christianity|cross]]es on their shirts. The main characters often comment on bad Pagans and on the opposition they receive from [[fundamentalist]]s. Despite the strip's frequent references to [[Paganism|Pagan]] and [[Wicca]]n sub-culture, it has a substantial [[Christian]] following as well as a [[Neopagan]] audience.

Many strips are the result of viewer suggestion, and Oh My Gods! as a whole often reflects the personal experiences of the artist.

The last official strip was posted on 17 March 2009.  The following year, a strip entitled "Finale" was posted along with a note from the creator indicating that he had decided to cease creating the Oh My Gods! comic.&lt;ref name="Finale"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ohmygods.co.uk/strips/finale|title=Finale|accessdate=2011-01-11|publisher=Shivian Montar Balaris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special strips==
In addition to the normal strips Oh My Gods! also features simple reverse font slogans which are supposed to resemble religious bumper stickers and special remembrances of the deaths of Shivian Balaris's father and [[Pope John Paul II]], and the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  The first anniversary strip was in the form of a short movie.

==Characteristic features==

Characters have died in the course of the story and remained so, in a departure from the convention of comic strip comedy. Elements of fantasy (fairies, boob-vampires, etc.) take the story into the realms of the surreal, though it keeps a thread of realism. This fantastic aspect is embellished by the appearance of such characters as the [[Pope]], a Clown for Christ, and [[Unitarian Universalists]] who are depicted as [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]].

Oh My Gods! has a characteristic "[[preschool]]" like drawing style, with characters only having eyes, one perspective, and no fingers. The drawing style is based loosely on a popular webcomic - [[Little Gamers]], et al. In the 8 March 2002 comic, Shivian acknowledges this by doing what the characters themselves say is "a blatant ripoff".&lt;ref name="March 8th, 2002 - Oh My Gods!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohmygods.co.uk/strips/2002-03-08|title=March 8th, 2002 - Oh My Gods!|accessdate=2009-02-24|publisher=Shivian Montar Balaris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Die-hard fans will also make what they call "Ohmygodsifications" of themselves, or what they would look like if they were a character in the strip.

Oh My Gods! also very often breaks the [[fourth wall]]. Characters are well aware of their existence as characters in a comic, and they are often depicted as conversing with Shivian or commenting on things occurring in his interactions with the comic or life at large. Additionally, they have been shown great surprise when Shivian made a change to the style of the comic such as the introduction of color, legs, or fleshed out backgrounds. In another instance, Shivian is shown as storing the props for the comic in the basement of their house.&lt;ref name="October 6th, 2003 - Oh My Gods!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohmygods.co.uk/strips/2003-10-06|title=October 6th, 2003 - Oh My Gods!|accessdate=2009-02-24|publisher=Shivian Montar Balaris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Protestant work ethic''', the '''Calvinist work ethic'''&lt;ref&gt;The Idea of Work in Europe from Antiquity to Modern Times by Catharina Lis&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Puritan work ethic'''{{efn|Especially in the [[United States]].}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryken |first=Leland |date=2010 |title=Worldly Saints: The Puritans As They Really Were |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox7aNVgljlMC&amp;pg=PT51 |publisher=Harper Collins |pages=51– |isbn=978-0-310-87428-7}}]&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept in [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and [[history]] that emphasizes that hard work, discipline and [[frugality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protestant Ethic|url=http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/protesta.htm|website=Believe: Religious Information Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a result of a person's subscription to the values espoused by the [[Protestantism|Protestant faith]], particularly [[Calvinism]].

This contrasts with the focus upon religious attendance, confession, and [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|ceremonial sacrament]] in the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] tradition. A person does not need to be a religious [[Calvinist]] in order to follow the Protestant work ethic, as it is a part of certain cultures impacted by the [[Protestant Reformation]].{{efn|Other Protestant traditions, most notably Lutheranism, also tend to subscribe to this set of values.}}

The concept is often credited with helping to define the societies of [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Even though some of these countries were more affected by [[Lutheranism]] or [[Anglicanism]] than [[Calvinism]], local Protestants nevertheless were influenced by these ideas to a varying degree. As [[penal law (British)|penal law]] was enacted to uphold the uniform teachings of the [[Church of England]] in [[England]], only various [[English dissenters]]{{efn|''Further information: [[Puritanism]], [[Independent (religion)]], [[Nonconformism]], [[English Presbyterianism]], [[Ecclesiastical separatism]], [[17th-century denominations in England]].''}} held to those values. Among them were the [[Puritans]] who emigrated to [[New England]], bringing the work ethic with them and helping define the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] of what would become the [[United States of America]]. Immigrants brought their work ethic to the [[United States of America]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]] and other European colonies.

The phrase was initially coined in 1904–1905{{efn|No exact date is known. The term appeared to the public with the publication of his book in 1905.}} by [[Max Weber]] in his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|orig-year=First published 1905|translator-first=Talcott|translator-last=Parsons|date=2003|publisher=Dover| location=New York|ISBN=9780486122373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of leading contemporary historians, including historian [[Fernand Braudel]] (d. 1985) and British historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] (d. 2003), assert that the existing consensus among scholars is that Protestant Work Ethic theory is false. They refer to the pre-Reformation existence of rapid economic development of Catholic capitalist communities.
  
== Basis in Protestant theology ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
{{Further|Grace (Christianity)|Good works}}
Protestants, beginning with [[Martin Luther]], reconceptualized worldly work as a duty which benefits both the individual and society as a whole. Thus, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] idea of [[good works]] was transformed into an obligation to consistently work diligently as a sign of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]. Whereas Catholicism teaches that good works are required of Catholics as a necessary manifestation of the faith they received, and that faith apart from works is dead (James 2:14–26) and barren, the Calvinist theologians taught that only those who were [[Predestination|predestined]] to be saved would be saved.

Since it was impossible to know who was predestined, the notion developed that it might be possible to discern that a person was [[Unconditional election|elect]] (predestined) by observing their way of life. Hard work and frugality were thought to be two important consequences of being one of the elect. Protestants were thus attracted to these qualities and supposed to strive for reaching them.

==American political history==
Writer [[Frank Chodorov]] argued that the Protestant ethic was long considered indispensable for American political figures:
{{quote|
There was a time, in these United States, when a candidate for public office could qualify with the electorate only by fixing his birthplace in or near the "log cabin." He may have acquired a competence, or even a fortune, since then, but it was in the tradition that he must have been born of poor parents and made his way up the ladder by sheer ability, self-reliance, and perseverance in the face of hardship. In short, he had to be "self made." The so-called Protestant Ethic then prevalent held that man was a sturdy and responsible individual, responsible to himself, his society, and his God. Anybody who could not measure up to that standard could not qualify for public office or even popular respect. One who was born "with a silver spoon in his mouth" might be envied, but he could not aspire to public acclaim; he had to live out his life in the seclusion of his own class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Frank|last=Chodorov|author-link=Frank Chodorov|url=https://mises.org/daily/5031/The-Radical-Rich |title=The Radical Rich|website=Mises Daily Articles|publisher=[[Mises Institute]]|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
There has been a revitalization of Weber's interest, including the work of [[Lawrence Harrison (academic) |Lawrence Harrison]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], and [[David Landes]]. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, published in June 8, 2003, Niall Ferguson pointed that data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) seems to confirm that "the experience of Western Europe in the past quarter-century offers an unexpected confirmation of the Protestant ethic. To put it bluntly, we are witnessing the decline and fall of the Protestant work ethic in Europe. This represents the stunning triumph of secularization in Western Europe—the simultaneous decline of both Protestantism and its unique work ethic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Niall|last=Ferguson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/weekinreview/the-world-why-america-outpaces-europe-clue-the-god-factor.html |title=The World; Why America Outpaces Europe (Clue: The God Factor) |work=The New York Times |date=8 June 2003 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for those in a Protestant work culture to skip lunch (traditionally being sustained from a large breakfast) or to eat lunch while doing their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bresiger|first1=Gregory|title=Millions of Americans skipping lunch to work: study|url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/02/millions-of-americans-skipping-lunch-to-work-study/|work=New York Post|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author="Cubicle Curtis"|title=How to Take Productive Breaks|url=http://workawesome.com/productivity/how-to-take-productive-breaks/|website=Work Awesome}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to Catholic cultures which practice ''[[siesta]]'' at lunch time,&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=George|title='Working hours in Spain are too long'|url=http://www.thelocal.es/20130704/siestas-banned-in-spain-says-top-german-magazine|work=The Local|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucianist]] cultures such as China, Korea, and Japan which have a one- or two-hour lunch break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Hours in China|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/essential/business-hour.htm|website=Travel China Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries such as Spain have experimented with banning ''siesta'' in order to try to adopt the Protestant work ethic, with hopes of reducing their financial debt via hard-working and efficient employees.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; In Italy, many shops now remain open during siesta, while in China, companies are encouraging employees to give up their traditional break time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hodgekinson|first1=Tom|title=The Idle Parent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familycolumnists/3356755/The-Idle-Parent.html|work=Daily Telegraph|date=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism#Criticisms}}
The Austrian Catholic economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that capitalism began in Italy in the 14th century, not in the Protestant areas of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=History of Economic Analysis |first=Joseph A. |last=Schumpeter |oclc=269819 |isbn=0-415-10888-8 |pages=74–75 |chapter=Part II From the Beginning to the First Classical Situation (to about 1790), chapter 2 The scholastic Doctors and the Philosophers of Natural Law}}.  In the footnote, Schumpeter refers to {{cite book |first=Abbott Payson |last=Usher |title=The Early History of Deposit Banking in Mediterranean Europe |year=1943 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002870348}} and {{cite journal |last=de Roover |first=Raymond |date=December 1942 |title=Money, Banking, and Credit in Medieval Bruges |journal=Journal of Economic History |publisher=The Economic History Association |volume=2, supplement S1 |pages=52–65 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700083431}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other factors that further developed the European market economy included the strengthening of [[property right]]s and lowering of [[transaction cost]]s with the decline and monetization of [[feudalism]], and the increase in real [[wage]]s following the epidemics of [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voigtlander|first1=Nico|last2=Voth|first2=Hans-Joachim|title=The Three Horsemen of Riches: Plague, War, and Urbanization in Early Modern Europe|url=http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/nico.v/Research/Horsemen.pdf|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|date=9 October 2012|volume=80|issue=2|pages=774–811|doi=10.1093/restud/rds034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker and Wossmann at the University of Munich have written a discussion paper describing an alternate theory.  The abstract to this states that the literacy gap between Protestants (as a result of the Reformation) and Catholics sufficiently explains the economic gaps, and that the "[r]esults hold when we exploit the initial concentric dispersion of the Reformation to use distance to Wittenberg as an instrument for Protestantism."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Becker |first1=Sascha O. |last2=Wößmann |first2=Ludger |year=2007 |title=Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History - Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7 |publisher=Department of Economics University of Munich |publication-place=Munich |page= |url=http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf |accessdate=12 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they also note that, between Luther (1500) and 1871 Prussia, the limited data available has meant that the period in question is regarded as a "black box" and that only "some cursory discussion and analysis" is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Wossmann (2007) page A5 Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Fernand Braudel wrote "all historians have opposed this tenuous theory [the Protestant Ethic], although they have not managed to be rid of it once and for all. Yet it is clearly false. The northern countries took over the place that earlier had been so long and brilliantly been occupied by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or business management."&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, Fernand. 1977. Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientist Rodney Stark moreover comments that "during their critical period of economic development, these northern centers of capitalism were Catholic, not Protestant — the Reformation still lay well into the future." He also summarized the finding of other leading modern historians thus, "Protestants were not more likely to hold the high-status capitalist positions than were Catholics. Catholic areas of western Europe did not lag in their industrial development. And even more obvious at the time Weber wrote was that fully developed capitalism had appeared in Europe many centuries before the Reformation!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/controversy/protestant-objections/protestant-modernity.html&lt;/ref&gt; British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said, "The idea that large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed."&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper. 2001. The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century. Liberty Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1747">'''Rustam II''' ({{lang-fa|رستم}}), was the twelfth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 964 to 979. He was the brother and successor of [[Shahriyar II]].

Rustam was the son of [[Sharwin II]]. In 964, Shahriyar was deposed because of his pro-[[Ziyarid]] policies in favor of his pro-[[Buyid]] brother Rustam. Rustam was the first Bavand ruler who embraced [[Shia Islam]]. Shahriyar later tried to reclaim the Bavand throne by invading [[Tabaristan]] with a [[Samanid]] army in 968, but with no avail. Rustam died in 979, and was succeeded by his son [[Al-Marzuban]].

'''Sanamahism''' or '''Sanamahi Laining''' refers to the traditional Meitei beliefs and religion found in the state of India called [[Manipur]] near [[Myanmar]]. The term is derived from ''Sanamahi'', one of the important Meitei deities. Sanamahi derives his power from the combination of all the stars in the Milky Way. Lord Sun worships him for more power and he delivers all with ease. According to Bertil Lintner, Sanamahism is an "[[animism|animistic]], ancestor worshipping, shaman-led tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertil Lintner|title=Great Game East: India, China, and the Struggle for Asia's Most Volatile Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fLOBwAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-19567-5|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanamahism is practiced by the [[Meitei people|Meitei]], [[Zeliangrong]] and other communities who inhabit [[Manipur]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Myanmar]] and [[Bangladesh]], with small migrant populations in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]].

==Revival==
According to 2011 census, about eight percent of Manipur belong to religions stated as 'other'.

Religion in Manipur is thought to have passed through three stages.&lt;ref&gt;P. 199 ''Social Movements in North-East India'' By Mahendra Narain Karna&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form of worship==
In assimilate features such as the worship of forces of nature like fire, water, mountain, ancestor worship ([[Apokpa]]), Lamlai (Outdoor Dwelling Gods and Goddesses), Yumlai (House dwelling Gods and Goddesses), Ningthoulai (King God) and Umanglai (Forest Dwelling God). Religion of antiquity – in its pure native form, it is as all as the history of Meitei people from the time immemorial.

===Deities===
There is reference to the worship of Sanamahi by Ningthou (King) Kangba in the Hayi age. Manipur is a polytheistic land with Atiya Sidaba as the supreme god. Atiya Sidaba, Apaanba and Asheeba are the three manifestations or incarnations of God as the creator, the preserver and the annihilator of this universe respectively.

Panthoibi is the Mother of the Universe and Nongpok Ningthou is her mate.&lt;ref&gt;P. 4290 ''Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature'' By various&lt;/ref&gt; Besides those, three hundred and sixty-four deities with their consorts are the most important deities worshipped by the Meiteis.

The Plain Kabui are observed in worship of Sanamahi and Ima Leimarel.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India'' By Kumar Suresh Singh, S. B. Roy, Asok K. Ghosh&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanamahi (also known as Asheeba) has a creator brother (like him) named Paakhangba (Konjin Tukthapa).&lt;ref&gt;P. 82 ''A History of Manipuri Literature'' By Ch Manihar Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the important gods and goddesses worshiped by the Meiteis are:{{cn|date=August 2016}}
* Shidaba Mapu (Immortal Owner)
* Lainingthou Sanamahi (Supreme God of the Household Gods and Goddesses)
* Ebudhou Paakhangba (Younger Brother of Lainingthou Sanamahi and the Ruler of the outside world)

The '''Sassoon family''', known as '''"[[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]] of the East"''' due to the great wealth they accumulated in trade,&lt;ref name=jewcy/&gt; is of [[Baghdadi Jews|Baghdadi Jewish]] descent and international renown. It was based in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], before moving to [[Bombay]], [[India]], and then spreading to [[China]], [[England]], and other countries. It is said that the family descended from the Shoshans, one of the families of [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs, Schloessinger|first1=Joseph, Max|title=IBN SHOSHAN|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8022-ibn-shoshan|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 18th century, the Sassoons were one of the wealthiest families in the world, with a merchant empire spanning the continent of Asia.&lt;ref name="SiegfriedSassoon"&gt;''Siegfried Sassoon: A biography'', [[Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont|Max Egremont]], (London 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the family strongly implies a local, [[Mesopotamian]] origin for the family. The family name of Sassoon is also commonly shared by many [[Armenians|Armenian]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] families and tribes who all originate from the mountainous district of [[Sason]] (whence the family and tribal names), west of [[Lake Van]], in upper Mesopotamia in modern Turkey. It is, however, possible that some Spanish [[Sephardi]] blood was mixed with the primarily Mesopotamian Jewish Sasoons.

==Origins==
{{unreferenced-section|date=May 2018}}
[[Sassoon ben Salih]] (1750–1830) and his family were the chief treasurers to the [[pashas]] of [[Baghdad]] and [[Southern Iraq]]. His sons [[David Sassoon|David]] (1792–1864), and [[Joseph Sassoon|Joseph]] (1795–1872) fled from a new and unfriendly [[wāli]], in 1828 David first went to the Persian Gulf port of [[Bushehr]] and in 1832 to [[Bombay]], [[India]], with his large family. In Bombay, he built the international business called David S. Sassoon, with the policy of staffing it with people brought from Baghdad. They filled the functions of the various branches of his business in India, [[Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and east Asia. He cemented the family's dominant position in the Sino-Indian opium trade. {{crossref|(See [[First Opium War]].)}} The family's businesses in China, and Hong Kong especially, were built to capitalise on the trade.&lt;ref name=jewcy&gt;{{cite web|title=SASSOON|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13218-sassoon|work=Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; His business extended to China – where Sassoon House (now the north wing of the [[Peace Hotel]]) on [[the Bund (Shanghai)|the Bund]] in [[Shanghai]] became a noted landmark – and then to England. In each branch, he maintained a rabbi. His wealth and munificence were proverbial; his philanthropy across Asia included the building of schools, orphanages, hospitals, and museums with the proceeds of the drug trade. On his death, tributes to him were made from across the continent by Muslims, Christians, Parsees, Jews, and Hindus.&lt;ref name="SiegfriedSassoon" /&gt;

==Joseph Sassoon sons==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2018}}
Joseph Sassoon went to Aleppo, Syria, where he established a merchant house and later his business interests spread to Alexandria, Thessaloniki, and Athens, which included a shipping company and a money exchange house. His five sons branched out in many directions: his son Moses Sassoon (1828–1909) returned to Baghdad before moving to Egypt where he built the financial house Joseph Sassoon &amp; Sons, which later expanded and became an agent for Crédit Foncier in Egypt. In 1871 Moses' son Jacob Sassoon (1850–1936) was one of the largest cotton plantation owners in Egypt, and owned cotton mills; during the American civil war his older brother Nissim (1840–1917) had made a fortune exporting Egyptian cotton to England making him Egypt's largest cotton exporter. In 1927, with Misr Bank and other Egyptian businessmen, Jacob Sassoon founded of Misr Spinning and Weaving Company (Arabic: شركة مصر للغزل والنسيج), also known as Misr Helwan or the El-Ghazl factory owning 61% of the company's shares. Jacob Sassoon also founded Egypt Crédit Foncier with the Joseph Vita Mosseri, his grandson Eliau Joseph Sassoon was an architect, and designed the Asicurazione de Trieste Building. Eliau Sassoon was also a real estate investor and developer, who foresaw the unparalleled growth of Cairo and the lucrative effect such expansion would have on land values. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of the properties he invested in were located at the nexus of the elegant European quarter of Ismailia or in the choicest parts of Kasr al-Dubara, and later, in Garden City, Zamalek, and Giza. In 1952 his grandson Eliau (Elias) Nissim Eliau Joseph Sassoon (1928–2010) founded Banque Du Caire with Maurice Joseph Cattaui (1925–2009).

==Eliau (Elias) Nissim Eliau Joseph Sassoon==
{{unreferenced-section|date=May 2018}}
[https://www.myheritage.com/site-family-tree-372295561/sassoon-family#!profile-1500007-info Eliau (Elias) Nissim Eliau Joseph Sassoon] (Hebrew: אליהו נסים אליאו יוסף ששון) (1927–2010), (always called Elias), born in Aleppo, Syria, to Nassim Eliau Sassoon (1911–1988) a wealthy merchant, banker, and former partner at Safra Freres a bank based in Aleppo, and [https://www.myheritage.com/site-family-tree-372295561/sassoon-family#!profile-1500009-info Messouda Sassoon (born Shamash)] (1911–1992).

Elias Sassoon was Joseph Sassoon’s most influential and wealthiest descendant, in 1940 he was sent to Alexandria to attend the prestigious boarding school, [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]]. He later joined his family’s business in 1946 where he worked for the family’s business in Egypt.

Among the many holdings, the family had at the time included interests in the [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]], [[Iraq Petroleum Company|Turkish Petroleum Company]] and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a textile factory, a large cotton export business and interests in both the General Company of Commerce and Industry of Greece (later Attica Enterprises Holding S.A.) and Atlas Maritime.

In 1947 Elias focused his attention on three primary sectors: the new booming oil exploration industry sweeping the Middle East, shipping and banking. With a £5000 loan from his father, Elias invested in Standard Oil adding to his family’s existing holdings in the company. That same year he married Hannah Rochel Jacque Sassoon (née de Menasche) (1929–2009), granddaughter of Baron Jacques Bohor Yacoub Levi de Menashe (d.1916).

His great-grandfather, David Solomon Sassoon (1871–1956) had been an investor in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, which later partnered with Standard Oil to provide markets for the oil reserves in the Middle East. In 1906, SOCONY (later Mobil) opened its first fuel terminals in Alexandria with financing provided by David Solomon Sassoon. Elias Sassoon was a devoted Zionist and considered the British anything but friends to the Jewish people because of their blockade in the Mediterranean to refugee vessels carrying Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of World War II, and although to a lesser extent, he considered the British government as culpable nonetheless in the atrocities against world Jewry.

In 1952 he cofounded [http://www.banqueducaire.com/English/Pages/default.aspx Banque Du Caire] with his childhood friend Moise Joseph Maurice Cattaui (1925–2009). By then Elias Sassoon had expanded his family’s business to France, Brazil, South Africa and the United States where the family exported cotton to and had maintained trading posts since the 1800s.

The Sassoons believed that Mesopotamia (now Syria and Iraq) contained substantial reservoirs of oil, the forerunner of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC). David Solomon Sassoon was among the first to secure the interest of the Imperial German banks and companies, already involved in the building of the Berlin–Baghdad railway, which he played an active role in its financing. This German interest was followed by British interests when David Sassoon became an agent for the [https://www.rothschildarchive.org/ Rothschilds] in Ottoman Empire. In 1911, in an attempt to bring together British and German interests competing in the region, Sassoon formed a consortium of British investors composed of banks and companies and formed the African and Eastern Concession Ltd.

In 1953 Elias Sassoon used these networks of interests to expand his family’s investment interests to include mining concessions in Africa. In 1957 the new Egyptian post-revolution government under Nasser nationalized all European particularly British and French companies and banks. The government also began expelling foreigners and the Jewish community of Egypt once again, despite its many contributions to the country’s artistic, economic, political, and academic fields found itself under the government’s harassment and intimidation, many were forced to leave the country with no more than one suitcase and most had their assets and properties seized by the Revolutionary Council.

The Sassoons were among those, whose assets were confiscated and in 1966 Elias Sassoon and his wife were taken to the port in Alexandria and expelled from the country. Elias’ wife who was an Egyptian citizen was declared non-citizen, and at the request of the Egyptian government, Elias’s Syrian citizenship was revoked. They were given laissez-passer (travel documents) and ordered aboard a ship bound for Greece, however, their son Edouard Elias Sassoon (1948–1985) who was a medical student at the University of Alexandria was denied exit visa.

The government accused Elias Sassoon of using his family’s banking network to help smuggle assets belonging to members of the Jewish community out of the country and demanded that he return his assets held in Europe before his son is allowed to leave. After paying what amounted to ransom money, totaling £4 million and the intervention of both the French and the Greek governments, Edouard Sassoon joined his family in 1971, with his wife Josephine Celine Esther (née Cattaui) (1949–1994), daughter of Moise Cattaui who was also denied exit visa after her family was expelled from the country in 1964.

Elias Sassoon had established Sassoon Cattaui Investment Holding (later, Providence Group), a privately-owned family hedge fund with Moise Cattaui in 1961 in Switzerland with assets from the Sassoon Family Trust, which had been formed in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1910. In 1970, the partners moved the company Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles) a private family investment group, which is not required to register with the SEC or comply with reporting requirements under the Dodd–Frank, reform act.  It is said that at the time of formation of the Fund, the total value of assets under management in 1961 was £25million.

The Fund invested in commercial real estate properties in the U.S., Canada, and Greece as well as in precious metals, oil &amp; gas, and securities. The Fund also speculated in the currency markets, among its many holdings are: [http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-sassoon/4146/register-of-interests BHP Billiton], the co-investor in [[Le Méridien]] Hotel company with [http://www.lemeridienoakbrook.com/history Air France], American Express, GM, Wells Fargo Bank, HSBC, Lehman Brothers, Exxon Mobile, Conoco Phillips, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, Microsoft, Sun Microsystem, Midland Bank, stockbroking firm Frankel Pollak (which was later sold to [https://www.sasfin.com/ Sasfin Bank], a Sassoon family bank based in South Africa) and S&amp;P. It is rumored that at the time of Elias Sassoon’s death, the Fund, which is not required to file its financials with the SEC had over $100 billion of assets under management, most of which are assets of both the Sassoon and Cattaui families. 

==David S. Sassoon sons==
[[File:Sir Philip Sassoon, 1923, Oil on canvas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Philip Sassoon]], [[John Singer Sargent]], 1923]]
Sassoon's eight sons also branched out in many directions. The Sassoon family was heavily involved in the shipping and [[opium trade|opium]] production industry in China and India. [[Elias David Sassoon|Elias David]] (1820–1880), his son by his first wife, had been the first of the sons to go to China, in 1844. He later returned to Bombay, before leaving the firm to establish E. D. Sassoon in 1867, with offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Another son, [[Albert Abdullah David Sassoon]] (1818–1896) took on the running of the firm on his father's death, and notably constructed the [[Sassoon Docks]], the first wet dock built in western India. With two of his brothers he later became prominent in England, and the family were friends of the Prince of Wales, later King [[Edward VII]]. One daughter of the family, [[Rachel Beer|Rachel Sassoon Beer]] bought a number of newspapers in England, including ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (1893–1904) and ''[[The Observer]]'', which she also edited.
[[File:Siegfried Sassoon by Glyn Warren Philpot 1917.jpeg|thumb|Portrait of [[Siegfried Sassoon]] by [[Glyn Warren Philpot]], 1917. [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]]]

Of those who settled in England, Sir [[Edward Albert Sassoon]] (1856–1912), the son of Albert, married [[Aline Caroline de Rothschild]], and was a Conservative member of Parliament from 1899 until his death. The seat was then inherited by his son Sir [[Philip Sassoon]] (1888–1939) from 1912 until his death. Philip served in the [[World War I|First World War]] as military secretary to Field Marshal Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] and, during the 1920s and 1930s, as Britain's undersecretary of state for air. The twentieth-century English poet, one of the best known [[War_poet#Britain|World War I poets]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]] (1886–1967) was David's great-grandson.

Another descendant of [[Sassoon David Sassoon|David Sassoon]] is the British banker and former Treasury’s commercial secretary [[James Sassoon, Baron Sassoon|James Meyer Sassoon]]. He was mentioned in the [[Paradise Papers]] as one of the beneficiaries of a tax exempt Cayman Island trust fund worth $236 million in 2007 and defended it as being of non UK origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Meyer Sassoon |url=https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/stories/james-meyer-sassoon|publisher=[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]]|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The branch which carried on the rabbinical tradition has been represented by Rabbi [[Solomon David Sassoon]] (1915–1985), who moved from [[Letchworth]] to [[London]] and then to [[Jerusalem]] in 1970. He was the son of one [[David Solomon Sassoon]] (1880–1942)  who collected Jewish books and manuscripts and catalogued them in two volumes. 

The bulk of this collection is stored at the [[British Library]] in London, England. Some examples of this collection are maintained at the [[University of Toronto Library]] in Toronto, Canada. Contrary to manipulative claims on the matter, none of these priceless works are presently stored in the United States. 

David Sassoon was the son of Flora Abraham, who had moved from India to England in 1901 and established a famous salon in her London home. Solomon Sassoon had two sons, [[Isaac S. D. Sassoon]] and David Solomon Sassoon, who are both rabbis.

'''Sunda Wiwitan''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮝᮤᮝᮤᮒᮔ᮪, [[English language|English]]: "early Sunda", "real Sunda", or "original Sunda") is a religious belief system of traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]]. It venerates the power of nature and the spirit of [[ancestor]]s ([[animism]] and [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ekadjati, Edi S, "Kebudayaan Sunda, Suatu Pendekatan Sejarah", Pustaka Jaya, Jakarta, 1995, halaman 72-73&lt;/ref&gt; 

The followers of this belief system can be found in some villages in western Java, such as [[Baduy people|Kanekes]], [[Lebak Regency|Lebak]], [[Banten]]; [[Kasepuhan| Ciptagelar Kasepuhan Banten Kidul]], Cisolok, Sukabumi; [[Kampung Naga]]; and [[Cigugur]], [[Kuningan Regency]]. In [[Carita Parahyangan]] this faith is called ''Jatisunda''. Its practitioners assert that Sunda Wiwitan has been part of their way of life since ancient times, before the arrival of [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]].

The sacred book of Sunda Wiwitan is called [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], it is a didactic text of religious and moral guidance, rules and lessons. The text is identified as Kropak 630 by [[National Library of Indonesia]]. According to a ''kokolot'' (elder) of Cikeusik village, the people of Kanekes are not adherents to [[Hindu]] or [[Buddhist]] faiths; they follow an animistic system of belief that venerates and worships the spirits of ancestors. However, over the course of time Sunda Wiwitan has been influenced by and incorporated Hindu, and to some extent, Islamic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Djajadiningrat, 1936: 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology and belief system==
The highest spiritual power in Sunda Wiwitan is ''Sang [[Hyang]] Kersa'' ("The Powerful") or ''Nu Ngersakeun'' ("He Who has the Will"). This supreme being is also referred to by several names or divine titles, such as ''Batara Tunggal'' ("The One"), ''Batara Jagat'' ("Ruler of Universe"), and ''Batara Seda Niskala'' ("The Unseen"). Sang Hyang Kersa resides in the highest and most sacred realm called ''Buana Nyungcung'' (Sundanese, lit: "Pointy Realm"). The [[Hindu gods]] ([[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Indra]], [[Yama]], and so on) are considered subordinates of Sang Hyang Kersa.&lt;ref&gt;Ekadjati, Edi S, "Kebudayaan Sunda, Suatu Pendekatan Sejarah", Pustaka Jaya, Jakarta, 1995, halaman 73&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sunda Wiwitan [[ontology]], the [[universe]] consists of three realms:
#'''Buana Nyungcung''' ("The Pointy Realm" or "Peak Realm"):  the uppermost realm; the abode of the supreme highest Sang Hyang Kersa.
#'''Buana Panca Tengah''' ("The Middle World"): [[earth]], the realm of human beings and animals, with five cardinal directions: east, west, north, south, and center/zenith.
#'''Buana Larang''' ("The Forbidden World"): [[hell]], the realm of [[demon]]s and lowly spirits, the lowermost realm.

Between ''Buana Nyungcung'' (the peak realm) and ''Buana Panca Tengah'' (earth), there are 18 layers of realms, arranged in decreasing order of sacredness from top to bottom. The uppermost of these heavenly realms is called ''Bumi Suci Alam Padang,'' or according to Kropak 630 (Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian), ''Alam Kahyangan'' or ''Mandala [[Hyang]]''. This second-highest realm is the abode of [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] and [[Sunan Ambu]].

Sang Hyang Kersa created seven bataras{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} in Sasaka Pusaka Buana (The Sacred Place on Earth). The oldest of these bataras is called Batara Cikal and is considered to be the ancestor of the Kanekes people. Other bataras ruled various locations in Sunda lands.

==Value system==
The value system of Sunda Wiwitan is based on written and unwritten (internalized) [[norm (social)|norm]]s. The written norms are rules and [[taboos]] that govern the way of life of adherents, while the unwritten norms are internal and individual understandings of the faith. 

Sunda Wiwitan's basic and principle concepts are based on two things: ''Cara Ciri Manusia'' and ''Cara Ciri Bangsa." These two principles are mentioned by Sunda Wiwitan elders, yet are not explicitly mentioned in the ''Siksa Kanda-ng Karesian," the sacred text of Sunda Wiwitan. 

'''''Cara Ciri Manusia''''' comprises the basic elements of human life. It consists of five fundamentals: 
* ''Welas asih'': love and compassion
* ''Undak usuk'': social and family order
* ''Tata krama'': behavior order and rules of conduct, such as politeness and courteousness
* ''Budi bahasa dan budaya'': language and culture
* ''Wiwaha yudha naradha'': "yudha," meaning war or battle. This principle refers to the essential human characteristic of always being wary or suspicious of foreign or unknown influences. This reflects an inherent conservatism and resistance to change in traditional village life. It implies that influences incompatible with tradition must be rejected.

The second concept of '''''Cara Ciri Bangsa''''' states that people have universals or similarities in basic human traits, yet express diversity from one individual or community to another. These elements are the source of variety among human beings: 
* ''Rupa'': looks
* ''Adat'': customs and rules
* ''Bahasa'': language
* ''Aksara'': letters
* ''Budaya'': culture 

The philosophy and value system emphasizes the internal or spiritual elements of human life, indicating that humans need spiritual guidance and wisdom in their lives.

Originally Sunda Wiwitan did not incorporate many taboos or prohibitions. The core rules of conduct consist of just two elements:
* "Do not do something not to the taste of others" (something that others dislike), and do no harm to others
* "Do not do something to harm yourself"
However, to honor sacred places (''Kabuyutan'', ''Sasaka Pusaka Buana'' or ''Sasaka Domas'') and follow certain traditions in rice farming, Sunda Wiwitan elaborated on many restrictions and taboos. The most numerous taboos (called ''Buyut'' by Kanekes people) are applied to those living within the most sacred place on earth—the people of Baduy Dalam that inhabit ''Sasaka Pusaka Buana'' (Sacred Place on Earth).

==Traditions and ceremonies==
In Sunda Wiwitan tradition, prayer and ritual is performed through songs and chant of [[pantun Sunda]] and kidung{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} dances. These ritual practices can be observed during the rice harvest ceremony and the annual new year festival called [[Seren Taun]]. These customary ceremonies are still performed annually by the more traditional Sundanese communities in [[Baduy people|Kanekes]], Lebak, [[Banten]]; Ciptagelar Kasepuhan Banten Kidul, Cisolok, Sukabumi; [[Kampung Naga]]; and Cigugur, [[Kuningan]]. 

Although modern Sundanese people may practice Islam or adhere to other faiths, influences and value systems, certain elements of traditional customs, beliefs, and culture of Sunda Wiwitan still survive into contemporary times. In terms of influence on their social values and cultural mores, Sundanese people have never abandoned traditional Sundanese beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Rama Jati&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triune Mind, Triune Brain''' is a theoretical model developed by Canadian Buddhist scholar [[Suwanda H. J. Sugunasiri]]. It follows upon his clarification of the three terms used by the Buddha for consciousness, namely,  [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Mano]], [[Citta]] and [[Viññāṇa]] as can be seen in his work on the [[Triune Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;Sugunasiri, Suwanda H. J., “Triune Mind in Buddhism: A Textual Exploration”, The Canadian Journal of Buddhist Studies, No. 10, (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Looking into the fields of [[Pali]] Buddhism, Neuroscience, Anthropology, Linguistics, and Embryology, among others, the overall thrust of this research moves toward a formalization and scientific refinement, done by assimilating functions of the mind as known in the [[Suttas|Sutta]] and the [[Abhidharma|Abhidamma]] with structures of the brain according to evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name="academia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/16555392/TRIUNE_MIND_FINDS_HOME_IN_TRIUNE_BRAIN_An_Exercise_in_Buddhianscience_and_Westernscience |title=TRIUNE MIND FINDS HOME IN TRIUNE BRAIN: An Exercise in Buddhianscience &amp; Westernscience &amp;#124; Suwanda Sugunasiri |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this work, Sugunasiri primarily seeks to correlate Buddhist concepts with [[Paul D. MacLean|Paul MacLean]]’s theory of the [[Triune Brain]] - Reptilian, Paleomammalian, and Protomammalian.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Paul, 1990, The Triune Brain in Evolution, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how the Buddha’s term sattā,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palidictionary.appspot.com/browse/s/satta|title=satta - Definition and Meaning - Pali Dictionary - Pāli to English, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Burmese Dictionary|website=www.palidictionary.appspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ‘sentient being’, covers both humans and animals, each having the six senses, including the sixth mind-sense. Then he goes on to show how the concept can be helpful in reviving and understanding MacLean’s theory, reinterpreting and rebranding the three brains as Protosentient-, Paleosentient-, and Neosentient. Through the use of Pali terminology, he shows how the Buddhist analysis serves us with a fuller understanding of the theory of mind.
 
MacLean’s newly branded theory meets the Buddhian (his term, meaning ‘of the Buddha’ – cf. Einstein &gt; Einsteinian) Triune Mind, its components, Citta, Mano, and Viññāṇa characterized in the following words: “The six senses would constitute Mano, the total working of the mindbody … Viññāṇa and the vacillations in relation to values-conditioned behaviour constituting Citta.”
 
===Sugunasiri's reinterpretation===
Interpreted on the basis of an Abhidhamma analysis as Receiving Mind, Judging Mind, and Executive Mind respectively,&lt;ref name="academia1"/&gt; they are shown to fit within Maclean’s Triune Brain structure. Taking up the Protosentient (Reptilian) brain first, he compares the functions of the Basal Ganglia (and Medulla Oblongata) with those of Citta; the Paleosentient (Paleomammalian) brain in the Hypothalamus (and Thalamus) is compared to Viññāṇa; and finally the Neosentient (Neomammalian) brain in the Amygdala aligns with Mano.

|-

|}

===Other critical points===
While the parallelism is the central theme of the research, there are other critical points to his theory building. The Buddhian notion of ‘stream of consciousness’ (''[[Vijñāna|viññāṇasota]]''), e.g., is explained in relation to neuronal behaviour and Citta as neuropeptides. An intriguing chapter looks at the mind in the context of embryonic development, looked at from both the Westernscientific as well as the Buddhist viewpoints. The Buddhian notion of Rebecoming is explored in relation to the evolution of the brain, and MacLean’s puzzle about an evolutionary common thread to connect non-humans of the past with humans of the present is answered by reminding us how satta ‘sentient being’ is common to animals and humans alike.

With a quick review of the [[Four Noble Truths]], we are further reminded that sentient beings are driven by the Triple Thirsts (Sense-thirst (''[[kāma]] [[taṇhā]]''), ‘Thirst to be’ (''[[bhava]] taõhà''), ‘Thirst to be not’ (''vibhava taṇhā'') and the [[Three poisons|Triple Blemish Roots]] (Passion (''[[rāga]]''), Hatred (''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]''), Delusion (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'')). Sugunasiri relates the Triple Thirsts to self-preservation (as in Western Evolutionary theory) and the Triple Blemish Roots to the continuity of the species. Responding to MacLean’s search for “Animal Mentations” and “Inherited Folklore”, Citta is shown to be the mind that serves as the medium through which they are carried across lifetimes, and life-lines where neuropeptides serve as the medium containing information relating to the stimulus, when the ‘message’ is carried through to the next neuron, jumping across the synapse, more descriptively, synaptic gap. Sugunairi writes, in what is perhaps the first attempt, in scientific terms, at explaining Rebecoming (i.e., life after life, but popularly ‘[[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]]’): “The Citta may carry the load of the Triple Thirsts and the Triple Blemish Roots through the synapse between life A and life B”. The two neurons on either side of the gap are used as paralleling two lifetimes, the first ending at death and the subsequent life beginning with conception, characterized as ‘Relinking Citta’ (''paṭisandhi).&lt;ref&gt;https://palidictionary.appspot.com/browse/p/paṭisandhi&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondrial DNA is argued to be the content of Citta the neuropeptides.

===Conclusion===
Prof. Sugunasiri ends his work with a bit of a twist. Although the triple functions of the mind as in Buddhian characterization has been ‘housed’ in MacLean’s rebranded three brain structure, the brain is described as only the centralized home of Citta, Vinanna and Mano. He ends his book in a scientifically concise way, maintaining a non-dualistic approach to mind and body while unifying concepts of Pali Buddhism with Western Science leaving an enhanced new position in its wake.

[[File:Ceirut Central District wady.jpg|thumb|Typical Lebanese houses in the Wadi Abu Jamil neighborhood]]
'''Wadi Abu Jamil''', located in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's Centre Ville]], is the former [[Jewish Quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].

==History==
Formally known as ''Wadi al-Yahoud'' (meaning "Valley of the Jews"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/627906/La_plus_grande_synagogue_du_Liban__sort_de_l'oubli.html|title=La plus grande synagogue du Liban sort de l'oubli|accessdate=13 August 2009|date=13 August 2009|work=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the quarter was the center of the [[Lebanese Jews|Lebanese Jewish]] community, with Beirut's largest and most important [[synagogue]], the [[Maghen Abraham Synagogue]], located there. The neighborhood was home to Lebanon's centuries-old Jewish community and also for the more recent Jewish refugees from [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].

Emigration from the community began in earnest after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], [[Yasir Arafat]]'s [[PLO]] forces took over much of the neighborhood, which was located along the dividing line between the two sides of the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. During the war, Israeli bombardment damaged the Magen Abraham Synagogue.

The area today is home to fewer than 100 Lebanese Jews.

==Synagogue renovation==
Renovation of the Maghen Abraham Synagogue began in the summer of 2009.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hRj1bTv6vD01LdreLt95Y3kmqx2AD99SQDO03 |accessdate=August 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813173606/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hRj1bTv6vD01LdreLt95Y3kmqx2AD99SQDO03 |archivedate=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Funding for the renovation includes donations from the Lebanese Jewish Community Council and Jewish Lebanese living overseas.  Isaac Arazi, the leader of the Jewish community in Lebanon has  managed to raise $40,000 from private donors.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=1&amp;article_id=104921|title=Renovation of Beirut synagogue gets under way|work=The Daily Star|date=4 August 2009|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovation is estimated to cost between $1 million and $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;  [[Solidere]], the Lebanese joint-stock company responsible for much of Central Beirut’s reconstruction, has donated $150,000 toward the renovation effort.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt; Lebanese architect [[Nabil Gholam]] has played an important role in the redevelopment planning process.

'''Yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|v|ə}}; {{lang-he-n|ישיבה}}, lit. "sitting"; pl. {{hebrew|ישיבות}}, ''yeshivot'' or ''yeshivos'') is a [[judaism|Jewish]] institution that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]]. The studying is usually done through daily ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiurim]]'' (lectures or classes) as well as in study pairs called ''[[ḥavruta]]s'' ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "friendship"&lt;ref name="agora"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uZvs6_fGeMC |title=World Wide Agora |last=Liebersohn |first=Aharon |page=155 |year=2009 |isbn=9781409284772}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "companionship"&lt;ref name="Forta"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NhdoWlrzcg4C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=chavruta#v=onepage&amp;q=chavruta&amp;f=false |title=Judaism |last=Forta |first=Arye |page=89 |publisher=Heinemann Educational |year=1989 |isbn=0-435-30321-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Ḥavruta''-style learning is one of the unique features of the yeshiva.

In the United States and Israel, the different levels of yeshiva education have different names. In the United States, elementary-school students are enrolled in a ''yeshiva'', post-[[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]]-age students learn in a ''[[mesivta|metivta]]'', and undergraduate-level students learn in a ''[[Beth midrash|beit midrash]]'' or ''yeshiva gedola'' ({{lang-he|ישיבה גדולה}}, lit. "large yeshiva" or "great yeshiva"). In Israel, elementary-school students are enrolled in a ''[[Talmud Torah]]'' or ''[[cheder]]'', post-bar mitzvah-age students learn in a ''yeshiva ketana'' ({{lang-he|ישיבה קטנה}}, lit. "small yeshiva" or "minor yeshiva"), and high-school-age students learn in a ''yeshiva gedola''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1MArvfg24EsC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=yeshiva+ketana&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=yeshiva%20ketana&amp;f=false |title=נתיבות שלום |trans-title=Nesivos Sholom |last=Berezovsky |first=Rabbi Sholom Noach |authorlink=Sholom Noach Berezovsky|page=211 |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=9781583304952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCbtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=what+is+a+mesivta&amp;dq=what+is+a+mesivta&amp;hl=en |title=The Day Schools and Torah Umesorah: The Seeding of Traditional Judaism in America |last=Kramer |first=Doniel Zvi |publisher=Yeshiva University Press |year=1984 |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kollel]] is a yeshiva for married men. It is common for a kollel to pay a token stipend to its students. Students of [[Litvish|Lithuanian]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] yeshiva gedolas usually learn in yeshiva until they get married.

Historically, yeshivas were attended by males only. Today, all non-Orthodox and a few [[Modern Orthodox]] yeshivas are open to females. Although there are separate schools for Orthodox women and girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://matzav.com/sarah-schenirer-ah-the-mother-of-the-bais-yaakov-movement-on-her-yahrtzeit-today-26-adar |title=Sarah Schenirer a”h, the Mother of the Bais Yaakov Movement, On Her Yahrtzeit, Today, 26 Adar |website=matzav.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; yeshivas for women do not follow the same structure or curriculum as the traditional yeshiva for boys and men.

==Etymology==
Alternate spellings and names include '''yeshivah''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|v|ɑː}}; {{lang-he|ישיבה}}, "sitting" (noun); '''metivta''' and '''mesivta''' ({{lang-arc|מתיבתא}} ''methivta''); '''[[Beth midrash]]''', '''Talmudical Academy''', '''Rabbinical Academy'''; and '''Rabbinical School'''. The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'', lit. "sitting", is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning "session."&lt;ref&gt;"Session", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', "to sit."&lt;/ref&gt;

The transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'', "the two colleges."

==History==

===Origins===
The [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a "city" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] ("house of judgement") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)&lt;/ref&gt; adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yarḥei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for "Months of Kallah") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.

===Geonic Period===
The Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.

Throughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.

The yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.

The yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.

The yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===

After the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa. One of these include the Kairuan yeshiva in Spain (Hebrew: ישיבת קאירואן) that was established by Chushiel Ben Elchanan (Hebrew: חושיאל בן אלחנן) in 974.&lt;ref&gt;מרדכי וורמברנד ובצלאל ס. רות, '''עם ישראל - תולדות 4000 שנה - מימי האבות ועד חוזה השלו'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, every town [[rabbi]] had the right to maintain a number of full-time or part-time pupils in the town's [[beth midrash]] (study hall, usually adjacent to the [[synagogue]]). Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, these young people would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere (after obtaining [[Semikhah|semicha]], rabbinical ordination) or join the workforce.

===Lithuanian yeshivas===
[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical [[beth midrash]] in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]
Organised Torah study was revolutionised by Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]], a disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]] (an influential 18th-century leader of Judaism). In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater for those who were looking for more intensive study.

With the support of his teacher, Rabbi Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the (now [[Belarus]]ian) town of Volozhin. Although the [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Hebron Yeshiva|Slabodka]], [[Panevėžys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions and often bear the same name.

In the 19th century, Rabbi [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (secularising movement), and emerging political ideologies such as [[Zionism]], that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized. After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshivah world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks ("mussar shmues"). A spiritual mentor ([[mashgiach ruchani]]) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree also, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began previously, in the 18th Century, within traditional Jewish life in the Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.

Some variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example the contrast between breadth (''beki'ut'') and depth (''iyyun''), or the place given to [[pilpul]] (the type of casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries). The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by Rabbi [[Chaim Soloveitchik]] of Brisk, has become widely popular, though there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and Novhardok, though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.

===Hasidic yeshivas===
With the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on [[Talmud]]ic literature that is central to Rabbinic Judaism, augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.

In many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. In contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts "with [[pilpul]]". Pilpul is the in-depth analytical investigation of a topic, traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of Talmudic study. The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the "Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the "Tract on Ecstasy" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.

===Sephardi yeshivas===
[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|Rabbinical School Jerusalem]]
Although the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.

The Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of esoteric Jewish mysticism ([[Kabbalah]]) in a more mainstream position that in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel, after the immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there, some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.

===Conservative movement yeshivas===
In 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with "positive-historical Judaism" (the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]). In subsequent years, [[Conservative Judaism]] established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as "yeshivas" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.

===Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas===
Non-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to [[Conservative Judaism]] include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.

===Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries===
[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]], the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]], and the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]]. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London , UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a "yeshiva".

===Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas===
{{main|List of yeshivas}}

==Types of yeshivot==
#Yeshiva Ketana ("junior yeshiva") - Many yeshivot ketanot in Israel and some in the Diaspora do not have a secular course of studies and all students learn Judaic Torah studies full-time.
#Yeshiva High School - Also called ''[[Mesivta]]'' or ''Mechina'' or ''Yeshiva Ketana'', combines the intensive Jewish religious education with a secular high school education. The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.
#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. (Note in [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]] they call their [[Mesivta|Mesivtas]]/Yeshiva ketanas, [[Mechina|Mechinas]].
#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.
#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva.
#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea, though having its intellectual roots traced to the Torah, is a relatively modern innovation of 19th-century Europe although The [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a "city" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. Often, a kollel will be in the same location as the yeshiva.
#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].
Traditionally, religious girls' schools are not called "yeshiva." The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical [[Halakha]] and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of [[Mishnah]] and sometimes [[Talmud]]. They are also sometimes called "yeshiva" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called "seminary" or ''"midrasha"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Curriculum==
Learning at an Orthodox yeshiva includes [[Torah study]]; the study of [[Rabbinic literature]], especially the [[Talmud]] (Rabbinic Judaism's central work); and the study of [[History of responsa|Responsa]] for Jewish observance, and alternatively ethical ([[Musar literature|Musar]]) or mystical ([[Hasidic philosophy]]) texts. In some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] texts or [[Kabbalah]] are studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]).

Non-Orthodox institutions offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, Halacha, and Philosophy, with an openness to modern scholarship.

===Chavruta-style learning===
{{main|Chavruta}}
Yeshiva students prepare for and review the ''shiur'' with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.&lt;ref name="Forta"/&gt; In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name="agora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeff"&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.&lt;ref name="zobin"&gt;{{cite book |pages=104&amp;ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may even wave their hands, pound the table, or shout at each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVvAe_U9stsC |page=422 |title=The Blackwell Reader in Judaism |last1=Neusner |first1=Jacob |last2=Avery-Peck |first2=Alan J. |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishers]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-631-20738-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the size of the yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of pairs of chavrutas can be heard discussing and debating each other's viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-20wAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chavruta&amp;dq=chavruta |title=Ein Yaakov: The Ethical and Inspirational Teachings of the Talmud |page=xxix |last=Finkel |first=Avraham Yaakov |year=1999 |publisher=Jason Aronson |isbn=0-7657-6082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the skills of chavruta-style learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's ''chavruta'' alone.&lt;ref name="Forta"/&gt;

==Academic year==
{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}
In most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim''. [[Elul]] zman starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. This is the shortest (approx. six weeks), but most intense semester as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]. Winter zman starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer semester starts after [[Passover]] and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.

*10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. - Optional evening ''seder''

This schedule is generally maintained Sunday through Thursday. On Thursday nights, there may be an extra long night seder, known as ''mishmar'' sometimes lasting beyond 1:00 am, and in some yeshivot even until the following sunrise. On Fridays, there is usually at least one ''seder'' in the morning, with unstructured learning schedules for the afternoon. Saturdays have a special [[Shabbat]] schedule which includes some ''sedarim'' but usually no shiur.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Talmud study===
In the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is study in-depth (''iyyun''), often confined to selected legally focused tractates, with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second seeks to cover ground more speedily, to build general knowledge (''beki'ut'') of the Talmud.

In the yeshiva system of talmudic study the first area to be mastered are eight ''mesechtohs'' (volumes that deal with a given subject which are divided into chapters that deal with sub-topics relating to the general subject) that deal with civil jurisprudence. These are the ''mesechtohs'' that are studied in undergraduate yeshivot. These eight volumes are mastered first because it is with these subjects that a student can best master the technique of proper analysis of the talmud. Only after this technique is mastered is a student ready to go on to other areas of the talmud and develop a scholarship in all areas of the Talmud.

Works generally studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]] and the analyses of the [[Tosafists]] and other ''[[rishonim]]'' (commentators from the 11th to 14th centuries). There are two schools of ''rishonim'', one from France and the other from Spain who will sometimes hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud. Various other ''[[mefarshim]]'' (commentators), from later generations are also used.

===Jewish law===
Generally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''[[halacha]]'' (Jewish law). The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazic Yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' written by Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]], the Chofetz Chaim. The ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' is a compilation of ''halachic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. In Sephardic Yeshivot, the Shulhan Arukh itself is more commonly studied. The [[Beth Yoseph|Bet Yosef]] is also more widely studied in Sepharadic Yeshivot.

===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===
The preeminent [[musar literature|mussar (ethical) text]] studied in ''yeshivot'' is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' ("Path [of the] Just") by Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of [[mussar literature]] studied include:
*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' ("Paths [of the] Righteous") Its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.
*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'', by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].
*''Ma'alot ha-Middot'' ("Benefit [of good character] traits")
*''Mishnat R' Aharon'' Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler|Rabbi Aharon Kotler]].
*''Mikhtav me-Eliyahu'', the works of Rabbi [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].

[[Hasidism|Hasidic]] yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of [[Kabbalah]], but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional [[dveikus]] (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to mussar, but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. [[Chabad-Lubavitch|Chabad]] yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. Many Yeshivot in Israel belonging to the Religious Zionism study the writings of [[Rav Kook]], who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy.

===Torah and Bible study===
Intensive study of the [[Torah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]] with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades, often with Yiddish translations and more notes in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] yeshivas.

The teaching of [[Tanakh]], Hebrew Bible, is usually only done on the high school level, and students read the [[weekly Torah portion]] by themselves (known as the obligation of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', "Hebrew Bible twice and Aramaic [[Targum]] once"). Exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. Since their inception, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot in Israel, offer courses in many, if not most, of the books of [[Nevi'im]] and [[Ketuvim]].

== College credit ==
Some Yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis, (although often not encouraged) and this is facilitated by arrangements for the above study to receive credit towards a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
In most [[Litvish|Lithuanian]] and [[Hasidic]] yeshivot throughout the world, classes are taught in [[Yiddish]]; Modern Orthodox, Zionist or ''[[baal teshuvah]]'' yeshivot may use Israeli Hebrew or the local language. Students learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient in, with [[Hasidic]] students usually learning in [[Yiddish]], Israeli [[Litvish|Lithuanian]] students in [[Hebrew]], and American [[Litvish|Lithuanian]] students in English.

===Yeshivish===
[[Yeshivish]], also "Frumspeak", is a term used somewhat jokingly for the Yiddish- and Hebrew- influenced English used in Orthodox yeshivas in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://forward.com/culture/135621/how-to-understand-yeshivish/ |title=How to Understand Yeshivish |author=Philogos |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2018-10-06 |work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
