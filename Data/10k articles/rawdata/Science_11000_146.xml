      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1870">An '''Alisol''' is a Reference Soil Group of the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB).

Alisols have an ''argic horizon'', which has a high [[cation exchange capacity]]. In the subsoil, the [[base saturation]] is low.

There exist mixed forms, for example 'Stagnic Alisol', that are mainly Alisol, but also contain components that are found in [[Stagnosol]]s.

Alisols occur in [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[humid subtropical climate]]s, but are also found in temperate regions.&lt;ref&gt;Chesworth, Ward (editor); ''Encyclopedia of Soil Science''; p. 36. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[Lixisol]]s, [[Acrisol]]s and [[Ferralsol]]s, Alisols have much higher-activity clays and are likely to be found on younger terrains or more geologically active regions such as [[Kyushu]] and [[Chugoku]].

==Agricultural use==
Alisols are acidic (increased by limited drainage) and therefore need liming, contain few nutrients and therefore need fertilizer, and do not have much surface coherence so are easily eroded.

Aluminium and manganese toxicity is a very serious problem in Alisols, because at the low [[pH]] of these soils such generally insoluble metals become soluble and can poison plants which are not tolerant of them. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions oil palm, cotton, and maize (corn) as crops suitable to be grown on Alisols, though most crops require very intensive fertilisation for long-term success.

The '''Alvarez hypothesis''' posits that the [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s and many other living things during the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] was caused by the [[Impact event|impact]] of a large [[asteroid]] on the [[Earth]]. Prior to 2013, it was commonly cited as having happened about 65 million years ago, but a 2013 paper by Renne et al. gave an updated value of 66 million years.&lt;ref name="Renne2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Renne |first=Paul R. |last2=Deino |first2=Alan L. |last3=Hilgen |first3=Frederik J. |last4=Kuiper |first4=Klaudia F. |last5=Mark |first5=Darren F. |last6=Mitchell |first6=William S. |last7=Morgan |first7=Leah E. |last8=Mundil |first8=Roland |last9=Smit |first9=Jan |title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary |journal=Science |date=7 February 2013 |volume=339 |issue=6120 |pages=684–687 |doi=10.1126/science.1230492 |pmid=23393261 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/684 |bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence indicates that the asteroid fell in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], at Chicxulub, [[Mexico]]. The hypothesis is named after the father-and-son team of scientists [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis]] and [[Walter Alvarez]], who first suggested it in 1980. 

In March 2010, an international panel of scientists endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact]], as being the cause of the extinction. A team of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and in so doing also ruled out other theories such as massive volcanism. They had determined that a {{convert|10|–|15|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} space rock hurtled into earth at Chicxulub. For comparison, the Martian moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] is {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} and Mount Everest is just under {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on|1}}. The collision would have released the same energy as {{convert|100000000|MtTNT|J}}, over a billion times the energy of the atomic bombs dropped on [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schulte |first1=P. |last2=Alegret |first2=L. |last3=Arenillas |first3=I. |last4=Arz |first4=J.

A 2016 drilling project into the peak ring of the crater strongly supported the hypothesis, and confirmed various matters that had been unclear until that point. These included the fact that the peak ring comprised granite (a rock found deep within the earth) rather than typical sea floor rock, which had been shocked, melted, and ejected to the surface in minutes, and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards from sand deposits. Crucially the cores also showed a near complete absence of [[gypsum]], a sulfate-containing rock, which would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, confirming the presence of a probable link between the impact and global longer-term effects on the climate and food chain.

==History==
{{main|Timeline of Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event research}}
In 1980, a team of researchers led by Nobel prize-winning physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and chemists [[Frank Asaro]] and [[Helen Vaughn Michel]] discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–Pg boundary, formerly called Cretaceous–Tertiary or K–T boundary) contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] hundreds of times greater than normal. Iridium is extremely rare in the Earth's crust because it is very dense and has the affinity for iron that characterizes the siderophile elements (see [[Goldschmidt classification]]), and therefore most of it sank into the Earth's core while the earth was still molten. The Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the earth at the time of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alvarez |first1=L.W. |last2=Alvarez |first2=W. |last3=Asaro |first3=F. |last4=Michel |first4=H. V. |year=1980 |title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction |journal=Science |volume=208 |issue=4448 |pages=1095–1108 |bibcode=1980Sci...208.1095A |doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095 |pmid=17783054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, in a 1953 publication, geologists [[Allan O. Kelly]] and [[Frank Dachille]] analyzed global geological evidence suggesting that one or more giant asteroids impacted the Earth, causing an angular shift in its axis, global floods, fire, atmospheric occlusion, and the [[extinction of the dinosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly |first1=A. O. |last2=Dachille |first2=F. |year=1953 |title=Target: Earth – The Role of Large Meteors In Earth Science |publisher= |location=Carlsbad, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/news_detail.cfm?ID=72 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215144945/http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/news_detail.cfm?ID=72 |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but without strong confirming evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Laubenfels |first=M. W. |year=1956 |title=Dinosaur Extinctions: One More Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=207–218 |jstor=1300393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The evidence for the Alvarez impact hypothesis is supported by [[Chondrite|chondritic]] [[meteorite]]s and [[asteroid]]s which contain a much higher iridium concentration than the Earth's crust. The [[isotope|isotopic]] ratio of iridium in meteorites is similar to that of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer but significantly different from the ratio in the Earth's crust. [[Chromium]] isotopic anomalies found in Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary sediments are similar to that of an asteroid or a comet composed of [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s. [[Shocked quartz]] granules, glass spherules and [[tektite]]s, indicative of an impact event, are common in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, especially in deposits from around the Caribbean. All of these constituents are embedded in a layer of clay, which the Alvarez team interpreted as the debris spread all over the world by the impact.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;  The location of the impact was unknown when the Alvarez team developed their hypothesis, but later scientists discovered the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub Crater]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], now considered the likely impact site.

[[Image:KT boundary 054.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Badlands near [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]] where erosion has exposed the K–Pg boundary.]]

Using estimates of the total amount of iridium in the K–Pg layer, and assuming that the asteroid contained the normal percentage of iridium found in [[chondrites]], the Alvarez team went on to calculate the size of the asteroid. The answer was about 10 kilometers (6&amp;nbsp;mi) in diameter, about the size of Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Such a large impact would have had approximately the energy of 100&amp;nbsp;million [[TNT equivalent|megatons]], i.e. about 2 million times as great as the most powerful [[thermonuclear bomb]] ever [[Tsar Bomba|tested]].

[[Paul Renne]] of the [[Berkeley Geochronology Center]] has reported that the date of the asteroid event is 66,038,000 years ago, plus or minus 11,000 years, based on the [[radioactive decay]] of [[argon]].  He further posits that the mass extinction of dinosaurs occurred within 33,000 years of this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perlman |first=D. |date=8 February 2013 |title=Dinosaur extinction battle flares |url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Dinosaur-extinction-battle-flares-4261978.php |work=[[SF Gate]] |accessdate=2013-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The most easily observable consequence of such an impact would be a vast dust cloud which would block sunlight and prevent photosynthesis for a few years, an event called an [[impact winter]]. This would account for the extinction of plants and [[phytoplankton]] and of all organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). But small creatures whose food chains were based on [[detritus]] would have a reasonable chance of survival.  It is estimated that sulfuric acid aerosols were injected into the stratosphere, leading to a 10–20% reduction of solar transmission normal for that period.  It would have taken at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ocampo |first1=A. |last2=Vajda |first2=V. |last3=Buffetaut |first3=E. |year=2006 |chapter=Unravelling the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) Turnover, Evidence from Flora, Fauna and Geology |editor1-last=Cockell |editor1-first=C. |editor2-last=Gilmour |editor2-first=I. |editor3-last=Koeberl |editor3-first=C. |title=Biological Processes Associated with Impact Events |publisher=SpringerLink |pages=197–219 |isbn=978-3-540-25735-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global firestorms may have resulted as incendiary fragments from the blast fell back to Earth. Analyses of [[fluid inclusions]] in ancient [[amber]] suggest that the [[oxygen]] content of the atmosphere was very high (30–35%) during the late Cretaceous. This high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plummeted in the early Paleogene Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMenamin |first1=M. A. S.|last2=Schulte McMenamin |first2=D. |year=1987 |title=Late Cretaceous Atmospheric Oxygen |journal=Science |volume=235 |issue=4796 |pages=1561-1562 |bibcode = 1987Sci...235.1561R |doi = 10.1126/science.235.4796.1561a }}&lt;/ref&gt; If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary [[greenhouse effect]] once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable survivors of the "long winter".

The impact may also have produced [[acid rain]], depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor. Chemical buffers would have limited the changes, and the survival of animals vulnerable to acid rain effects (such as [[frog]]s) indicate this was not a major contributor to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kring |first=D. A. |year=2003 |title=Environmental consequences of impact cratering events as a function of ambient conditions on Earth |journal=Astrobiology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=133–152 |bibcode = 2003AsBio...3..133K |doi=10.1089/153110703321632471 |pmid=12809133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact hypotheses can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulphuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time &amp;mdash; possibly under ten years.

Although further studies of the K–Pg layer consistently show the excess of iridium, the idea that the dinosaurs were exterminated by an asteroid remained a matter of controversy among [[geologist]]s and [[paleontologist]]s for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keller |first=G. |year=2005 |title=Impacts, volcanism and mass extinction: random coincidence or cause and effect? |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/earth-sci/083f/kellerkt.pdf |journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences |volume=52 |number=4-5 |pages=725–757 |doi=10.1080/08120090500170393|bibcode=2005AuJES..52..725K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Criticism==
Amongst others, [[Charles B. Officer]] and [[Gerta Keller]] have been critical of the theory.

Officer and Jake Page  describe in their ''The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy''&lt;ref&gt;Blake &amp; Officer (1996). The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy (Addison-Wesley), {{ISBN|0-201-48384-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  how
* A dust cloud from an asteroid impact could not have existed because many marine plants that require uninterrupted sunlight were unaffected 
* The iridium deposits appear to be the work of volcanoes 
* The extinctions occurred gradually, not instantaneously "Even if a meteoric impact occurred at K-T time, it simply could not explain the extinction record."
* The Chicxulub structure is a volcanic sequence of late Cretaceous age; it is not an impact meltsheet of Cretaceous-Tertiary age
* Papers disputing the Alvarez hypothesis were summarily rejected by journals without review 

Keller has focussed on [[Deccan Traps]] volcanism as a likely cause of a more gradual extinction. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine |last=Bosker |first=Bianca |date=September 2018 |title=What Caused the Dinosaur Extinction? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/dinosaur-extinction-debate/565769/|magazine=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 Chicxulub crater drilling project==
{{main|Chicxulub crater|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}
In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the [[peak ring]] of the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact crater]], to obtain [[rock core]] samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact, and its effects. They confirmed that the rock composing the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact; that [[gypsum]], a [[sulfate]]-containing rock that ''is'' usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed by a huge [[megatsunami]] (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.  

These strongly support the hypothesis that the impactor was large enough to create a 120 mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject [[granite|basement granite]] from the [[midcrust]] deep within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted for a long time.  This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the [[food chain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/updated-drilling-dinosaur-killing-impact-crater-explains-buried-circular-hills&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/science/chicxulub-crater-dinosaur-extinction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bibliography of Carl Linnaeus''' includes academic works about botany, zoology, [[nomenclature]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] written by the Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778). Linnaeus laid the foundations for the modern scheme of [[binomial nomenclature]] and is known as the father of modern taxonomy. His most famous works is ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' which is considered as the starting point for zoological nomenclature together with ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' which is internationally accepted as the beginning of modern [[botanical nomenclature]].

'''Casimir pressure''' is created by the [[Casimir force]] of [[virtual particle]]s.

According to experiments, the Casimir force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; between two closely spaced neutral parallel plate conductors is directly proportional to their surface area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;F=PA.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, dividing the magnitude of Casimir force by the area of each conductor, Casimir pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be found. Because the Casimir force between conductors is attractive, the Casimir pressure in space between the conductors is negative.

Because virtual particles are physical representations of the [[zero point energy]] of physical [[vacuum]], the Casimir pressure is the difference in the density of the zero point energy of empty space inside and outside of cavity made by conductive plates.

Some scientists{{who|date=November 2011}} believe that zero point energy is the dominant energy of the [[Universe]] and that the Casimir pressure of this energy is the main cause of the observed [[accelerated expansion]] of the Universe. In other words, virtual particles drive the accelerated expansion of the Universe.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

== Early life and education ==
Olkin was born and raised in Michigan. As a child, Olkin considered a variety of careers in science and academia, including [[geologist]], [[paleontologist]],  [[archaeologist]], and [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/meet-three-scientists-behind-the-pluto-mission/|title=Meet three scientists behind the Pluto mission|last1=Crigger|first1=Megan|date=July 24, 2015|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In college, she was [[pre-med]] before switching to [[engineering]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; earning a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Aeronautics]] and [[Astronautics]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1988, then an [[Master of Science|M.S.]], also in Aeronautics and Astronautics, from [[Stanford University]] in 1989. Olkin then returned to MIT where she earned a Ph.D. in Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Science in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~colkin/CathyOlkin/Experience_%26_Education.html|title=Cathy Olkin - Experience &amp; Education|website=www.boulder.swri.edu|publisher=Southwest Research Institute|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dissertation advisor was [[James L.

'''Double salts''' are salts containing more than one [[ion|cation]] or [[ion|anion]], and are obtained by combination of two different salts which were [[crystallization|crystallized]] in the same regular ionic [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. Examples of double salts include [[alum]]s (with the general formula M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;[SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) or [[Tutton's salt]]s (with the general formula [M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;[SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name=InorgChem&gt;{{Housecroft3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[potassium sodium tartrate]], [[ammonium iron(II) sulfate]] (Mohr's salt), and [[Alstonite|bromlite]]. [[Aluminium sulfacetate]], {{chem|Al|2|SO|4|(CH|3|CO|2|)|4}}, is an example of a double salt with two distinct anions; another is the salt {{chem|Tl|4|(OH)|2|CO|3|}} where hydroxyl-centred triangles of thallium, {{chem|[Tl|3|(OH)]|2+}}, are a recurring structural motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Hydroxocentered {{chem|[(OH)Tl|3|]|2+}} triangle as a building unit in thallium compounds: synthesis and crystal structure of {{chem|Tl|4|(OH)|2|CO|3}}|first1 = Oleg I.|last1 = Siidra|first2 = Sergey N.|last2 = Britvin|first3 = Sergey V.|last3 = Krivovichev|journal = [[Zeitschrift für Kristallographie]]|volume = 224|issue = 12|pages = 563–567|doi = 10.1524/zkri.2009.1213|year = 2009|bibcode = 2009ZK....224..563S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Double salts should not be confused with [[coordination complex|complexes]]. When dissolved in water, a double salt completely dissociates into simple ions while a complex does not; the [[coordination complex|complex ion]] remains unchanged. For example, KCeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a double salt and gives K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ions when dissolved in water, whereas K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[YbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is a complex salt and contains the discrete [YbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ion which remains intact in [[aqueous solution]]s.&lt;ref name=InorgChem/&gt; It is therefore important to indicate the [[coordination complex|complex ion]] by adding square brackets "[ ]" around it.  Double salts are distinct from mixed-crystal systems where two salts co-crystallise;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Mixed crystals and double salts between metal(II) salt hydrates|last = Balarew|first = Christo|journal = [[Zeitschrift für Kristallographie]]|volume = 181|issue = 1-4|pages = 35–82|doi = 10.1524/zkri.1987.181.1-4.35|year = 1987|bibcode = 1987ZK....181...35B}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to an [[Ida Freund]] publication from 1904 reprinted in 2014, the former involves a chemical combination with fixed composition, whereas the latter is a mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=9ttkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA448|title = The Study of Chemical Composition: An Account of its Method and Historical Development with Illustrative Quotations|first = Ida|last = Freund|authorlink = Ida Freund|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 2014|isbn = 9781107690301|chapter = Mitscherlich and the Connection between Crystalline Form and Chemical Composition|pages = 385–453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the properties of the double salt formed will not be the same as the properties of its component single salts.

'''''Eureka!''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[educational]] [[television series]] which was produced and broadcast by [[TVOntario]] in 1980 and 1981. The series was narrated by [[Billy Van]], and featured a series of [[animated]] vignettes which taught [[physics]] lessons to children. It is currently available online.

==Synopsis==

Eureka! is a series of animated shorts that illustrate concepts in physics. Each program takes a simple and direct approach to the subject matter; while the basic concepts are explained in a voice-over, cartoon characters and a variety of animated objects demonstrate the principles on the screen. Constant review and reinforcement make the message clear; as a result, the study of physics becomes easy and accessible - even to viewers without a solid background in the subject. Basic formulae and concepts are introduced with a recap of what was learnt in the previous episode to build knowledge on a topic and create connections.

==Production==

Animation - Grafilm Productions Inc.

Design - Joe Meluck

Educational Consultants - John Kuropatwa, Paul Henshall, Bryan Kaufman, Ernie McFarland, Michael Broschart

Unit Manager - Vickie Gilchrist

Production Assistant - George Pyron

The '''Exploratorium''' is a museum in [[San Francisco]] that allows visitors to explore the world through science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide. It has been described by the ''New York Times'' as the most important science museum to have opened since the mid-20th century, an achievement attributed to "the nature of its exhibits, its wide-ranging influence and its sophisticated teacher training program".&lt;ref name=Lawlessness&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=An Emphasis on Newton’s Laws (and a Little Lawlessness)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/arts/design/the-new-exploratorium-opens-in-san-francisco.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized as "a mad scientist's penny arcade, a scientific funhouse, and an experimental laboratory all rolled into one",&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Allison|title=A First Look at the New Exploratorium|url=http://www.7x7.com/arts-culture/first-look-new-exploratorium|work=7x7 Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the participatory nature of its exhibits and its self-identification as a center for informal learning has led to it being cited as the prototype for participatory museums around the world.&lt;ref name=Thrill&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=The Thrill of Science, Tamed by Agendas|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium was founded by physicist and educator [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and opened in 1969 at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]], its home until January 2, 2013. On April 17, 2013, the Exploratorium reopened at Piers 15 and 17 on San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. The historic interior and exterior of Pier 15 was renovated extensively prior to the move, and is divided into several galleries mainly separated by content, including the physics of seeing and listening (Light and Sound), Human Behavior, Living Systems, Tinkering (including electricity and magnetism), the Outdoor Gallery, and the Bay Observatory Gallery, which focuses on local environment, weather, and landscape.

Since the museum's founding, over 1,000 participatory exhibits have been created, approximately 600 of which are on the floor at any given time. The exhibit-building workshop space is contained within the museum and is open to view. In addition to the public exhibition space, the Exploratorium has been engaged in the professional development of teachers, science education reform, and the promotion of museums as informal education centers since its founding. Since Oppenheimer's death in 1985, the Exploratorium has expanded into other domains, including its 50,000-page website and two iPad apps on sound and color. It has also inspired an international network of participatory museums working to engage the public with general science education.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium to Show New Face in a New Place|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/science/exploratorium-to-reopen-on-san-francisco-bay-in-2013.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Exploratorium building is also working to showcase environmental sustainability efforts as part of its goal to become the largest net-zero museum in the country.&lt;ref name=SFGateNetZero&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium sets 'Net-Zero' energy goal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-sets-Net-Zero-energy-goal-4422432.php?t=6a884541ce|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium offers visitors a variety of ways—including exhibits, webcasts, websites and events—to explore and understand the world around them. In 2011, the Exploratorium received the [[National Science Board]] 2011 Public Service Science Award for its contributions to public understanding of science and engineering.&lt;ref name='NSF2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119077&amp;org=NSB&amp;from=news | title = San Francisco-based Exploratorium to Receive National Science Board's 2011 Public Service Award | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | date = April 4, 2011 | publisher = [[National Science Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Inside exploratorium.jpg|thumb|left|Exploratorium's main floor, in its original [[Palace of Fine Arts]] location (2009)]]

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Frank Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frank Oppenheimer]], founder of the Exploratorium]]
The Exploratorium is the brainchild of [[Frank Oppenheimer]], an experimental physicist and university professor. Oppenheimer, who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] with his brother [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], was diverted from an academic career when he was forced to resign from his position at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1949 as a result of an inquiry by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He was blacklisted from academic positions across the country, and withdrew with his family to run a Colorado [[cattle ranch]] for almost a decade.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|104–115}}

Oppenheimer also began lending a hand with science projects of local high school students, eventually becoming the sole science teacher at the high school in [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]]. The field trips and experiments he did with his high school students would become a blueprint for the hands-on methods of teaching and learning he would later bring to the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|115–121}}
 
When Oppenheimer was invited to join the University of Colorado's physics department in 1959, he found himself less interested in traditional laboratory research and much more interested in exploring methods of provoking curiosity and inquiry.  He received a grant from the National Science Foundation, which he used to build models of nearly a hundred science experiments.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}} This "Library of Experiments" would become the core of the Exploratorium exhibit collection, and was the forerunner of the ''Exploratorium Cookbook'', a manual explaining how to build these basic science exhibits.&lt;ref name=Cookbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium Cookbook I: A Construction Manual for Exploratorium Exhibits |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |work=Exploratorium Publications |publisher=The Exploratorium |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423045619/http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |archivedate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced of the need for public museums to supplement science curricula at all levels, he toured Europe and studied museums on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. Three European museums, encountered during that year, served as important influences on the founding of the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.

Back in the United States, Oppenheimer was invited to do the initial planning for a new branch of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but he turned it down to work on what he called his "San Francisco project". In 1967, the Oppenheimers came to [[San Francisco]] with a view towards opening an independent museum of their own. Oppenheimer sought funding and support for the endeavor using a grassroots approach, bringing a written proposal and some handmade exhibits with him as he visited scientists, businesses, city and school officials, relatives, and friends. Many prominent scientists and cultural figures endorsed the project, and the offers of support in conjunction with a $50,000 grant from the [[San Francisco Foundation]] made the museum realizable.

In late August 1969, the Exploratorium opened with little fanfare at the Palace of Fine Arts.

===Move to Piers 15 and 17===
The Exploratorium relocated from the Palace of Fine Arts to Piers 15 and 17, located between the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] along the San Francisco Embarcadero, in April 2013. The Piers location was identified by Goéry Delacôte and then-board chairman Van Kasper as a potential space for relocation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Build: The Making of a Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-66-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution exempting the museum’s 66-year lease of the piers from San Francisco’s competitive bidding process due to its unique nature as a cultural and educational institution.&lt;ref name=Sadiq&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadiq|first=Sheraz|title=Exploratorium Unveils Plans for New Home|url=http://science.kqed.org/quest/2010/10/19/exploratorium-unveils-plans-for-new-home/|work=QUEST|publisher=KQED|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking for the project, which required substantial construction and renovation, occurred on October 19, 2010. The Exploratorium holds a 66-year lease on the piers with the Port of San Francisco. Exhibits are currently only viewable at the  Pier 15 campus; Pier 17 houses some staff, with the option for future expansion.&lt;ref name=Perlman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium in S.F. beginning work on new home|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-in-S-F-beginning-work-on-new-home-3170176.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers 15 and 17 are historic piers, built in 1931 and 1912 respectively.&lt;ref name="Under"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Under: The World Below the Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-67-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}    In 1954, the area between the piers was infilled and paved over. This infill was removed as part of the construction phase, restoring the space between the piers to public plazas, a pedestrian bridge, and open water.

==Architecture and design==

===Renovation of Piers 15 and 17===
[[File:Rust wedge.jpg|thumb|upright|Outdoors "Rust Wedge" display shows the enormous expansive force of [[rust|rusting iron]]]]
The Exploratorium campus comprises  {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of indoor and outdoor exhibit space, and includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of freely accessible public space. The exhibits are housed in and around Pier 15, which extends over {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the Bay.&lt;ref name=MovingScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Beato|first=Greg|title=The Science of Moving Science Across Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/artsspecial/how-the-exploratorium-in-san-francisco-moved-across-town.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 was designed by architecture firm [[EHDD]].&lt;ref name=Breakthrough&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Lydia |title=Breakthrough at San Francisco's Exploratorium |url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The Architect's Newspaper |date=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517153030/http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nibbi Brothers served as the General Contractor,&lt;ref name="Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerfen|first=Katie|title=Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/exploratorium-designed-by-ehdd_o|accessdate=4 August 2015|newspaper=THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum)]] as the Glazing Contractor. The piers had been neglected for decades leading up to the Exploratorium’s move, and extensive renovation and repair was required.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Nearly two thirds of the [[piling]]s under Pier 15 were repaired, including almost every piling needed to provide structural integrity, and new pilings were sunk.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The removal of the parking lot between the piers was done slowly over the two years of construction, and the debris from the removal was captured and recycled.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} Several pilings were left in the water between the piers, both for aesthetic reasons and to support future exhibits.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

An effort was made in the construction of the new location to preserve the historic elements of Pier 15.  The Bay Observatory was the only new structure added to the site. The east end of the pier was cleaned of [[lead paint]], revealing historic lettering underneath; designers chose to preserve the lettering rather than paint it over.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} As a result, the traces of the shipping lines that originally frequented the pier can still be seen. Some of the preservation efforts presented challenges in design, however; historic windows created energy losses that had to be offset elsewhere, and the historic interior trusswork was mainly restored rather than removed, meaning that the upper-level staff offices had to be built around them.&lt;ref name="Sustain"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-68-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Other challenges to the design of the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Other conflicts between construction and energy use included the glass in the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The fritting also makes the reflective surfaces of the Bay Observatory safe for birds.&lt;ref name=TakingFlight&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiber |first=Dan |title=Bird-safe building standards taking flight in San Francisco |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner |date=June 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908200100/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pier 15 incorporated two seismic joints as part of its [[seismic retrofit]], one separating the Bay Observatory from the Pier 15 shed and the other separating the entire pier from the land. This second joint ensures that the entire pier will move independently from the land mass in the event of an earthquake, significantly reducing the potential [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] stress.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The café at the west end of the Exploratorium is named the Seismic Joint in honor of the joint, which cuts through the area of the building where the café is situated.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

The aesthetic of the project was defined as "industrial naval chic" in keeping with the pier’s history.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|63}}

===Restaurant===
[[File:Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|The design scheme for the Exploratorium's Seaglass Restaurant was inspired by the exhibit ''Color of Water''.]]
The design aesthetic for both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass Restaurant was created by designer Olle Lundberg and based on the exhibit ''Color of Water''. The bar at Seaglass features a specially designed version of Exploratorium artist Shawn Lani’s exhibit ''Icy Bodies''.&lt;ref name=Feasters&gt;{{cite web|last=Meier-Johnson|first=Pat|title=Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium: A Sense for the Feasters|url=http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|work=The Connected Traveler|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204423/http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LorettaKeller&gt;{{cite web|last=Pape|first=Allie|title=Loretta Keller's Exploratorium Duo to Open April 17|url=http://sf.eater.com/archives/2013/03/25/loretta_kellers_exploratorium_restaurants_to_open_april_17.php|work=SF Eater|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a net-zero energy goal as part of its overall sustainability efforts. Setting this net-zero goal means that, while in operation, The Exploratorium will produce more energy on-site than it will consume on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Drury B.|last2=Torcellini|first2=Paul A., Ph.D., P.E.|title=Understanding Zero-Energy Buildings|journal=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.|date=September 2006|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum highlights its sustainability efforts in visible ways throughout the museum as part of a stated intention to lead by example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=22|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TruongEcoFriendly&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Landmark museum to reopen as most energy-efficient institute on Earth|url=https://news.yahoo.com/landmark-museum-to-reopen-as-most-eco-friendly-institute-on-earth-195905286.html|work=Yahoo!

The Exploratorium, in order to reach its net-zero energy goal, produces energy with a roof-mounted array of [[photovoltaics]].  There are 5,874 PV modules on the roof, totaling {{convert|78,712|sqft|m2}}, with a projected year-1 yield of 1.3 MW-AC/square foot (13.9 MW-AC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or a total year-1 yield of 2,113,715 kWh.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Fact Sheet: Environmentally Conscious Inside and Out|url=http://www.ehdd.com/sites/ehdd2/images/6275/Exploratorium%20Sustainability%20Project%20Sheet.pdf|website=EHDD Architecture|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any surplus energy generated is intended to be fed back into the utility grid, as the projected annual energy use for the building totals at 1,275,936 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium's Net-Zero Energy Goal for New Waterfront Home 2013|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratoriums-net-zero-energy-goal-new-waterfront-home-2013|website=Exploratorium|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abellon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon, P.E.|first1=Devin A.|title=Exploratorium's New Waterfront Home Features Innovative Radiant System Using SF Bay Water|url=http://uponor.media-resources-ordp.com/casestudies/exploratorium.shtml|website=Uponor, Inc.|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium, San Francisco.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium]]
In addition to solar power, the museum makes use of an [[HVAC]] system that takes advantage of the relatively constant, moderate temperature of the bay water under the piers, which is {{convert|50|to|65|F|C}}, to heat and cool the building. The bay water is filtered and sterilized before it is brought into a {{convert|4,000|USgal|m3}} cistern below the pier, where it is held for use.  When needed, the bay water is moved to a titanium [[heat exchanger]], of which the building has two, where it is either used to heat or cool water that is cycled through a system of thermally activated radiant slabs.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon|first1=Devin|title=Exploring Every Possibility|url=http://www.edcmag.com/articles/95153-the-exploratorium-at-pier-15|website=EDC: The Official Magazine for the LEED Professional|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are {{convert|27|mi|km}} of plastic tubing in the [[radiant heating]] system in the floor, creating 82 different heating and cooling zones with distinct control systems.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt; After the bay water passes through the heat exchangers, it is returned to the San Francisco Bay as allowed by a permit issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORDER NO. R2-2010-0082|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/board_decisions/adopted_orders/2010/R2-2010-0082.pdf|website=California Environmental Protection Agency: State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=California Regional Water Quality Control Board: San Francisco Bay Region|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the energy savings are expected to come from using the bay water as a [[heat sink]] for the building’s cooling needs.  When the temperature of the bay water is below that of the chilled water return from the radiant pipes, which is the case for most of the year in the Bay Area’s temperate climate, the system works in waterside [[economizer]] mode.  In this mode, the cooling loads are met either entirely or partially through passive heat exchange between the colder bay water and the warmer return water, greatly reducing the building’s energy needs.&lt;ref name=Abellon /&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a separate system for its ventilation needs, pairing a [[dedicated outdoor air system]] (DOAS) with [[displacement ventilation]] distribution to bring outdoor air into the building.  By integrating radiant heating and cooling and displacement ventilation, the Exploratorium has greatly reduced the portion of its HVAC system that relies on forced air.  Reducing the size of a building’s forced air system has the associated benefits of both lower energy loads as well as reduced ductwork, both of which are cost-saving.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straube|first1=John|title=The Perfect HVAC|url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-022-the-perfect-hvac|website=Building Science Corporation|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has multiple features designed to reduce its water consumption.  Two large cisterns under the structural beams connecting the southeast pilings capture up to {{convert|338,000|USgal|m3}} of rainwater and fog runoff for reuse in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=17|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plumbing is designed for water conservation, with [[waterless urinal]]s and [[dual-flush toilet]]s projected to save an annual million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the bay water heating and cooling system is estimated to save two million gallons of potable water a year by eliminating the need for traditional evaporative cooling towers.&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"/&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 also makes use of natural light in the effort to reduce energy loads.  The existing building had many clerestory windows and an overhead skylight that runs the length of the interior space.  In compliance with historic preservation requirements, the building’s façade was left mostly unchanged, allowing for much of the interior space to benefit from the existing architecture’s ample daylight.  The retrofit did include the addition of high performance glazing to the existing windows.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerfen|first1=Katie|title=Exploratorium|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/cultural-projects/exploratorium.aspx|website=Architect Magazine: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Young|first1=Mignon|title=Sustainability Around The Bay|url=http://www.gabreport.com/2014/05/sustainability-around-the-bay|website=GAB: Green Architecture and Building Report|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Exploratorium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum certification.&lt;ref name="USGBC Scorecard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium at Piers 15/17 LEED Scorecard|url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/exploratorium-piers-1517|website=US Green Building Council|publisher=US Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "After a two-year post-opening shakedown period of monitoring and adjusting the systems, the Exploratorium hopes to become the largest net-zero-energy-use museum in the United States and possibly the world."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Christopher|title=A San Francisco Museum, Reborn on the Bay|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/travel/a-san-francisco-museum-reborn-on-the-bay.html|accessdate=2013-08-07|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also turning its commitment to sustainability into a learning experience by showcasing elements of the building’s green design on site.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;

==Layout==
The new site contains over 600 exhibits, 25% of which were developed specifically for the Pier 15 site. With the exception of some art installations, all exhibits are developed and made onsite.&lt;ref name=OpensApril10&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium opens April 10 at Pier 15|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Exploratorium-opens-April-10-at-Pier-15-4430723.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoor and outdoor spaces are divided into six galleries, each highlighting a specific content group. Many exhibits are mobile, however, and move among different galleries; similarly, not all exhibits fall into distinct categories.

Exhibits cover a range of subject areas, including [[human perception]] (such as vision, hearing, learning and cognition), the life sciences, physical phenomena (such as light, motion, electricity, waves and resonance, and magnetism), local environment (water, wind, fog, rain, sun, and other elements, as well as cityscape, landscape, and the flora and fauna of the Bay) and human behavior (such as cooperation, competition, and sharing).&lt;ref name=MuseumGalleries&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Galleries|url=http://exploratorium.edu/visit/galleries/|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osher West Gallery: Human Behavior===
[[File:Blowing Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors collaborate to make a [[smoke ring]] at the Exploratorium's previous location at the Palace of Fine Arts]]
The West Gallery focuses on human behavior.  Its signage and exhibits encourage visitors to play with perception; investigate memory, emotion, and judgment; and experiment with how people cooperate, compete, and share. It holds exhibits such as ''Poker Face'' (partners try to assess when someone is bluffing), ''Trust Fountain'' (an experimental exhibit from the museum’s [[National Science Foundation]]-funded Science of Sharing project, this two-person drinking fountain is based on the [[Prisoner’s dilemma]], a classic scenario centering on negotiation and trust),&lt;ref name=GalleriesExhibits&gt;{{cite web|title=Galleries and Exhibit Highlights|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/galleries-and-exhibit-highlights|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tactile Dome'', a pitch-black environment visitors explore by touch, which was originally designed by [[August Coppola]].&lt;ref name=Coppola&gt;{{cite web|last=Barmann|first=Jay|title=August Coppola, Brother of Francis, Creator of Tactile Dome, Dies at 75|url=http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|work=SFist.com|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813044417/http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Gallery also included the temporary exhibition ''The Changing Face of What is Normal: Mental Health'', which showcased the personal artifacts of patients from the now-decommissioned Willard Psychiatric Center,&lt;ref name=Lawlessness /&gt; which was on view through April 2014.

The West Gallery also houses the Kanbar Forum, a cabaret-style theater that will host music events, science lectures, and other programs when it opens in summer 2013.&lt;ref name=sparkling&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Heather|title=San Francisco's Exploratorium opens in sparkling new home|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/tech/innovation/new-exploratorium|work=CNN|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Gallery: Tinkering===
The South Gallery is a workshop area where visitors can engage in learning through [[maker movement|hands-on making]], located directly across from the Exploratorium's own internal exhibit workshop, which is also open to their view. Oppenheimer wanted visitors to be able to “smell the oil”, and insisted that the usually hidden exhibit-building activities be on display as an exhibit in its own right.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Exploratorium Reborn: Inside San Francisco's New Innovation Shrine|url=https://gizmodo.com/5994274/exploratorium-reborn-inside-san-franciscos-new-shrine-to-innovation|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits in the South Gallery highlight a [[DIY]] aesthetic, and include ''Animation Stations'' where visitors can make their own [[stop motion|stop-motion films]].

Artworks on display include the ''Tinkerer’s Clock'' (a 22-foot-high clock constructed by artist [[Tim Hunkin]], with figurines in his noted cartoon style that can be manipulated by visitors and unfold into a clockface on the hour); and ''Rolling Through The Bay'' (a sculpture made by artist Scott Weaver over the course of 37 years, utilizing over 100,000 toothpicks and depicting many of the Bay Area’s iconic landmarks, through which a ping-pong ball can roll on one of several different "tours").&lt;ref name=rolling&gt;{{cite web|last=Koh|first=Barbara|title=At the Exploratorium – Scott Weaver’s Amazing Toothpick Art|url=http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/sfevents/p/At-The-Exploratorium-Scott-Weavers-Amazing-Toothpick-Art.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bechtel Central Gallery: Seeing and Listening===
[[File:Giant Mirror at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|A visitor investigates the reflective properties of the Giant Mirror in the Central Gallery of the Exploratorium at Pier 15.]]
The Bechtel Central gallery houses many of the "classic" Exploratorium exhibits, including many of those that have been on display since the very earliest years of the museum.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; It includes a mix of new and old exhibits that investigate physics and the perception of light, color, and sound, such as ''Sound Bite'' (a demonstration of hearing with the jawbone instead of the ears) and ''Bright Black'' (a trick of perception convinces viewers that an object is white when it is almost entirely black).

===East Gallery: Living Systems===
The East Gallery houses a much-expanded selection of life sciences exhibits. Many exhibits relate directly to the immediate local environment, such as the ''Glass Settling Plate'' (barnacles and other creatures are grown on a plate in the Bay, then put live under a mobile microscope to be observed from both above and below) and the ''Algae Chandelier'' (visitors can pump air to nourish overhead tanks of colorful phytoplankton). Other exhibits explore different biological systems and processes, such as the imaging station with mouse stem cells, the live cow’s eye dissections, and the ''Live Chicken Embryo'' (one of the oldest of the Living Systems exhibits, showing live chicken embryos at different stages of development).&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium shows off its huge new digs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57579443-1/san-francisco-exploratorium-shows-off-its-huge-new-digs/|work=CNET|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery===
The Bay Observatory building is the only new building constructed on the Exploratorium’s campus. It holds the Seaglass restaurant on its lower level and exhibits on the upper level relating to the waterfront and the cityscape. The gallery focuses on what visitors can see in real time, including the movement of clouds and tides, the changing waterfront, the movement of ships, and interpretation of oceanographic data. The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as ''Oculus'' (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery to be used as a timepiece, tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun’s movement), ''Visualizing the Bay'' (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the ''Map Table'' (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkes|first=Alison|title=The Exploratorium’s new eyes on the bay|url=http://baynature.org/2013/04/18/the-exploratoriums-new-eyes-on-the-bay/|work=Bay Nature Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Observatory also houses the Wired Pier project, which consists of more than a dozen sensors on and around the Bay Observatory that stream real-time data about the surrounding environment, such as quality of air and bay water, weather, tides and pollution, and compile it into interactive visualizations.&lt;ref name=Plutchak&gt;{{cite web|last=Plutchak|first=Rochelle|title=NOAA Science Has  Home at the New Exploratorium|url=http://research.noaa.gov/InDepth/Features/CurrentFeature/TabId/728/ArtMID/1884/ArticleID/10044/NOAA-Science-Has-a-Home-at-the-New-Exploratorium.aspx|work=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Website|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Gallery===
[[File:Fog Bridge at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|Mist from Fujiko Nakaya’s Fog Bridge drifts over the water between Piers 15 and 17 at the Exploratorium.]]
The Outdoor Gallery comprises the north, south, and east aprons of Pier 15, and extends through both ticketed and unticketed space. Focus is on direct interaction with the Bay environment, which can be seen in exhibits such as ''Color of Water'' (an installation of 32 distinct [[Textile sample|color swatches]] suspended below the rail surrounding the pier so that visitors can investigate the changing colors of the Bay’s water). Another notable exhibit is ''Remote Rains'', which allows visitors to choose a past rainstorm as profiled by the Hydrometeorology Testbed, which is then recreated by a rain machine that duplicates the frequency, size, and velocity of the raindrops, giving a tangible experience of [[NOAA]] research data on storms.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300M digs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130410/us-travel-san-francisco-new-exploratorium/|work=Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the publicly accessible bridge connecting Piers 15 and 17, artist [[Fujiko Nakaya]] created an installation called ''Fog Bridge #72494'' that creates bursts of fog for six minutes every half-hour as the first in a series of large-scale temporary installations called ''Over the Water''.&lt;ref name=overthewater&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Water|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/over-the-water|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Fog Bridge'' is {{convert|150|ft|m}} long and makes use of 800 nozzles to create the fog, which Nakaya hopes will inspire visitors to pay attention to the nature of one of San Francisco’s best-known weather patterns.  Although originally slated to be temporary, it is now on permanent display. A desalination system, located in Pier 17, conditions bay water for use in the artwork. &lt;ref name=Aleta&gt;{{cite web|last=Aleta|first=George|title=An Artist Creates Artificial Fog in San Francisco|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/artscience/2013/04/an-artist-creates-artificial-fog-in-san-francisco|work=Smithsonian Magazine Blog|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miranda" /&gt;

===Public space===
The Exploratorium campus includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of publicly accessible open space. This includes the plaza facing on the Embarcadero, the connector bridge between Piers 15 and 17 where ''Fog Bridge # 72494'' is installed, the south apron of Pier 17, and the east and south aprons of Pier 15. This public space overlaps with the Outdoor Gallery, and includes some notable exhibits, such as the ''Aeolian Harp'' (an expanded version of the original installation by Doug Hollis on the roof of the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts, first created in collaboration with Frank Oppenheimer in 1976)&lt;ref name=aeolian&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeolian Harp|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/aeolian-harp|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Bay Windows'' (visitors spin disks filled with samples of Bay mud, sand, and gravel gathered from five distinct regions of the Bay itself).&lt;ref name=baywindows&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay Windows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/bay-windows|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurant===
The lower level of the Bay Observatory Building houses the Seaglass Restaurant, which, like the Seismic Joint Cafe, is open to unticketed members of the public. Both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass are run by Loretta Keller, chef-owner at Coco500, in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.

==Educational programs==
The Exploratorium seeks to bring hands-on inquiry to education, including training teachers in the teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Teacher Institute===
[[File:Exploratorium teachers.jpg|thumb|right|Teachers from the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute examine the "String Thing" they built]]
The Teacher Institute, founded in 1984, is an Exploratorium-based professional development program geared towards middle and high school science teachers. In addition to providing workshops at the museum that teach hands-on and inquiry-based teaching methods, it provides coaches and support for novice teachers. Studies have shown that while 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within five years, the retention rate for teachers who go through the Teacher Institute is 85 to 90 percent.&lt;ref name=Olney&gt;{{cite news|last=Olney|first=Jennifer|title=Teachers participate in intense training program|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/focus_on_solutions&amp;id=8775413|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=KGO-TV|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teacher Institute is also home to the [[Iron Science Teacher]], a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching, which originated at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, ''[[Iron Chef]]'', this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail. Contestants are currently or formerly part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher". Shows are also archived on the Exploratorium's website.&lt;ref name=IronScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Theresa|title='Iron Science Teacher' competitors at Exploratorium use museum paper as secret ingredient in fun demos|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_20993010/iron-science-teacher-competitors-at-exploratorium-use-museum|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Jose Mercury News|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two out of three teachers applying were being turned away due to space limitations, by the time the Exploratorium closed at its former location; following the move to the Piers, the Exploratorium has been expanding its professional development for teachers through the Teacher Institute.&lt;ref name=Olney /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, two [[MOOC]] courses were also being made available through MOOC provider [[Coursera]]. One course integrates engineering into middle and high school [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] classrooms, and the other integrates [[maker movement|making and tinkering activities]] into elementary and middle school classrooms.&lt;ref name=Coursera&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Booker|title=Coursera Online Hub Offers Teachers Development|url=http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615031051/http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning programs===
The Exploratorium operates several programs centering on informal learning. The Institute for Inquiry (IFI) is a professional development program of the Exploratorium geared towards educators, scientists, administrators, and policymakers. The Institute is a recipient of National Science Foundation funding and designs programs, materials and tools to help leaders in the science education community further the role of inquiry in elementary science education and strengthen reform efforts. It consists of workshops and an online library of resources available to participants in the Institute.&lt;ref name=IFI&gt;{{Cite report |author=Inverness Research Associates |authorlink= |date=June 2001 |title=Report: The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry Four Cornerstone Claims|url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/2001-11-ExplorIFI-4CornerstnClaims/2001-11-Rpt-ExploratrmIFI_4CornerstnClaims-Execsum.PDF |publisher=Inverness Research |page=ii |docket= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Inquiry partnered with the [[Sonoma Valley Unified School District]] on a program combining science education with [[English Language Development]] (ELD). Data from the two-year pilot study showed that a professional development program designed to help teachers integrate ELD strategies into science lessons had a significant, measurable impact on the achievement of students in both ELD and in science.&lt;ref name=innovation&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Narrative: Integrating English Language Development and Science: A Professional Development Approach|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/narratives/u396c100434.pdf|work=Investing in Innovation Fund Website|publisher=US Department of Education|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a collaboration between the Exploratorium, the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], and [[King's College London]]. CILS studies the intersection between museums and schools as centers of informal learning with the intention of understanding how informal science learning occurs and how informal educational centers such as the Exploratorium can contribute to science education reform.&lt;ref name=CILS&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Details: Center for Informal Learning and Schools|url=http://informalscience.org/projects/ic-000-000-001-775/Center_for_Informal_Learning_and_Schools|work=Informal Science|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tinkering Studio began in 2008 as an in-house program geared towards [[maker culture]] and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within the museum in a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe,&lt;ref name=tinkering&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Julian|title=Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio makes science fun|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-s-Tinkering-Studio-makes-science-fun-2295556.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;{{cite news|last=Raker|first=Silva|title=Exploratorium expanding minds in Mideast|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Exploratorium-expanding-minds-in-Mideast-4395559.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, in collaboration with the Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the [[Discovery Science Center]], the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.&lt;ref name=cwsnetwork&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Michalchik |first1=Vera|last2=Remold|first2=Julie|last3=Verdugo |first3=Renato|date=March 2013 |title=California Tinkering Afterschool Network Pilot Year Evaluation Report |url=http://cswnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CA-Tinkering-Afterschool-Network-Evaluation-Report-FINAL.pdf |publisher=SRI International |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium also houses a number of other educational resources. These include the Learning Commons, a library and media resource center that houses a collection of print and digital science teaching resources for use by regional educators; a webcast studio, located in the Central Gallery, which produces 75 educational Webcasts from the museum and locations around the world annually, including a live webcast of the Mars [[Curiosity Rover]] launch and landing; and Lifelong Learning, which creates educational programming for children, teens, family groups, and adults. Lifelong Learning programs further the Exploratorium’s stated dedication to informal learning and the museum as teaching tool, and include day camps, workshops for families, the Homeschool Science series (in-house classes geared specifically towards homeschooled students), the Girl’s Science Institute (multi-day workshops geared towards girls 9-11), and excursions for adults. The Exploratorium has also published a number of books, and many of the 50,000 pages on its website are hands-on activity ideas or science experiments in the museums’ signature open-ended style.

===Educational outreach===
The Exploratorium operates several educational outreach programs. The Community Outreach Program works with community organizations to provide exhibit-based educational activities for underserved children and families in the local community.&lt;ref name=tecolote&gt;{{cite news|last=Leibrich|first=Ryan|title=New Exploratorium location opens its doors|url=http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=El Tecolote|date=April 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204600/http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also home to XTech, a science education program for underserved middle school students. Begun in 2006, XTech was primarily funded by a National Science Foundation grant and provided afterschool activities in science, engineering, and technology in partnership with two community-based organizations in the Bay Area. XTech serves over 100 students a year in addition to 10-15 youth facilitators.&lt;ref name=xtech&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Carroll |first1=Becky |last2=Castori |first2=Pam |last3=Smith |first3=Anita |date=September 2009 |title=The Exploratorium's XTech Program: Engaging STEM Experiences for Middle School Youth |url=http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |publisher=Inverness Research |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133042/http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explainers===
The Exploratorium Explainer program, which has been operating since the museum opened, hires and trains high school students and young educators each year. The program tripled its capacity, hiring 300 Explainers, following the relocation to Pier 15 in 2013.&lt;ref name=KTVU&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300 million waterfront facility |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk |accessdate=18 June 2013 |newspaper=KTVU |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411173430/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk/ |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Explainers function essentially as docents. There are two types of Explainers: High School Explainers, who are teenagers, and Field Trip Explainers, who are college students and young educators. The program was conceived by Frank Oppenheimer in the early days of the museum. He wanted to provide a visitor experience that was a learning experience in a museum context&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=PhD |title=Explainers' development of science-learner identities through participation in a community of practice |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615204432/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |last=Richardson |first=Anne |year=2011 |publisher=Antioch University |accessdate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed for guesswork and the absence of "correct" answers. He felt young people would be more capable than adults at conveying the open-ended experience he was looking for. His plan with the Explainers was to "loosen up the whole feeling of learning." Oppenheimer also intended the program to allow students to experience learning outside the framework of their school systems. The Explainers come from a highly diverse array of socioeconomic backgrounds, and he hoped they would bring families and friends who would not otherwise be likely to visit a museum.&lt;ref name=Cole /&gt;{{rp|169–174}} Both the High School and Field Trip Explainers are paid positions.

The Explainer Program was inspired by the staff demonstrations Frank observed at the Palais de la Decouverte, although the facilitators at the Palais when Oppenheimer visited were either graduate students or practicing scientists. The success of the Exploratorium’s Explainer program led the Palais to eventually hire teenage explainers of their own.&lt;ref name=ASTC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duensing|first=Sally|title=Exporting the Exploratorium:  Creating a "Culture of Learning"|journal=ASTC Dimensions|date=November–December 1999|url=http://www.astc.org/pubs/dimensions/1999/nov-dec/exporting.htm|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Explainers often cite their experiences at the Exploratorium as defining elements of their success,&lt;ref name=Hamlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamlin|first=Jesse|title=Learning From Teaching at the Exploratorium / Student guides' lessons went beyond science|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Learning-From-Teaching-at-the-Exploratorium-2914198.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=August 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; including several notable tech CEOs.&lt;ref name=verisign&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan|title=Profile of VeriSign chairman, CEO|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Linda|title=Backyard science today, an innovative workforce tomorrow|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/backyard-science-today-an-innovative-workforce-tomorrow|work=The National|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
[[File:Walter Kitundu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Kitundu]] - Artist in Residence and MacArthur Fellow]]
Despite being generally thought of as a science museum, the Exploratorium has always incorporated both science and art. As early as 1966, Frank Oppenheimer presented a paper discussing the connections between art and science, and the role of a museum in appealing to both casual visitors and serious students of all ages.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

The formal artist in residence program was started in 1974,&lt;ref name=AIR&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist-in-Residence Program|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/artist-residence|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but artworks such as Bob Miller’s ''Sun Painting'' were commissioned shortly after the museum was opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=BobMiller&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Miller|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers/bob-miller|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the founding of the artist in residence program, over 250 artworks in various disciplines have been created.

Each year, the museum invites ten to twenty artists to participate in residencies ranging from two weeks to two years. Artists-in-residence work with staff and the visiting public to create original installations, exhibits, or performances. Artists are given a stipend, housing, travel expenses, and technical support, and they have at their disposal the Exploratorium's full array of metal and woodworking shops and materials. Two artists-in-residence who went on to become staff members have been awarded [[MacArthur Fellowship]] "genius" grants: [[Walter Kitundu]] and [[Ned Kahn]].

The new Embarcadero campus opened with more than 40 pieces by prominent artists, including Douglas Hollis, [[Golan Levin]], [[Lucky Dragons]], [[Amy Balkin]], and [[Fujiko Nakaya]]. The Center for Art and Inquiry, a new project at the new location, is an initiative to catalyze and orchestrate art across the museum.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite web|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|title=Painting the Sun and Sculpting Fog|url=http://www.artnews.com/2013/03/20/the-new-exploratorium/|work=ARTnews|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Artful Science from Sunny California |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13318084.300-review-artful-science-from-sunny-california-.html |author = Peter Turvey|volume = |work= [[New Scientist]] |date = 1992-02-15 |accessdate = 2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has an equally long history with musical, film and other performances. Participating artists and performers included [[Laurie Anderson]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Trimpin]], and [[The Mermen]].&lt;ref name=Speakingofmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking of Music|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/40th/podcasts.php|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the artists in residence, the museum’s Osher Fellows Program hosts 4-8 resident scholars, scientists, educators, and artists every year. Notable Osher Fellows have included [[Walter Murch]], [[James Crutchfield]], [[Christian de Duve]], [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Tim Hunkin]], [[Lewis Hyde]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Rosamond Wolff Purcell]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], and [[Juan Felipe Herrera]].&lt;ref name=Osher&gt;{{cite web|title=Osher Fellows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hands-on activities for younger visitors (under 14 - needs confirmation).  The pendulum art activity has a youngster picking four different color markers.  The youngster then pushes a large board suspended by 4 wires to develop a pattern.  At the youngster's say so, the attendant places a selected color into an arm and lowers it onto a white paper weighted to the board.  The marker patterns the movement of the board. After 4 markers are done, the project is complete, signed by the 'young artist', and taken home.

==Influence==

===Impact===
In 2007, the Exploratorium was highlighted in the book ''Forces For Good'' as one of the 12 most effective non-profits in the United States, and was the only West Coast institution and only museum to make the list.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"&gt;{{cite book|title=Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits|last1=Crutchfield|first1=Leslie R.|last2=McLeod Grant|first2=Heather|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|isbn=978-0787986124|page=22}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has inspired science museums worldwide, from the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego to the [[Garden of Archimedes]] in Florence, Italy. In 2003, ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' noted that about 400 science centers in 43 countries were established after the example of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name=Pancaldi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===Attendance===
In 2012, 570,000 people visited the Exploratorium; 55% were adults and 45% were children. Geographically, 52% were from the Bay Area, 24% from the rest of California, 14% from other states, and 10% outside the US. Some 36% received free or discounted admission, and 44,000 attended on free admission days. Prior to the relocation, 97,000 students and chaperons visited the museum each year; of these, 67,000 participated in the Field Trip program. It was estimated that 180 million people visited Exploratorium exhibits at science centers and other locations worldwide.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Annual attendance at the new Pier 15 location was anticipated to exceed one million.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Paul|title=New Exploratorium, with $300 million price tag, to open next week on San Francisco waterfront|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22982616/gleaming-new-300-million-exploratorium-open-next-wednesday?source=rss|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013, the ''New York Times'' reported that although attendance had soared, revenues still fell short of goals, forcing the Exploratorium to lay off around 1/5 of its staff.&lt;ref name=ChangCutback&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Exploratorium Forced to Cut Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/science/exploratorium-forced-to-cut-back.html|accessdate=2014-05-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum officials had decided not to make a big publicity push upon reopening, fearing the overcrowding experienced by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in 2008, but this was later viewed as "an opportunity lost".&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt;  A staffer (expecting himself to be laid off) observed that the Exploratorium seemed to be "moving from visionary, internally developed work to work-for-hire for other museums around the world”, as the management scrambled to earn more money from consulting for other organizations to replace unrealized admissions revenue.&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt; On April 17, 2014 the Exploratorium announced that attendance in the first year since re-opening was 1.1 million visitors, and that other key statistics had doubled or tripled.&lt;ref name=Fact2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Slafkosky|first=Jenny|title=Fact Sheet: One Year at Pier 15|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/fact-sheet-one-year-pier-15|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
[[File:Exploratorium Webcast.jpg|thumb|right|''Solar Eclipse'' webcast at the old Exploratorium.]]
Online since 1993, the Exploratorium was one of the first museums to build a site on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=Gnatek&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site serves 13 million visitors each year. It has received six [[Webby Award]]s since 1997, including four for Best Science Website and one for Best Education website, and has been an honoree an additional ten times.&lt;ref name=Webby&gt;{{cite web|title=The Webby Awards Gallery and Archive|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com|work=Webby Awards|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium's website is an extension of the experiences on the museum's floor and provides a large number of hands-on activities and exhibits for online-only visitors. The Exploratorium also broadcasts live video and/or audio directly from the museum floor (or from satellite feeds in the field, at such locations as Antarctica or the Belize rainforest) onto the Internet from its Webcast Studio. Webcasts provide access to special events, scientists, and other museum resources for audiences on the Web. Visitors to the website can hear or view interviews with scientists, "meet" interesting people, or tour unique locations from factories to particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=Semper&gt;

The Exploratorium has additionally released two free iPad apps, Sound Uncovered (2013) and Color Uncovered (2011), which assist in making its unique educational model as accessible as possible. Color Uncovered has been downloaded more than a million times.&lt;ref name=iPad&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Rebecca|title=Exploratorium’s new iPad app reveals ‘magic of existing phenomena’|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/12/exploratoriums-new-ipad-app-reveals-magic-of-existing-phenomena/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
The Exploratorium has a number of partnerships with other organizations. One notable current partnership is with the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  NOAA research vessels periodically berth at the end of Pier 15 and use the working biological labs featured in the museum to bring their research and data to the public. A number of exhibits at the Exploratorium, such as ''Remote Rains'', are based on NOAA data. NOAA scientists additionally provided training for the Explainer program to assist Explainers in explaining science to visitors based on the NOAA’s areas of research.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;

===Global Studios===
The Exploratorium Global Studios initiative is an entrepreneurial endeavor that shares resources, exhibits, and research with foreign governments, universities, partner museums, libraries, hospitals, and other public and private entities around the world. One area of significant current activity for the Global Studios initiative is the Middle East, where it hopes to assist countries that are making long-term investments in education and transitioning to more information-based economies.&lt;ref name=GlobalStudios&gt;{{cite press release |title=Exploratorium Launches Global Studios, an Entrepreneurial Endeavor to Share Knowledge and Services Around the World |language=English |date=15 November 2012 |publisher=The Exploratorium |location= |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratorium-launches-global-studios-entrepreneurial-endeavor-share |accessdate=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Tinkering Studio visited a science festival in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2012, where they trained a group of teachers to help thousands of festival participants to experience the hands-on learning style favored by the Exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hours and access===
The Exploratorium is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10am-5pm, with adults-only evening hours from 6pm-10pm on Thursdays (for visitors age 18+). The entire museum is wheelchair-accessible.

The Exploratorium is located on the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] at Green Street, between [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman’s Wharf]] and the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]]. The museum is accessible by multiple modes of public transit, including [[BART]], [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Muni]] streetcar, bus, taxi, and [[pedicab]]. It is located {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} from the [[Embarcadero Station|Embarcadero]] BART and MUNI stations, and has its own stop on the [[F Market &amp; Wharves|F streetcar line]]. The Exploratorium does not own or operate any parking lots, but is located near several publicly accessible lots and on-street parking, including a lot directly across the street, operated by the Port of San Francisco.

===Events===
[[Pi Day|Community π Day]] started at the Exploratorium by [[Larry Shaw (Pi)|Larry Shaw]] and is celebrated annually on 3/14 (March 14). [[Iron Science Teacher]] competition (like [[Iron Chef]]) showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient. Monthly events include "Full-Spectrum Science with Ron Hipschman". Every Thursday is "After Dark" for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar|title=Upcoming Events Calendar {{!}} Exploratorium|date=2014-03-17|work=Exploratorium|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related points of interest===
The Exploratorium maintains exhibits in public Bay Area spaces. The Outdoor Exploratorium consists of 14 different exhibits relating to the local environment, all placed outside in the [[Fort Mason]] area and accessible to the general public.&lt;ref name=FrogMom&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Exploratorium: Cool Science at Fort Mason|url=http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|date=12 March 2009|work=FrogMom|accessdate=20 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204459/http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''golden-crowned sifaka''' or '''Tattersall's sifaka''' (''Propithecus tattersalli'') is a medium-sized [[lemur]] characterized by mostly white fur, prominent furry ears, and a golden-orange [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]].  It is one of the smallest [[sifaka]]s ([[genus]] ''Propithecus''), weighing around {{convert|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measuring approximately {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} from head to tail.  Like all sifakas, it is a [[Vertical clinging and leaping|vertical clinger and leaper]], and its diet includes mostly seeds and leaves.  The golden-crowned sifaka is named after its discoverer, [[Ian Tattersall]], who first spotted the species in 1974.  However, it was not formally described until 1988, after a research team led by [[Elwyn L. Simons]] observed and captured some specimens for [[captive breeding]].  The golden-crowned sifaka most closely resembles the western forest sifakas of the ''P. verreauxi'' group, yet its [[karyotype]] suggests a closer relationship with the ''P. diadema'' group of eastern forest sifakas.  Despite the similarities with both groups, more recent studies of its karyotype support its classification as a distinct species.

Found in [[Gallery forest|gallery]], [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|deciduous]], and semi-evergreen forest, its restricted range includes 44&amp;nbsp;forest fragments, totaling an area of {{convert|44,125|ha|acre sqmi|lk=on}}, centered on the town of [[Daraina]] in northeast [[Madagascar]].  Its estimated population is 18,000&amp;nbsp;individuals.  It is primarily active during the day, although it also tends to be active at dawn and dusk during the rainy season. It sleeps in tall [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] trees and is preyed upon by the  [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]].  The golden-crowned sifaka lives in groups of around five to six individuals, containing a balanced number of adult males and females.  Scent is used to [[mark territories]], which are defended by growling, chasing, and ritualistic leaping displays.  Reproduction is [[Seasonal breeder|seasonal]], with [[gestation]] lasting six months and [[lactation]] lasting five months.  Infants are [[Weaning|weaned]] during the wet season to ensure the best chances of survival.

The small range and fragmented populations of this species weigh heavily on its survival.  [[Forest fragmentation]], [[habitat destruction]], [[poaching]], [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]], and other human factors threaten its existence.  The golden-crowned sifaka is listed by the [[IUCN Red List]] as ''Critically Endangered''. Its range was originally not covered by any [[List of national parks of Madagascar|national parks]] or [[protected area]]s in Madagascar, but a new protected area was established in 2005 to include a {{convert|20,000|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}} portion.  Attempts have been made to keep the golden-crowned sifaka in captivity at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].  The small colony was maintained from 1988 to 2008.  In Madagascar, lawlessness resulting from the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|2009 political coup]] led to increased poaching of this species, and many were sold to local restaurants as a delicacy.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The golden-crowned or Tattersall's sifaka (''Propithecus tattersalli''), known locally as ''ankomba malandy'' (or ''akomba malandy'', meaning "white lemur"),{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{r|1988Simons}}{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|pp=210–213}} was discovered in 1974 north of [[Vohemar]] in northeast Madagascar by [[Ian Tattersall]], who observed but did not capture the animal.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{r|1988Simons}} Unsure of its classification, Tattersall provisionally considered it a variant of the [[silky sifaka]] in his 1982 book, ''[[The Primates of Madagascar (book)|The Primates of Madagascar]]'',{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345–1348}} citing its mostly off-white to yellowish fur, but also noting its uncharacteristic orange crown patch and tufted ears.{{r|1988Simons}} Driven by a report in 1986 that the forest where Tattersall had observed this unique sifaka was contracted to be [[Clearcutting|clear-cut]] for [[charcoal]] production, a research team from the [[Duke Lemur Center]], led by [[Elwyn L. Simons]], obtained permits to capture specimens for a [[captive breeding]] program.{{r|1988Simons}}  Simons and his team were the first to capture and observe the golden-crowned sifaka,{{r|2004Rumpler}} formally describing it as a new species in 1988 and naming it in honor of Tattersall.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{r|1988Simons}} The specimens were found {{convert|6|to|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Daraina]], a village in the northeast corner of Madagascar.{{r|1988Simons}}{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}

There have been conflicting studies regarding the taxonomic status of the golden-crowned sifaka.{{r|2004Mayor}} When described by Simons in 1988, size, [[animal communication|vocalizations]], and [[karyology|karyotypes]] (the number and appearance of [[chromosome]]s) were compared with the other sifakas. In terms of size, general morphology, and vocalizations, the golden-crowned sifaka is more comparable to the western forest sifakas (known as the ''P. verreauxi'' group) in that it is smaller in length and weight. Its karyotype, however, is more similar to that of the eastern forest sifakas (known as the ''P. diadema'' group).{{r|1988Simons|2001Pastorini}} The golden-crowned sifaka has 42&amp;nbsp;chromosomes (2n=42), 16 of which are [[Autosome|autosomal pairs]] (not [[sex chromosomes]]) that are [[Centromere|meta- or submetacentric]] (where chromosome arms are equal or unequal in length, respectively).  The remaining autosomal pairs are smaller and [[Centromere|acrocentric]] (with the shorter chromosome arm difficult to observe). Its [[X chromosome]] is metacentric, which is comparable to that of the ''P. diadema'' group, not the ''P. verreauxi'' group.{{r|2004Rumpler|2004Mayor}} Given the conflicting information, its geographic isolation, as well as the unique long fur tufts on the ears—a trait not shared by any other sifaka—the golden-crowned sifaka was recognized as a distinct species.{{r|1988Simons|2004Rumpler|2001Pastorini}}

In 1997, comparisons of repeated DNA sequences within the family [[Indriidae]] supported Simon's classification, placing the golden-crowned sifaka as a sister group to the other sifakas.{{r|2004Mayor|1997Razafindraibe}} In 2001, a study involving [[mitochondrial DNA]] suggested a very recent divergence between it and the [[Coquerel's sifaka]], then considered a subspecies of the ''P. verreauxi'' group. If this were true, the golden-crowned sifaka would not merit species status and would form a subclade with the Coquerel's sifaka within the ''P. verreauxi'' group.{{r|2004Mayor|2001Pastorini}}{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242–1247}} In 2004, a comparative study of the karyotypes of the three traditional species of sifakas provided insight into the chromosomal arrangements of all three groups. This study found that the golden-crowned sifaka differs from ''P. verreauxi'' group and ''P. diadema'' group by 9 and 17 chromosomal rearrangements respectively, and conversely argued that the golden-crowned sifaka is indeed a separate species and is more closely related to the ''P. verreauxi'' group.{{r|2004Rumpler}} More recently, in 2007 a craniodental ([[skull]] and [[Tooth (animal)|tooth]]) study provided evidence for 9 or 10 distinct sifaka species, including the golden-crowned sifaka.  It also placed the golden-crowned sifaka within the ''P. verreauxi'' group.{{r|2007Groves}}

==Anatomy and physiology==
The golden-crowned sifaka is one of the smallest sifaka species with a weight of {{convert|3.4|to|3.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, a head-body length of {{convert|45|to|47|cm|in|abbr=on}}, a tail length of {{convert|42|to|47|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and total length of {{convert|87|to|94|cm|in|abbr=on}}.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}{{r|2002Vargas}} It is comparable in size to the sifakas inhabiting the southern and western dry forests, such as Coquerel's sifaka, the [[crowned sifaka]], [[Von der Decken's sifaka]], and Verreaux's sifaka. It has a coat of moderately long, creamy-white fur with a golden tint, dark black or chocolate-brown fur on its neck and throat, pale orange [[fur]] on the tops of its legs and [[forelimb]]s, a white tail and [[hindlimb]]s, and a characteristic bright orange-gold [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]].{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=373–375}} It is the only sifaka with prominent tufts of white fur protruding from its ears,{{r|2001Pastorini}} making its head appear somewhat triangular and distinctive in appearance.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}} Its eyes are orange, and its face is black and mostly hairless,{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=373–375}} with dark gray-black fur with white hairs stretching from beneath the eyes to the cheeks.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}  Its [[snout]] is blunt and rounded, and its broad nose helps to distinguish it from other sifakas. Occasionally the bridge of the nose will have a patch of white fur. Similar to other sifakas, this [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] animal has long, strong legs that enable it to [[Vertical clinging and leaping|cling and leap]] between tree trunks and branches.{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=373–375}}

==Geographic range and habitat==
[[File:Eulemur coronatus2.jpg|thumb|left|The geographic range of the [[crowned lemur]] overlaps the range of the golden-crowned sifaka.]]
The golden-crowned sifaka lives in dry [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|deciduous]], [[gallery forest|gallery]], and semi-evergreen forests and is found at altitudes up to {{convert|500|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, though it seems to prefer lower elevations.{{r|2002Vargas}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}} Surveys have shown it to be limited to highly fragmented forests surrounding the town of Daraina in an area encircled by the Loky and Manambato rivers in northeastern Madagascar.{{r|2002Vargas}}  The golden-crowned sifaka has one of the smallest geographic ranges of all [[Indriidae|indriid]] lemur species.{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=373–375}}{{Sfn|Simons|1997|pp=142–166}} Out of 75&amp;nbsp;forest fragments studied by researchers, its presence could be definitively reported in only 44, totaling {{convert|44,125|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}}. This study, published in 2002, also estimated the total species population and observed population densities. [[Home range]] size varied between {{convert|0.18|and|0.29|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} per group. With an average [[Group size measures|group size]] of five individuals, the population density ranged between 17 and 28&amp;nbsp;individuals per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{r|2002Vargas}} Another home range size estimate of {{convert|0.09|to|0.12|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} has also been suggested with a population density range of 10 and 23&amp;nbsp;individuals per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}} The forested area available to the species within its desired elevation range was estimated at {{convert|360|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, yielding an estimated population of 6,120–10,080 and a breeding population between 2,520 and 3,960&amp;nbsp;individuals.{{r|2002Vargas}} However, a study published in 2010 using [[Line-intercept sampling|line transect]] data from 2006 and 2008 in five major forest fragments yielded an estimated population of 18,000 individuals.{{r|2010Quéméré}}

The species is [[sympatric]] (coexists) with two other medium-sized lemurs: the [[Sanford's brown lemur]] (''Eulemur sanfordii'') and the [[crowned lemur]] (''Eulemur coronatus'').{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=270–271}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}}
{{Clear}}

==Behavior==

The golden-crowned sifaka is primarily active during the day ([[Diurnality|diurnal]]), but researchers have witnessed activity in the early morning and evening ([[crepuscular]]) during the rainy season (November through April).{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}} In captivity, it has been observed feeding at night, unlike captive Verreaux's sifakas.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|pp=210–213}} It travels between {{convert|461.7|and|1077|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day, an intermediate range compared to other sifakas of the eastern forests.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}  The golden-crowned sifaka can be observed feeding and resting higher in the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] during the dry season (May through October).{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}}{{r|2002Vargas}} It sleeps in the taller trees (the [[emergent layer]]) of the forest at night.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}

When stressed, the golden-crowned sifaka emits grunting vocalizations as well as repeated "''churrs''" that escalate into a high-[[amplitude]] "''whinney''."{{r|1988Simons}} Its ground predator [[Alarm signal|alarm call]], which sounds like "''shē-fäk''",{{r|1988Simons}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}} closely resembles that of Verreaux's sifaka.{{r|1988Simons|2001Pastorini}}  It also emits [[Animal mobbing behavior|mobbing]] alarm calls in response to [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}

===Diet===

The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka consists of a wide variety of plants—as many as 80&amp;nbsp;species—whose availability varies based on the season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}} It is a [[Seed predation|seed predator]], making [[seed]]s a year-round staple in its diet when available.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}}{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe [[fruit]]s, [[flower]]s, and [[leaves]]. One study showed a diet composition of 37%&amp;nbsp;unripe fruit and seeds, 22%&amp;nbsp;immature leaves, 17%&amp;nbsp;mature leaves, 13%&amp;nbsp;flowers, and 9%&amp;nbsp;fruit pulp.{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} Individuals have also been observed consuming tree [[Bark (botany)|bark]] during the dry season.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}} In general, approximately 60% of its diet consists of unripe fruits and seed, mainly from [[Fabaceae|leguminous]] pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}} At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (''[[Poupartia|Poupartia caffra]]'') and on [[mango]] trees.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|pp=210–213}} Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}}

A study in 1993 showed variability and flexibility in feeding preferences between three research sites around Daraina.  Plant species preferences (measured in feeding time) changed between wetter, intermediate, and drier forests:{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}}

===Social organization===

The social structure of the golden-crowned sifaka is very similar to that of Verreaux's sifaka, both averaging between five and six individuals per group, with a range between three and ten.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}{{r|2002Vargas}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}} Unlike the Verreaux's sifaka, group [[sex ratio]]s are more evenly balanced,{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345–1348}} consisting of two or more members of both sexes.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}} Females are dominant within the group,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=190–192}} and only one female breeds successfully each season. Males will roam between groups during the mating season.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}

Because of their smaller home ranges relative to other sifakas, group encounters are slightly more common, occurring a few times a month.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}} It has been noted that the temperament of the golden-crowned sifaka is more volatile than that of other sifaka species and, in the case of a dispute, this animal frequently emits a grunt-like vocalization that seems to signal annoyance.{{r|1988Simons}} Aggressive interactions between groups are generally non-physical but include loud growling, territorial marking, chasing, and ritualistic leaping displays.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=86–89}} Same-sexed individuals act most aggressively towards each other during such encounters.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}} [[Territory (animal)|Scent marking]] is the most common form of territorial defense, with scent marks acting as "signposts" to demarcate territorial boundaries.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}{{r|2002Vargas}} Females use glands in the [[Sex organ|genital]] regions ("anogenital") while males use both anogenital and chest glands.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}

===Reproduction===

The golden-crowned sifaka is a [[seasonal breeder]], often [[mating]] during the last week of January.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} Its [[gestation]] period is a little less than six months, and its [[lactation]] period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality.{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January),{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} and continues for approximately 170 days.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}} [[Childbirth|Parturition]] occurs in the middle of the dry season (late June or July).{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} [[Weaning]] occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}} It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.{{Sfn|Meyers|Wright|1993|pp=179–192}}

Females reproduce once every two years. Infants are born with little hair and initially cling to their mother's belly. As they mature, they begin to ride on her back. Following weaning, riding on the back is only tolerated for short durations, particularly when the group is alerted to the presence of a predator. By one year of age, the juveniles are 70% of their full adult body weight.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}  [[Infant mortality]] is high in this species.{{r|1993aMeyers}}  Upon reaching [[sexual maturity]], males leave their natal group and transfer to neighboring social groups.{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345–1348}} Observations by researchers and reports from local people indicate that this species will jump to the ground and cross more than {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of grassland to reach nearby forest patches.  This suggests that forest fragmentation may not completely isolate separated populations.{{r|2002Vargas}}

==Predators and parasites==

[[File:Cryptoprocta ferox.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] is a predator of the golden-crowned sifaka.]]
The only predator known to target this species is the [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], although the golden-crowned sifaka reacts to the presence of [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] with alarm calls.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176–204}}  A [[hematology]] and [[blood serum|serum chemistry]] study published in 1995 revealed that 59% of the wild golden-crowned sifakas sampled were infected with a [[microfilaria]]l parasite, a potentially unknown species of [[nematode]] in the genus ''[[Mansonella perstans|Mansonella]]''.{{r|1993aMeyers|1995Garell|2009Irwin}}  Healthy, infected individuals did not appear to be adversely affected by the infestation, but the overall effect on the dwindling population is unknown.{{r|1993aMeyers}}  Also, no [[malaria]]l or [[intestinal parasite]]s were found, although 48% of the golden-crowned sifakas examined had external [[ear mite]]s.{{r|1995Garell}}

==Human interactions==
While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few biological threats, such as predation, it faces many significant human-caused ([[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands.{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=52–84}} By 1985 it was estimated that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of [[deforestation]] there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020.{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305–326}} [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|Illegal logging]] practices, [[slash-and-burn agriculture]] (known as ''tavy''), uncontrolled [[Wildfire|grass fires]], [[gold mining]], [[poaching]], and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.{{r|2002Vargas}}

Malagasy farmers continue to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration. The fires sometimes burn out of control and destroy forest edges along with the natural [[flora]], increasing the damage even further than intended.{{r|2002Vargas}} Due to the nature of Madagascar's geology and soil, ''tavy'' also depletes the fertility of the soil, accelerating the [[crop rotation]] rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests.{{LoM2 Sfn|pages=52–84}}

Although [[coal]] is the preferred cooking fuel of the Malagasy people, the most affordable and prominent source of energy is timber, known as ''kitay''. Wood is also used as a primary building material, only adding further incentive to remove trees from the forest. With the depletion of dead wood from the forest patches, the people have begun to remove young, healthy trees. This is seen most commonly in areas closest to villages.  Although the shapes and sizes of forest fragments around the Daraina region have been mostly stable for 50&amp;nbsp;years prior to a study in 2002, the six years preceding the study had seen 5% of the small- to medium-sized forest fragments disappear due to increased human encroachment.{{r|2002Vargas}}

A newly emergent threat facing the golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners moving into the region's forests.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|pp=210–213}}  Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing the trees in the area.{{r|2002Vargas}} The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|pp=210–213}}{{r|1993aMeyers}} the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of [[bushmeat]].{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}} In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher who has studied the golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans.{{r|1993aMeyers}}  Indeed, bushmeat hunting by people from nearby [[Ambilobe]] has already [[Local extinction|extirpated]] at least one isolated population.{{Sfn|Simons|1997|pp=142–166}}

===Conservation===
Because studies have shown that the golden-crowned sifaka are most likely to be found in large forest fragments (greater than {{convert|1000|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}}), the species is thought to be sensitive to [[forest fragmentation]] and degradation.  However, since it has been found around gold mining camps and degraded forests, it is not restricted to undisturbed forests and appears to tolerate human activity.{{r|2002Vargas}}  Regardless, with its low population, highly restricted range, and badly fragmented habitat, the prospect for survival for the golden-crowned sifaka is considered bleak.{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345–1348}}  For these reasons, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) added it to its list of the 25 most endangered primates in 2000.{{r|2000-2002Top25}}  Previously, in 1992, the IUCN's [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|Species Survival Commission]] (IUCN/SSC) Primate Specialist Group also assigned the species its highest priority rating.{{r|2002Vargas}}  As of its 2014 assessment, the golden-crowned sifaka is once again "[[Critically endangered|Critically Endangered]]" on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This was an upgrade from 2008 when it was listed as ''[[Endangered species|Endangered]]''. In previous assessments it was listed as ''Critically Endangered'' (1996 and 2000) and ''Endangered'' (1990 and 1994).{{r|IUCN}}

The area inhabited by the golden-crowned sifaka is also an important agricultural and economical resource for the human population.{{r|1989Meyers}}  Suggested conservation action aimed at protecting this species and its habitat has focused on offering varying degrees of protection to forest fragments in the region, allowing human activity and resource extraction in areas that have less conservation potential while strictly protecting areas critical to the species' survival. In 2002, none of the forested areas that the golden-crowned sifaka inhabits were part of a formally protected [[national park]] or [[nature reserve|reserve]].{{r|2002Vargas}} A conservation study from 1989 called for the creation of a national park that includes the forest of [[Binara]] as well as the dry forests to the north of Daraina.{{r|1989Meyers}} A more recent study from 2002 proposed a network of protected forest areas including areas outside of the village of Daraina, forests north of the Monambato River, and the northern forests that constitute the species' northern reservoir.{{r|2002Vargas}}  In 2005, Fanamby, a Malagasy [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), teamed up with [[Conservation International]] to create a {{convert|20,000|ha|acre sqmi|adj=on}} protected area that both Association Fanamby and the Ministry of Water and Forests manage.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=373–375}}  As of 2008, only ten forest patches that could support viable populations remained, according to the IUCN.{{r|IUCN}}

[[Image:Illegal export of rosewood 001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A Malagasy man uses a chainsaw in the middle of several large piles of 1- to 2-meter rosewood logs|[[Illegal logging in Madagascar|Illegal logging]] poses another threat to the golden-crowned sifaka.]]
Only one [[Captivity (animal)|captive]] population of golden-crowned sifakas has been represented in a zoological collection.{{r|IUCN}}  Building on a successful record of maintaining a viable captive Verreaux's sifaka population, the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]], requested and obtained permission from the [[Politics of Madagascar|government of Madagascar]] to capture and export this (then) unknown species for [[captive breeding]].  Plans were also made to establish a captive breeding program at the Ivoloina Forestry Station, now known as [[Parc Ivoloina]].  In November 1987, during the same expedition that resulted in the formal description of the species, two males and two females were caught and measured.  Five others were also caught, but were released because they were juvenile males.{{r|1988Simons}} In July 1988, a golden-crowned sifaka was born in captivity at the DLC.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|pp=210–213}}  However, the captive population was small and not viable for long-term breeding,{{Sfn|Simons|1997|pp=142–166}}{{r|1993Haring}} and captive sifakas have proven difficult to maintain due to their specialized dietary needs.{{r|1993Haring}}  The last captive individual died in 2008.  Despite the loss of its small colony after 20 years, DLC believes that establishment of a captive population for conservation-oriented captive breeding purposes could provide an important second level of protection, particularly if habitat protection measures are unsuccessful.{{r|DLC}}

===Effects of the 2009 political crisis===
{{See also|2009 Malagasy political crisis|Illegal logging in Madagascar}}

As a result of the political crisis that began in 2009 and the resulting breakdown of law and order in Madagascar, poachers have hunted lemurs in the Daraina area and sold them to local restaurants as a delicacy.  Pictures of dead lemurs that had been smoked for transport were taken by Fanamby and released by Conservation International in August 2009.  The lemurs in the photographs included the endangered golden-crowned sifaka, as well as crowned lemurs.{{r|BBC_20Aug09}}  Around the time the photographs were released, 15 people were arrested for selling smoked lemurs, which were bought from hunters for 1,000 [[Malagasy ariary|ariary]], or around US$0.53, and then sold in restaurants for 8,000 ariary (US$4.20).{{r|BBC_20Aug09|SciAm_21Aug09}}  [[Russell Mittermeier]], president of Conservation International, said that the arrests would not end the poaching since the poachers would "just get slaps on the wrist".{{r|SciAm_21Aug09}}

{{Infobox telescope}}
'''Group 70''' is a [[non-profit]] [[education]]al organization of people from many countries all around the world and many walks of life seeking to make [[astronomy]] available to the peoples of the world.
They began in 1988 with the goal of building a large [[amateur telescope making|amateur telescope]], a {{convert|70|inch}}  [[Optical telescope|astronomical instrument]]. Upon completion it would be the largest telescope in the world built by and for amateur astronomers. Beyond building a large aperture telescope, they offer related instrumentation and services to those in amateur, professional and educational fields of astronomy.

As of mid-2008, the project has moved from San Jose, CA to Fremont CA and work has moved from the mirror to the steel and other optics.

Use of a comparable telescope in California is very expensive: a rental must be scheduled well in advance and the weather may not cooperate.

'''''Hell and High Water: Global Warming – the Solution and the Politics – and What We Should Do''''' is a book by author, scientist, and former U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] official [[Joseph J. Romm]], published December 26, 2006. The author is "one of the world's leading experts on [[clean energy]], advanced vehicles, [[energy security]], and [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearfoundation.org/rommbio.html Romm bio] at NuclearFoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The book warned of dire consequences to the U.S. and the world if wide-scale environmental changes are not enacted by the U.S. government. It reviewed the evidence that the initial [[global warming]] changes would lead to feedbacks and accelerated warming. According to Romm, the oceans, soils, Arctic [[permafrost]], and [[rainforest]]s could become sources of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The book claimed that, without serious government action, [[sea level rise|sea levels would rise]] high enough to submerge numerous coastal communities and inland areas on both U.S. coasts and around the world by the year 2100.

In 2008, [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] wrote that "On [Romm's] blog and in his most recent book, ''Hell and High Water'', you can find some of the most cogent, memorable, and deployable arguments for immediate and overwhelming action to confront global warming."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1730759_1731034_1731042,00.html Time.com feature on "Top 15 Green Websites"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Romm was interviewed on [[Fox News]] on January 31, 2007 about the book and the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] climate report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateprogress.org/2007/02/01/climate-progress-on-fox-news/ accessible here Fox News interview, January 31, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the book==
Part I, comprising the first four chapters of the book, reviews the science of [[climate change]], setting forth the evidence that humans are causing an unprecedented increase in carbon emissions that is, in turn causing global warming. The book describes the consequences of unchecked climate change, such as destruction of coastal cities due to rising sea levels and mega-hurricanes; increasing droughts and deadly water shortages; infestation of insects into new ranges; and increased famines, heat waves, forest fires and [[desertification]]. The book sets forth the research on "feedback loops" that would contribute to accelerating climate change, including: 
*melting ice at the poles that means less reflection of sunlight by white ice and more absorption of the sun’s heat by ocean water and dark land;
*an increasing amount of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere (water vapor is a greenhouse gas); 
*melting permafrost in the Arctic, where more carbon is locked in Arctic permafrost than in all of the Earth’s atmosphere and where methane, which is about 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) as a greenhouse gas, is being released by permafrost in the Arctic faster than scientists previously thought it would;
*the death of algae and phytoplankton from heat and acidity in the oceans, reducing the {{CO2}} being absorbed by them; and
*the reduced ability of tropical forests to absorb {{CO2}} as they are destroyed.

Romm proposes an eight-point program, based on existing technologies, to counter and then reverse the trend toward catastrophic global warming: performance-based efficiency programs; [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] gains from industry and power generation through [[cogeneration]] of heat and power; building [[wind farms]]; capturing carbon dioxide from proposed coal plants; building nuclear plants; greatly improving the fuel economy of our vehicles using [[PHEV]]s; increasing production of high-yield [[energy crop]]s; and stopping [[tropical deforestation]] while planting more trees.(pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23)

Part I then offers extrapolations, based on various models and analyses, of what will happen to the U.S. and the world by 2025, 2050 and 2100 if decisive action is not taken quickly. Treehugger.com called this "an explanation that is both comprehensive and comprehensible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/06/book_review_hel.php Summary of the book from review at Treehugger.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book claimed that without serious government action within the following ten years, [[sea level rise|sea levels will eventually rise]] high enough to submerge numerous coastal communities and inland areas on both U.S. coasts and around the world causing over 100 million "environmental refugees" to flee the coasts by the year 2100.

Part II, comprising the next six chapters, discusses the politics and media issues that the author says are delaying such decisive action (and how this has a negative influence on the behavior of other countries, particularly China) and also discusses the currently available technological solutions to global warming. The book asserts that there has been a disingenuous, concerted and effective campaign to convince Americans that the science is not proven, or that global warming is the result of natural cycles, and that there needs to be more research. The book claims that, to delay action, industry and government spokesmen suggest falsely that "technology breakthroughs" will eventually save us with [[hydrogen cars]] and other fixes. It asserts that the reason for this [[denial and delay]] is that "ideology trumps rationality.... Most conservatives cannot abide the solution to global warming – strong government regulations and a government-led effort to accelerate clean-energy technologies into the market."(p.&amp;nbsp;107)  Romm says that the media have acted as enablers of this program of denial in the misguided belief that the pursuit of "balance" is superior to the pursuit of truth - even in science journalism. The book describes how this has led to skewed public opinion and to congress cutting funds for programmes aimed at accelerating the deployment into the American market of cost-effective technologies already available.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Bryan. [http://hot-topic.co.nz/hell-and-high-water/ "Hell and High Water"], ''Hot Topic'', April 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The book spends many pages refuting the "hydrogen myth" (see also Romm's previous book, ''[[The Hype about Hydrogen]]'') and "the geo-engineering fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/06/book_review_hel.php this summary of the book from review at Treehugger.com.]  See also [https://www.wsj.com/article/SB117738522902280119-search.html?KEYWORDS=Hydrogen+Greenest&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month this article from ''The Wall Street Journal'' dated April 24, 2007, at p. B7] (requires subscription).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Chapter 7, the book describes technology strategies that it claims would permit the U.S., over the next two decades, to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by two-thirds without increasing the energy costs of either consumers or businesses. These include launching "a massive performance-based efficiency program for homes, commercial buildings and new construction... [and] a massive effort to boost the efficiency of heavy industry and expand the use of cogeneration... [c]apture the {{CO2}} from 800 new large coal plants and store it underground, [b]uild 1 million large wind turbines... [and] [b]uild 700 new large nuclear power plants".&lt;ref&gt;Romm, pp. 154-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's conclusion calls on voters to demand immediate action. The conclusion is followed by over 50 pages of extensive endnotes and an index.

[[Tyler Hamilton (reporter)|Tyler Hamilton]], in his review of the book for [[The Toronto Star]], summarizes the book's contents as follows: "Whereas the first third of Romm's book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming, the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the U.S. public is being misled by a federal government (backed by conservative political forces) that is intent on inaction, and that's also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions."&lt;ref name=Star&gt;Hamilton, Tyler. [https://www.thestar.com/article/166819 "Fresh alarm over global warming",] ''Toronto Star'', January 1, 2007, accessed 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In his book "Hell and High Water," Romm discusses the urgency to act and the sad fact that America is refusing to do so.... Romm gives a name to those such as [[ExxonMobil]] who deny that global warming is occurring and are working to persuade others of this money-making myth: they are the Denyers and Delayers. They are better rhetoriticians than scientists are.... Global warming is happening now, and Romm... gives us 10 years to change the way we live before it’s too late to use existing technology to save the world.  "...humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical, and industrial know-how to solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century. The tragedy, then, as historians of the future will most certainly recount, is that we ruined their world not because we lacked the knowledge or the technology to save it but simply because we chose not to make the effort”(Romm, 25).&lt;ref&gt;[http://environmentalblogging.org/?p=780 Review from Environmentalblogging.org] February 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Challenges and solutions identified by the book==
The book claims that U.S. politicians who deny the science and have failed to take genuine action on conservation and alternative energy initiatives are following a disastrous course by delaying serious changes that he says are imminently needed. Romm also criticizes the media for what he says is sloppy reporting and an unwillingness to probe behind political rhetoric, which he says are lulling Americans into accepting continuing delays on implementing emission-cutting technologies. The book argues that there is a window of opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming and it calls upon Americans to demand government action to require the use of emission-cutting technologies.

Romm writes that strategies to combat climate change with current technologies can significantly slow global warming and buy more time for the world to develop new technologies and take even stronger action. The book lays out a number of proposed solutions to avoiding a climate catastrophe, including:
*capturing [[carbon dioxide]] from coal [[power plant]]s and storing it underground;
*building 1 million large [[wind turbines]] and 700 [[nuclear power plant]]s;
*launching massive [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] programs for homes, office buildings, and heavy industry;
*increasing the [[fuel efficiency]] of cars and light trucks to 60 miles per gallon while also equipping them with advanced [[plug-in hybrid]] technology; and
*ceasing tropical [[deforestation]] and reversing the trend by planting trees.

The book states, "The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report]] this year (2007) will present a much stronger consensus and a much clearer and darker picture of our likely future than the Third Assessment&amp;mdash;but it will almost certainly still underestimate the likely impacts. The Fifth Assessment, due around 2013, should include many of the omitted feedbacks, like that of the [carbon emissions caused by] defrosting tundra, and validate the scenarios described on these pages...." (p.&amp;nbsp;94)

==Critical response==
The [[Toronto Star]]'s January 1, 2007 review of the book says that Romm "convincingly shoots down the arguments of those who claim global warming is a hoax or some kind of natural cycle not associated with human activities."  The review laments that the "'Denyers and Delayers' are winning the political battle in the United States, the world's highest emitter of [[greenhouse gas]]es and a saboteur of Kyoto talks" and that the media's policy of "giving 'equal time' to Denyers gives the public the wrong impression about our understanding and level of certainty around global warming science."  The review concludes, "The book itself is a short and easy read, not as intimidating as some other works, and it hits all the main points on the science and politics behind global warming, and the policy and technological solutions to minimize damage to the planet, economy and humanity."&lt;ref name=Star/&gt;

A review in the [[Detroit Free Press]]'s Freep.com stated, "Joseph Romm's ''Hell and High Water'' is a great book for people who want to understand the complexities of global warming and, perhaps more important, what we could be doing about it other than wringing our hands or sticking our collective head in the sand."&lt;ref&gt;"Hell and High Water", ''Detroit Free Press'', January 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Technology Review]]'' concluded, "His book provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change, a sensible agenda for technology and policy, and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18301/ ''Technology Review''], March 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''BooksPath Reviews'' commented, ''Hell and High Water'' is nothing less than a wake-up call to the country. It is a searing critique of American environmental and energy policy and a passionate call to action by a writer with a unique command of the science and politics of climate change.  ''Hell and High Water'' goes beyond ideological rhetoric to offer pragmatic solutions to avert the threat of global warming — solutions that must be taken seriously by every American.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookspath.wordpress.com/2007/02/28/hell-and-high-water/ BooksPath Reviews, February 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 2007, Bill Moore at EV World.com wrote: "...it seemed every paragraph, every page revealed some new outrage that just got my dander up.

[[Grist (magazine)|''Grist'']]'s blog "Gristmill" noted, "Joseph Romm's ''Hell and High Water'' may be the most depressing book on global warming I've ever read. ... My hope is that a lifetime spent in insider elite politics causes him to underestimate what a bottom-up grassroots movement can accomplish. ... A coalition that supported real action on global warming, as part of movement that supported real solutions on these other issues too, would have a much better chance of winning than a single-issue group. It would have a broader base and could offer more immediate relief from problems; because global warming wouldn't be its only or even main issue, it would produce quicker results in the lives of ordinary people. ...   Technically, Romm is sound."  The writer amended his statement as follows: "I referred to the book as 'depressing', but the tone is frank, not truly gloomy.... Romm... is known as a level-headed, optimistic analyst. His book is no exception &amp;ndash; he documents the problem and the (quite mainstream) solutions he endorses thoroughly and meticulously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gristmill.grist.org/print/2007/1/13/154846/114?show_comments=no Gristmill review]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Foreign Policy in Focus]]'' article "An Inconvenient Truth II" cites the book with approval and references its analysis twice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4014#_edn7 "An Inconvenient Truth II"], ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', February 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The blog "Political Cortex" wrote: "''Hell and High Water'' might be the Global Warming work of most interest to the politically engaged (Democratic and/or Republican). Romm lays a strong case as to how Global Warming could be the death sentence for the Republican Party as reality becomes ever blatantly at odds with Republican Party rhetoric.... Romm also highlights how, in an ever more difficult world in the years to come, either the United States figures out how to lead in dealing with mitigating/muting Global Warming and its impacts or risks becoming a pariah nation, with dire implications for the Republic and its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, A.

But the most salient aspects of this provocative expose involve Romm's documentation of what he calls the Bush administration's irresponsible and backward energy policies, the censorship of legitimate and urgent information pertaining to global warming, and the threats rising temperatures pose to "the health and well-being of this nation and the world.

There are a wide range of potential applications for research at high altitude, including medical, [[physiological]], and cosmic physics research.

==High-altitude medical research==
The most obvious and direct application of high-altitude research is to understand altitude illnesses such as [[acute mountain sickness]], and the rare but rapidly fatal conditions, [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]) and [[high-altitude cerebral edema]] ([[HACE]]).&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude-sickness.org/ |title=altitude-sickness.org |accessdate=2007-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818061521/http://www.altitude-sickness.org/ |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at high altitude is also an important way to learn about sea level conditions that are caused or complicated by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] such as chronic lung disease and [[sepsis]]. Patients with these conditions are very complex and usually suffer from several other diseases at the same time, so it is virtually impossible to work out which of their problems is caused by lack of oxygen. Altitude research gets round this by studying the effects of oxygen deprivation on otherwise healthy people.

Travelling to high altitude is often used as a way of studying the way the body responds to a shortage of oxygen. It is difficult and prohibitively expensive to conduct some of this research at sea level

Although the shortage of air contributes to the effects on the human body, research has found that most altitude sicknesses can be linked to the lack of atmospheric pressure. At low elevation, the pressure is higher because the molecules of air are compressed from the weight of the air above them. However, at higher elevations, the pressure is lower and the molecules are more dispersed. The percentage of oxygen in the air at sea level is the same at high altitudes. But because the air molecules are more spread out at higher altitudes, each breath takes in less oxygen to the body. With this in mind, the lungs take in as much air as possible, but because the atmospheric pressure is lower the molecules are more dispersed, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen per breath.

At 26,000 feet the body reaches a maximum and can no longer adjust to the altitude, often referred to as the "Death Zone".

[[File:NOVA laser.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Inertial confinement fusion using [[lasers]] rapidly progressed in the late 1970s and early 1980s from being able to deliver only a few [[joule]]s of laser energy (per pulse) to being able to deliver tens of kilojoules to a target. At this point, incredibly large scientific devices were needed for experimentation. Here, a view of the 10 beam [[LLNL]] [[Nova (laser)|Nova laser]], shown shortly after the laser's completion in 1984. Around the time of the construction of its predecessor, the [[Shiva laser]], laser fusion had entered the realm of "[[big science]]".]]

'''Inertial confinement fusion''' ('''ICF''') is a type of [[fusion energy]] research that attempts to initiate [[nuclear fusion]] reactions by heating and compressing a fuel target, typically in the form of a pellet that most often contains a mixture of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].

To compress and heat the fuel, energy is delivered to the outer layer of the target using high-energy beams of [[laser|laser light]], [[electron]]s or [[ion]]s, although for a variety of reasons, almost all ICF devices {{as of|2015|lc=y}} have used lasers. The heated outer layer explodes outward, producing a reaction force against the remainder of the target, accelerating it inwards, compressing the target. This process is designed to create [[shock wave]]s that travel inward through the target. A sufficiently powerful set of shock waves can compress and heat the fuel at the center so much that fusion reactions occur.

The energy released by these reactions will then heat the surrounding fuel, and if the heating is strong enough this could also begin to undergo fusion. The aim of ICF is to produce a condition known as ''[[Fusion ignition|ignition]]'', where this heating process causes a [[chain reaction]] that burns a significant portion of the fuel. Typical fuel pellets are about the size of a pinhead and contain around 10 [[milligrams]] of fuel: in practice, only a small proportion of this fuel will undergo fusion, but if all this fuel were consumed it would release the energy equivalent to [[Barrel of oil equivalent|burning a barrel of oil]] '''(BOE)'''.
&lt;!--This is calculated using a value of 6.3×10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; J/kg, the maximum efficiency of the hydrogen burning fusion reaction and the standard accepted value of burning a barrel of oil of ~6 gigajoules--&gt;{{fact|date=September 2018}}

ICF is one of two major branches of [[fusion energy]] research, the other being [[magnetic confinement fusion]]. When it was first proposed in the early 1970s, ICF appeared to be a practical approach to [[fusion power]] production and the field flourished. Experiments during the 1970s and '80s demonstrated that the efficiency of these devices was much lower than expected, and reaching ignition would not be easy. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, many experiments were conducted in order to understand the complex interaction of high-intensity laser light and plasma. These led to the design of newer machines, much larger, that would finally reach ignition energies.

The largest operational ICF experiment is the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) in the US, designed using all of the decades-long experience of earlier experiments. Like those earlier experiments, however, NIF has failed to reach ignition and is, as of 2015, generating about {{frac|3}} of the required energy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackburn|first1=T.

This is a major step forward.&lt;ref name="milestone"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24429621|title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab|date=7 October 2013|publisher=BBC News|quote=fusion reaction exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar large-scale device in France, [[Laser Mégajoule]], was officially inaugurated in October 2014.

==Description==

===Basic fusion===
{{main|Nuclear fusion }}

[[Image:Hohlraum irradiation on NOVA laser.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Indirect drive laser ICF uses a ''[[hohlraum]]'' which is irradiated with laser beam cones from either side on its inner surface to bathe a fusion microcapsule inside with smooth high intensity X-rays. The highest energy X-rays can be seen leaking through the hohlraum, represented here in orange/red.]]
Fusion reactions combine lighter atoms, such as [[hydrogen]], together to form larger ones. Generally the reactions take place at such high temperatures that the atoms have been [[ion]]ized, their [[electron]]s stripped off by the heat; thus, fusion is typically described in terms of "nuclei" instead of "atoms".

Nuclei are positively charged, and thus repel each other due to the [[electrostatic force]]. Overcoming this repulsion costs a considerable amount of energy, which is known as the ''[[Coulomb barrier]]'' or ''fusion barrier energy''. Generally, less energy will be needed to cause lighter nuclei to fuse, as they have less charge and thus a lower barrier energy, and when they do fuse, more energy will be released. As the mass of the nuclei increase, there is a point where the reaction no longer gives off net energy—the energy needed to overcome the energy barrier is greater than the energy released in the resulting fusion reaction.

The best fuel from an energy perspective is a one-to-one mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]; both are heavy [[isotope]]s of hydrogen. The D-T (deuterium &amp; tritium) mix has a low barrier because of its high ratio of neutrons to protons. The presence of neutral [[neutron]]s in the nuclei helps pull them together via the [[nuclear force]], while the presence of positively charged protons pushes the nuclei apart via electrostatic force. Tritium has one of the highest ratios of neutrons to protons of any stable or moderately unstable nuclide—two neutrons and one proton. Adding protons or removing neutrons increases the energy barrier.

A mix of D-T at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]] does not undergo fusion; the nuclei must be forced together before the nuclear force can pull them together into stable collections. Even in the hot, dense center of the sun, the average proton will exist for billions of years before it fuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fusedweb.llnl.gov/cpep/chart_pages/3.HowFusionWorks.html |title=FusEdWeb &amp;#124; Fusion Education |publisher=Fusedweb.llnl.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510084815/http://fusedweb.llnl.gov/cpep/chart_pages/3.HowFusionWorks.html |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For practical fusion power systems, the rate must be dramatically increased by heating the fuel to tens of millions of degrees, and/or compressing it to immense pressures. The temperature and pressure required for any particular fuel to fuse is known as the [[Lawson criterion]]. These conditions have been known since the 1950s when the first [[H-bomb]]s were built. To meet the Lawson Criterion is extremely difficult on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current high state of technical prowess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Hoffman |url=http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm |title=What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable |publisher=Scienceworldreport.com |date=2013-03-23 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICF mechanism of action ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[HiPER]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

In a hydrogen bomb, the fusion fuel is compressed and heated with a separate fission bomb (see [[Teller-Ulam design]]). A variety of mechanisms transfers the energy of the fission "trigger"'s explosion into the fusion fuel. The requirement of a fission bomb makes the method impractical for power generation. Not only would the triggers be prohibitively expensive to produce, but there is a minimum size that such a bomb can be built, defined roughly by the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] of the [[plutonium]] fuel used. Generally it seems difficult to build nuclear devices smaller than about 1 kiloton in yield, which would make it a difficult engineering problem to extract power from the resulting explosions.

As the explosion size is scaled down, so too is the amount of energy needed to start the reaction off. Studies from the late 1950s and early 1960s suggested that scaling down into the megajoule energy range would require energy levels that could be delivered by any number of means. This led to the idea of using a device that would "beam" the energy at the fusion fuel, ensuring mechanical separation. By the mid-1960s, it appeared that the [[laser]] would develop to the point where the required energy levels would be available.

Generally ICF systems use a single laser, the ''driver'', whose beam is split up into a number of beams which are subsequently individually amplified by a trillion times or more. These are sent into the reaction chamber (called a target chamber) by a number of mirrors, positioned in order to illuminate the target evenly over its whole surface. The heat applied by the driver causes the outer layer of the target to explode, just as the outer layers of an H-bomb's fuel cylinder do when illuminated by the X-rays of the fission device.

The material exploding off the surface causes the remaining material on the inside to be driven inwards with great force, eventually collapsing into a tiny near-spherical ball. In modern ICF devices the density of the resulting fuel mixture is as much as one-hundred times the density of lead, around 1000 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This density is not high enough to create any useful rate of fusion on its own. However, during the collapse of the fuel, [[shock wave]]s also form and travel into the center of the fuel at high speed. When they meet their counterparts moving in from the other sides of the fuel in the center, the density of that spot is raised much further.

Given the correct conditions, the fusion rate in the region highly compressed by the shock wave can give off significant amounts of highly energetic [[alpha particles]]. Due to the high density of the surrounding fuel, they move only a short distance before being "thermalised", losing their energy to the fuel as heat. This additional energy will cause additional fusion reactions in the heated fuel, giving off more high-energy particles. This process spreads outward from the centre, leading to a kind of self-sustaining burn known as ''ignition''.

===Issues with successful achievement===
The primary problems with increasing ICF performance since the early experiments in the 1970s have been of energy delivery to the target, controlling symmetry of the imploding fuel, preventing premature heating of the fuel (before maximum density is achieved), preventing premature mixing of hot and cool fuel by [[hydrodynamic]] instabilities and the formation of a 'tight' [[Shock wave|shockwave]] convergence at the compressed fuel center.

In order to focus the shock wave on the center of the target, the target must be made with extremely high precision and [[sphericity]] with aberrations of no more than a few micrometres over its surface (inner and outer). Likewise the aiming of the laser beams must be extremely precise and the beams must arrive at the same time at all points on the target. Beam timing is a relatively simple issue though and is solved by using [[Analog delay line|delay line]]s in the beams' optical path to achieve [[1 E-12 s|picosecond]] levels of timing accuracy. {{Anchor|instability2016-01-29}}The other major problem plaguing the achievement of high symmetry and high temperatures/densities of the imploding target are so called "beam-beam" imbalance and beam anisotropy. These problems are, respectively, where the energy delivered by one beam may be higher or lower than other beams impinging on the target and of "hot spots" within a beam diameter hitting a target which induces uneven compression on the target surface, thereby forming [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=A.

The [[Richtmyer-Meshkov instability]] is also formed during the process due to shock waves being formed.

All of these problems have been substantially mitigated to varying degrees in the past two decades of research by using various beam smoothing techniques and beam energy diagnostics to balance beam to beam energy; however, RT instability remains a major issue. Target design has also improved tremendously over the years. Modern [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] [[hydrogen]] ice targets tend to freeze a thin layer of [[deuterium]] just on the inside of a plastic sphere while irradiating it with a low power [[Infrared|IR]] laser to smooth its inner surface while monitoring it with a [[microscope]] equipped [[camera]], thereby allowing the layer to be closely monitored ensuring its "smoothness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lle.rochester.edu/pub/progress/doe_apr02.pdf Inertial Confinement Fusion Program Activities, April 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511175948/http://www.lle.rochester.edu/pub/progress/doe_apr02.pdf |date=May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryogenic targets filled with a deuterium [[tritium]] (D-T) mixture are "self-smoothing" due to the small amount of heat created by the decay of the radioactive tritium isotope. This is often referred to as "[[beta radiation|beta]]-layering".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lle.rochester.edu/pub/progress/MarDOE06.pdf Inertial Confinement Fusion Program Activities, March 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511180008/http://www.lle.rochester.edu/pub/progress/MarDOE06.pdf |date=May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capsule can be either inserted in a hohlraum (as above) and imploded in the '''indirect drive''' mode or irradiated directly with [[laser]] energy in the '''direct drive''' configuration. Microcapsules used on previous laser systems were significantly smaller owing to the less powerful irradiation earlier lasers were capable of delivering to the target.]]

Certain targets are surrounded by a small metal cylinder which is irradiated by the laser beams instead of the target itself, an approach known as "''indirect drive''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindl |first=John |last2=Hammel |first2=Bruce |contribution=Recent Advances in Indirect Drive ICF Target Physics |year=2004 |title=20th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/iaea04_lindl.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach the lasers are focused on the inner side of the cylinder, heating it to a superhot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which radiates mostly in [[X-ray]]s. The X-rays from this plasma are then absorbed by the target surface, imploding it in the same way as if it had been hit with the lasers directly. The absorption of thermal x-rays by the target is more efficient than the direct absorption of laser light, however these ''[[hohlraum]]s'' or "burning chambers" also take up considerable energy to heat on their own thus significantly reducing the overall efficiency of laser-to-target energy transfer. They are thus a debated feature even today; the equally numerous "''direct-drive''" design does not use them. Most often, indirect drive hohlraum targets are used to simulate [[Nuclear weapon|thermonuclear weapons]] tests due to the fact that the fusion fuel in them is also imploded mainly by X-ray radiation.

A variety of ICF drivers are being explored. Lasers have improved dramatically since the 1970s, scaling up in energy and power from a few [[joule]]s and kilowatts to megajoules (see [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]] laser) and hundreds of terawatts, using mostly [[Nonlinear optics|frequency doubled or tripled light]] from [[Neodymium#Neodymium glass|neodymium glass]] amplifiers.

Heavy ion beams are particularly interesting for commercial generation, as they are easy to create, control, and focus. On the downside, it is very difficult to achieve the very high energy densities required to implode a target efficiently, and most ion-beam systems require the use of a hohlraum surrounding the target to smooth out the irradiation, reducing the overall efficiency of the coupling of the [[ion beam]]'s energy to that of the imploding target further.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of nuclear fusion}}

===First conception===

====In the US====
Inertial confinement fusion history can be traced back to the "Atoms For Peace" conference held in 1957 in Geneva. This was a large, international UN sponsored conference between the superpowers of the US and Russia. Among the many topics covered during the event, some thought was given to using a [[hydrogen bomb]] to heat a water-filled underground cavern. The resulting steam would then be used to power conventional generators, and thereby provide electrical power.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=1}}

This meeting led to the [[Operation Plowshare]] efforts, given this name in 1961. Three primary concepts were studied as part of Plowshare; energy generation under [[Project PACER]], the use of large nuclear explosions for excavation, and as a sort of nuclear fracking for the natural gas industry. PACER was directly tested in December 1961 when the 3&amp;nbsp;kt [[Project Gnome]] device was emplaced in bedded salt in New Mexico. In spite of all theorizing and attempts to stop it, radioactive steam was released from the drill shaft, some distance from the test site. Further studies as part of [[Project PACER]] led to a number of engineered cavities replacing natural ones, but through this period the entire Plowshare efforts turned from bad to worse, especially after the failure of 1962's [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan]] which released huge quantities of [[fallout]]. PACER nevertheless continued to receive some funding until 1975, when a 3rd party study demonstrated that the cost of electricity from PACER would be the equivalent to conventional nuclear plants with fuel costs over ten times as great as they were.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Long, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4QsAAAAAMBAJ "Peaceful nuclear explosions"], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', October 1976, pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another outcome of the "Atoms For Peace" conference was to prompt [[John Nuckolls]] to start considering what happens when the fusion side of the bomb. When A fission bomb explodes, it releases X-Rays, which implodes the fusion side. This "secondary," was scaled down to very small size. His earliest work concerned the study of how small a fusion bomb could be made while still having a large "[[fusion energy gain factor|gain]]" to provide net energy output. This work suggested that at very small sizes, on the order of milligrams, very little energy would be needed to ignite it, much less than a fission "primary".{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=1}} He proposed building, in effect, tiny all-fusion explosives using a tiny drop of D-T fuel suspended in the center of a metal shell, today known as a hohlraum. The shell provided the same effect as the bomb casing in an H-bomb, trapping [[x-rays]] inside so they irradiated the fuel. The main difference is that the x-rays would not be supplied by a primary within the shell, but some sort of external device that heated the shell from the outside until it was glowing in the x-ray region (see [[thermal radiation]]). The power would be delivered by a then-unidentified pulsed power source he referred to using bomb terminology, the "primary".{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=2}}

The main advantage to this scheme is the efficiency of the fusion process at high densities. According to the Lawson criterion, the amount of energy needed to heat the D-T fuel to break-even conditions at ambient pressure is perhaps 100 times greater than the energy needed to compress it to a pressure that would deliver the same rate of fusion. So, in theory, the ICF approach would be dramatically more efficient in terms of gain.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=2}} This can be understood by considering the energy losses in a conventional scenario where the fuel is slowly heated, as in the case of [[magnetic fusion energy]]; the rate of energy loss to the environment is based on the temperature difference between the fuel and its surroundings, which continues to increase as the fuel is heated. In the ICF case, the entire hohlraum is filled with high-temperature radiation, limiting losses.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=3}}

==== In Germany ====

Around the same time (in 1956) a meeting was organized at the Max Planck Institute in Germany by the fusion pioneer [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. At this meeting [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed the non-fission ignition of a thermonuclear micro-explosion by a convergent shock wave driven with high explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Archives of Library University of Stuttgart, Konvolut 7, Estate of Professor Dr. Hoecker, 1956 von Weizsäcker, Meeting in Göttingen&lt;/ref&gt; Further reference to Winterberg's work in Germany on nuclear micro explosions (mininukes) is contained in a declassified report of the former East German [[Stasi]] (Staatsicherheitsdienst).&lt;ref&gt;Stasi Report of the former East German Democratic Republic, MfS-AGM by "Der Bundesbeauftragte für die Unterlagen des Staatsicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik," Zentralarchiv, Berlin, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 [[Friedwardt Winterberg|Winterberg]] proposed that ignition could be achieved by an intense beam of microparticles accelerated to a velocity of 1000&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedwardt Winterberg|F. Winterberg]], Z. f. Naturforsch. 19a, 231 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1968, he proposed to use intense electron and ion beams, generated by [[Marx generator]]s, for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;F. Winterberg, Phys. Rev. 174, 212 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this proposal is that the generation of charged particle beams is not only less expensive than the generation of laser beams but also can entrap the charged fusion reaction products due to the strong self-magnetic beam field, drastically reducing the compression requirements for beam ignited cylindrical targets.

==== In the USSR ====

In 1967 research fellow [[Gurgen Askaryan]] published article with proposition to use focused laser beam in fusion [[lithium deuteride]] or [[deuterium]].&lt;ref name=nauka&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/N/%27%27Nauka_i_jizn%27%27%27/%27%27Nauka_i_jizn%27%27%27%2C1967%2CN10.%5Bpdf%5D.zip|author=[[Gurgen Askaryan]]|script-title=ru:Новые физические эффекты |trans-title=New Physical Effects|language=Russian|journal = [[Nauka i Zhizn]]|volume=11|year=1967|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early research===
Through the late 1950s, Nuckolls and collaborators at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) ran a number of computer simulations of the ICF concept. In early 1960 this produced a full simulation of the implosion of 1&amp;nbsp;mg of D-T fuel inside a dense shell. The simulation suggested that a 5 MJ power input to the hohlraum would produce 50 MJ of fusion output, a gain of 10. At the time the laser had not yet been invented, and a wide variety of possible drivers were considered, including pulsed power machines, charged particle accelerators, plasma guns, and hypervelocity pellet guns.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=4}}

Through the year two key theoretical advances were made. New simulations considered the timing of the energy delivered in the pulse, known as "pulse shaping", leading to better implosion. Additionally, the shell was made much larger and thinner, forming a thin shell as opposed to an almost solid ball. These two changes dramatically increased the efficiency of the implosion, and thereby greatly lowered the energy required to compress it. Using these improvements, it was calculated that a driver of about 1 MJ would be needed,{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=5}} a five-fold improvement. Over the next two years several other theoretical advancements were proposed, notably [[Ray Kidder]]'s development of an implosion system without a hohlraum, the so-called "direct drive" approach, and [[Stirling Colgate]] and Ron Zabawski's work on very small systems with as little as 1 μg of D-T fuel.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|pp=4-5}}

The introduction of the laser in 1960 at [[HRL Laboratories|Hughes Research Laboratories]] in California appeared to present a perfect driver mechanism. Starting in 1962, Livermore's director [[John S. Foster, Jr.]] and Edward Teller began a small-scale laser study effort directed toward the ICF approach. Even at this early stage the suitability of the ICF system for weapons research was well understood, and the primary reason for its ability to gain funding.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=6}} Over the next decade, LLNL made several small experimental devices for basic laser-plasma interaction studies.

===Development begins===
In 1967 [[Kip Siegel]] started KMS Industries using the proceeds of the sale of his share of an earlier company, Conductron, a pioneer in [[holography]]. In the early 1970s he formed [[KMS Fusion]] to begin development of a laser-based ICF system.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;Sean Johnston, [http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/29299.html "Interview with Dr. Larry Siebert"], American Institute of Physics, 4 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This development led to considerable opposition from the weapons labs, including LLNL, who put forth a variety of reasons that KMS should not be allowed to develop ICF in public. This opposition was funnelled through the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], who demanded funding for their own efforts. Adding to the background noise were rumours of an aggressive Soviet ICF program, new higher-powered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and glass lasers, the electron beam driver concept, and the [[1970s energy crisis]] which added impetus to many energy projects.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=6}}

In 1972 Nuckolls wrote an influential public paper in ''Nature'' introducing ICF and suggesting that testbed systems could be made to generate fusion with drivers in the kJ range, and high-gain systems with MJ drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Nuckolls |first=John |last2=Wood |first2=Lowell |last3=Thiessen |first3=Albert |last4=Zimmerman |first4=George |title=Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications |journal=Nature |volume=239 |issue=5368 |year=1972 |pages=139–142 |doi=10.1038/239139a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 23, 2014|bibcode = 1972Natur.239..139N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lindl |first=J.D. |contribution=The Edward Teller medal lecture: The evolution toward Indirect Drive and two decades of progress toward ICF ignition and burn |year=1993 |title=International workshop on laser interaction and related plasma phenomena |publisher=Department of Energy (DOE)'s Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of limited resources and numerous business problems, KMS Fusion successfully demonstrated fusion from the ICF process on 1 May 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200912/backpage.cfm |first=Philip |last=Wyatt |title=The Back Page |publisher=Aps.org |date=December 2009 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this success was followed not long after by Siegel's death, and the end of KMS fusion about a year later, having run the company on Siegel's life insurance policy.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt; By this point several weapons labs and universities had started their own programs, notably the [[solid-state laser]]s ([[List of laser types#Solid-state lasers|Nd:glass laser]]s) at LLNL and the [[University of Rochester]], and [[krypton fluoride]] [[excimer laser]]s systems at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] and the [[Naval Research Laboratory]].

Although KMS's success led to a major development effort, the advances that followed were, and still are, hampered by the seemingly intractable problems that characterize fusion research in general.

===High-energy ICF===
High-energy ICF experiments (multi-hundred joules per shot and greater experiments) began in earnest in the early-1970s, when lasers of the required energy and power were first designed. This was some time after the successful design of [[magnetic confinement fusion]] systems, and around the time of the particularly successful [[tokamak]] design that was introduced in the early '70s. Nevertheless, high funding for fusion research stimulated by the multiple [[energy crisis|energy crises]] during the mid to late 1970s produced rapid gains in performance, and inertial designs were soon reaching the same sort of "below break-even" conditions of the best magnetic systems.

LLNL was, in particular, very well funded and started a major laser fusion development program. Their [[Janus laser]] started operation in 1974, and validated the approach of using Nd:glass lasers to generate very high power devices. Focusing problems were explored in the [[Long path laser]] and [[Cyclops laser]], which led to the larger [[Argus laser]]. None of these were intended to be practical ICF devices, but each one advanced the state of the art to the point where there was some confidence the basic approach was valid. At the time it was believed that making a much larger device of the Cyclops type could both compress and heat the ICF targets, leading to ignition in the "short term". This was a misconception based on extrapolation of the fusion yields seen from experiments utilizing the so-called "exploding pusher" type of fuel capsules. During the period spanning the years of the late '70s and early '80s the estimates for laser energy on target needed to achieve ignition doubled almost yearly as the various plasma instabilities and laser-plasma energy coupling loss modes were gradually understood. The realization that the simple exploding pusher target designs and mere few kilojoule (kJ) laser irradiation intensities would never scale to high gain fusion yields led to the effort to increase laser energies to the 100 kJ level in the UV and to the production of advanced ablator and cryogenic DT ice target designs.

===Shiva and Nova===
One of the earliest serious and large scale attempts at an ICF driver design was the '''[[Shiva laser]]''', a 20-beam [[Neodymium#Neodymium glass|neodymium doped glass]] laser system built at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) that started operation in 1978. Shiva was a "proof of concept" design intended to demonstrate compression of fusion fuel capsules to many times the liquid density of hydrogen. In this, Shiva succeeded and compressed its pellets to 100 times the liquid density of deuterium. However, due to the laser's strong coupling with hot electrons, premature heating of the dense plasma (ions) was problematic and fusion yields were low. This failure by Shiva to efficiently heat the compressed plasma pointed to the use of [[optical frequency multiplier]]s as a solution which would frequency triple the infrared light from the laser into the ultraviolet at 351&amp;nbsp;nm. Newly discovered schemes to efficiently frequency triple high intensity laser light discovered at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] in 1980 enabled this method of target irradiation to be experimented with in the 24 beam OMEGA laser and the [[NOVETTE laser]], which was followed by the [[Nova (laser)|Nova laser]] design with 10 times the energy of Shiva, the first design with the specific goal of reaching ignition conditions.

Nova also failed in its goal of achieving ignition, this time due to severe variation in laser intensity in its beams (and differences in intensity between beams) caused by filamentation which resulted in large non-uniformity in irradiation smoothness at the target and asymmetric implosion. The techniques pioneered earlier could not address these new issues. But again this failure led to a much greater understanding of the process of implosion, and the way forward again seemed clear, namely the increase in uniformity of irradiation, the reduction of hot-spots in the laser beams through beam smoothing techniques to reduce [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]] imprinting on the target and increased laser energy on target by at least an order of magnitude. Funding for fusion research was severely constrained in the 80's, but Nova nevertheless successfully gathered enough information for a next generation machine.

===National Ignition Facility===
The resulting design, now known as the [[National Ignition Facility]], started construction at LLNL in 1997. NIF's main objective will be to operate as the flagship experimental device of the so-called [[Stockpile stewardship|nuclear stewardship program]], supporting LLNLs traditional bomb-making role.

The first credible attempts at ignition were initially scheduled for 2010,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} but ignition was not achieved as of September 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[William Broad|William J.

===Fast ignition===
A more recent development is the concept of "[[fast ignition]]," which may offer a way to directly heat the high density fuel after compression, thus decoupling the heating and compression phases of the implosion. In this approach the target is first compressed "normally" using a driver laser system, and then when the implosion reaches maximum density (at the stagnation point or "bang time"), a second ultra-short pulse ultra-high power [[petawatt]] (PW) laser delivers a single pulse focused on one side of the core, dramatically heating it and hopefully starting fusion ignition. The two types of fast ignition are the "plasma bore-through" method and the "cone-in-shell" method. In the first method the petawatt laser is simply expected to bore straight through the outer plasma of an imploding capsule and to impinge on and heat the dense core, whereas in the cone-in-shell method, the capsule is mounted on the end of a small high-z (high [[atomic number]]) cone such that the tip of the cone projects into the core of the capsule. In this second method, when the capsule is imploded, the petawatt has a clear view straight to the high density core and does not have to waste energy boring through a 'corona' plasma; however, the presence of the cone affects the implosion process in significant ways that are not fully understood. Several projects are currently underway to explore the fast ignition approach, including upgrades to the [[OMEGA laser]] at the [[University of Rochester]], the [[GEKKO XII]] device in Japan, and an entirely new £500 million facility, known as [[HiPER]], proposed for construction in the [[European Union]]. If successful, the fast ignition approach could dramatically lower the total amount of energy needed to be delivered to the target; whereas NIF uses UV beams of 2&amp;nbsp;MJ, HiPER's driver is 200&amp;nbsp;kJ and heater 70&amp;nbsp;kJ, yet the predicted fusion gains are nevertheless even higher than on NIF.

===Other projects===
[[Laser Mégajoule]], the French project, has seen its first experimental line achieved in 2002, and its first target shots were finally conducted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-lmj.cea.fr/fr/lmj/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was roughly 75% complete as of 2016.

Using a different approach entirely is the [[z-pinch|''z''-pinch]] device. ''Z''-pinch uses massive amounts of electric current which is switched into a cylinder comprising extremely fine wires. The wires vaporize to form an electrically conductive, high current plasma; the resulting circumferential magnetic field squeezes the plasma cylinder, imploding it and thereby generating a high-power x-ray pulse that can be used to drive the implosion of a fuel capsule. Challenges to this approach include relatively low drive temperatures, resulting in slow implosion velocities and potentially large instability growth, and preheat caused by high-energy x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/010607a.pdf Z-Pinch Power Plant a Pulsed Power Driven System for Fusion Energy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117115440/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/010607a.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|bibcode=2002AIPC..651....3G|doi =10.1063/1.1531270|series=AIP Conference Proceedings|conference =DENSE Z-PINCHES: 5th International Conference on Dense Z-Pinches. |date=2002|last1=Grabovskii|first1=E.

Most recently, Winterberg has proposed the ignition of a deuterium microexplosion, with a gigavolt super-Marx generator, which is a [[Marx generator]] driven by up to 100 ordinary Marx generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |first=Friedwardt |last=Winterberg| authorlink=Friedwardt Winterberg |eprint=0812.0394 |class=physics.gen-ph |title=Ignition of a deuterium micro-detonation with a gigavolt super marx generator |date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an energy source==
Practical power plants built using ICF have been studied since the late 1970s when ICF experiments were beginning to ramp up to higher powers; they are known as '''inertial fusion energy''', or '''IFE''' plants. These devices would deliver a successive stream of targets to the reaction chamber, several a second typically, and capture the resulting heat and neutron radiation from their implosion and fusion to drive a conventional [[steam turbine]].

===Technical challenges===
IFE faces continued technical challenges in reaching the conditions needed for ignition. But even if these were all to be solved, there are a significant number of practical problems that seem just as difficult to overcome. Laser-driven systems were initially believed to be able to generate commercially useful amounts of energy. However, as estimates of the energy required to reach ignition grew dramatically during the 1970s and '80s, these hopes were abandoned. Given the low efficiency of the laser amplification process (about 1 to 1.5%), and the losses in generation (steam-driven turbine systems are typically about 35% efficient), fusion gains would have to be on the order of 350 just to energetically break even. These sorts of gains appeared to be impossible to generate, and ICF work turned primarily to weapons research.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

With the recent introduction of fast ignition and similar approaches, things have changed dramatically. In this approach gains of 100 are predicted in the first experimental device, [[HiPER]]. Given a gain of about 100 and a laser efficiency of about 1%, HiPER produces about the same amount of ''fusion'' energy as electrical energy was needed to create it. It also appears that an order of magnitude improvement in laser efficiency may be possible through the use of newer designs that replace the flash lamps with [[laser diode]]s that are tuned to produce most of their energy in a frequency range that is strongly absorbed. Initial experimental devices offer efficiencies of about 10%, and it is suggested that 20% is a real possibility with some additional development.

With "classical" devices like NIF about 330&amp;nbsp;MJ of electrical power are used to produce the driver beams, producing an expected yield of about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ, with the maximum credible yield of 45&amp;nbsp;MJ. Using the same sorts of numbers in a reactor combining fast ignition with newer lasers would offer dramatically improved performance. HiPER requires about 270&amp;nbsp;kJ of laser energy, so assuming a first-generation diode laser driver at 10% the reactor would require about 3&amp;nbsp;MJ of electrical power. This is expected to produce about 30&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dunne |first=Mike |contribution=HiPER: a laser fusion facility for Europe |year=2006 |title=Fast Ignition Workshop |publisher=Central Laser Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory |url=http://fsc.lle.rochester.edu/pub/workshops/FIW06/Dunne_FI06.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a very poor conversion to electrical energy appears to offer real-world power output, and incremental improvements in yield and laser efficiency appear to be able to offer a commercially useful output.

===Practical problems===
ICF systems face some of the same secondary power extraction problems as magnetic systems in generating useful power from their reactions. One of the primary concerns is how to successfully remove heat from the reaction chamber without interfering with the targets and driver beams. Another serious concern is that the huge number of [[neutron]]s released in the fusion reactions react with the plant, causing them to become intensely radioactive themselves, as well as mechanically weakening metals. Fusion plants built of conventional metals like [[steel]] would have a fairly short lifetime and the core containment vessels will have to be replaced frequently.

One current concept in dealing with both of these problems, as shown in the '''HYLIFE-II''' baseline design, is to use a "waterfall" of [[FLiBe]], a molten mix of [[fluoride]] salts of [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]], which both protect the chamber from neutrons and carry away heat. The FLiBe is then passed into a [[heat exchanger]] where it heats water for use in the turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Craig |last=Olson |first2=Max |last2=Tabak |first3=Jill |last3=Dahlburg |first4=Rick |last4=Olson |first5=Steve |last5=Payne |first6=John |last6=Sethian |first7=John |last7=Barnard |first8=Rick |last8=Spielman |first9=Ken |last9=Schultz |first10=Robert |last10=Peterson |first11=Per |last11=Peterson |first12=Wayne |last12=Meier |first13=John |last13=Perkins |contribution=Inertial Fusion Concepts Working Group, Final Reports of the Subgroups |year=1999 |title=1999 Fusion Summer Study |publisher=Columbia University |url= http://sites.apam.columbia.edu/SMproceedings/6.InertialConcepts/6.IFE_Subgroups.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tritium]] produced by fissioning lithium nuclei can also be extracted in order to close the power plant's thermonuclear fuel cycle, a necessity for perpetual operation because tritium does not exist in quantity naturally and must be manufactured. Another concept, '''Sombrero''', uses a reaction chamber built of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] which has a very low neutron [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]]. Cooling is provided by a molten ceramic, chosen because of its ability to stop the neutrons from traveling any further, while at the same time being an efficient heat transfer agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=I.N. |last=Sviatoslavsky |first2=M.E. |last2=Sawan |first3=R.R. |last3=Peterson |first4=G.L. |last4=Kulcinski |first5=J.J. |last5=MacFarlane |first6=L.J. |last6=Wittenberg |first7=E.A. |last7=Mogahed |first8=S.C. |last8=Rutledge |first9=S. |last9=Ghose |first10=R. |last10=Bourque |contribution=SOMBRERO - A Solid Breeder Moving Bed KrF Laser Driven IFE Power Reactor |year=1991 |title=14th IEEE/NPSS Symposium on Fusion Engineering |publisher=Fusion Technology Institute, University of Wisconsin |url=http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/pdf/fdm862.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic viability===
Even if these technical advances solve the considerable problems in IFE, another factor working against IFE is the cost of the fuel. Even as Nuckolls was developing his earliest detailed calculations on the idea, co-workers pointed this out: if an IFE machine produces 50 MJ of fusion energy, one might expect that a shot could produce perhaps 10 MJ of power for export. Converted to better known units, this is the equivalent of 2.8 kWh of electrical power. Wholesale rates for electrical power on the grid were about 0.3 cents/kWh at the time, which meant the monetary value of the shot was perhaps one cent. In the intervening 50 years the price of power has remained about even with the rate of inflation, and the rate in 2012 in [[Ontario, Canada]] was about 2.8 cents/kWh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/marketdata/markettoday.asp |title=IESO Power Data |publisher=Ieso.ca |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002115248/http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/marketdata/marketToday.asp |archivedate=2014-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in order for an IFE plant to be economically viable, fuel shots would have to cost considerably less than ten cents in year 2012 dollars. At the time this objection was first noted, Nuckolls suggested using liquid droplets sprayed into the hohlraum from an eye-dropper-like apparatus.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=5}} Given the ever-increasing demands for higher uniformity of the targets, this approach does not appear practical, as even the inner ablator and fuel itself currently costs several orders of magnitude more than this. Moreover, Nuckolls' solution had the fuel dropped into a fixed hohlraum that would be re-used in a continual cycle, but at current energy levels the hohlraum is destroyed with every shot.

Direct-drive systems avoid the use of a hohlraum and thereby may be less expensive in fuel terms. However, these systems still require an ablator, and the accuracy and geometrical considerations are even more important. They are also far less developed than the indirect-drive systems, and face considerably more technical problems in terms of implosion physics. Currently there is no strong consensus whether a direct-drive system would actually be less expensive to operate.

==Projected development==
The various phases of such a project are the following, the sequence of inertial confinement fusion development follows much the same outline:
; Burning demonstration: Reproducible achievement of some fusion energy release (not necessarily a Q factor of &gt;1).
; High gain demonstration: Experimental demonstration of the feasibility of a reactor with a sufficient energy gain.
; Industrial demonstration: Validation of the various technical options, and of the whole data needed to define a commercial reactor.
; Commercial demonstration: Demonstration of the reactor ability to work over a long period, while respecting all the requirements for safety, liability and cost.

At the moment, according to the available data,&lt;ref&gt;This chapter is based on data available in June 2006, when [[Laser Megajoule]] and NIF lasers are not yet into complete service.&lt;/ref&gt; inertial confinement fusion experiments have not gone beyond the first phase, although Nova and others have repeatedly demonstrated operation within this realm. In the short term a number of new systems are expected to reach the second stage.

For a true industrial demonstration, further work is required. In particular, the laser systems need to be able to run at high operating frequencies, perhaps one to ten times a second. Most of the laser systems mentioned in this article have trouble operating even as much as once a day. Parts of the HiPER budget are dedicated to research in this direction as well. Because they convert electricity into laser light with much higher efficiency, diode lasers also run cooler, which in turn allows them to be operated at much higher frequencies. HiPER is currently studying devices that operate at 1 MJ at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, or alternately 100 kJ at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz.

R&amp;D continued on inertial fusion energy in the European Union and in Japan. The [[HiPER|High Power laser Energy Research]] facility (HiPER) is a proposed experimental fusion device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the [[European Union]] to continue the development of laser-driven inertial confinement approach. HiPER is the first experiment designed specifically to study the ''fast ignition'' approach to generating nuclear fusion. Using much smaller [[laser]]s than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude would offer a much higher ''Q'' with a reduction in construction costs of about ten times. Theoretical research since the design of HiPER in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition but a new approach known as ''shock ignition'' has been proposed to address some of these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perkins|first=L.

==Nuclear weapons program==
The very hot and dense conditions encountered during an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment are similar to those created in a thermonuclear weapon, and have applications to the nuclear weapons program. ICF experiments might be used, for example, to help determine how warhead performance will degrade as it ages, or as part of a program of designing new weapons. Retaining knowledge and corporate expertise in the nuclear weapons program is another motivation for pursuing ICF.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Garwin]], Arms Control Today, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/science |title=Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the NIF in the United States is sourced from the 'Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship' program, and the goals of the program are oriented accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/science/stockpile-stewardship |title=Stockpile Stewardship |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that some aspects of ICF research may violate the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] or the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makhijani |first=Arjun |first2=Hisham |last2=Zerriffi |url=http://www.ieer.org/reports/fusion/chap5.html |title=Dangerous Thermonuclear Quest |publisher=Ieer.org |date=1998-07-15 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, despite the formidable technical hurdles, ICF research might potentially lead to the creation of a "[[pure fusion weapon]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~globsec/publications/pdf/7_2Jones.pdf Jones and von Hippel, Science and Global security, 1998, Volume 7 p129-150] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309102658/http://www.princeton.edu/~globsec/publications/pdf/7_2Jones.pdf |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutron source==
Inertial confinement fusion has the potential to produce orders of magnitude more neutrons than [[Spallation#Nuclear spallation|spallation]]. Neutrons are capable of locating hydrogen atoms in molecules, resolving atomic thermal motion and studying collective excitations of photons more effectively than [[X-rays]]. [[Neutron scattering]] studies of molecular structures could resolve problems associated with [[protein folding]], [[Facilitated diffusion|diffusion through membranes]], [[Proton pump|proton transfer mechanisms]], dynamics of [[molecular motor]]s, etc. by modulating [[Neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] into beams of slow neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, Andrew |title=A Route to the Brightest Possible Neutron Source? |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |date=February 2007 |pages=1092–1095 |pmid=17322053 |doi=10.1126/science.1127185 |last2=Dunne |first2=M |last3=Bennington |first3=S |last4=Ansell |first4=S |last5=Gardner |first5=I |last6=Norreys |first6=P |last7=Broome |first7=T |last8=Findlay |first8=D |last9=Nelmes |first9=R |issue=5815 |bibcode =2007Sci...315.1092T }}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with fissionable materials, neutrons produced by ICF can potentially be used in [[Hybrid Nuclear Fusion]] designs to produce electric power.

The term "'''interspecies family'''" refers to a group consisting of at least two members of different species who deeply care for each other. Examples include a human and their dog, a couple and their cats, a dog and a cat, or even a mule and a sheep. The emphasis is on love and that the members of the group care for and treat each other like a family.  For instance, "interspecies family" may describe a group composed of a dog and a person who refers to their dog as their child, best friend, or other phrase that connotes a stronger bond than just a "pet", a term which implies a sense of property and ownership.

Most often this is used to discuss non-human interspecies families, typically where a mother of one species will foster a youngling from a different species. With the more recent growth of the fields of [[anthrozoology]] and [[animal studies]], this is being used more frequently to refer especially to bonds between human and non-human animals. 
 
== History and use ==

=== Anthropomorphism ===
Some of the earliest instances of the interspecies family involve the use of [[anthropomorphism]], such as in the children's book ''[[Stuart Little]]'' in which a mouse is a member of a human family. This is a fairly common idea which led to some of the first uses of "interspecies family" in media targeted towards children.

=== Non-human animal relationships ===
There is also a popular trend in books and internet sites that involves capturing photographs and stories of interspecies non-human animal families.  These heartwarming cases promote the idea that animals can look past such differences. However, in these cases they are more often referred to as "interspecies adoptions", "interspecies pairings", and "interspecies friendships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nobel|first=Oliver|title=Interspecies Animal Friendships Will Warm Your Heart (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/interspecies-animal-friendships_n_1556674.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human and non-human animal relationships ===
Just recently, the term has been used to describe non-fiction situations involving human and non-human animal relationships. In 2011 a dissertation was written by Avigdor Edminster entitled ''"'This Dog Means Life': Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edminster|first=Avigdor|title="This Dog Means Life": Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107791/1/Edminster_umn_0130E_11975.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;   in which "Interspecies families" is used frequently.  There have been other instances since then, but they have been strictly within academic works.

In the fall of 2013, The National Museum of Animals &amp; Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Animals and Society|url=http://www.museumofanimals.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created the exhibit entitled {{'}}''My Dog Is My Home: The Experience of Human-Animal Homelessness''{{'}}. The exhibit explores the experience of being homeless with an animal, and specifically the needs that are unmet because of homeless services' failure to recognize the legitimacy of the human-animal bond and their status as an "interspecies family". The exhibit helped popularize the phrase "interspecies family" among its animal protection audience as well as among social service providers. Part of the museum's mission is to promote this idea of inter-species families and make the general public more aware of the strong bonds that can be shared between human and non-human animals.

'''Jean Louis Florent Polydore Roux''' (27 July [[1792]], [[Marseille]] -12 April [[1833]] , [[Bombay]]) was a  [[France|French]] [[Art|painter]] and [[naturalist]].

Jean-Louis-Florent-Polydore Roux was, from his childhood, interested in natural history and had a large insect collection.He was taught  by [[Pierre André Latreille]] and [[Georges Cuvier]] at [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences de l'Institut de France]] in Paris and  was in 1819 appointed curator of the [[Muséum d'histoire naturelle de Marseille]].He  published ''Catalogue d’insectes de Provence'', 1820 a 2 volume work on birds ''Ornithologie provençale'', 1833 and ''Crustacés de la Méditerranée et de son littoral'',1828–30, which including 45 coloured plates, which he himself had made. He also published on [[molluscs]] ''[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/51497#page/5/mode/2up Iconographie conchyliologique]'', 1828.Marine painting was another of his occupations and a [[Roux family (marine painters)|Roux family concern]]. Roux  was a correspondent of [[Antoine Risso|Risso]] who in 1826 named the copepod ''Pandarus rouxi'' after him. In 1831 he joined [[Charles von Hügel]], who was travelling for the Austrian government, on an excursion to Egypt and from there in 1832 to Bombay, where he later died of [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

A [[species]] of Indian lizard, ''[[Calotes rouxii]]'', is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''.

A '''Lariat chain''' is a loop of chain that hangs off, and is spun by a wheel. It is often used as a science exhibit or a toy. 

The original [http://normantuck.com/catalogPages/lariat.html '''Lariat Chain'''] was created in 1986 by [http://www.normantuck.com Norman Tuck], as an Artist-in-Residence project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/xref/exhibits/lariat_chain.html |title=Exhibit Cross Reference - Lariat Chain |publisher=Exploratorium.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco. 

'''Lariat Chain''' was developed from an earlier Tuck piece entitled '''Chain Reaction''' (1984). '''Chain Reaction''' was hand cranked, and utilized a heavy chain attached by magnets onto an iron flywheel. As in '''Lariat Chain''', '''Chain Reaction''' used a brush to disrupt the motion of the traveling chain.  

The speed of the chain is arranged to equal the [[group velocity|wave speed]] of [[transverse wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transverse and Longitudinal Waves|url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/tralon.html|website = hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that waves moving against the motion of the chain appear to be standing still.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group2/lariat/index.html Exploratorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005233508/http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group2/lariat/index.html |date=2008-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normantuck.com/catalogPages/lariat.html normantuck.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linear parameter-varying control''' (LPV control) deals with the [[control systems|control]] of linear parameter-varying systems, a class of nonlinear systems which can be modelled as parametrized linear systems whose parameters change with their [[State (controls)|state]].

==Gain scheduling==
In designing feedback controllers for dynamical systems a variety of modern, [[Multivariable calculus|multivariable]] controllers are used. In general, these controllers are often designed at various operating points using [[Linearization|linearized]] models of the [[Scheduling|system dynamics]] and are scheduled as a function of a [[parameter]] or parameters for operation at intermediate conditions. It is an approach for the control of non-linear systems that uses a family of linear controllers, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system. One or more [[observable]] variables, called the [[Scheduling|scheduling variables]], are used to determine the current operating region of the system and to enable the appropriate linear controller. For example, in case of aircraft control, a set of controllers are designed at different gridded locations of corresponding parameters such as [[Angle of attack|AoA]], [[Mach number|Mach]], [[dynamic pressure]], [[Center of mass|CG]] etc. In brief, gain scheduling is a control design approach that constructs a nonlinear controller for a nonlinear plant by patching together a collection of linear controllers. These linear controllers are blended in real-time via switching or [[interpolation]].

Scheduling multivariable controllers can be very tedious and time-consuming task. A new paradigm is the linear parameter-varying (LPV) techniques which synthesize of automatically scheduled multivariable controller.

===Drawbacks of classical gain scheduling===
* An important drawback of classical gain scheduling approach is that adequate performance and in some cases even stability is not guaranteed at operating conditions other than the design points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. Shamma|first=Jeff|title=Gain Scheduling: Potentital Hazards and Possible Remedies|journal=IEEE Control Systems|year=1992|volume=June|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scheduling multivariable controllers is often a tedious and time-consuming task and it holds true especially in the field of aerospace control where the parameter dependency of controllers are large due to increased [[Flight envelope|operating envelopes]] with more demanding performance requirements.
* It is also important that the selected scheduling variables reflect changes in plant dynamics as operating conditions change. It is possible in gain scheduling to incorporate linear [[robust control]] methodologies into nonlinear control design; however the global stability, robustness and performance properties are not addressed explicitly in the design process.

Though the approach is simple and the computational burden of linearization scheduling approaches is often much less than for other nonlinear design approaches, its inherent drawbacks outweigh its advantages and necessitates a new paradigm for the control of dynamical systems. New methodologies such as Adaptive control based on [[Artificial neural networks|Artificial Neural Networks]] (ANN), [[Fuzzy logic]] etc. try to address such problems, the lack of proof of stability and performance of such approaches over entire operating parameter regime requires design of a parameter dependent controller with guaranteed properties for which, a Linear Parameter Varying controller could be an ideal candidate.

==Linear parameter-varying systems==
LPV systems are a very special class of nonlinear systems which appears to be well suited for control of dynamical systems with parameter variations. In general, LPV techniques provide a systematic design procedure for gain-scheduled multivariable controllers. This methodology allows performance, robustness and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] limitations to be incorporated into a unified framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=J. Balas|first=Gary|title=Linear Parameter-Varying Control And Its Application to Aerospace Systems|url=http://www.icas.org/ICAS_ARCHIVE/ICAS2002/PAPERS/541.PDF|publisher=ICAS|accessdate=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=Fen|title=Control of Linear Parameter Varying systems|url=http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/wu/paper/PhDthesis.ps|publisher=Univ. of California, Berkeley|accessdate=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103153558/http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/wu/paper/PhDthesis.ps|archivedate=2014-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief introduction on the LPV systems and the explanation of terminologies are given below.

===Parameter dependent systems===
In [[control engineering]], a [[state space]] representation is a [[mathematical model]] of a physical system as a set of input, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; output, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and [[State variable|state]] variables, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; related by first-order [[Differential equation|differential]] equations. The dynamic evolution of a [[nonlinear]], non-[[autonomous]] system is represented by

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x,u,t)&lt;/math&gt;

If the system is [[Time-variant system|time variant]]

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x(t),u(t),t),x(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x(t_0)=x_0 ,u(t_0)=u_0&lt;/math&gt;

The state variables describe the mathematical "state" of a [[dynamical system]] and in modeling large complex [[nonlinear]] systems if such state variables are chosen to be compact for the sake of practicality and simplicity, then parts of dynamic evolution of system are missing. The state space description will involve other variables called exogenous [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] whose evolution is not understood or is too complicated to be modeled but affect the state variables evolution in a known manner and are measurable in real-time using [[sensors]].
When a large number of sensors are used, some of these sensors measure outputs in the system theoretic sense as known, [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] nonlinear functions of the modeled states and time, while other sensors are accurate estimates of the exogenous variables. Hence, the model will be a time varying, nonlinear system, with the future time variation unknown, but measured by the sensors in real-time.
In this case, if &lt;math&gt;w(t),w&lt;/math&gt; denotes the exogenous variable [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]], and &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the modeled state, then the state equations are written as

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} =f(x(t),w(t),\dot{w}(t),u(t))&lt;/math&gt;
		
The parameter &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is not known but its evolution is measured in real time and used for control. If the above equation of parameter dependent system is linear in time then it is called Linear Parameter Dependent systems. They are written similar to [[LTI system theory|Linear Time Invariant]] form albeit the inclusion in time variant parameter.

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=A(w(t))x(t)+B(w(t))u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=C(w(t))x(t)+D(w(t))u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
		
Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems, whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters. The time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance, but is assumed to be measurable in real time. The controller is restricted to be a linear system, whose state-space entries depend [[Causality|causally]] on the parameter’s history. There exist three different methodologies to design a LPV controller namely,
# 	[[Linear fractional transformations]] which relies on the [[Small-gain theorem|small gain theorem]] for bounds on performance and robustness.
# 	Single Quadratic [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov Function]] (SQLF)
# 	Parameter Dependent Quadratic Lyapunov Function (PDQLF) to bound the achievable level of performance.

These problems are solved by reformulating the control design into finite-dimensional, [[Convex function|convex]] feasibility problems which can be solved exactly, and infinite-dimensional convex feasibility problems which can be solved approximately .
This formulation constitutes a type of gain scheduling problem and contrast to classical gain scheduling, this approach address the effect of parameter variations with assured stability and performance.

Many chemicals are commonly available in pure form. Others are available as [[reagent]]s - inexpensive, convenient sources of chemicals with a bit of processing. This is convenient for both [[amateur chemistry|amateur]] and professional chemistry work. Common reagents include:
* Metal [[oxides]] and [[carbonates]] (widely used in [[pottery]])
* [[Organic acids]] (used for [[home brewing]])
* [[Solvents]] and [[acids]] (used in cleaning materials and other [[hardware stores|hardware]] applications)
* [[Photographic processing|Photographic chemicals]], such as [[silver nitrate]] 
* Single-chemical [[fertilizer]]s, such as [[potassium nitrate]] (used in agricultural supply)
* [[Water chlorination|Chlorinating]] agents, such as [[calcium hypochlorite]] (used in [[swimming pool]] and water purification)
* [[Mordant]]s, such as [[potassium dichromate]] (used in [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]])

Details on the constituent chemicals of various household products can be found on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Household Products Index.&lt;ref&gt;[http://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov/ Household Products Index], NIH.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''maceral''' is a component, organic in origin, of [[coal]] or [[oil shale]]. The term 'maceral' in reference to coal is analogous to the use of the term '[[mineral]]' in reference to [[igneous]] or [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks. Examples of macerals are [[inertinite]], [[vitrinite]], and [[Exinite|liptinite]].

== Inertinite ==

{{main|Inertinite}}
Inertinite is considered to be the equivalent of charcoal and degraded plant material. It is highly oxidised in nature and may be said to be burnt. A large portion of South Africa's coal reserves consist of inertinite.

== Vitrinite ==

{{main|Vitrinite}}
Vitrinite is shiny, glass-like material that is considered to be composed of cellular plant material such as roots, bark, plant stems and tree trunks. Vitrinite macerals when observed under the microscope show a boxlike, cellular structure, often with oblong voids and cavities which are likely the remains of plant stems. This has a high calorific value (24 - 28 MJ/kg) and a large proportion of volatile matter (24 - 30%). It often occurs interbanded or interlaminated with inertinite and can be recognised as bright bands.

== Liptinite ==

{{main|Liptinite}}
Liptinite macerals are considered to be produced from decayed leaf matter, spores, pollen and algal matter. Resins and plant waxes can also be part of liptinite macerals. Liptinite macerals tend to retain their original plant form, i.e., they resemble plant fossils. These are hydrogen rich and have the highest calorific values of all coal macerals.

Macerals of liptinite are [[sporinite]], [[cutinite]], [[resinite]], [[alginite]] ([[telalginite]] and [[lamalginite]]), [[liptodetrinite]], [[fluorinite]], and [[bituminite]].

==Nature of macerals==

Macerals are considered to be dehydrogenated plant fragments. Evidence for this includes remnant [[pollen]] [[spores]], fossilised leaves, remnant cellular structure and similar. In rare cases, maceral and fossilised pollen can be found in terrestrial sedimentary rocks.

Maceral maturity can be estimated by ''vitrinite reflectance''. This gives information on the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen composition of the coal, and determines the [[coal#Types|type of coal]]: [[lignite]], [[brown coal]], [[bituminous coal]], [[anthracite]] or [[graphite]].

Macerals found in [[kerogen]] source rocks are often observed under the microscope to determine the kerogen maturity of the sedimentary formations. This is a vital component of oil and gas exploration.

Macerals are observed under the [[petrographic microscope]] under reflected light. Coal fragments must be extremely highly polished down to less than half a micrometre before they can be observed under the microscope.

A '''microdensitometer''' is an optical instrument used to measure [[optical density|optical densities]] in the microscopic domain.&lt;ref name=IS&gt;[[Christopher Dainty|J. C. Dainty]] and R. Shaw, ''Image Science'' (Academic, New york, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TPP&gt;T. H. James, ''The Theory of the Photographic Process'' (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TLO&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]], ''Tunable Laser Optics'' (Elsevier Academic, New York, 2003) Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-known microdensitometer, used in the photographic industry, is a granularity instrument or granularity machine.&lt;ref name=TPP /&gt;  The [[granularity]] measurement&lt;ref name=TPP /&gt; involves the use of an optical aperture, 10-50 micrometers in diameter, and in the recording of thousands of [[optical density]] readings.  The standard deviation of this series of measurements is known as the ''granularity''&lt;ref name=TPP /&gt;&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt; of the measured transmission surface, optical film, or [[photographic film]], in particular .

An alternative version to the traditional point-by-point microdensitometer is the [[beam expander|beam expanded]] [[N-slit interferometer|laser microdensitometer]].&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt;&lt;ref name=USP&gt;F. J. Duarte, Electro-optical interferometric microdensitometer system, US Patent 5255069 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  This instrument can illuminate simultaneously an area a few centimeters wide with an ultra thin height, in the micrometer regime.&lt;ref name=USP /&gt;  Advantages include increased depth of focus, significant increases in data collection speed, and superior signal to noise ratios.&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt;&lt;ref name=USP /&gt;   In [[microscopy]] applications, this type of ultra thin beam-expanded illumination can also be known as light sheet illumination or selective plane illumination.

This measurement technique, using ultra-thin [[beam expander|expanded laser beams]], is particularly useful to detect microscopic imperfections in optical coatings or transmission optical surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Duarte, ''Tunable Laser Applications'' (CRC, New York, 2009) Chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic fungi can be classified using three groups:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Lower fungi''' - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s &amp; [[chytridiomycetes]])
* '''Higher fungi''' -filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])
* '''Terrestrial fungi''' - contain appendages of marine fungi ([[trichomycetes]])
The majority of mycoplankton species are higher fungi, found in the [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]] phylums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to fossil records, fungi date back to the late [[Proterozoic]] era, 900-570 million years ago. It is hypothesized that mycoplankton evolved from terrestrial fungi, likely in the [[Paleozoic]] era (390 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marine Fungi: and Fungal-like Organisms|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RcF97cHppPsC|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 2012-08-31|isbn = 9783110264067|first = E. B. Gareth|last = Jones|first2 = Ka-Lai|last2 = Pang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods and pathways of terrestrial fungi's adaption to the marine environment are still under study.

== Biogeochemical Contributions ==

By working with microbial communities, mycoplankton efficiently converts particulate organic matter to dissolved organic matter as part of the [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Marine snow, organic solute plumes, and optimal chemosensory behavior of bacteria|journal = Limnology and Oceanography|date = 2001-09-01|issn = 1939-5590|pages = 1309–1318|volume = 46|issue = 6|doi = 10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1309|first = Thomas|last = Kiørboe|first2 = George A.|last2 = Jackson|citeseerx = 10.1.1.570.5719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria mediate carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other nutrient fluxes in marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Benthic Bacterial and Fungal Productivity and Carbon Turnover in a Freshwater Marsh|url = http://aem.asm.org/content/72/1/596|journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 0099-2240|pmc = 1352256|pmid = 16391096|pages = 596–605|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1128/AEM.72.1.596-605.2006|first = Nanna|last = Buesing|first2 = Mark O.|last2 = Gessner}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that there are higher concentrations of mycoplankton near the surface and in shallow waters, which indicates their connection with the upwelling of organic matter. This further correlates with abundant [[phytoplankton]] communities at the surface, implying that mycoplankton is intimately involved in organic matter consumption in the [[Photic zone|euphotic]] zone.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Distribution and Diversity of Planktonic Fungi in the West Pacific Warm Pool|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0101523.s001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An '''open-access mandate''' is a policy adopted by a research institution, research funder, or government which requires researchers—usually university faculty or research staff and/or research grant recipients—to make their published, [[peer-reviewed]] journal articles and conference papers [[open access]] (1) by [[self-archiving]] their final, peer-reviewed drafts in a freely accessible [[institutional repository]] or [[disciplinary repository]] ("Green OA") or (2) by publishing them in an [[open-access journal]] ("Gold OA")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harnad|first=Stevan|author2=Brody, T. |author3=Vallieres, F. |author4=Carr, L. |author5=Hitchcock, S. |author6=Gingras, Y. |author7=Oppenheim, C. |author8=Stamerjohanns, H. |author9=Hilf, E.  |title=The Access/Impact Problem and the Green and Gold Roads to Open Access|journal=Serials Review|year=2004|volume=30|issue=4|pages=310–314|doi=10.1016/j.serrev.2004.09.013|url=http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Temp/impact.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64cTLhrxg|archivedate=11 January 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinfield|first=Stephen|title=A mandate to self archive?

==Characteristics==

Among the universities that have adopted open-access mandates for faculty are [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University College London]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[University of Minho]] (Portugal), [[University of Liege]] and [[ETH Zürich]].  Among the funding organizations that have adopted open-access mandates for grant recipients are [[National Institutes of Health]] (with the [[NIH Public Access Policy]]), [[Research Councils UK]],  [[National Fund for Scientific Research]],  [[Wellcome Trust]] and [[European Research Council]]. For a full index of institutional and funder open-access mandates adopted to date, see the [[ROARMAP|Registry of Open Access Mandatory Archiving Policies (ROARMAP)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://roarmap.eprints.org/ Registry of Open Access Mandatory Archiving Policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-access mandates can be classified in many ways: by the type of mandating organization (employing institution or research funder), by the locus (institutional or institution-external) and timing of [[self-archiving|deposit]] itself (immediate, delayed), by the time  (immediate, delayed) at which the deposit is made open access, and by whether or not there is a default copyright-retention contract (and whether it can be waived). Mandate types can also be compared for strength and effectiveness (in terms of the annual volume, proportion and timing of deposits, relative to total annual article output, as well as the time that access to the deposit is set as open access.&lt;ref&gt;Gargouri, Y., Lariviere, V., Gingras, Y., Brody, T., Carr, L., &amp; Harnad, S. (2012). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.8174 Testing the Finch Hypothesis on Green OA Mandate Ineffectiveness]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1210.8174&lt;/ref&gt; Mandates are classified and ranked by some of these properties in MELIBEA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesoabierto.net/politicas/default.php MELIBEA directory and comparator of institutional open-access policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional and funder mandates===
Universities can adopt open-access mandates for their faculty. All such mandates make allowances for special cases.&lt;ref name="Suber 2012 87"/&gt; Tenured faculty cannot be required to publish; nor can they be required to make their publications open access.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=87}}, which cites
:{{cite web |url= http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2009/06/30/university-open-access-policies-as-mandates/ |title=University open-access policies as mandates |first=Stuart |last=Shieber |work=blogs.law.harvard.edu, "The Occasional Pamphlet" |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mandates can take the form of administrative procedures, such as designating repository deposit as the official means of submitting publications for institutional research performance review, or for research grant applications or renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Rentier, B., &amp; Thirion, P. (2011). [http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/102031 The Liège ORBi model: Mandatory policy without rights retention but linked to assessment processes].&lt;/ref&gt; Many European university mandates have taken the form of administrative requirements, whereas many U.S. university mandates have taken the form of a unanimous or near-unanimous self-imposed faculty consensus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a default rights-retention contract (together with a waiver option for individual special cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research funders such as government funding agencies or private foundations can adopt open-access mandates as contractual conditions for receiving funding.&lt;ref name="Suber 2012 87"/&gt;

===Principal kinds of open-access mandates===
"Mandate" can mean either "authorize" or "oblige". Both senses are important in inducing researchers to provide  OA. Open-access advocate [[Peter Suber]] has remarked that "'mandate' is not a good word..." for open-access policies, "...but neither is any other English word."&lt;ref name="Suber 2012 87"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways to describe a mandate include "shifting the default publishing practice to open access" in the case of university faculty or "putting an open-access condition" on grant recipients.&lt;ref name="Suber 2012 88"/&gt; Mandates are stronger than policies which either request or encourage open access, because they require that authors provide open access. Some mandates allow the author to opt out if they give reasons for doing so.&lt;ref name="Suber 2012 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Encouragement policies'' - These are not requirements but merely recommendations to provide open access.
*''Loophole mandates'' - These require authors to provide open access if and when their publishers allow it.

Mandates may include the following clauses:

*''Mandates with a limited-embargo clause'' - These require authors to provide open access either immediately or, at the latest, after a maximal permissible embargo period (which may vary from 6 months to 12 months or more).
*''Mandates with an immediate-deposit clause'' - These require authors to deposit their refereed final drafts in their [[institutional repository]] immediately upon publication (or upon acceptance for publication) whether or not their publishing contracts allow making the deposit open access immediately: If the publisher embargoes open access, access to the deposit can be left as ''closed access'' during any permissible embargo period. (For closed-access deposits repositories have a request-a-copy Button with which users can request and authors can provide a single copy with one click each during the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, A., Couture, M., Rodrigues, E., Carr, L. and Harnad, S. (2012) [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/18511/ Open Access Mandates and the "Fair Dealing" Button'. In: ''Dynamic Fair Dealing: Creating Canadian Culture Online'' (Rosemary J. Coombe &amp; Darren Wershler, Eds.) ]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*''Mandates with a rights-retention clause'' - These policies typically extend to the parent institution a non-exclusive license to exercise any and all copyrights in the article. Copyright remains with the author until they transfer copyright to a publisher, at which point the non-exclusive license survives. In so doing, authors are free to publish wherever they prefer, while granting the institution the right to post a version of the article on the open web via an institutional repository. The benefit of the rights-retention clause is that neither the author, nor the institution, need negotiate open access with the publisher; the policy itself allows open access to the article. Upon acceptance or publication, the author or their representative deposits the article into their institutional repository. Waivers are generally available in cases where authors do not desire open access for a given article.

===Locus of deposit===
Most institutional open-access mandates require that authors [[self archive]] their papers in their own [[institutional repository]]. Some funder mandates specify institutional deposit, some specify institution-external deposit, and some allow either.

===Timing of deposit===
Mandates may require deposit immediately upon publication (or acceptance for publication) or after an allowable embargo.

===Timing of opening access to deposit===
Mandates may require opening access to the deposit immediately upon publication (or acceptance for publication) or after an allowable embargo.

==Instances==

=== Canadian funding agencies ===
The [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR) proposed a mandate in 2006 and adopted it in September 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=Canadian%20Institutes%20of%20Health%20Research%20%28CIHR%29 OA Self-Archiving Policy: Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)]. Eprints.org (2007-01-04). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first North American public research funder to do so. The CIHR Policy on Access to Research Outputs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/32005.html CIHR Policy on Access to Research Outputs – CIHR]. Cihr-irsc.gc.ca. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; provides two options to researchers: publication in open access journals, and making their manuscripts available in an online central ([[PubMed Central Canada]] is recommended) or institutional repository.

In October 2013, the two other Canadian federal funding agencies, the National Science and Engineering Council (NSERC) and the [[Social Science and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC) jointly proposed the same mandate as CIHR's, and launched a two-month consultation on what will become the Tri-Agency Open Access Policy.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/policies-politiques/Tri-OA-Policy-Politique-LA-Trois_eng.asp proposal] and the [http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/policies-politiques/OpenAccess-LibreAcces_eng.asp description of the consultation] on NSERC website.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2015 a [[Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=F6765465-1|title=Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications|work=science.gc.ca|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?mthd=tp&amp;crtr.page=2&amp;nid=940979&amp;crtr.tp1D=1 announcement of the new Tri-Agency Open Access Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer-reviewed journal publications arising from Agency-supported research must be made freely available within 12 months of publication, whether by depositing in an online repository or by publishing in a journal that offers immediate or delayed open access.  The policy is effective for grants awarded from May 1, 2015 onward.

On May 1, 2015 the [[International Development Research Centre]] adopted a new open access policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Misc/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=719|title=IDRC adopts new Open Access Policy|work=idrc.ca|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Books and journal articles must be made freely available within 12 months of publication, whether by publishing open access and using open access journals, or by uploading to an open access repository.  The policy is effective for proposals received on or after July 20, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Misc/Pages/Open-Access-Policy.aspx|title=Open Access Policy for IDRC-Funded Project Outputs|work=idrc.ca|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States funding agencies ===
In May 2006, the US Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA)&lt;ref&gt;http://cornyn.senate.gov/doc_archive/05-02-2006_COE06461_xml.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed toward improving the NIH Public Access Policy.&lt;ref name="Public Access Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicaccess.nih.gov/ |title=Public Access Homepage |publisher=Publicaccess.nih.gov |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides points about making open access mandatory, to which the NIH complied in 2008, it argues to extend self-archiving to the full spectrum of major US-funded research. In addition, the FRPAA would no longer stipulate that the self-archiving must be central; the deposit can now be in the author's own institutional repository (IR). The new U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Public Access Policy took effect in April 2008 and states that "all articles arising from NIH funds must be submitted to PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication".&lt;ref name="Public Access Homepage" /&gt; It stipulates self-archiving in [[PubMed Central]] rather than in the author's own [[institutional repository]]. In 2012, the NIH announced it would enforce its Public Access Policy by blocking the renewal of grant funds to authors who don't follow the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NIH to Begin Enforcing Open-Access Policy on Research It Supports |first=Paul |last=Basken |url=http://chronicle.com/article/NIH-to-Begin-Enforcing/135852/ |newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research bill was introduced into both houses of Congress.

=== European funding agencies ===
In April 2006, the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120519103356/http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/pdf/scientific-publication-study_en.pdf Study on the Economic and Technical Evolution of the Scientific Publication Markets in Europe]. Ec.europa.eu (2009-02-23). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; recommended: "EC Recommendation A1: "Research funding agencies... should [e]stablish a European policy mandating published articles arising from EC-funded research to be available after a given time period in open access archives..." This recommendation has since been updated and strengthened by the European Research Advisory Board (EURAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific publication: policy on open access|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/eurab/pdf/eurab_scipub_report_recomm_dec06_en.pdf|publisher=European Union|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project [[OpenAIRE]] (Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe)  has since been launched.

The global shift towards open access to the results of publicly funded research (publications and data) has been a core strategy in the European Commission to improve knowledge circulation and thus innovation. It is illustrated in particular by the general principle for open access to scientific publications in [[Horizon 2020]] and the pilot for research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf|website=European Commission|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, via a Recommendation, the European Commission encouraged all EU Member States to put publicly funded research results in the public sphere in order to strengthen science and the knowledge-based economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 17 July 2012 on access to and preservation of scientific information|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012H0417&amp;rid=1|website=EUR-Lex|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it emerged that the European Commission are looking to create its own open access publishing platform for papers that emerge from the Horizon 2020 programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-21|title=European Commission Moves Into Publishing|url=https://zenodo.org/record/815016|journal=Zenodo|doi=10.5281/zenodo.815016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banks|first=Michael|date=2017|title=European Commission moves into publishing|url=http://stacks.iop.org/2058-7058/30/i=5/a=10|journal=Physics World|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=6|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/30/5/10|issn=2058-7058|bibcode=2017PhyW...30e...6B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/european-commission-considering-leap-open-access-publishing|title=European Commission considering leap into open-access publishing|last=Enserink|first=Martin|date=2017-03-29|work=Science|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617183616/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/european-commission-considering-leap-open-access-publishing|archive-date=2017-06-17|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/06/08/openaire-can-form-the-basis-for-a-truly-public-european-open-access-platform/|title=OpenAIRE can form the basis for a truly public European Open Access Platform|date=2017-06-08|work=Impact of Social Sciences|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform is likely to be similar to the one used by [[Wellcome Trust]] for Wellcome Open Research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/about|title=How it Works - Wellcome Open Research|website=wellcomeopenresearch.org|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]]'s Gates Open Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gatesopenresearch.org/|title=Gates Open Research|website=gatesopenresearch.org|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Eprint button}}To somewhat improve on the European Commission's (and FRPAA's) allowable embargo of up to six months, EURAB has revised the mandate: all articles must be deposited ''immediately upon acceptance for publication''; the allowable delay for complying with publisher embargoes applies only to the time when access to the deposit must be made open access rather than to the time when it must be deposited. Immediate deposit is required so that individual users can then request an immediate individual copy of any deposited eprint during the embargo period by clicking on a "RequestCopy" Button provided by the  [[Institutional Repository]] software (e.g., [[DSPACE (Open Access)|DSPACE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/RequestCopy|title=RequestCopy|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EPrints]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.eprints.org/w/RequestEprint|title=RequestCopy|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Button automatically sends an email message to the author requesting an individual eprint; the author can comply with one click and the software immediately emails the eprint to the requestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1002.3074 |title=Open Access Mandates and the "Fair Dealing" Button |first1=Arthur |last1=Sale |first2=Marc |last2=Couture |first3=Eloy |last3=Rodrigues |first4=Leslie |last4=Carr |first5=Stevan |last5=Harnad |authorlink5=Stevan Harnad |work=arXiv.org|bibcode=2010arXiv1002.3074S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not open access, but may cover some immediate research needs during any embargo. A related idea was later put forth as the [[Open Access Button]] for papers that have not been deposited in an [[Institutional Repository]] .

==Effectiveness==

[[File:Greenmand60.png|thumb|right|Mandates triple self-archiving rates]]
For the four institutions with the oldest self-archiving mandates, the averaged percentage of green open-access self-archiving has been compared to the percentage for control articles from other institutions published in the same journals (for years 2002–2009, measured in 2011). Open-access mandates triple the percent Green OA (see figure below).&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;Poynder, Richard (2011). [http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/821-Richard-Poynder-Interview-How-Fast-Is-Open-Access-Growing.html Open Access By Numbers] ''Open and Shut'' June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gargouri, Yassine, Larivière, Vincent &amp; Harnad, Stevan (2013) [http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/358882/ Ten-year Analysis of University of Minho Green OA Self-Archiving Mandate] (in E Rodrigues, Ed. )&lt;/ref&gt; Respective totals are derived from the [[Thomson Reuters]] [[Web of Science]].

===Tracking mandates===
As of May 2015, open-access mandates have been adopted by over 550 universities and research institutions, and over 140 research funders worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROARMAP - Home|url=http://roarmap.eprints.org/|work=ROARMAP: Registry of Open Access Repositories Mandatory Archiving Policies|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of universities which have open-access mandates are [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OA Self-Archiving Policy: Harvard University: Faculty of Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=Harvard%20University%3A%20Faculty%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences|publisher=eprints.org|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Faculty Open-Access Policy|url=http://roarmap.eprints.org/122/|publisher=ROARMAP|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States and [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OA Self-Archiving Policy: University College London (UCL)|url=http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=University%20College%20London%20%28UCL%29|publisher=eprints.org|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ETH Zürich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OA Self-Archiving Policy: ETH Zürich|url=http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=ETH%20Zürich|publisher=eprints.org|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the European Union. Funders which require open access when their funding recipients publish include the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] in the US and [[Research Councils UK|RCUK]] and [[European Research Council|ERC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OA Self-Archiving Policy: European Research Council (ERC)|url=http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=European%20Research%20Council%20%28ERC%29|publisher=eprints.org|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the EU. Mandate policy models and guidance have been provided by the [[Open Society Institute]]'s EPrints Handbook,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927041923/http://www.eprints.org/documentation/handbook/universities.php]&lt;/ref&gt; EOS,&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt; OASIS&lt;ref name="oasis"/&gt; and Open Access Archivangelism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Green OA Mandate Is Optimal?|url=http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/494-guid.html|publisher=Open Access Archivangelism|accessdate=11 January 2012|date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ROARMAP]], the searchable Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies at the [[University of Southampton]] indexes the world's institutional, funder and governmental OA mandates (and the Open Access Scholarly Information Sourcebook (OASIS)&lt;ref name="oasis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutional Policies|url=http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=338|publisher=Open Access Scholarly Information Sourcebook|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as EnablingOpenScholarship (EOS)&lt;ref name="eos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Access policies for universities and research institutions|url=http://www.openscholarship.org/jcms/c_6226/open-access-policies-for-universities-and-research-institutions?hlText=policie|publisher=EnablingOpenScholarship|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; graph the quarterly outcome). [[SHERPA/JULIET]] is a [[SHERPA]] service which lists funder mandates only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About JULIET - Research funders' open access policies|url=http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/index.php?la=en&amp;mode=simple&amp;page=about|work=SHERPA/JULIET|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international cross-disciplinary surveys conducted by Swan (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swan|first=Alma|author2=Brown, Sheridan|title=Open access self-archiving: An Introduction|journal=[[Jisc|JISC]], [[HEFCE]]|year=2005|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11006/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority of researchers respond that they would self archive willingly if their institutions or funders mandated it. Outcome studies by Sale (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sale|first=AHJ|title=The acquisition of open access research articles|journal=First Monday|year=2006|volume=11|issue=10|url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/388/|doi=10.5210/fm.v11i10.1409}}&lt;/ref&gt; have confirmed these survey results. Both mandated and unmandated institutional and disciplinary repositories worldwide are indexed by [[SHERPA]]'s ''[[OpenDOAR]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendoar.org/ Directory of Open Access Repositories]&lt;/ref&gt; and their rate of growth is monitored and displayed by the University of Southampton's [[Registry of Open Access Repositories]] (''ROAR'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://roar.eprints.org/ Registry of Open Access Repositories]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have tested which mandate conditions are most effective in generating deposit. The three most important conditions identified were: (1)  immediate deposit required, (2) deposit required for performance evaluation, and (3) unconditional opt-out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt-out allowed for the deposit requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent-Lamarre, Philippe, Boivin, Jade, Gargouri, Yassine, Larivière, Vincent and Harnad, Stevan (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3327">[[File:StressEnergyTensor contravariant.svg|thumb|250px|right|The stress–energy tensor of a perfect fluid contains only the diagonal components.]]
In [[physics]], a '''perfect fluid''' is a [[fluid]] that can be completely characterized by its rest frame [[mass density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; and ''isotropic'' [[pressure]] ''p''.

Real fluids are "sticky" and contain (and conduct) heat. Perfect fluids are idealized models in which these possibilities are neglected.  Specifically, perfect fluids have no [[shear stress]]es, [[viscosity]], or [[heat conduction]].

In space-positive [[metric signature]] tensor notation, the [[stress–energy tensor]] of a perfect fluid can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \left( \rho_m + \frac{p}{c^2} \right) \, U^\mu U^\nu + p \, \eta^{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''U'' is the [[Four-vector#Four-velocity|4-velocity]] [[vector field]] of the fluid and where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu \nu} = \operatorname{diag}(-1,1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; is the metric tensor of [[Minkowski spacetime]].

In time-positive [[metric signature]] tensor notation, the [[stress–energy tensor]] of a perfect fluid can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \left( \rho_\text{m} + \frac{p}{c^2} \right) \, U^\mu U^\nu - p \, \eta^{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''U'' is the 4-velocity of the fluid and where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu \nu} = \operatorname{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)&lt;/math&gt; is the metric tensor of [[Minkowski spacetime]]

This takes on a particularly simple form in the rest frame
:&lt;math&gt; \left[ \begin{matrix} \rho_e &amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;p&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;p&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p\end{matrix} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{e} = \rho_\text{m} c^2&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[energy density]]'' and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the ''pressure'' of the fluid.


Perfect fluids admit a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian formulation]], which allows the techniques used in [[Field (physics)|field theory]], in particular, [[quantization (physics)|quantization]], to be applied to fluids.  This formulation can be generalized, but unfortunately, heat conduction and anisotropic stresses cannot be treated in these generalized formulations.{{why|date=December 2013}}

Perfect fluids are used in [[general relativity]] to model idealized distributions of [[matter]], such as the interior of a star or an isotropic universe. In the latter case, the [[equation of state]] of the perfect fluid may be used in [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] equations to describe the evolution of the universe.

In [[general relativity]], the expression for the [[stress–energy tensor]] of a perfect fluid is written as
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \left( \rho_m + \frac{p}{c^2} \right) \, U^\mu U^\nu + p \, g^{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''U'' is the [[Four-vector#Four-velocity|4-velocity]] [[vector field]] of the fluid and where &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the metric, 
written with a space-positive signature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">'''Photosynthetic capacity''' ('''A&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a measure of the maximum rate at which leaves are able to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]] during [[photosynthesis]]. It is typically measured as the amount of carbon dioxide that is fixed per metre squared per second, for example as μmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Limitations ==
Photosynthetic capacity is limited by carboxylation capacity and electron transport capacity. For example, in high carbon dioxide concentrations or in low light, the plant is not able to regenerate [[ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate]] fast enough (also known RUBP, the acceptor molecule in photosynthetic carbon reduction). So in this case, photosynthetic capacity is limited by electron transport of the light reaction, which generates the NADPH and ATP required for the PCR (Calvin) Cycle, and regeneration of RUBP. On the other hand, in low carbon dioxide concentrations, the capacity of the plant to perform [[carboxylation]] (adding carbon dioxide to [[RuBisCO|Rubisco]]) is limited by the amount of available carbon dioxide, with plenty of Rubsico left over.¹ Light response, or photosynthesis-irradiance, curves display these relationships.

== Current Research ==
Recent studies have shown that photosynthetic capacity in leaves can be increased with an increase in the number of [[stoma]]ta per leaf. This could be important in further crop development engineering to increase the photosynthetic efficiency through increasing diffusion of carbon dioxide into the plant.²

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''plate trick''', also known as  '''[[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]'s string trick''',  the '''belt trick''', or the '''Balinese cup trick''', is any of several demonstrations of the idea that rotating an object with strings attached to it by 360 degrees does not return the system to its original state, while a second rotation of 360 degrees, a total rotation of 720 degrees, does.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1778.pdf retrieved September 6, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, it is a demonstration of the theorem that [[SU(2)]] (which [[double cover (topology)|double-covers]] [[SO(3)]]) is [[Simply connected space|simply connected]]. To say that SU(2) double-covers SO(3) essentially means that the unit [[quaternion]]s represent the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations twice over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis610/geombchap8.pdf Retrieved September 9th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demonstrations ==

One way of doing the trick is to rest a small plate flat on the palm, then perform two rotations of one's hand while keeping the plate upright, ending in the original position. The hand makes one rotation passing over its shoulder, twisting the arm, and then another rotation passing under, untwisting it.

There is a [[Balinese candle dance]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20140203"&gt;{{Citation |title=Pandanggo sa ilaw - Candle Dance |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gf8Xa0N2yk }}&lt;/ref&gt; where an open cup of liquid is held instead of a plate. Since the feet can remain fixed during the manoeuvre, but the hand rotates twice, and all the arm and shoulder and other body segments smoothly connect the feet to the hand and undergo the intermediate rotations, then the rotation loops that each segment undergoes are progressively collapsed as one progresses from the hand along the arm to the shoulder, torso, legs and finally the feet, which represent the collapse of the loop to a point, since they did not rotate. Similarly, for the belt version of the trick, the buckle rotates twice, but the opposite end of the belt remains fixed, and all along the rest of the belt are the progressively collapsing rotation loops from buckle to fixed end.

[[Twirling|Figure-eight twirling]] used in [[baton twirling]], staff twirling in [[martial art]]s, and [[swordsmanship]], provides a similar demonstration. Here it is also fairly easy and natural to collapse the motion of the hand progressively down through a wiggle to a stationary position, providing an additional, and perhaps more intuitive demonstration that the double rotation loop can be collapsed to a point.

In [[mathematical physics]], the trick illustrates the quaternionic mathematics behind the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of [[spinor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-strange-numbers-that-birthed-modern-algebra-20180906/ Retrieved September 9 2018&lt;/ref&gt; As with the plate trick, these particles' spins return to their original state only after two full rotations, not after one.

===The belt trick===
[[File:Belt Gürtel.jpg|thumb|Leather belt with frame buckle]]
The same phenomenon can be demonstrated using a leather belt with an ordinary [[belt buckle|frame buckle]], whose prong serves as a pointer. The end opposite the buckle is clamped so it cannot move. The belt is extended without a twist and the buckle is kept horizontal while being turned clockwise one complete turn (360°), as evidenced by watching the prong. The belt will then appear twisted, and no maneuvering of the buckle that keeps it horizontal and pointed in the same direction can undo the twist. Obviously a 360° turn counterclockwise would undo the twist. The surprise element of the trick is that a second 360° turn in the clockwise direction, while apparently making the belt even more twisted, does allow the belt to be returned to its untwisted state by maneuvering the buckle under the clamped end while always keeping the buckle horizontal and pointed in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/dirac-belt/DiracBelt.html Retrieved September 9 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mathematically, the belt serves as a record, as one moves along it, of how the buckle was transformed from its original position, with the belt untwisted, to its final rotated position. The clamped end always represents the null rotation. The trick demonstrates that a path in rotation space (SO3) that produces a 360 degree rotation is not homotopy equivalent to a null rotation, but a path that produces a double rotation (720°) is null equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1778v2.pdf Understanding Quaternions and the Dirac Belt Trick],

A fictional extension of the belt trick appears in [[Ian McEwan]]'s novel ''[[Solar (novel)|Solar]]'' as a plot device to explain the protagonist's Nobel prize work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Project Alpha''' was an elaborate [[hoax]] that began in 1979 and ended with its deliberate disclosure in 1983. It was orchestrated by the [[stage magic]]ian and [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]]. It involved planting two fake [[psychic]]s, [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] (now better known as [[Banachek]]) and Michael Edwards,&lt;!-- this Michael Edwards is neither of the people with this name having a Wikipedia article as of March 2006--&gt; into a [[parapsychology]] (PSI) research project at [[Washington University]]. Introduced to the researchers during the initial stages of the program, the young men convinced the researchers that their psychic powers were real. With spoon bending demonstrated, the lab ran a long series of experiments to test the range of their abilities, involving everything from moving objects in sealed globes, to changing electronic clocks, to making images appear on unexposed film.

After over a year of such tests, the lab began to prepare papers for presentation at a major parapsychology meeting in Syracuse in August 1981. In July 1981, Randi leaked statements about the project at a magician's meeting in Pittsburgh. The August meeting was dominated by discussions of the experiments and Randi's role; opinions were sharply divided about what was actually happening. Randi presented a critique of the lab's videotapes, pointing out obvious fakery. When the team returned to the lab and ran a number of the experiments with tighter controls, all indications of PSI powers disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1995|pp=356–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the lab largely ended their involvement with the two, quoting "meager results." Other researchers were happy to continue working with them, and for the next year they travelled about and were engaged in a wide variety of experiments. Many glowing reports were published in various journals and magazines.

In early 1983, Randi called a press conference at the offices of ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, ostensibly to announce the first example of true psychic abilities. When introducing the two, Randi casually asked how it all worked. Edwards replied "To be quite honest, we cheat", resulting in gasps from the assembled reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title= James Randi and Project Alpha |medium=video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1S5CRcqJQo |time=2:30 |quote="To be quite honest, we cheat."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fallout was immediate; the Washington lab was shut down shortly thereafter. One PSI researcher claimed that "Randi has set back the field 100 years!" To which Randi responded that they were the ones who tried to set back the study of parapsychology, but he "brought it into the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Honest Liar]]'', a 2014 film documentary by Left Turn Films; Pure Mutt Productions; Part2 Filmworks. (The quoted remarks commence at 59 min, 37 sec.)&lt;/ref&gt; Others came to believe Randi and the lead researcher, Philips, were conspiring to discredit the field, which is widely considered a [[pseudoscience]].

Following Project Alpha, Randi went on to use variations of the technique on several other occasions. Perhaps the most famous example led to the downfall of [[TV evangelist]] and [[faith healer]] [[Peter Popoff]], when Randi had a man pose as a woman with uterine cancer, which Popoff happily "cured". In another example, Randi worked with [[performance artist]] José Alvarez, who posed as a [[channeller]] known as "Carlos", who was presented on [[Australia|Australian]] TV and soon had a wide following. After this hoax was exposed, the artist was constantly approached by people who believed him to be genuine, even if he told them directly that he was an actor. Recently, Project Alpha has become the subject of a movie development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dave |last=McNary |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/barry-sonnenfeld-boards-the-amazing-randis-project-alpha-1201451629/ |title= Barry Sonnenfeld Boards the Amazing Randi's 'Project Alpha' |website=Variety |date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peter Phillips' experiments ==
During the 1970s, [[James S. McDonnell]], board chairman of [[McDonnell Douglas]] and believer in the paranormal, began to give grants to a number of researchers who were working in the PSI field. Looking for a more substantial effort, he approached his home town's [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] with plans to set up a permanent PSI research facility. At first his overtures were rebuffed, but eventually [[physicist]] Peter Phillips, who was also interested in the field, agreed to lead up a parapsychology lab at the school. In 1979, McDonnell arranged a $500,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] grant for the establishment and five years operation of the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research.

The formation of the lab was relatively well reported, and Philips was often on-camera explaining their efforts. He was most interested in [[spoon bending]] by children, also known as "psychokinetic metal bending", or PKMB. In response to these stories, James Randi wrote to the lab with a list of 11 "caveats" they should be wary of, and his suggestions on how to avoid them.&lt;ref name="skeptics"&gt;

These included a rigid adherence to the protocol of the test, so that the subjects would not be allowed to change it in the midst of the run. This had been the [[modus operandi]] of [[Uri Geller]] while being tested at [[Stanford Research Institute]]; whenever something did not work, he simply did something else instead. The researchers then reported this as a success, when in fact the original test had failed. Other suggestions included having only one object of study at any time, permanently marking the object or objects used so they could not be switched, and having as few people in the room as possible to avoid distractions. Randi also offered his services to watch the experiments as a control, noting that a [[Evocation|conjurer]] would be an excellent person to look for fakery. Phillips did not take Randi up on the offer because of the skeptic's reputation of being "a showman rather than an unprejudiced critic" and his perceived hostility towards psychic claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1995|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters, Randi even told the researchers that the subjects were fake, but the researchers did not check out their backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early phases of the project, many people claiming to have psychic powers presented themselves to the lab. The vast majority quickly proved to have no such ability, or, just as commonly, used [[sleight of hand]] to make their "abilities" work. Many of these were convinced what they were doing was "real". However, after a short while it became apparent that two young men, Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards, were much more successful, and the lab started to focus their energies on them. In fact, the two young men were "plants", friends of Randi whom he had met some time before as part of his magician's trade. Part of Randi's instructions to these men was to tell the truth if they were ever asked whether they were faking the results; they were never asked this question directly. The researchers assumed that the participants would have no qualms about lying in their answer to a straightforward question if they were also lying about their abilities.&lt;ref name="Thalbourne 1995 357"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1995|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards ==
[[File:MikeEdwards.jpg|thumb|Mike Edwards]]

Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at the time Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the researchers with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary to one of the caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred.&lt;ref name="skeptics" /&gt; In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.&lt;ref name="skeptics" /&gt;

Because the studio was set up to allow people in front of the camera to see themselves on monitors, and the videotapes were available to be watched by anyone, the two used the video to critique their own performance. They would deliberately fail on their first attempt at any given demonstration, and then use the video to find out what was visible to the researchers and what was not. They would then develop a technique that would not appear on video. Edwards found that one particular camera operator was on guard to capture any attempts at sleight of hand, so he picked the man to assist him in one experiment, and he was replaced by a less competent cameraman. This was also a clear violation of one of Randi's caveats; the test run should have been stopped at this point and recorded as a failure.

The two were so successful at spoon bending that several other tests were invented. In one they were given pictures in sealed envelopes and then asked to try to identify them from a list shown to them later. The two were left alone in a room with the envelopes, and although there was a possibility that they would peek, this was supposed to be controlled by examining the envelopes later. The envelopes were held closed with four staples, which they simply pried open with their fingernails, looked at the picture, and then resealed by inserting the staples back into the same holes and forcing them closed by pressing them against the table.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Randi|1983a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Randi|1983a|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another test was electronic; they were asked to influence the burnout point of a common [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were simply [[palming]] the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down on one end of the fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] effects.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Randi|1983a" /&gt;

In one instance, Shaw and Edwards were asked to move small objects in a sealed transparent globe, normally small bits of paper balanced on an edge. At first they were unable to get anything to happen, but later noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced a small gap under one edge, which they could blow into to cause the paper to move.

Other examples included their ability to make digital clocks stop working properly (Edwards put it in a microwave oven for a few seconds), or make images appear on film just by staring at the camera (Shaw spat on the lens).&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Randi|1983a"/&gt; In an example of a sort of [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]] test, the experimenters later described the images as being various bits of the female anatomy, which, "of course", young men (such as Shaw and Edwards) would be interested in.&lt;ref name="skeptics" /&gt;

In one particular experiment, Shaw tried to get them to say on film that he was not allowed to touch the object he was supposed to bend in the experiment (he had already secretly done that, and with them affirming that he could not and had not touched it, the "miracle" would look even greater). When Shaw asked: "Can I touch it?", the reply was, to his surprise: "You do what you have to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donahoo|first1=Refugio|title=The Esoteric Codex: Paranormal Hoaxes|date=15 October 2015|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=978-1329624108|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers explain these apparently inexcusable inadequacies in experimental protocols by drawing a clear distinction between two different stages of an investigation: the exploratory, informal experiments and the formal experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1995|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exploratory phase, the researchers would simply be trying to determine whether there is a phenomenon that could be worth further investigation, which often implies the use of much more complicated protocols and expensive equipment. In doing so, they are also trying to set up a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere that is believed to be conducive to psychic phenomena. It is during this stage that Shaw and Edwards were able to convince the researchers of psychic abilities

== Revelation and aftermath ==

In mid-1981, the two were fairly famous in the psi world, and even outside it, and Phillips decided to release a research brief at a workshop of the Parapsychological Association Convention (August 1981). According to the researchers' official version, Phillips also wrote to Randi to ask for a tape of fake metal-bending, which was to be shown alongside the recording of Shaw and Edwards. The researchers were looking for opinions and critical input from the parapsychology community and finally released a revised abstract that reflected the received criticism in its conservative and skeptical language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1995|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcements in the press, Randi wrote to the lab again and stated that it was entirely possible the two were [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], using common sleight of hand to fool the researchers.

Randi started to leak stories that the two were a plant of his.  These stories reached the lab, but they were not taken seriously on the grounds that (1) it seemed hard to believe that a plot could have been carried out so consistently by Randi and the two young magicians for 21 months, and (2) there was not precedent known of such a plot ever being carried out by a skeptic. The story had been widely circulated by the time the meeting was held the next month. Reactions were varied; some thought it was simply a lie, others that Randi was pulling off a hoax, and still others concluded the entire experiment was dreamed up as a conspiracy by Randi and Phillips to discredit the field.

Upon returning from the meeting, Phillips immediately changed the test protocols. The two found that they were no longer able to fool the experimenters so easily, and in most cases, not at all. During this time the lab started releasing additional reports that seriously toned down the success rate. In their own words, "We did not conclude that they must be frauds, but only that after extensive testing, they were not behaving nearly as psychically as they had led us to expect."&lt;ref name="Thalbourne 1995 358"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1995|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement of protocols later led James Randi to list a "straight spoon" award to Phillips in a press release of his "bent spoon" awards, but that award was omitted from the list of awards published by [[Omni Magazine|''Omni'' magazine]] and the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''; it was reported in the latter in a subsequent letter to the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalbourne|1984-85|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point Shaw and Edwards were so famous that they were asked to travel widely and present their powers. Many other psi investigators interviewed the two and gave glowing reviews, thus tainting themselves in the eventual aftermath.

Randi decided to end the project and announced the entire affair in [[Discover Magazine|''Discover'' magazine]]. Many of the researchers who endorsed Shaw and Edwards after the August meeting were now burned in the process. One went so far as to claim that the young men really did have psychic powers, and that they were now lying about being magicians. The bad press was so widespread that the McDonnell Lab was shut down.

The ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' revealed that Shaw was a fake psychic in their fall 1980 issue. At the time neither the authors (McBurney and Greenberg) nor the editor ([[Kendrick Frazier]]) knew that Shaw was part of Project Alpha.  Shaw had, in fact, posed as a fake psychic prior to Project Alpha, and his high-school paper ran a story about his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cummings|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rumors that the psychics were fake reached the researchers, but they didn't believe them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rumor seemed unlikely to be true for several reasons: the two young men came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months. What critic would be so persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? There seemed to be no precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.&lt;ref name="Thalbourne 1995 357"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The complaint of psi investigators for years had been that they did not have enough funding for their experiments. However, in Randi's opinion it was not funding but the experimenters that were the problem. With $500,000 from McDonnell, Randi felt that lack of funding could no longer be blamed for any failure. Randi's purpose was to show that no matter how much money was spent, there would still be no reliable results.

Some within the parapsychology community were outraged, with Berthold Schwarz declaring: "Randi has set parapsychology back 100 years!" Randi's approach also raised outcries concerning ethical considerations and doubts about positive effects on methodology awareness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Broad|1983|}}&lt;/ref&gt; both within the parapsychology and the skeptic communities.  But Randi reports that other parapsychology researchers have contacted him with praise, describing the project as "splendid and deserved", "an important sanitary service", "commendable", and "long-needed".

Even decades later, Project Alpha remains one of the talking points in the PSI field. A 2011 biography of Michael Thalbourne, one of the Mac-Lab experimenters, dismisses the entire affair thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;James Randi, who sought to discredit Mac-Lab staff just to prove some vague point. He had two of his poorly trained magicians infiltrate the lab so they could indulge in deceptive practices that included cheating and all manner of fraud. Needless to say, this reprehensible behaviour was detected, and no published works ever emerged from Randi’s farcical escapade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storm|first1=Lance|title=2011 Outstanding Contribution Award Winner: Michael Thalbourne|journal=Mindfield Bulletin|date=7 November 2011|url=http://www.parapsych.org/articles/29/123/2011_outstanding_contribution.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

NASA's new [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) and [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] programs will allow for beyond [[low-Earth orbit]] spaceflight. There are a number of notional, proposed missions for the programs, none of which are confirmed. Some of these mission concepts include:&lt;ref name="MarsRoadmap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/01/sls-exploration-roadmap-pointing-dual-mars-approach/|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com |accessdate=26 January 2012 |author=Chris Bergin |date=24 January 2012 |title=SLS Exploration Roadmap evaluations provide clues for human Mars missions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LunarRoadmap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/12/building-roadmap-sls-con-ops-lays-leolunar-options/ |title=Building the Roadmap for SLS – Con Ops lays out the LEO/Lunar Options |publisher=NASASpaceflight.com |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2012 |author=Chris Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/02/sls-dod-market-secondary-payloads-potential/ |title=SLS interest in DoD launch market and Secondary Payloads potential |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA_Exploration_Roadmap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/03/nasa-exploration-roadmap-return-moons-surface-documented/ |title=NASA Exploration Roadmap: A return to the Moon’s surface documented |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lunar missions==
[[File:Orion visiting Deep Space Gateway.jpg|thumb|Various components of the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway will be launched on SLS together with Orion.]]

===Exploration Mission 1===
{{main|Exploration Mission 1}}
The Exploration Mission 1 will be the first mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] on the [[Space Launch System]], planned for June 2020. It will spend approximately 3 weeks in space, including 6 days in a [[retrograde orbit]] around the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="Nov15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-ins-and-outs-of-nasa-s-first-launch-of-sls-and-orion |title=The Ins and Outs of NASA's First Launch of SLS and Orion |publisher=[[NASA]] |editor-first=Daniel |editor-last=Huot |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is planned to be followed by [[Exploration Mission 2]] in 2023.

===Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway===

{{main|Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway}}
The [[Exploration Mission 2]] is scheduled to be the first crewed mission of NASA's [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] on the SLS, which will transport the power and propulsion module for the [[Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway]] in lunar orbit. Exploration Missions 2 through 8 would complete the assembly of the Gateway Space Station.&lt;ref name="Insider20170401"&gt;{{cite news |last=Godwin |first=Curt |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/nasa/nasa-human-spaceflight-plans-focus-announcement-deep-space-gateway/ |title=NASA's human spaceflight plans come into focus with announcement of Deep Space Gateway |newspaper=Spaceflight Insider |date=April 1, 2017 |accessdate=2017-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Gebhardt |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/09/sls-manifest-phobos-mars-2039/ |title=SLS manifest options aim for Phobos prior to 2039 Mars landing |website=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-announces-next-steps-on-journey-to-mars-progress-on-asteroid-initiative |title=NASA Announces Progress on Asteroid Initiative &amp;#124; NASA |website=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Earth orbit Orion missions==

[[File:Orion_and_Mars_Transfer_Vehicle_in_Martian_orbit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Artist's rendering of the proposed Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV) "Searcher" that would incorporate [[Nuclear thermal rocket|NTR]] propulsion and [[Transhab|inflatable habitat technology]]. A crewed [[Orion MPCV]] is docked on the right.]]

===2033 Forward Work Martian Moon Phobos/Deimos===
This is a crewed [[flexible path]] mission to one of the Martian moons, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] or  [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. It would include 40 days in the vicinity of Mars and a return Venus flyby.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===2037–2039 Forward Work Mars Landing===
This would be a crewed mission, with four to six astronauts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Bergin |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/10/nasa-con-ops-baseline-slsorion-mission-mars/ |title=NASA Con Ops Assess Baseline Features for SLS/Orion Mission to Mars |website=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=2013-10-06 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a semi-permanent habitat for at least 540 days on the surface of [[Mars]] in 2033 or 2045. The mission would include in-orbit assembly, with the launch of seven SLS Block 2 heavy-lift vehicles (HLVs). The seven HLV payloads, three of which would contain nuclear propulsion modules, would be assembled in LEO into three separate vehicles for the journey to Mars; one cargo [[In-Situ Resource Utilization]] Mars Lander Vehicle (MLV) created from two HLV payloads, one Habitat MLV created from two HLV payloads and a crewed Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV), known as "Copernicus", assembled from three HLV payloads launched a number of months later. [[Nuclear Thermal Rocket]] engines such as the [[NERVA|Pewee]] of [[Project Rover]] were selected in the [[Mars Semi-Direct|Mars Design Reference Architecture]] (DRA) study as they met mission requirements being the preferred propulsion option because it uses proven technology, has higher performance, lower launch mass, creates a versatile vehicle design, offers simple assembly, and has growth potential. A [[Safe Affordable Fission Engine|nuclear reactor serving as the power source]] for [[Ion propulsion]] was also an alternative option, in the case NTRs were not available.&lt;ref name="MarsRoadmap" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/09/nasa-considers-sls-launch-sequence-mars-missions-2030s/|title=NASA considers SLS launch sequence for human Mars missions in the 2030s |website=NASASpaceFlight.com|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120003776_2012004085.pdf |title=Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP): A Proven Growth Technology for Human NEO / Mars Exploration Missions|website=Ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other proposed missions==
===2024 single launch Mars sample-return===
This is a crewed flight with a [[telerobotic]] [[Mars sample return mission]] proposed by NASA's [[Mars Program Planning Group]]. The time frame suggests SLS-5, a 105&amp;nbsp;t rocket to deliver an Orion capsule, a [[solar electric propulsion]] (SEP) robotic rover, and a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). "Sample canister could be captured, inspected, encased and retrieved [[telerobotics|tele-robotically]]. Robot brings sample back and rendezvous with a crew vehicle." The mission may also include a Mars orbiter with [[solar electric propulsion]].&lt;ref name="2024 MSR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/nasa-interest-2024-mars-sample-return-sls-orion/ |title=NASA interest in 2024 Mars Sample Return Mission using SLS and Orion |website=NASASpaceFlight.com |author=Chris Bergin |date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sample return missions from the outer planets===
Concepts for sample return missions to [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] are also being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/nasa-payload-fairings-options-multi-mission-sls-capability/|title=NASA interested in payload fairing options for multi-mission SLS capability|website=NASASpaceFlight.com|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skylab II===
{{main|Skylab II}}
[[File:Skylab II Drawing.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|One section of the [[Skylab II]] Habitat would be made from the SLS Block 2 upper-stage hydrogen tank, similar to but larger than Skylab. A unique use for the SLS as no other vehicle is presently being designed with an 8-meter-diameter upper stage tank.]]
Skylab II, proposal by Brand Griffin, an engineer with Gray Research Inc working with NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to use the upper stage hydrogen tank from SLS to build a 21st-century version of [[Skylab]] for future NASA missions to asteroids, Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point]]-2 (EML2) and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/private-spaceflight/skylab-ii-living-beyond-the-dark-side-of-the-moon-130414.htm |title=Skylab II:Living Beyond the Dark Side of the Moon |author=Markus Hammonds |publisher=Discovery |date=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/03/dsh-module-concepts-outlined-beo-exploration/|title=Deep Space Habitat module concepts outlined for BEO exploration |website=NASASpaceFlight.com|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_10_22_2012_p34-507657.xml |title=NASA Deep-Space Program Gaining Focus |author=Frank Morring, Jr. |publisher=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |date=22 October 2012|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near Earth Object missions===
Five [[near Earth object]] (NEO) mission concepts have been suggested, ranging from minimum to full capabilities. Among these are two near Earth object missions suggested for in 2026. A 155-day mission to NEO [[1999 AO10]], a 304-day mission to NEO 2001 GP2, a 490-day mission to a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] such as [[2000 SG344]], utilizing two Block 1B SLS vehicles,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marshall Murphy |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/09/nasa-evaluate-yearlong-asteroid-mission/ |title=NASA managers evaluate yearlong deep space asteroid mission |website=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Boeing-proposed NEO mission to NEA 2008 EV5 in 2024. The latter would start from the proposed Earth-Moon L2 based [[Exploration Gateway Platform]]. Utilising an SLS third stage the trip would take about 100 days to arrive at the asteroid, 30 days for exploration, and a 235-day return trip to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/long-duration-iss-crew-foundations-beo-missions/|title=Long duration ISS crew to lay the foundations for BEO missions |website=NASASpaceFlight.com|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Altitude Venus Operational Concept===
{{main|High Altitude Venus Operational Concept}}
This is a crewed Venus mission concept using two SLS Block 1B launches to send a crew of 2 to explore the atmosphere of Venus for 1 month, with retrieval in Earth orbit by a commercial crew vehicle or an Orion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0az7DEwG68A|title=A way to explore Venus|first=|last=NASA Langley Research Center|date=October 10, 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacd.larc.nasa.gov/branches/space-mission-analysis-branch-smab/smab-projects/havoc/ |title=HAVOC &amp;#124; Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate |website=Sacd.larc.nasa.gov |date=2016-06-15 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/29141-venus-airship-havoc-nasa-concept-gallery.html |title=Project HAVOC: NASA Concept Could Explore Venus with Airships (Gallery) |website=Space.com |date=2015-04-20 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/nasa-havoc-concept-manned-mission-to-venus/35311/ |title=NASA concept would send astronauts to Venus |website=Gizmag.com |date=2014-12-20 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LUVOIR space telescope===
[[File:Atlast concepts all3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] successors]]
The SLS has been proposed as the launch vehicle for the future [[Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor]]  (LUVOIR) space telescope, which will have a main [[segmented mirror]] between 8 and 16 meters in diameter,&lt;ref name='LUVOIR SLS'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20150018127 SLS Launched Missions Concept Studies for LUVOIR Mission].

===''Europa Clipper''===
{{main|Europa Clipper}}
SLS has been proposed as the launch vehicle for the planned ''[[Europa Clipper]]'', an orbiter to [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] to study its atmosphere, magnetic and thermal characteristics, gravitational harmonics, sample any water plumes, etc. Its launch is proposed for the mid-2020s.&lt;ref name="March 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/24926-nasa-europa-mission-2015-budget.html |title=NASA Eyes Ambitious Mission to Jupiter's Icy Moon Europa by 2025 |work=Space.com |date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europa Lander===
{{main|Europa Lander (NASA)}}
If funded, the launch of a Europa Lander would require the SLS system, and it would be launched after ''Europa Clipper'' in the mid-2020s to complement its studies.&lt;ref name='FoustJuly2017'&gt;[http://spacenews.com/jpl-moves-ahead-with-mars-and-europa-missions-despite-funding-uncertainty/ JPL moves ahead with Mars and Europa missions despite funding uncertainty]. Jeff Foust. July 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranus orbiter and probe===
{{main|NASA Uranus orbiter and probe}}
SLS has been proposed by Boeing as a launch vehicle for a Uranian probe. The rocket would "Deliver a small payload into orbit around Uranus and a shallow probe into the planet’s atmosphere." The mission would study the Uranian atmosphere, magnetic and thermal characteristics, gravitational harmonics, as well as do flybys of Uranian moons.&lt;ref name="Chris Gebhardt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/11/new-sls-options-new-large-upper-stage |title=New SLS mission options explored via new Large Upper Stage |author=Chris Gebhardt |publisher=NASASpaceFlight |date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boeing.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/defense-space/space/sls/docs/sls_mission_booklet_jan_2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Space Launch System Exploration, Science, Security |website=Boeing.com |accessdate=2017-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923193950/http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/defense-space/space/sls/docs/sls_mission_booklet_jan_2014.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Selection of Discovery Mission 13 and 14}}
''Psyche'' was submitted as part of a call for proposals for NASA's [[Discovery Program]] that closed in February 2015. It was shortlisted on September 30, 2015, as one of five finalists and awarded $3 million for further concept development.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170106" /&gt;&lt;ref name="selection 1st round"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-investigations-for-future-key-planetary-mission |title=NASA Selects Investigations for Future Key Planetary Mission |publisher=NASA |first1=Dwayne C. |last1=Brown |first2=Laurie |last2=Cantillo |date=September 30, 2015 |access-date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aspect of selection was enduring the "site visit" in which about 30 NASA personnel come and interview, inspect, and question the proposers and their plan.&lt;ref name="asunow.asu.edu"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20161220-discoveries-journey-metal-world |title=Journey to a metal world |work=ASU Now |publisher=Arizona State University |first=Karin |last=Valentine |date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2017, it was selected along with [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'']] as one of two winners of this round of Discovery mission selection, with launch set for 2023 as the 14th Discovery mission.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; In May 2017 the launch date was moved up to target a more efficient trajectory, launching in 2022 and arriving in 2026 with a Mars [[gravity assist]] in 2023.&lt;ref name='NASA-20170524'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2017-149 |title=NASA Moves Up Launch of Psyche Mission to a Metal Asteroid |publisher=NASA |first1=D.

===Science goals and objectives===
[[File:16Psyche (Lightcurve Inversion).png|thumb|A 3D model of {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} based on light curve data]]
[[File:Motif de "Widmanstätten" ©dada 677.jpg|thumb|The [[Widmanstätten pattern]] that can be found inside iron–nickel meteorites, which have the same classification as asteroid {{nowrap|16 Psyche}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38805430 |title=Hunt for Antarctica's 'lost meteorites' |work=BBC News |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=January 31, 2016 |access-date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Planetary differentiation|Differentiation]] was a fundamental process in shaping many [[asteroid]]s and all [[terrestrial planet]]s, and direct exploration of a [[Planetary core|core]] could greatly enhance understanding of this process. The ''Psyche'' mission will characterize {{nowrap|[[16 Psyche]]'s}} geology, shape, elemental composition, [[magnetic field]], and mass distribution. It is expected that this mission will increase the understanding of [[Nebular hypothesis|planetary formation]] and interiors.

Specifically, the science goals for the mission are:
*Understand a previously unexplored building block of planet formation: iron cores.
*Look inside terrestrial planets, including Earth, by directly examining the interior of a differentiated body, which otherwise could not be seen.
*Explore a new type of world, made of metal.

The science objectives are:
*Determine whether {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} is a core, or if it is unmelted material.
*Determine the relative ages of regions of {{nowrap|16 Psyche's}} surface.
*Determine whether small metal bodies incorporate the same light elements as are expected in the Earth's high-pressure core.
*Determine whether {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} was formed under conditions more [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] or more [[Reducing agent|reducing]] than Earth's core.
*Characterize {{nowrap|16 Psyche's}} [[topography]].

The science questions this mission will address are:&lt;ref name='mission' /&gt;
*Is {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} the stripped core of a differentiated [[planetesimal]], or was it formed as an iron-rich body? What were the building blocks of planets? Did planetesimals that formed close to the Sun have very different bulk compositions?
*If {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} was stripped of its [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], when and how did that occur?
*If {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} was once molten, did it solidify from the inside out, or the outside in?
*Did {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} produce a [[Dynamo theory|magnetic dynamo]] as it cooled?
*What are the major [[alloy]] elements that coexist in the iron metal of the core?
*What are the key characteristics of the geologic surface and global topography?  Does {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} look radically different from known stony and icy bodies?
*How do craters on a metal body differ from those in rock or ice?

===Orbit regime===

The ''Psyche'' spacecraft would orbit {{nowrap|16 Psyche}} at decreasing altitudes.&lt;ref name="Oh2017" /&gt; Its first regime, {{nowrap|Orbit A}}, will see the spacecraft enter a {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} orbit for magnetic field characterization and preliminary mapping for a duration of 56 days. It will then descend to {{nowrap|Orbit B}}, set at {{convert|290|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude for 76 days, for topography and magnetic field characterization. It will then descend to {{nowrap|Orbit C}}, at {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude for 100 days to perform gravity investigations and continue magnetic field observations. Finally, the orbiter will enter {{nowrap|Orbit D}}, set at {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} to determine the chemical composition of the surface using its gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers. It will also acquire continued imaging, gravity, and magnetic field mapping. The mission is planned to orbit the asteroid for at least 21 months.&lt;ref name="Oh2017" /&gt;

==Science payload==
''Psyche'' will fly a payload of {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name='Gerrit 2015'/&gt; consisting on four scientific instruments.&lt;ref name="asunow.asu.edu"/&gt;
*The [[multispectral image|Multispectral Imager]] will provide high-resolution images using filters to discriminate between metallic and silicate constituents.
*The Gamma-ray and Neutron Spectrometer will analyze and map the asteroid's elemental composition.
*The [[Spacecraft magnetometer|Magnetometer]] will measure and map the remnant [[magnetic field]] of the asteroid.
*The X-band Gravity Science Investigation will use the [[X-band]] (microwave) radio telecommunications system to measure the asteroid's [[Physical geodesy|gravity field]] and deduce its interior structure.

The spacecraft will also test an experimental [[Laser communication in space|laser communication]] technology called [[Deep Space Optical Communications]].&lt;ref name=DSOC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6967 |title=Deep Space Communications via Faraway Photons |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Leonard |last=David |date=October 18, 2017 |accessdate=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that the device will be able to increase spacecraft communications performance and efficiency by 10 to 100 times over conventional means.&lt;ref name=DSOC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/psyche/overview/index.html |title=Psyche Overview |publisher=NASA |last=Greicius |first=Tony |date=September 14, 2017 |access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laser beams from the spacecraft will be received by a ground telescope at [[Palomar Observatory]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/tdm/feature/Deep_Space_Communications |title="Lighten Up" – Deep Space Communications via Faraway Photons |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Loura |editor-last=Hall |date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saturn INT-20''' was a proposed intermediate-payload follow-on from the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle. A conical-form interstage would be fitted on top of the [[S-IC]] stage to support the [[S-IVB]] stage, so it could be considered either a retrofitted [[Saturn IB]] with a more powerful first stage, or a stubby, cut-down Saturn V without the [[S-II]] second stage.

Three variants were studied, one with three [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines in the first stage, one with four, and one with five.

==Performance==

Without the S-II stage, which made up a large fraction of the mass of the Saturn V, a version of the INT-20 using an unmodified five-engine version of the S-IC booster would be greatly overpowered and accelerate substantially faster than the Saturn V. This would create excessive aerodynamic stress in the low atmosphere. Several solutions to this problem were considered.

Using the original five-engine S-IC would require three engines to be shut down 88 seconds after launch, with the remainder of the first-stage flight flown on only two engines. This meant that a considerable amount of the firing time would be carrying three engines of "dead weight". As a consequence the extra payload over a four-engine variant would only have been about one thousand pounds, and the extra cost and complexity of the fifth engine was unjustified.

A four-engine variant would launch with four engines firing and shut down two engines 146 seconds after launch. The remaining two engines would burn until first-stage shutdown 212 seconds after launch. This variant could put approximately 132,000 pounds into a 100 [[nautical mile]] (185&amp;nbsp;km or 115 statute mile) orbit, versus around 250,000 pounds for the three-stage Saturn V.

The three-engine variant would burn all three engines up to first-stage shutdown at 146 seconds after launch. This variant could put approximately 78,000 pounds of payload into a 100 nautical mile (185&amp;nbsp;km) orbit, around twice the useful payload of the Saturn IB.

Both three- and four-engine variants would therefore have provided useful payload capacities ([[Saturn C-3]]) intermediate between the Saturn IB and Saturn V, and re-using Saturn V components would reduce costs and simplify ground operations compared to building an entirely new launcher in that payload range.

'''Stone &amp; Webster''' was an [[United States|American]] engineering services company based in [[Stoughton, Massachusetts]]. It was founded as an electrical testing lab and consulting firm by [[electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] Charles Stone and [[Edwin S. Webster]] in 1889. In the early 20th century, Stone &amp; Webster was known for operating [[streetcar]] systems in many cities across the [[United States]]; examples include [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. 
The company grew to provide engineering, construction, environmental, and plant operation and maintenance services, and it has long been involved in power generation projects, starting with hydroelectric plants of the late 19th-century; and with most American nuclear power plants.

Stone &amp; Webster was acquired and integrated as a division of [[The Shaw Group]] in 2000, and in 2012, the French engineering conglomerate [[Technip]] acquired Stone &amp; Webster's energy and chemical business, and process technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group. The CB&amp;I acquisition of other assets of [[The Shaw Group]], also in 2012, resulted in the formation of a nuclear power subsidiary, CB&amp;I Stone Webster, which operated for about 4 years, being sold in January 2016 to [[Westinghouse Electric Company]].

[[Charles A. Stone]] and [[Edwin S. Webster]] first met in 1884 and became close friends while studying electrical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1890, only two years after graduating, they formed the Massachusetts Electrical Engineering Company. The name was changed to Stone &amp; Webster in 1893. Their company was one of the earliest electrical engineering consulting firms in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&amp;fileName=wa/wa0200/wa0227/data/hhdatapage.db&amp;recNum=7&amp;itemLink=D%3Fhh%3A13%3A.%2Ftemp%2F%7Epp_O3rN%3A%3A%40%40%40mdb%3Dfsaall%2Capp%2Cbrum%2Cdetr%2Cswann%2Clook%2Cgottscho%2Cpan%2Choryd%2Cgenthe%2Cvar%2Ccai%2Ccd%2Chh%2Cyan%2Cbbcards%2Clomax%2Cils%2Cprok%2Cbrhc%2Cnclc%2Cmatpc%2Ciucpub%2Ctgmi%2Clamb| title=Nooksack Falls Hydroelectric Plant; HAER WA-18| work=Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record| publisher=Library Of Congress| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone &amp; Webster's first major project was the construction of a hydroelectric plant for the New England paper company in 1890. Stone &amp; Webster not only had valuable insight into developing and managing utilities but they also had keen intuition for businesses to invest in. Through the panic of 1893, Stone &amp; Webster were able to acquire the Nashville Electric Light and Power Co. for a few thousand dollars and later sold it for $500,000.&lt;ref name="Library Of Congress"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&amp;fileName=wa/wa0200/wa0227/data/hhdatapage.db&amp;recNum=8&amp;itemLink=D%3Fhh%3A13%3A.%2Ftemp%2F%7Epp_O3rN%3A%3A%40%40%40mdb%3Dfsaall%2Capp%2Cbrum%2Cdetr%2Cswann%2Clook%2Cgottscho%2Cpan%2Choryd%2Cgenthe%2Cvar%2Ccai%2Ccd%2Chh%2Cyan%2Cbbcards%2Clomax%2Cils%2Cprok%2Cbrhc%2Cnclc%2Cmatpc%2Ciucpub%2Ctgmi%2Clamb| title=Nooksack Falls Hydroelectric Plant; HAER WA-18| work=Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record| publisher=Library Of Congress| page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the next ten years, Stone &amp; Webster acquired interest in large number of utilities while offering managerial, engineering and financial consulting to a number of independent utility firms. Even though Stone &amp; Webster were not a holding company, their financial and managerial presence meant that they had considerable influence in policy decisions. They would often be paid in utility stock.&lt;ref name="Library Of Congress"/&gt;

Stone &amp; Webster became involved in Washington State engineering projects—Washington's natural resources, and hydroelectric power, and resulting development opportunities brought companies like Stone &amp; Webster to the state{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}—beginning with Puget Sound area street railways. By 1900, they had controlled and merged eight small rail lines in Seattle; soon after, they also took over the street railway systems of Tacoma and Everett. By 1908, Stone &amp; Webster listed thirty-one railway and lighting companies under its management including five located in Washington State: the Puget Sound Electric Railway, Puget Sound International Railway and Power Co., Puget Sound Power Co., The Seattle Electric Co., and Whatcom County Railway and Light Co.{{Overly detailed inline|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name="Library Of Congress"/&gt; Stone &amp; Webster leadership was sensitive to the concerns of large utility holding companies and were careful to emphasize the complete independence of these utilities, but Edwin Webster believed that outside capital was crucial to develop the resources of Washington, and chided those who thought otherwise.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In 1905, Stone &amp; Webster bought out the power and lighting properties that were once owned by the Bellingham Bay Improvement Co., including the York Street Steam plant and the partially built [[Nooksack Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant]].{{Overly detailed inline|date=February 2017}} Stone &amp; Webster took over construction operations and on September 21, 1906, Bellingham received power from the plant via a {{convert|47|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&amp;fileName=wa/wa0200/wa0227/data/hhdatapage.db&amp;recNum=9&amp;itemLink=D%3Fhh%3A13%3A.%2Ftemp%2F%7Epp_O3rN%3A%3A%40%40%40mdb%3Dfsaall%2Capp%2Cbrum%2Cdetr%2Cswann%2Clook%2Cgottscho%2Cpan%2Choryd%2Cgenthe%2Cvar%2Ccai%2Ccd%2Chh%2Cyan%2Cbbcards%2Clomax%2Cils%2Cprok%2Cbrhc%2Cnclc%2Cmatpc%2Ciucpub%2Ctgmi%2Clamb| title=Nooksack Falls Hydroelectric Plant; HAER WA-18| work=Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record| publisher=Library Of Congress| page=9| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704021754/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&amp;fileName=wa%2Fwa0200%2Fwa0227%2Fdata%2Fhhdatapage.db&amp;recNum=9&amp;itemLink=D%3Fhh%3A13%3A.%2Ftemp%2F~pp_O3rN%3A%3A%40%40%40mdb%3Dfsaall%2Capp%2Cbrum%2Cdetr%2Cswann%2Clook%2Cgottscho%2Cpan%2Choryd%2Cgenthe%2Cvar%2Ccai%2Ccd%2Chh%2Cyan%2Cbbcards%2Clomax%2Cils%2Cprok%2Cbrhc%2Cnclc%2Cmatpc%2Ciucpub%2Ctgmi%2Clamb| archivedate=July 4, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the independence allowed its subsidiaries, J.D. Ross, superintendent of Seattle City Light issued a report critical of Stone &amp; Webster's presence in Seattle. listing 49 companies under Stone &amp; Webster's management at the time.&lt;ref name="Library Of Congress"/&gt;

By 1912, the company, nationally, had divided itself into three specialized subsidiaries:&lt;ref name="Library Of Congress"/&gt;
* Stone &amp; Webster Engineering
* Stone &amp; Webster Management Association
* Stone &amp; Webster Investments

In 1927, Stone &amp; Webster expanded the investments business, merging its securities subsidiaries with the investment banking firm of Blodgett &amp; Co. founded in 1886, to form Stone &amp; Webster and Blodgett Inc. In January, 1946, the name of the business, was changed to Stone and Webster Securities Corporation. Stone and Webster Securities was one of the 17 U.S. investment banking and securities firms named in the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s antitrust investigation of Wall Street commonly known as the [[Investment Bankers Case]].&lt;ref&gt;United States of America, Plaintiff, Against Henry S. Morgan, Harold Stanley, Et Al., Doing Business as Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Et Al., Defendants&lt;/ref&gt; The Stone &amp; Webster investment banking operations were eventually acquired by [[Kidder Peabody]] which already had overlapping ownership.

===1940s to 1960s===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
{{Close paraphrasing|section|date=February 2017}}
Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., has since offered its customers in the United States and the world engineering, design, construction, consulting, and environmental services to build electric power plants, petrochemical plants and refineries, factories, infrastructure, and civil works projects. Stone &amp; Webster helped build substantial portions of the nation's power production infrastructure, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric plants constituting around 20 percent of U.S. generating capacity. The company played a significant role in the nation's defense efforts during World War I and II and afterwards, helping develop the A-Bomb, constructing large shipyards, and creating alternate means of production of [[strategic material]]s such as [[synthetic rubber]]. Much of the world's capacity in petrochemical and plastics development was also developed as a result of Stone &amp; Webster efforts.

====1940s efforts, including in nuclear power====
America's entry into World War II brought a dramatic increase in demand for all types of engineering and construction, and Stone &amp; Webster became intensely involved in the war effort. According to former Stone &amp; Webster president Allen, "Few elements of war production were not impacted in a significant way by Stone &amp; Webster."{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Typical Stone &amp; Webster wartime assignments included the design and construction of cartridge case plants, a complete steel foundry, a plant to produce bombsights and other equipment, a plant furnishing fire-control instruments, a facility producing aircraft superchargers, and three TNT-production plants, in addition to meeting demands for infrastructure and power facilities. The company was also called upon to engage in more creative projects.

Perhaps the most creative Stone &amp; Webster wartime effort was its involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]], which designed and built the atomic bomb. Stone &amp; Webster was involved in creating the facilities and laboratories for the [[Manhattan Project]]. Prior to its acquisition it was also part of the [[Maine Yankee]] decommissioning project. The company was selected in June 1942 by the first MED District Engineer, Colonel [[James C. Marshall]], as the main subcontractor for the project. Eventually the company established a completely separate engineering organization employing 800 engineers and draftsmen to study ways to separate large quantities of fissionable [[uranium-235]]. At [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], Stone &amp; Webster constructed a new city that ultimately housed 75,000 workers and the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] electromagnetic separation plant.

Immediately after the end of the war, demand for Stone &amp; Webster services rose rapidly among U.S. public utilities. Under the leadership of Texan George Clifford, the company began to build interstate gas pipelines and compressor stations and also became the largest single stockholder in the Tennessee Gas Transmission Company ([[Tenneco]]). The company was also retained on tasks that helped shift the nation's economy from a defense to a civilian basis, such as estimating the costs of deactivation and stand-by maintenance of defense plants and shipyards, providing technical advice and services on Japanese reparations, evaluating the mobile equipment that remained in overseas theaters, and continuing work at Oak Ridge.

====1950s and 1960s====
Stone &amp; Webster was perhaps the most significant engineering company to be involved in the nation's developing nuclear power industry. Chosen after a competition with 90 other companies to build the nation's first nuclear power plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, Stone &amp; Webster was subsequently selected to design and supervise the construction of a large accelerator at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, design the neutron shield tank for the nuclear-powered merchant ship N.S. Savannah, and engineer and construct a prototype atomic energy power plant for the U.S. Army.

The steady demand for electric power generation also meant an increase in construction contracts for more conventional power plants. By the early 1950s, Stone &amp; Webster had built 27 separate hydroelectric plants constituting 5 percent of U.S. capacity, steam power plants aggregating six million kilowatts in capacity, and some 6,000 miles of power transmission lines.
During this time, the company also obtained a variety of chemical process contracts in the United States, Canada, Japan and other countries to meet the worldwide demand for plastics.

As the 1960s drew on, however, Stone &amp; Webster's petrochemical and plastics activity began to slow as U.S. refinery capacity caught up with customer demand and declined accordingly. To smooth the impact of these fluctuations, the company diversified its process interests, developing, for example, a more extensive relationship with the paper industry. During the decade, the company designed the first commercial mill to make pulp from hardwood trees.
Slowing business activity also resulted in some conceptual restructuring within the company, including an effort to standardize designs in areas of proven success and placing a greater emphasis on the use of project work teams that combined staff with differing specialized skills. The increased emphasis on teaming fit well with Stone &amp; Webster's need to address problems that developed in the energy supply sector in the mid- to late 1960s and was used in the design of synthetic natural gas plants, a liquified natural gas distribution center, and demonstration projects in coal and oil gasification.

====Challenges in the 1970s–80s====
During the 1970s, major world events—including the [[OPEC]] (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargoes of 1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979]], uncertainty in the chemical process industry with respect to feedstock supplies, increasing opposition to the use of nuclear power, and a growing public awareness of environmental issues—brought difficulties as well as new business opportunities for Stone &amp; Webster.

The high prices that followed the embargoes, for example, constrained energy demand and thus reduced the need for new electric generating capacity. Utilities looked into every possible alternative to meet demand, short of constructing major new baseload stations, resulting in "one of the severest drop-offs in building in the history of the engineering-construction industry," according to former Stone &amp; Webster president William Allen in ''Public Utilities Fortnightly'' (July 20, 1989).{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}} An equally severe, simultaneous downturn in international construction compounded the problem.

The investment banking affiliate, Stone &amp; Webster Securities, had attempted to grow by acquiring two smaller, regional brokerage houses in 1968: Hayden, Miller &amp; Co., based in Cleveland, and Atlanta-based Wyatt, Neal &amp; Waggoner. That increased the number of offices of the firm from nine to 28, but cultural and style differences between the parent company's traditional engineering management and retail brokerage management led to an exodus of key employees, and the Securities firm closed its doors in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Keller, David Neal | year = 1989 | title = Stone &amp; Webster, 1889-1989 | page = 288 | location =  | publisher =  | isbn = 0962367702 | url =  | access-date =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stone &amp; Webster headquarters.jpg|thumb|Stone &amp; Webster headquarters at 245 Summer St. in Boston in 1980]]

Stone &amp; Webster's difficulties with constructing conventional power plants were matched by its problems in nuclear construction. By the late 1970s, the company had attained a central role in the nuclear power industry—a significant portion of all nuclear energy in the United States was being generated at plants designed and generated by Stone &amp; Webster. In 1975, the company had been selected to construct the [[Clinch River Breeder Reactor]]. However, increasing public opposition to the construction of nuclear plants, lengthy delays brought by challenges before public utility commissions, and corresponding increases in plant construction costs, capped by the [[Three Mile Island accident|incident]] at [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station|Three Mile Island]] in 1979, brought about a moratorium on the construction of large nuclear plants and the cancellation of many existing orders.

The company began to respond to these challenges during the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. Stone &amp; Webster met its clients' reluctance to build by improving engineering and construction efficiencies through the use of computer-assisted design and innovative working agreements with contractors and the building trades unions, as well as by providing services that kept plants operating safely, efficiently, and for a longer time than originally intended.
To further survive in this complex business environment, Stone &amp; Webster began to more intensely solicit government and international business, increase its activity in the area of environmental protection and alternative energy production, continue its activity in extending the lives of existing power plants, and develop other areas of diversification as long as they did not distract from the company's core business—engineering. Stone &amp; Webster also began to phase out those parts of the company that were unrelated to its core activities and no longer considered financially viable, such as its securities subsidiary.

====1990s====
In the 1990s, Stone &amp; Webster faced a business environment in which its core activities of power plant and petrochemical plant construction were lagging, and new areas targeted for growth had not yet fulfilled their potential. As a result, company stock performance was sluggish, and in 1992 a stockholder group headed by corporate gadfly [[Bob Monks]] attacked Stone &amp; Webster management, asserting that the company had not exploited its assets to keep its stock price high and inquiring as to growth plans the company intended to institute in order to raise stock value.

In 1994, the company registered a net loss of $7.8 million despite revenues of over $818 million. Recognizing that a need existed to improve its financial picture, Stone &amp; Webster opted for a further change in its traditional marketing strategy. The company centered its hopes for future growth on a broader expansion of its core businesses into global markets, a cutback in its dependence on power generation, and the expansion of its environmental and transportation efforts.

Stone &amp; Webster's infrastructure and transportation activities during this time included the engineering and design of railway and other large transit systems, including part of the [[Washington Metro|Washington, D.C. metro]]; major airport improvements in [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] and [[Miami International Airport|Miami]]; bridge construction, such as the [[Confederation Bridge|eight mile-long bridge]] linking [[Prince Edward Island]] to the Canadian mainland; and roadway upgrading, including work on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Moreover, the company's advanced computer applications efforts included the use of three-dimensional models; expert systems which monitored, diagnosed, and recommended solutions in areas from equipment vibration to chemical plant processing; and advanced controls that continuously monitored all plant operations.

=====Changes in leadership in the 1990s=====
Despite its challenges, Stone &amp; Webster appeared to retain considerable strengths on which to draw. Once the impact of strategies responsive to the business environment of the 1990s had been put in place, company officials and outside observers seemed reasonably optimistic about the company's prospects as it moved on into its second century.

There was little sign that anything was wrong at the company in the late 1990s. Stone &amp; Webster announced it was selling some buildings in Boston in 1997 but claimed that this was only because the company had an excess of real estate. Stone &amp; Webster also moved its corporate headquarters out of New York City and back to Boston, and sold or subleased office space in New York and New Jersey. Whatever was actually the case in 1997, by 1999 Stone &amp; Webster had serious cash flow problems. Company executives later charged that chairman Smith had consistently underbid on projects in order to win business, putting Stone &amp; Webster on shaky ground.

===2000s===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
The company collapsed in 2000 after a major [[bribery]] scandal. It had attempted to pay $147 million to a relative of [[Indonesia]]n President [[Suharto]] to secure the largest contract in Stone &amp; Webster's history. But the plan went bad, and the company fell along with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/03/15/the_bribe_memo_and_collapse_of_stone__webster/| title='The Bribe Memo' and collapse of Stone &amp; Webster |newspaper=Boston Globe; Business| date=March 15, 2006| author=Steve Bailey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Stone &amp; Webster filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in 2000 because of cash flow problems. It was bought at auction by the [[Shaw Group]] for US$150 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = NYT Staff | date = May 10, 2000 | title = Company News Stone Webster to Sell Assets and File for Chapter 11 | journal = [[The New York Times]] | agency = Associated Press | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/business/company-news-stone-webster-to-sell-assets-and-file-for-chapter-11.html| access-date= 15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = NYT Staff | date = July 8, 2000 | title = Company News: Shaw Group Wins the Bidding for Stone Webster | journal = [[The New York Times]] | agency = Dow Jones | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/08/business/company-news-shaw-group-wins-the-bidding-for-stone-webster.html | access-date= 15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company finally emerged from bankruptcy in late 2003,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and under the Shaw Group, Stone &amp; Webster was a subsidiary of a global leader with revenue of over $3.3 billion.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The Stone &amp; Webster subsidiary retained 5,000 employees,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} with significant global operations associated with construction and engineering projects, hazardous waste management, and environmental services.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In 2008, ''[[Engineering News-Record|ENR]]'' ranked the Stone &amp; Webster subsidiary of The Shaw Group subsidiary as first in revenue for Power EPC, and fifth by Revenue in Process &amp; Petrochemical EPC.{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}

|- valign="top"
|'''1088'''
|[[Shen Kuo]]
|First person to write of the magnetic needle compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by helping to employ the astronomical concept of True North at all times of the day, thus making the first, recorded, scientific observation of the magnetic field (as opposed to a theory grounded in superstition or mysticism).
|- valign="top"
|'''1187'''
|[[Alexander Neckham]]
|First in Europe to describe the magnetic compass and its use in navigation.
|- valign="top"
|'''1269'''
|[[Pierre de Maricourt]]
|Published the first extant treatise on the properties of magnetism and compass needles.
|- valign="top"
|'''1550'''
|[[Gerolamo Cardano]]
|Wrote about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.
|- valign="top"
|'''1600'''
|[[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]
|In ''De Magnete'', expanded on Cardano's work (1550) and coined the New Latin word ''electricus'' from ἤλεκτρον (elektron), the Greek word for "amber" (from which the ancients knew an [[electric spark]] could be created by rubbing it with silk).  Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc., were capable of manifesting [[electrostatic]] properties. Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies, due to the now well-known fact that moisture impairs the [[electrical insulation]] of such bodies. He also noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron. The many discoveries of this nature earned for Gilbert the title of founder of the electrical sciences.
|- valign="top"
|'''1646'''
|[[Sir Thomas Browne]]
|The first usage of the word ''electricity'' is ascribed to his work [[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1660'''
|[[Otto von Guericke]]
|Invented an early electrostatic generator. By the end of the 17th Century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction by the use of an [[electrostatic generator]], but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies of the new science of [[electricity]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1667'''
|[[Johann Joachim Becher]]
|Stated the now-defunct scientific theory that postulated the existence of a fire-like element called "phlogiston" that was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. The theory was an attempt to explain processes such as combustion and the rusting of metals, which are now understood as oxidation, and which was ultimately disproved by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789.
|- valign="top"
|'''1675'''
|[[Robert Boyle]]
|Discovered that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum and does not depend upon the air as a medium. He also added resin to the then-known list of "electrics."
|- valign="top"
|'''1678'''
|[[Christiaan Huygens]]
|Stated his theory to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that light is a [[wave|wave-like phenomenon]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1687'''
|Sir [[Isaac Newton]]
|Published ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', by itself considered to be among the most influential books in the [[history of science]], laying the groundwork for most of [[classical mechanics]].  In this work, Newton described [[law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]] and the three [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]], which dominated the scientific view of the [[physical universe]] for the next three centuries.  Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of [[celestial mechanics|celestial]] bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about [[heliocentrism]] and advancing the [[scientific revolution]].  In [[mechanics]], Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of both [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]. (''Eventually, it was determined that Newton's laws of classical mechanics were a special case of the more general theory of quantum mechanics for macroscopic objects (in the same way that Newton's laws of motion are a special case of Einstein's Theory of Relativity)).''
|- valign="top"
|'''1704'''
|Sir [[Isaac Newton]]
|In his work ''Opticks'', Newton contended that light was made up of numerous small particles. This hypothesis could explain such features as light's ability to travel in straight lines and reflect off surfaces. However, this proposed theory was known to have its problems: although it explained reflection well, its explanation of refraction and diffraction was less satisfactory. In order to explain refraction, Newton postulated an "Aethereal Medium" transmitting vibrations faster than light, by which light, when overtaken, is put into "Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission", which he supposed caused the phenomena of [[refraction]] and [[diffraction]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1708'''
|[[Brook Taylor]]
|Obtained a remarkable solution of the problem of the "centre of oscillation" fundamental to the development of [[wave|wave mechanics]] which, however, remained unpublished until May 1714.
|- valign="top"
|'''1715'''
|[[Brook Taylor]]
|In ''Methodus Incrementorum Directa et Inversa'' (1715), he added a new branch to the higher mathematics, now designated the "calculus of finite differences." Among other ingenious applications, he used it to determine the form of movement of a vibrating string, first successfully reduced by him to mechanical principles. The same work contained the celebrated formula known as Taylor's theorem, the importance of which remained unrecognized until 1772, when J. L. Lagrange realized its powers and termed it "le principal fondement du calcul différentiel" ("the main foundation of differential calculus").  Taylor's work thereby provided the cornerstone of the calculus of [[wave|wave mechanics]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1722'''
|[[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]]
|Demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon.
|- valign="top"
|'''1729'''
|[[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]]
|Conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the difference between conductors and non-conductors (insulators).  From these experiments he classified substances into two categories: "electrics", like glass, resin and silk, and "non-electrics", like metal and water. Although Gray was the first to discover and deduce the property of electrical conduction, he incorrectly stated that "electrics" conducted charges while "non-electrics" held the charge.
|- valign="top"
|'''1732'''
|[[C. F. du Fay]]
|Conducted several experiments and concluded that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, could be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an "electric machine" (the name used at the time for electrostatic generators), thus discrediting Gray's "electrics" and "non-electrics" classification of substances (1729).
|- valign="top"
|'''1737'''
|[[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]
|Independently discovered what they believed to be two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two "electrical fluids": "vitreous" and "resinous", that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. This two-fluid theory would later give rise to the concept of positive and negative electrical charges devised by Benjamin Franklin.
|- valign="top"
|'''1740'''
|[[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]
|In ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1740s'''
|[[Leonhard Euler]]
|Disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory of light in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory.  His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave–particle duality|quantum theory of light]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1745'''
|[[Pieter van Musschenbroek]]
|At Leiden University, he invented the [[Leyden jar]], a type of [[capacitor]] (also known as a "condensor") for electrical energy in large quantities.
|- valign="top"
|'''1747'''
|[[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]]
|While experimenting with a Leyden jar (1745), he discovered the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]) when he observed that a discharge of static electricity caused the [[electric current]] earlier observed by [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]] to occur.
|- valign="top"
|'''1752'''
|[[Benjamin Franklin]]
|Identified lightning with electricity when he discovered that lightning conducted through a metal key could be used to charge a Leyden jar, thus proving that lightning was an electric discharge and current (1747).  He is also attributed with the convention of using "negative" and "positive" to denote an electrical charge or potential.
|- valign="top"
|'''1766'''
|[[Henry Cavendish]]
|The first to recognize [[hydrogen]] gas as a discrete substance, by identifying the gas from a metal-acid reaction as "flammable air" and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned.
|- valign="top"
|'''1771'''
|[[Luigi Galvani]]
|Invented the [[voltaic cell]].  Galvani made this discovery when he noted that two different metals (copper and zinc for example) were connected together and then both touched to different parts of a nerve of a frog leg at the same time, a spark was generated which made the leg contract.  Although he incorrectly assumed that the electric current was proceeding from the frog as some kind of "[[animal electricity]]", his invention of the voltaic cell was fundamental to the development of the electric battery.
|- valign="top"
|'''1772'''
|[[Antoine Lavoisier]]
|Showed that diamonds are a form of carbon, when he burned samples of carbon and diamond then showed that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of carbon dioxide per gram.
|- valign="top"
|'''1772'''
|[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]
|Showed that [[graphite]], which had been thought of as a form of [[lead]], was instead a type of [[carbon]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1772'''
|[[Daniel Rutherford]]
|Discovered and studied [[nitrogen]], calling it noxious air or fixed air because this gas constituted a fraction of air that did not support combustion.  Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Henry Cavendish]], and [[Joseph Priestley]], who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air. Nitrogen gas was inert enough that Antoine Lavoisier referred to it as "mephitic air" or azote, from the Greek word άζωτος  (azotos) meaning "lifeless".  Animals died in it, and it was the principal component of air in which animals had suffocated and flames had burned to extinction.
|- valign="top"
|'''1772'''
|[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]
|Produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates by about 1772.  Scheele called the gas 'fire air' because it was the only known supporter of combustion, and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled Treatise on Air and Fire, which he sent to his publisher in 1775. However, that document was not published until 1777.
|- valign="top"
|'''1778'''
|[[Carl Scheele]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]]
|Discovered that [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] is composed mostly of [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1781'''
|[[Joseph Priestley]]
|The first to utilize the electric spark to produce an explosion of hydrogen and oxygen, mixed in the proper proportions, to produce pure water.
|- valign="top"
|'''1784'''
|[[Henry Cavendish]]
|Discovered the [[electromagnetic induction|inductive capacity]] of [[dielectrics]] (insulators) and, as early as 1778, measured the specific inductive capacity for beeswax and other substances by comparison with an air condenser.
|- valign="top"

|[[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]
|Demonstrated via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained only if light was ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.  This finding was later very important to Maxwell's equations and to Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity.  His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|F.

With [[François Arago]] he studied the laws of the interference of [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] rays.

|Goldstein had undertaken his own investigations of discharge tubes and had named the light emissions studied by others "kathodenstrahlen", or [[cathode rays]].  In 1886, he discovered that discharge tubes with a perforated cathode also emit a glow at the [[cathode]] end. Goldstein concluded that in addition to the already-known cathode rays (later recognized as [[electrons]]) moving from the negatively charged cathode toward the positively charged [[anode]], there is another ray that travels in the opposite direction. Because these latter rays passed through the holes, or channels, in the cathode, Goldstein called them "kanalstrahlen", or [[canal rays]]. He determined that canal rays are composed of positive ions whose identity depends on the residual gas inside the tube. It was another of Helmholtz's students, [[Wilhelm Wien]], who later conducted extensive studies of canal rays, and in time this work would become part of the basis for [[mass spectrometry]].

|In a famous letter written by him, Pauli suggested that, in addition to electrons and protons, atoms also contained an extremely light neutral particle which he called the "neutron". He suggested that this "neutron" was also emitted during beta decay and had simply not yet been observed.  Later it was determined that this particle was actually the almost massless [[neutrino]].

|[[Walther Bothe]] and [[Herbert Becker (physicist)|Herbert Becker]]
|Found that, if the very energetic [[alpha particle]]s emitted from [[polonium]] fell on certain light elements, specifically [[beryllium]], [[boron]], or [[lithium]], an unusually penetrating radiation was produced. At first this radiation was thought to be [[gamma radiation]], although it was more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results were very difficult to interpret on this basis.  Some scientists began to hypothesize the possible existence of another fundamental, atomic particle.

|'''1932'''
|[[Irène Joliot-Curie]] and [[Frédéric Joliot]]
|Showed that if the unknown radiation generated by [[alpha particle]]s fell on paraffin or any other hydrogen-containing compound, it ejected [[proton]]s of very high energy. This was not in itself inconsistent with the proposed [[gamma ray]] nature of the new radiation, but detailed quantitative analysis of the data became increasingly difficult to reconcile with such a hypothesis.

|'''1932'''
|[[James Chadwick]]
|Performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis for the unknown radiation produced by [[alpha particle]]s was untenable, and that the new particles must be the [[neutron]]s hypothesized by [[Enrico Fermi]].  Chadwick suggested that, in fact, the new radiation consisted of uncharged particles of approximately the same mass as the proton, and he performed a series of experiments verifying his suggestion.

|'''1932'''
|[[Werner Heisenberg]]
|Applied [[perturbation theory]] to the two-electron problem and showed how [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] arising from electron exchange could explain [[exchange forces]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1932'''
|[[Mark Oliphant]]
|Building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments of [[Ernest Rutherford]] done a few years earlier, fusion of light nuclei (hydrogen isotopes) was first observed by Oliphant in 1932.  The steps of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars were subsequently worked out by Hans Bethe throughout the remainder of that decade.

|[[N. N. Semyonov]]
|Develops the total quantitative chain chemical reaction theory. The idea of the chain reaction, developed by Semyonov, is the basis of various high technologies using the incineration of gas mixtures. The idea was also used for the description of the nuclear reaction.
|- valign="top"
|'''1935'''
|[[Hideki Yukawa]]
|Published his hypothesis of the Yukawa Potential and predicted the existence of the [[pion]], stating that such a potential arises from the exchange of a massive scalar field, such as would be found in the field of the pion.  Prior to Yukawa's paper, it was believed that the scalar fields of the fundamental forces necessitated massless particles.

|'''1938'''
|[[Otto Hahn]], [[Fritz Strassmann]], [[Lise Meitner]], and [[Otto Robert Frisch]] 
|Hahn and Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons.  Simultaneously, they communicated these results to Meitner.  Meitner, and her nephew Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being nuclear fission.  Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.

|'''1947'''
|[[G. D. Rochester]] and [[C. C. Butler]]
|Published two cloud chamber photographs of cosmic ray-induced events, one showing what appeared to be a neutral particle decaying into two charged pions, and one which appeared to be a charged particle decaying into a charged pion and something neutral. The estimated mass of the new particles was very rough, about half a proton's mass. More examples of these "V-particles" were slow in coming, and they were soon given the name [[kaons]].

|[[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] and [[Julian Schwinger]]

|[[Clauss Jönsson]]
|Performed [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] [[double-slit experiment]] (1909) for the first time with particles other than photons by using electrons and with similar results, confirming that massive particles also behaved according to the [[wave–particle duality]] that is a fundamental principle of [[quantum field theory]].
|- valign="top"
|'''1964'''
|[[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]]
|Independently proposed the [[quark|quark model]] of hadrons, predicting the arbitrarily named [[Up quark|up]], [[Down quark|down]], and [[Strange quark|strange]] quarks.  Gell-Mann is credited with coining the term "quark", which he found in [[James Joyce]]'s book ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.
|- valign="top"
|'''1968'''
|[[Stanford University]]
|[[Deep inelastic scattering]] experiments at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) showed that the [[proton]] contained much smaller, point-like objects and was therefore not an elementary particle. Physicists at the time were reluctant to identify these objects with [[quarks]], instead calling them "partons" — a term coined by Richard Feynman.  The objects that were observed at SLAC would later be identified as [[Up quark|up]] and [[Down quark|down]] quarks.  Nevertheless, "parton" remains in use as a collective term for the constituents of [[hadrons]] (quarks, [[antiquarks]], and [[gluons]]).  The [[Strange quark|strange quark's]] existence was indirectly validated by the SLAC's scattering experiments: not only was it a necessary component of Gell-Mann and Zweig's three-quark model, but it provided an explanation for the [[kaon]] (K) and [[pion]] (π) hadrons discovered in cosmic rays in 1947.

|Performed [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] [[double-slit experiment]] (1909) using a single electron with similar results, confirming the existence of [[quantum field]]s for massive particles.

|'''1995'''
|[[Eric Cornell]], [[Carl Wieman]] and [[Wolfgang Ketterle]]
|The first "pure" Bose–Einstein condensate was created by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and co-workers at [[JILA]]. They did this by cooling a dilute vapor consisting of approximately two thousand rubidium-87 atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of laser cooling and magnetic evaporative cooling. About four months later, an independent effort led by Wolfgang Ketterle at [[MIT]] created a condensate made of sodium-23. Ketterle's condensate had about a hundred times more atoms, allowing him to obtain several important results such as the observation of quantum mechanical interference between two different condensates.

|'''2000'''
|[[CERN]]
|CERN scientists published experimental results in which they claimed to have observed indirect evidence of the existence of a [[quark–gluon plasma]], which they call a "new state of matter".
