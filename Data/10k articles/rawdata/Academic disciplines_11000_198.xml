In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture''' (also known as the '''Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture''' or the '''evasiveness conjecture''') is a group of related [[conjecture]]s about the number of questions of the form "Is there an edge between vertex ''u'' and vertex ''v''?" that have to be answered to determine whether or not an [[undirected graph]] has a particular property such as [[planar graph|planarity]] or [[bipartite graph|bipartiteness]]. They are named after [[Stål Aanderaa]], [[Richard M. Karp]], and [[Arnold L. Rosenberg]]. According to the conjecture, for a wide class of properties, no algorithm can guarantee that it will be able to skip any questions: any [[algorithm]] for determining whether the graph has the property, no matter how clever, might need to examine every pair of vertices before it can give its answer. A property satisfying this conjecture is called [[evasive Boolean function|evasive]].

More precisely, the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture states that any [[deterministic algorithm]] must test at least a constant fraction of all possible pairs of vertices, in the [[worst case analysis|worst case]], to determine any non-trivial monotone graph property; in this context, a property is monotone if it remains true when edges are added (so planarity is not monotone, but non-planarity is monotone). A stronger version of this conjecture, called the evasiveness conjecture or the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture, states that exactly {{nowrap|''n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}} tests are needed. Versions of the problem for [[randomized algorithm]]s and [[quantum algorithm]]s have also been formulated and studied.

The deterministic Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture was proven by {{harvtxt|Rivest|Vuillemin|1975}}, but the stronger Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture remains unproven. Additionally, there is a large gap between the conjectured lower bound and the best proven lower bound for randomized and quantum query complexity.

==Example==
The property of being non-empty (that is, having at least one edge) is monotone, because adding another edge to a non-empty graph produces another non-empty graph. There is a simple algorithm for testing whether a graph is non-empty: loop through all of the pairs of vertices, testing whether each pair is connected by an edge. If an edge is ever found in this way, break out of the loop, and report that the graph is non-empty, and if the loop completes without finding any edges, then report that the graph is empty. On some graphs (for instance the [[complete graph]]s) this algorithm will terminate quickly, without testing every pair of vertices, but on the [[empty graph]] it tests all possible pairs before terminating. Therefore, the query complexity of this algorithm is ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2: in the worst case, the algorithm performs ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 tests.

The algorithm described above is not the only possible method of testing for non-emptiness, but
the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture implies that every deterministic algorithm for testing non-emptiness has the same query complexity, ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2. That is, the property of being non-empty is ''evasive''. For this property, the result is easy to prove directly: if an algorithm does not perform ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 tests, it cannot distinguish the empty graph from a graph that has one edge connecting one of the untested pairs of vertices, and must give an incorrect answer on one of these two graphs.

==Definitions==
In the context of this article, all [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] will be [[simple graph|simple]] and [[undirected graph|undirected]], unless stated otherwise. This means that the edges of the graph form a set (and not a [[multiset]]) and each edge is a pair of distinct vertices. Graphs are assumed to have an [[implicit graph|implicit representation]] in which each vertex has a unique identifier or label and in which it is possible to test the adjacency of any two vertices, but for which adjacency testing is the only allowed primitive operation.

Informally, a [[graph property]] is a property of a graph that is independent of labeling. More formally, a graph property is a mapping from the set of all graphs to {0,1} such that isomorphic graphs are mapped to the same value. For example, the property of containing at least 1 vertex of degree 2 is a graph property, but the property that the first vertex has degree 2 is not, because it depends on the labeling of the graph (in particular, it depends on which vertex is the "first" vertex). A graph property is called non-trivial if it doesn't assign the same value to all graphs. For instance, the property of being a graph is a trivial property, since all graphs possess this property. On the other hand, the property of being empty is non-trivial, because the [[empty graph]] possesses this property, but non-empty graphs do not. A graph property is said to be [[Hereditary property#Monotone property|monotone]] if the addition of edges does not destroy the property. Alternately, if a graph possesses a monotone property, then every [[Glossary of graph theory#supergraph|supergraph]] of this graph on the same vertex set also possesses it. For instance, the property of being [[planar graph|nonplanar]] is monotone: a supergraph of a nonplanar graph is itself nonplanar. However, the property of being [[regular graph|regular]] is not monotone.

The [[big O notation]] is often used for query complexity. In short, ''f''(''n'') is O(''g''(''n'')) if for large enough ''n'', ''f''(''n'') ≤ ''c&amp;nbsp;g''(''n'') for some positive constant ''c''. Similarly, ''f''(''n'') is Ω(''g''(''n'')) if for large enough ''n'', ''f''(''n'') ≥ ''c&amp;nbsp;g''(''n'') for some positive constant ''c''. Finally, ''f''(''n'') is Θ(''g''(''n'')) if it is both O(''g''(''n'')) and Ω(''g''(''n'')).

==Query complexity==

The deterministic query complexity of evaluating a function on ''n'' bits (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the number of bits ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that have to be read in the worst case by a deterministic algorithm to determine the value of the function. For instance, if the function takes value 0 when all bits are 0 and takes value 1 otherwise (this is the [[Logical disjunction|OR]] function), then the deterministic query complexity is exactly ''n''. In the worst case, the first {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} bits read could all be 0, and the value of the function now depends on the last bit. If an algorithm doesn't read this bit, it might output an incorrect answer. (Such arguments are known as adversary arguments.) The number of bits read are also called the number of queries made to the input. One can imagine that the algorithm asks (or queries) the input for a particular bit and the input responds to this query.

The randomized query complexity of evaluating a function is defined similarly, except the algorithm is allowed to be randomized, i.e., it can flip coins and use the outcome of these coin flips to decide which bits to query. However, the randomized algorithm must still output the correct answer for all inputs: it is not allowed to make errors. Such algorithms are called [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s, which distinguishes them from [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s which are allowed to make some error. Randomized query complexity can also be defined in the Monte Carlo sense, but the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is about the Las Vegas query complexity of graph properties.

Quantum query complexity is the natural generalization of randomized query complexity, of course allowing quantum queries and responses. Quantum query complexity can also be defined with respect to Monte Carlo algorithms or Las Vegas algorithms, but it is usually taken to mean Monte Carlo quantum algorithms.

In the context of this conjecture, the function to be evaluated is the graph property, and the input is a string of size ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2, which gives the locations of the edges on an ''n'' vertex graph, since a graph can have at most ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 possible edges. The query complexity of any function is upper bounded by ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2, since the whole input is read after making ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 queries, thus determining the input graph completely.

==Deterministic query complexity==
For deterministic algorithms, {{Harvtxt|Rosenberg|1973}} originally conjectured that for all nontrivial graph properties on ''n'' vertices, deciding whether a graph possesses this property requires Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries. The non-triviality condition is clearly required because there are trivial properties like "is this a graph?" which can be answered with no queries at all.

[[File:Scorpion graph.svg|thumb|A scorpion graph. One of the three red path vertices is adjacent to all other vertices and the other two red vertices have no other adjacencies.]]
The conjecture was disproved by Aanderaa, who exhibited a directed graph property (the property of containing a "sink") which required only O(''n'') queries to test. A ''sink'', in a directed graph, is a vertex of indegree ''n''-1 and outdegree 0. This property can be tested with less than 3''n'' queries {{harv|Best|van Emde Boas|Lenstra|1974}}. An undirected graph property which can also be tested with O(''n'') queries is the property of being a scorpion graph, first described in {{harvtxt|Best|van Emde Boas|Lenstra|1974}}. A scorpion graph is a graph containing a three-vertex path, such that one endpoint of the path is connected to all remaining vertices, while the other two path vertices have no incident edges other than the ones in the path.

Then Aanderaa and Rosenberg formulated a new conjecture (the '''Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture''') which says that deciding whether a graph possesses a non-trivial monotone graph property requires Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Triesch|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conjecture was resolved by {{harvtxt|Rivest|Vuillemin|1975}} by showing that at least ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/16 queries are needed to test for any nontrivial monotone graph property. The bound was further improved to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/9 by {{Harvtxt|Kleitman|Kwiatkowski|1980}}, then to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4 - o(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by {{Harvtxt|Kahn|Saks|Sturtevant|1983}}, then to (8/25)''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - o(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by {{Harvtxt|Korneffel|Triesch|2010}}, and then to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3 - o(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by {{Harvtxt|Scheidweiler|Triesch|2013}}.

[[Richard Karp]] conjectured the stronger statement (which is now called the '''evasiveness conjecture''' or the '''Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture''') that "every nontrivial monotone graph property for graphs on ''n'' vertices is evasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lutz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A property is called ''evasive'' if determining whether a given graph has this property sometimes requires all ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kozlov|2008|pp=226&amp;ndash;228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture says that the best algorithm for testing any nontrivial monotone property must (in the worst case) query all possible edges. This conjecture is still open, although several special graph properties have shown to be evasive for all ''n''. The conjecture has been resolved for the case where ''n'' is a [[prime power]] by {{Harvtxt|Kahn|Saks|Sturtevant|1983}} using a [[Topological combinatorics|topological]] approach. The conjecture has also been resolved for all non-trivial monotone properties on bipartite graphs by {{harvtxt|Yao|1988}}. [[Minor (graph theory)|Minor]]-closed properties have also been shown to be evasive for large ''n'' {{harv|Chakrabarti|Khot|Shi|2001}}.

==Randomized query complexity==
Richard Karp also conjectured that Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries are required for testing nontrivial monotone properties even if randomized algorithms are permitted. No nontrivial monotone property is known which requires less than ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4 queries to test. A linear lower bound (i.e., Ω(''n'')) on all monotone properties follows from a very general [[Query complexity#Relationship between different models|relationship between randomized and deterministic query complexities]]. The first superlinear lower bound for all monotone properties  was given by {{harvtxt|Yao|1991}} who showed that Ω(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1/12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'') queries are required. This was further improved by {{harvtxt|King|1988}} to Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;5/4&lt;/sup&gt;), and then by {{Harvtxt|Hajnal|1991}} to&amp;nbsp;Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/3&lt;/sup&gt;). This was subsequently improved to the current best known lower bound (among bounds that hold for all monotone properties)  of Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'') by {{harvtxt|Chakrabarti|Khot|2001}}.

Some recent results give lower bounds which are determined by the critical probability ''p'' of the monotone graph property under consideration. The critical probability ''p'' is defined as the unique ''p'' such that a [[Erdős–Rényi model|random graph]] ''G''(''n'', ''p'') possesses this property with probability equal to 1/2. A random graph ''G''(''n'', ''p'') is a graph on ''n'' vertices where each edge is chosen to be present with probability ''p'' independent of all the other edges. {{Harvtxt|Friedgut|Kahn|Wigderson|2002}} showed that any monotone property with critical probability ''p'' requires &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\min\left\{\frac{n}{\min(p,1-p)},\frac{n^2}{\log n}\right\}\right)&lt;/math&gt; queries. For the same problem, {{Harvtxt|O'Donnell|Saks|Schramm|Servedio|2005}} showed a lower bound of Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/3&lt;/sup&gt;/''p''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;).

As in the deterministic case, there are many special properties for which an Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) lower bound is known.  Moreover, better lower bounds are known for several classes of graph properties. For instance, for testing whether the graph has a subgraph isomorphic to any given graph (the so-called [[subgraph isomorphism]] problem), the best known lower bound is Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) due to {{harvtxt|Gröger|1992}}.

==Quantum query complexity==
For bounded-error [[quantum query complexity]], the best known lower bound is Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1/6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'') as observed by Andrew Yao.&lt;ref&gt;The result is unpublished, but mentioned in {{Harvtxt|Magniez|Santha|Szegedy|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is obtained by combining the randomized lower bound with the quantum adversary method. The best possible lower bound one could hope to achieve is Ω(''n''), unlike the classical case, due to [[Grover's algorithm]] which gives an O(''n'') query algorithm for testing the monotone property of non-emptiness. Similar to the deterministic and randomized case, there are some properties which are known to have an Ω(''n'') lower bound, for example non-emptiness (which follows from the optimality of Grover's algorithm) and [[triangle finding problem|the property of containing a triangle]]. There are some graph properties which are known to have an Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) lower bound, and even some properties with an Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) lower bound. For example, the monotone property of nonplanarity requires Θ(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries {{harv|Ambainis|Iwama|Nakanishi|Nishimura|2008}} and the monotone property of containing more than half the possible number of edges (also called the majority function) requires Θ(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries {{Harv|Beals|Buhrman|Cleve|Mosca|2001}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">{{about|the satellite TV protocol|maritime vessel system|Automatic Transmitter Identification System (marine)}}
{{moreref|date=July 2008}}

The '''Automatic Transmitter Identification System''' ('''ATIS''') is a [[communications protocol]] used for the [[station identification]] of [[television channel]]s carried on [[satellite TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K.G. Johannsen|title=Automatic transmitter identification system|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|date=1992|volume=38|page=127-132|issn=0018-9316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATIS is only required for [[analog TV]] transmission and only via satellites or [[earth station]]s under [[United States]] jurisdiction. It is continuously repeated whilst an earth station is using a [[transponder]] on a satellite. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules for ATIS are set forth in [[CFR Title 47|47]] [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] §25.281.

The system was developed in response to the [[Captain Midnight (HBO)|"Captain Midnight"]] satellite jamming incident. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award#2009 Awards|Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]] for ATIS.

ATIS is a [[Morse code]] transmission sent on a [[subcarrier]] of 7.1&amp;nbsp;MHz and must activate automatically any time the station is transmitting. The [[center frequency]] must be no more than 25&amp;nbsp;kHz from this [[nominal value]] and the [[frequency deviation]] must be no more than 25&amp;nbsp;kHz peak when being [[modulation|modulated]]. Injection must be at a minimum of −26[[decibel|dB]] referenced to the [[unmodulated carrier]]. The [[pure tone|tone]] used to modulate the subcarrier is nominally 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, but may vary by as much as 800&amp;nbsp;Hz (400 to 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz).

The ATIS message is sent at a [[bit rate|transmission rate]] of 15 to 25 [[words per minute]] and must not exceed 30 seconds in its entire length. The message includes the FCC-assigned [[callsign]] of the earth station, its [[telephone number]], a ten-digit [[serial number]], and sometimes other information which is voluntary. The telephone number must immediately connect to personnel who can resolve [[radio interference]] and other [[frequency coordination]] issues. The serial number cannot be easily changed.

ATIS encoders must be included in the [[uplink]] [[airchain]] of all transmitters as of March 1, 1991 "in a method that cannot easily be defeated".

Other subcarriers piggybacked on the [[video]] carrier are also included in transmissions, often at 6.2&amp;nbsp;MHz and 6.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, just above the [[bandpass]] of the video signal (even if [[TV scrambling|scrambled]]). These carry left and right [[stereophonic|stereo]] audio and [[second audio program]], and sometimes [[radio station]]s or [[radio network]]s which may be unrelated to the [[TV network]]. [[Backhaul (broadcasting)|Backhaul]]s are too intermittent for such uses but may carry in-house private audio channels instead. Because all of these, including ATIS, are all audio, they can all be tuned by an analog [[TVRO]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. However, [[digital TV]] has overtaken analog because multiple channels can be transmitted on one transponder. These signals carry their station ID as [[data]] instead.

The '''Beaver Hall Group''' refers to a [[Montreal]]-based group of [[Canadians|Canadian]] painters who met in the late 1910s while studying art at a school run by the [[Art Association of Montreal]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Group is notable for its equal inclusion of men and women artists, as well as for its embrace of Jazz Age modernism.

All ten of the group's participants had studied under [[William Brymner]] (1855–1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of [[Randolph Stanley Hewton]], [[Edwin Holgate]], [[Mabel May]] and [[Lilias Torrance Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://artcore.ca/beaverhall.html&lt;/ref&gt; The group's name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the [[downtown Montreal]] studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included [[Mabel Lockerby]], [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]], and President of the group, [[A.Y. Jackson]].

The first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, [[A.Y. Jackson|Jackson]] emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel "with utter disregard for what
has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. 'Schools' and 'isms' do not trouble us," Jackson stressed, "individual expression is our chief concern".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; He identified its goals as being those of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the ''Montreal Gazette'' and ''La Presse'' gave generous coverage to the vernissage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO926-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The association only survived for two years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an information association into the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Nora McCullough's (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition "The Beaver Hall Hill Group". Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough's aim was to expose the talent of Quebec's women artists to western Canada. [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]] and [[A.Y. Jackson]] had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, ''1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group'' at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, "As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn't the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/correspondents/jazz-age-montreal-and-the-beaver-hall-group-canada-s-other-modernist-art-movement|title = Jazz Age Montreal and the Beaver Hall Group: Canada's Other Modernist Art Movement|date = December 14, 2015|accessdate = January 5, 2016|website = Magazine|publisher = National Gallery of Canada|last = Singhal|first = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7888">The '''Bem Sex-Role Inventory''' ('''BSRI''')&lt;!--Keep capitalized words capitalized--&gt; is a measure of [[gender expression]] and [[gender role]]s, put in terms of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]. It assesses how people identify themselves [[Psychology|psychologically]]. [[Sandra Bem]]'s goal of the BSRI was to examine psychological [[androgyny]] and provide [[empirical]] evidence to show the advantage of a shared masculine and feminine [[personality]] versus a sex-typed categorization.&lt;ref name="American Psychologist"&gt;American Psychologist (1977) "Sandra Lipsitz Bem: Early Career Award." ''American Psychologist'' (32)88-89&lt;/ref&gt; The test is formatted with 60 different [[Trait theory|personality traits]] which participants rate themselves based on a 7-point [[Likert scale]]. Traits are evenly dispersed, 20 masculine, 20 feminine, and 20 filler traits thought to be gender neutral.&lt;ref name="Bem"&gt;Bem &amp; Sandra Lipsitz (1981) "Bem Sex-Role Inventory" ''Mental Measurements Yearbook with Tests in Print'', (9)&lt;/ref&gt; All traits in the BSRI are positively valued personality aspects.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Aldora (1982) "Psychological Androgyny and Social Desirability" ''Journal of Personality Assessment'', (46)147&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous past studies have found that gender categorizations are [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with many stereotypical gendered behaviors.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

==History==
"In the field of psychology, much research is conducted involving individuals' perceptions of gender roles, and behavioral as well as attitudinal correlates.  Gender roles may be defined as "expectations about what is appropriate behavior for each sex".  One can also add to this definition the expectations which are held about appropriate personality characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cheryl L. Holt|author2=Jon. B. Ellis |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018836923919#page-2 |title=Assessing the Current Validity of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory  |date=1998-12-01 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |doi=10.1023/A:1018836923919 |volume=39 |journal=Sex Roles |pages=929–941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bem Sex-Role Inventory was created by [[Sandra Bem]] in an effort to measure androgyny. It was published in 1974. Stereotypical masculine and feminine traits were found by surveying 100 Stanford undergraduate students on which traits they found to be socially desirable for each sex.&lt;ref name="Bem" /&gt; The original list of 200 traits was narrowed down to the 40 masculine and feminine traits that appear on the present test.&lt;ref name="Gaa"&gt;Gaa, John P. &amp; Liberman, Dov. (1980) "Response Tendency on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory." ''The Journal of Psychology''. (2)259&lt;/ref&gt; Normative data was found from a 1973 sample for 444 males and 279 females and a 1978 sample of 340 females and 476 males all also from [[Stanford University]] undergraduates.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

==Scoring and interpretation==
Participants are asked to rate themselves on each trait using a Likert scale. One indicates never or almost never true, while a seven would indicate always or almost always true.&lt;ref name="Gaa"/&gt; Originally androgyny was calculated by finding the [[T-statistic|t-ratio]] difference between masculine and feminine scores; however, in 1981 Bem advises users to utilize a split [[median]] technique for more accurate scoring.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

The Bem Sex-Role Inventory offers four different possible resulting categorizations: masculine, feminine, androgynous and undifferentiated. Previously, an androgynous score was thought to be the result of equal masculine and feminine traits, while a sex-typed masculine or feminine score is the result of more traits belonging in one or the other category.The fourth type of score, undifferentiated, was seen as the result of extremely low masculine and feminine traits.

However, after the change in scoring technique, androgynous is the result of scoring above the median in both masculine and feminine categories. Sex-typed scores, masculine and feminine, are the result of scoring above the median in one gender and below the median in the other. An undifferentiated score is now a result of scoring below the median in both masculine and feminine categories. In other words, since scores are based on normative data, an androgynous classification occurs when a subject scores above 50% of the comparison group in both masculine and feminine categories, while a sex-typed classification is the result of scoring above half the comparison group in only one gender category.&lt;ref name="Sedney"&gt;Sedney, Mars Anne (1981) "Comments on Median Split Procedures for Scoring Androgyny Measures." ''Sex Roles'' (7)217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability and validity==
The BSRI is very empirically sound. Bem reports [[Cronbach's alpha|coefficient alphas]] of .78 for femininity scales and .87 for the masculinity scale. BSRI, also has demonstrated high [[Repeatability|test-retest reliability]].&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

However, since this is a [[self-report inventory]], how reliable the assessment is depends on how accurately participants rate themselves. An androgynous score is the result of extremely masculine and feminine scores and an undifferentiated score is the result of extremely low masculine and feminine scores. It has been theorized that perhaps tendencies to rate oneself extremely low and extremely high on traits can affect a subjects' resulting gender placement.&lt;ref name="Gaa"/&gt;

The degree of [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] of each scoring technique is up for debate. When comparing the old t ratio scoring to the newly endorsed median split technique, 42.3% of participants had a different resulting categorization. Since the median split method bases scores more heavily on the normative data of that population, a participant can be categorized differently based on the population of subjects they take the test with. For example, results may differ if the test was administered to a group of marines versus students at a private girls highschool. This challenges the test's between sample reliability.&lt;ref name="Sedney"/&gt; As stated by Elazae Pedhazur in a clip from his critique, "Bem concludes her discussion by stating, 'Finally, we urge investigators to further analyze their data without categorizing individual subjects in any way, i.e., through the use of multiple regression technique.' While endorsing what appears to be a suggestion to conduct studies within the framework of trait-treatment interactions, one cannot help wondering: Where has androgyny gone?"&lt;ref&gt;Pedhazur, Elazae. "Bem Sex Role Inventory: A Theoretical and Methodological Critique." Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (1979): 996-1016. EBSCOhost. Web. 13 Oct. 2013. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=ca8d7727-86ea-47e2-a191-8f083f23dcd3%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=1980-29271-001&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bem Sex-Role Inventory (short form)==
The short form of the BSRI consists of 30 items. It has a strong .90 correlation with the original BSRI. This short form of the test allows for increased [[internal consistency]]. Bem reports similar masculinity coefficient alphas and higher femininity coefficient alphas with this form. The short form discards the traits "feminine", "masculine", and "athletic" from the self-report scales. Specifically, the short form removed some feminine traits that could be seen as less socially desirable such as "gullible" and "childlike". Masculine categories depict "assertive-dominance" and "instrumentality", while feminine categories depict "nurtureness-interpersonal warmth" and "expressiveness".&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

[[File:BB at Purley Oaks (1964).jpg|thumb|The Brighton Belle passing Purley Oaks at speed in June 1964.]]
The '''''Brighton Belle''''' was a [[named train]] which was operated by the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] and subsequently by [[British Rail]] from [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] in London to [[Brighton]], on the Sussex coast. Commissioned as the flagship of the Southern Railway's mass electrification project, which commenced in January 1931, the world's only electric all-[[Pullman train (UK)|Pullman]] service ran daily between London Victoria and Brighton from 1 January 1933 until 30 April 1972.

==History==
The [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&amp;SCR) began using Pullman cars in its express trains in 1875, and in December 1881 they introduced the first all-Pullman train in the UK. Known as the ''Pullman Limited'', this ran between London Victoria and Brighton via [[Horsham]] and subsequently ordinary rolling stock was added to the service. In 1888 a second all-Pullman service was instituted, using cars lit by electricity and designed by [[William Stroudley]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Nicholas, The Brighton Belle, [http://www.southernelectric.org.uk/preservation/preserved-stock/preservationpull.html Southern Electric Group: Preserved Pullmans], Southern Electric Group (1972), p9&lt;/ref&gt;

The LB&amp;SCR was the origin of the British [[umber]] and cream Pullman livery. In 1903 [[R. J. Billinton]] changed the colour of the ordinary LB&amp;SCR coaches to umber brown with white or cream upper panels, and in 1906 this colour scheme was also adopted by the Pullman Car Co., with the name of the car in large gilt letters on the lower panel and flanked on each side by a coloured transfer of the Pullman Company's crest.

Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the ''Southern Belle''. Contemporary advertising by the LB&amp;SCR claimed that this was "... the most luxurious train in the world...". In 1908 this could be experienced for a special London Victoria to Brighton day return fare of 12 shillings, a premium rate at a time when average earnings were around £1 a week (or 20 shillings). The ''Southern Belle'' was steam hauled until 1 January 1933, when electric units were introduced. Trial trains had commenced running between London and Brighton on 2 November 1932, using an experimental five-coach unit (No. 2001) and examples of the new rolling stock were exhibited at London Victoria and Brighton stations from 29 December 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Antony, "Pullman Profile No. 4 - The Brighton Belle &amp; Southern Electric Pullmans" Noodle Books {{ISBN|978-1909328051}} (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the mid-day Victoria to Brighton service at Brighton Station on 29 June 1934, the Mayor of Brighton, Margaret Hardy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mayors from 1900 until 1990 {{!}} Corporation and Council {{!}} Topics {{!}} My Brighton and Hove|url = http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__8298.aspx|website = www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-03|first = Community Sites|last = (www.communitysites.co.uk)}}&lt;/ref&gt; renamed the train the ''Brighton Belle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brightonbelle.com/| title=Walk through "Hazel" on the Belle's 80th anniversary!| author=BBC News| date=June 29, 2013| website=Bringing Back the Brighton Belle| accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it retained this title until withdrawal. The service was scheduled to take 60 minutes for the 51-mile express journey.

Three five-car all-Pullman electric multiple units designated [[British Rail Class 403|5-BEL]] were commissioned by the Southern Railway as the flagship of the world's then-largest electrification project, which covered over 160 track miles. The 15 cars – built in 1932 by Metropolitan-Cammell at its Saltley works in Birmingham – were operated in trains comprising two units, the remaining unit normally held in reserve. The 'spare' multiple unit set was used for a Sunday Pullman service from [[Eastbourne]], known as the ''Eastbourne Pullman'' for much of the 1950s, but this service was discontinued in 1957.

During the [[Second World War]] the service was suspended after Unit 3052 was badly damaged by aerial bombing at London Victoria; all cars were placed in safe storage at [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|Crystal Palace (High Level) station]], but the service was progressively reinstated in 1946.

The trains were refurbished and overhauled in 1955, but by 1972 the stock was old and rode poorly by contemporary standards. Despite protests,&lt;ref&gt;Dunstone, Denis, For the Love of Trains, Ian Allan, {{ISBN|0-7110-3301-3}} (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the decision was taken not to replace the rolling stock and the service was withdrawn on 30 April 1972. Every car was preserved, in most cases to meet the ambitions of major breweries to 'bolt on' Pullman restaurants to pubs and hotels, although most were removed relatively quickly because of the high cost of maintenance and refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;"Farewell to the Belle". This is Cheshire.&lt;/ref&gt; A number were progressively acquired by the [[Venice Simplon Orient Express]], while one still remains in use as B&amp;B accommodation at the Little Mill Inn, Rowarth, Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelittlemill.co.uk/ Little Mill Inn, Rowarth]&lt;/ref&gt; Motor brake car 90 was used for passenger service on the [[Nene Valley Railway]] between 1980 and 1990, but was subsequently scrapped at Bury in 1995 following a series of arson attacks.

The Southern ran three Pullman trains with the suffix ''Belle''. The others were the ''[[Bournemouth Belle]]'' and the ''[[Devon Belle]]''. British Railways introduced the ''[[Thanet Belle]]'' (later renamed the ''Kentish Belle'') in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semgonline.com/misc/named_05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Cars 88 and 91 together again.JPG|thumb|Driving Cars 88 and 91 were coupled together for the very first time when the latter arrived at Rampart of Derby for restoration in September 2009.]]
A campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semgonline.com/coach/coupe/coupe066.pdf Coupe News (Journal of Pullman Car Services) No. 66, pp 24–25]&lt;/ref&gt; to return the ''Brighton Belle'' to mainline service was launched by the 5-BEL Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bringing Back The Brighton Belle|url = http://www.brightonbelle.com/|website = www.brightonbelle.com|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009. The trustees had been concerned for some time about the worrying state of electric train preservation in Britain and wanted to raise the profile of the issue and to deal with the issues of financial support and covered accommodation. The project was launched at the [[National Railway Museum]] following the acquisition of two of the surviving 14 cars; by early 2009 four out of the five cars needed to form a complete unit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernelectric.org.uk/preservation/preserved-stock/preservationpull.html Southern Electric Group: Preserved Pullmans]&lt;/ref&gt; had been acquired and the trust had set in place agreements to cover refurbishment of the cars, which began at Pullman restoration specialists Rampart Engineering at the [[Barrow Hill Engine Shed]] in February 2009.

When the 5-BEL project is completed, it will be returned to mainline service. Despite the high cost of the restoration (approaching £6 million) the programme is seen as an investment for future generations. Progress with the restoration of the ''Brighton Belle'' to mainline use will depend in part on the level of public donations. This is the first time that a complete train will have been restored in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=86207125bd754c522402e803e&amp;id=2a48594ecc&amp;e=6d9a0710ca 5BEL Trust Newsletter, March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; A short train of three cars will undergo mainline proving trials in the near future, with mainline excursions with a four car unit commencing upon testing success.&lt;ref&gt;[Heritage Railway magazine April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Train unit completed==

During February 2011, Driving Car 88 was displayed on the Brighton seafront to celebrate the acquisition of the Trust's fifth car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwayherald.co.uk/magazine/issueview.php?type=UK&amp;id=407 Railway Herald] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629132049/http://www.railwayherald.co.uk/magazine/issueview.php?type=UK&amp;id=407 |date=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth 5BEL car required was Pullman First ''Doris'', then based at the [[Bluebell Railway]] for the Bluebell's pullman rake, and thus a swap was arranged. The 5-BEL Trust had purchased ''Golden Arrow'' Pullman Kitchen Car ''Carina'' and supplied this to the Bluebell railway in exchange for ''Doris'', allowing the Bluebell Railway to complete a five-car all-Pullman ''Golden Arrow'' rake. ''Carina'' is of considerable heritage importance, having formed part of [[Winston Churchill]]'s funeral train which carried the principal mourners from London to [[Bladon]] on 30 January 1965.

The 5-BEL Trust said at the time that acquiring ''Doris'' as the trust's fifth car was not only the right move from a heritage standpoint but also it demonstrated the benefits of like-minded organisations working together. The following year, on 6 September 2012, the 5BEL Trust announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=October 2012 |issue=1338 |volume=158 |page=15 |title=Brighton Belle 'Hazel' to run again |editor-first=Nick |editor-last=Pigott |editor-link=Nick Pigott |issn=0033-8923 |publisher=Mortons Media Group |location=Horncastle }}&lt;/ref&gt; that, following two years of complex negotiations with the owners of the Black Bull at Moulton, near Richmond, it had purchased Pullman first 'Hazel' (no. 279) the previous month and had removed the car by road to the Brighton Belle shed at Barrow Hill. The car had been in continuous use as a highly praised restaurant since 1972 and her removal was an extremely delicate operation, involving the use of two of the largest mobile cranes in Britain. The acquisition of a second first class car, originally considered as an impossible outcome, permits the correct unit configuration of two motor brakes, two trailer kitchen firsts and a trailer parlour third, with a trailer held in reserve.

The '''CarbonFix Standard''' (CFS) is an initiative supported by over 60 organisations promotes the development of [[Afforestation|climate forestation]] projects to sequester [[carbon]] from the [[atmosphere]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The CarbonFix Standard is administered by CarbonFix, a non-profit association based in Germany.

The CarbonFix Standard has been favourably assessed in 2008, by the University of Canterbury, New Zealand and in 2009 by the Imperial College of London.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} CarbonPositive (2009) placed the CarbonFix Standard between the [[Voluntary Carbon Standard]] and the [[Climate, Community &amp; Biodiversity Alliance|CCB Standard]], "aiming for a best of both worlds approach".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==History==
The association CarbonFix was founded in 1999. In 2007, the association developed the first version of the CarbonFix Standard, which was presented at the [[World Climate Conference]] in [[Bali]], in December 2007. Since then, the standard has been revised several times.

==Structure==
The ''Terms'' section defines the technical wording used in the CarbonFix Standard.

The ''Criteria and Methodology'' section lists the criteria a project has to meet to become certified. Tree planting activities must take place on land which contained no forest before. Only projects which require the additional financial means from the sale of {{CO2}} credits will be certified. There must be [[Sustainable forest management|Sustainable Forest Management]]. [[CO2 fixation|{{CO2}}-Fixation]] is verified using  methodology based on the rules of the United Nations Climate Secretariat.

The ''Procedures'' of the CarbonFix Standard describes how to prepare project information and request [[certification]], how to sell  {{CO2}}-certificates, what fees CarbonFix charges and how {{CO2}}-certificates are placed into a carbon registry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6549">'''Conflict archaeology''' is a sub-discipline within [[archaeology]] focused on intergroup and intragroup conflict. Closely linked to [[battlefield archaeology]] and Military Sites Archaeology, conflict archaeology is developing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Nancy|editor=Thomas F. King|title=A Companion to Cultural Resource Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OUNw_jXhnkC&amp;pg=PT205|accessdate=30 September 2011|date=29 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9605-8|pages=205–|chapter=Historic Battlefields: Studying and Managing Fields of Conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an umbrella sub-discipline that encompasses these others, allowing for greater [[epistemological]] elasticity than other terms. Modern conflict archaeology deals with technological, social, cultural, psychological aspects of present conflicts. Unlike battlefield archaeology, modern conflict archaeology delves deeper into the anthropological study of the conflicts rather than the physical manifestations of the battles.As stated by Nicholas Saunders in his book entitled Beyond the Dead Horizon, "These complexities are generated partly by nature of modern wars/conflicts of industrialized intensity and they incorporate political and nationalistic motivations and notions of ethnicity and identity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to understand the modern-day conflict, it is important to recognize two fundamental issues:

1. Realize that each conflict is a multifaceted issue which incorporates many anthropological contexts of involved populations.

2. In order to understand the actual conflict, one must understand all facets of the motivating issues and their layers of conflict.

As stated by Saunders,"This multitude of issues makes modern conflict sites...multi-layered landscapes...that require robust interdisciplinary approaches."(Saunders, pg. x). Conflict archaeology addresses any type of issue regardless of size or effect, more importantly the residual effects felt from the conflict itself upon the surrounding populations. "In this view the constantly shifting multidimensional aftermaths of conflict are as important as the conflict themselves."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict archaeology is most strongly followed by some historical archaeologists in the [[United States]] and archaeologists of all time periods in [[Europe]]. Significant studies of conflict in [[North America]] predating the arrival of Europeans have been done, but these works are largely situated within regional, not thematic literature.

== A Case Study: The Bare Bones; body parts and conflict behavior ==

Within Saunders work, Susannah Callow's paper is presented as she analyzes the role in which body parts of the deceased act as key indicators of complex narratives of individual experiences during a conflict (i.e. politics, social status, personal memento etc.) as stated by allowing, "...the body is central to human experiences of modern warfare...material and human destruction...becomes a way of living material form to discourse and the body in pain is a vital component in battle to assert meaning and authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially our bodies act as physical manifestations of past conflicts. The physical effects that violence inflicts upon our bodies are allowed for the characterization of the surrounding conflict which was participated in. Our bodies tell us the human interaction enacted and the course of the conflict, whether one side was dominated in regards to another, based on physical evidence. As Callow states, "Permanent wounds such as scars or missing body parts convey messages about the success or failure of casing wounds to one another...and the military success of the individual who carries out such acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A primary component is that of dehumanization. "Dehumanization is the psychological term describing a process of denying the humanity or human characteristic of an individual/subgroup" Dehumanization is evident via acts of mutilation and is often revealed by the manner in which the dead are killed. This psychological process leads to the lack of restraint and often incites the celebration of death. Therefore, this is often illustrated by mass killings, genocides, use and disuse of parts and body part artifact construction. There are two major components of the dehumanization perspective:

1. Body parts are equivalent to material culture
This is expressed in the lynchings of the south in the late 18th century. These lynchings often featured a crowd oftentimes which would take and sell body parts of the deceased. These actions, as Callow states, "...conferred the stakes of belonging to the 'correct' group"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Deceased Individuals are viewed as waste.
For example, Nazi concentration camps often referred to the Jews as "loads or "merchandise" and resulted in the victims loss of identity. This is further emphasized as they were marked with numbers and herded like cattle. In the end disposal of their bodies were often mechanical oftentimes lacking proper post-mortem practices. Also, the deceased body parts were often used to create various commodities. For example, skulls were collected and sold for profit, skin was used to make leather  and human fat was used to make soap.
Therefore, it is through these examples that we realize that modern day conflicts are not limited to the battles and wars, but the psychological and anthropological interactions between various populations and the underlying motivations it exposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11683">The '''conservation and restoration of woodblock prints,''' is the process of caring for and repairing images made from a specific printing process involving using wooden reliefs to stamp or imprint an image onto paper. The process of creating [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] as Asian examples are known, or [[woodcut]]s as Western examples are called, has been known for many centuries, and many older prints have experienced aging and deterioration of the paper and colorants used.

== Common materials ==
=== Japanese woodblock prints ===
Woodblock prints from Japan are commonly printed on ''[[Japanese tissue|kozo]]'', paper made from mulberry tree fibers. Many pigments were derived from organic materials. For example, some blue hues were derived from [[dayflower]] petals. Other inorganic colorants, such as red lead, were also used.  &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Museum of Fine Arts|title=Conservation and Care of Museum Collections|date=2011|publisher=MFA Publications|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese woodblock prints ===
Fibers of Chinese woodblock prints come from five different plant groups: hemp, bark, rattan, bamboo, and grass. Fibers from these different groups were often combined, based on which plants were locally available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/RELACT/chinese_prints.pdf|title=Technology, treatment, and care of a Chinese wood block print|last=Tsai|first=Fei Wen|date=1997|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European woodcuts ===
European woodcuts such as Italian [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, were generally made of three materials: paper, pigment, and a pigment binder. Paper was generally thin, because woodcuts were made in larger batches, and were relatively cheap. The pigments were composed of both light-stable inorganic materials such as metals and earth compounds as well as organic colorants such as indigo. Both of these respond to environmental conditions different, and require different conservation treatments depending on the chemical composition. Binding agents for the pigments were oil-based and used to dry the inks more quickly. They were made from materials such as linseed oil and conifer resin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morenus|first=Linda Stiber|last2=Eng|first2=Charlotte W.|last3=Takahatake|first3=Naoko|last4=Rambaldi|first4=Diana C.|date=2015-11-01|title=16th- and 17th-Century Italian Chiaroscuro Woodcuts: Instrumental Analysis, Degradation, and Conservation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1945233015Y.0000000008|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=54|issue=4|pages=238–271|doi=10.1179/1945233015Y.0000000008|issn=0197-1360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==
[[File:Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12]][[File:Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|Print shows signs of fading. Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12]]
=== Light ===

Light has been known to fade pigments in woodblock prints, such as the colorant dayflower blue, found in many Japanese woodblock prints. [[Ultraviolet]] is the most damaging wavelength, yet even [[infrared]] can cause damage, especially because it also heats up prints when they are exposed to infrared waves. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2006|title=Conservation of Japanese Woodblock Prints: Display, Storage, and Treatment|jstor=42597791|journal=Impressions|volume=28|pages=60-75|last1=Fiske|first1=Betty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humidity ===

Paper and pigments are both very sensitive to changing humidity levels. If [[relative humidity]] falls lower than 35 percent, the paper can dry out and become brittle. If it reaches higher than 65 percent, the paper can become distorted. Furthermore, certain pigments can become more translucent in higher relative humidity. High fluctuations in relative humidity may cause the paper to experience stresses that could cause it to crack. Humidity can also aid the growth of pests and mold. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Heat ===
Heat can accelerate the rate of mechanical stresses in organic materials and cause the structure to become brittle or unstable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pollutants ===
Pollutants found in the air can interact with materials on woodblock prints and cause them to deteriorate at a quicker rate. For example, when exposed to sulfur-containing gases, red lead pigments will turn a metallic brown/black color.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Pests ===
Insects and pests can destroy woodblock prints by eating through the paper or leaving droppings that stain the paper. A common cause of holes in Japanese woodblock prints is the deathwatch beetle (''[[Deathwatch beetle|Xestobium rufovillosum]]''). These beetles were commonly found in wood used to build furniture in the [[Edo period]]. Woodblock prints that were stored on bookshelves, or other furniture infested with these beetles, also became infested themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Valérie|last2=Kamba|first2=Nobuyuki|last3=Tsuchiya|first3=Yuko|last4=Lin|first4=Huan-Shen|date=2013-09-01|title=A new approach to the conservation and presentation of ukiyo-e prints|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19455224.2013.828632|journal=Journal of the Institute of Conservation|volume=36|issue=2|pages=186–194|doi=10.1080/19455224.2013.828632|issn=1945-5224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventative Conservation ==
Preventative conservation, or [[collections care]], is a way of preventing deterioration of materials by reducing agents of deterioration. A good integrated pest management system as well as an HVAC system that filters for common pollutants have been known to reduce the damage woodblock prints receive. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Storage ===
The paper of woodblocks are often made of wood fibers and may react to non-archival quality storage materials. For example, if stored in paper folders, the prints can become acidic. Using acid-free storage materials can prevent these acidic processes. Storage materials such as folders or boxes can also prevent light from reaching the print, and further reduce damage to light-sensitive materials.

=== Display ===
Ultraviolet-filtered, Plexiglas-glazed frames do little to protect woodblock prints from light damage over time. Museums often limit the display of woodblock prints, such as not exposing them to light for more than three weeks at light levels of 50 [[lux]] and keep relative humidity at 50 percent ± 5 percent. It is recommended to slowly acclimate prints to any difference in temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Restoration and Treatment ==
=== Spots and Stains ===
One method, called a blotter wash, can help to remove stains. This process involves applying a solution (such as a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water) onto the areas affected by stains, spray rinsing the print in order to rinse off the solution, and then [[Blotting paper|blotting]] it dry. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awjg5IhVX-Y|title=blotter wash of woodcut on thin paper|last=Owen|first=Bryan|date=2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many processes for removing stains could be highly detrimental to the paper, the pigment, or both. Water washing techniques such as immersion, floating, or suction table may cause the ink to run. Some organic colorants may even dissolve when exposed to water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Holes and Losses ===
Holes should be repaired using infilling. This is the process of adhering a separate piece of paper over the holes. Oftentimes adhesives are added that can be easily removed.

=== Stripping and Demounting ===
Demounting is the process of removing a print from the mounting material. This is often done because older mounts were usually made from acidic paper materials that can deteriorate the paper or fade colorants. Mounts are usually adhered to prints through adhesive agents that can cause yellow distortions on the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/annualmeeting/5-characterizationoftraditional.pdf|title=Characterization of traditional Japanese colorants in woodblock printing using multispectral imaging|last=Edwards|first=Gwenanne|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Flattening ===
Dry flattening the paper of a print can sometimes remove signs of [http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Cockling cockling], [http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Crease creasing], or wrinkling, In this process, the print is laid flat on a surface, and the weight of another object is used to add even pressure across the print. Sometimes flattening can be unnecessary, such as when storing items in a folder may be suitable instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Stephanie|date=2002|title=Practical Considerations for Humidifying and Flattening Paper|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v21/bp21-15.pdf|journal=The Book and Paper Group Annual 21|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humidity flattening techniques often involve using humidity to help flatten paper objects; however, this technique can cause further damage to prints that have [[water-soluble]] colorants.

== Restoration Projects ==

=== Antonio da Trento's ''Martyrdom of Two Saints'' ===
[https://unframed.lacma.org/2016/02/04/examination-and-conservation-antonio-da-trento%E2%80%99s-martyrdom-two-saints The Martyrdom of Two Saints] from the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] is an Italian chiaroscuro woodcut by [[Antonio da Trento]] that had cuts in the support. When conservators looked more closely at this artwork in 2016, they also saw unusual discolorations that proved that newer materials were used to conserve the piece in the past, and the added colorants faded at a much slower rate than the original colorants, leaving much darker stains. In order to restore da Tento's print, conservators infilled the support with new paper and masked the newer overpaint with pigments that more closely matched the rest of the print's colors as seen today.

=== Torii Kiyonaga's ''Two Beauties under a Cherry Tree'' ===
[https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/japanesepillar/index.html Two Beauties under a Cherry Tree] is a pillar print, a tall and narrow print used to hang in front of traditional Japanese pillars. It is housed at the Library of Congress, and underwent conservation in 2012 for the exhibit, [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/cherry-blossoms/ Sakura: Cherry Blossoms as Living Symbols of Friendship.] This print was brittle, acidic, discolored, and tearing due to light and pollutants exposure as well as a previous restoration with acidic materials. When it underwent conservation treatment, the print's previous mount was stripped. The print was washed in a calcium solution that reversed some yellow discoloration. In addition, an oxidizing solution was added to red lead colorants that had turned black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/japanesepillar/index.html|title=Conservation Treatment of a Japanese Pillar Print|last=Karnes|first=Cyntia|date=2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crown sprouting''' is the ability of a [[plant]] to regenerate its [[shoot|shoot system]] after destruction (usually by fire) by activating dormant vegetative structures to produce regrowth from the [[root crown]] (the junction between the root and shoot portions of a plant).&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Sampson&lt;/ref&gt; These dormant structures take the form of [[lignotuber]]s or basal [[epicormic buds]]. Plant species that can accomplish crown sprouting are called '''crown resprouters''' (distinguishing them from [[Resprouter|stem or trunk resprouters]]) and, like them, are characteristic of fire-prone habitats such as [[chaparral]].&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knox, Kirsten J. E. |author2=Morrison, David A. | year = 2005 | title = Effects of inter-fire intervals on the reproductive output of resprouters and obligate seeders in the Proteaceae | journal = Austral Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–413 | doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01482.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to plant fire survival strategies that decrease the [[flammability]] of the plant, or by requiring heat to [[germinate]], crown sprouting allows for the total destruction of the above ground growth. Crown sprouting plants typically have extensive root systems in which they store nutrients allowing them to survive during fires and sprout afterwards. Early researchers suggested that crown sprouting species might lack species genetic diversity; however, research on [[Gondwana]]n shrubland{{Clarify|date=March 2011|reason=What is a "Gondwanan shrubland"?  The linked article of "Gondwana" does not mention it.}} suggests that crown sprouting species have similar genetic diversity to seed sprouters.&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Bond, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[genus|genera]], such as ''[[Arctostaphylos]]'' and ''[[Ceanothus]]'', have species that are both resprouters and not, both adapted to fire.

[[California Buckeye]], ''[[Aesculus californica]]'', is an example of a western United States tree which can regenerate from its root crown after a fire event, but can also regenerate by seed.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8696">'''Deuterium fusion''', also called '''deuterium burning''', is a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction that occurs in stars and some [[substellar object]]s, in which a [[deuterium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and a [[proton]] combine to form a [[helium-3]] nucleus. It occurs as the second stage of the [[proton–proton chain reaction]], in which a deuterium nucleus formed from two [[proton]]s fuses with another proton, but can also proceed from [[big bang nucleosynthesis|primordial]] deuterium.

==In protostars==
Deuterium is the most easily fused nucleus available to accreting [[protostar]]s,&lt;ref name="ZuckermanMalkan"&gt;{{Cite book

If there was no deuterium fusion, there would be no stars with masses more than about two or three times the mass of the [[Sun]] in the pre-[[main-sequence]] phase as the more intense [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|hydrogen fusion]] would occur and prevent the object from accreting matter.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt; Deuterium fusion allows further accretion of mass by acting as a thermostat that temporarily stops the central temperature from rising above about one million degrees, a temperature not hot enough for hydrogen fusion, but allowing time for the accumulation of more mass.&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 9780521801058}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the energy transport mechanism switches from convective to radiative, energy transport slows, allowing the temperature to rise and hydrogen fusion take over in a stable and sustained way. Hydrogen fusion will begin at {{val|e=7|u=K}}.

The rate of energy generation is proportional to (deuterium concentration)×(density)×(temperature)&lt;sup&gt;11.8&lt;/sup&gt;. If the core is in a stable state, the energy generation will be constant. If one variable in the equation increases, the other two must decrease to keep energy generation constant. As the temperature is raised to the power of 11.8, it would require very large changes in either the deuterium concentration or its density to result in even a small change in temperature.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"/&gt; The deuterium concentration reflects the fact that the gasses are a mixture of ordinary hydrogen and helium and deuterium.

The mass surrounding the radiative zone is still rich in deuterium, and deuterium fusion proceeds in an increasingly thin shell that gradually moves outwards as the radiative core of the star grows. The generation of nuclear energy in these low-[[density]] outer regions causes the protostar to swell, delaying the gravitational contraction of the object and postponing its arrival on the main sequence.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt; The total energy available by deuterium fusion is comparable to that released by gravitational contraction.&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"/&gt;

Due to the scarcity of deuterium in the [[Universe]], a protostar's supply of it is limited. After a few million years, it will have effectively been completely consumed.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{Cite book

[[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|Hydrogen fusion]] requires much higher temperatures and pressures than does deuterium fusion, hence, there are objects massive enough to burn deuterium but not massive enough to burn hydrogen.

Objects above the deuterium-fusion minimum mass (deuterium burning minimum mass, DBMM) will fuse all their deuterium in a very short time (∼4–50 Myr), whereas objects below that will burn little, and hence, preserve their original deuterium abundance. "The apparent identification of free-floating objects, or [[rogue planet]]s below the DBMM would suggest that the formation of star-like objects extends below the DBMM."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Deuterium Burning in Substellar Objects|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/542/2/L119/fulltext/005577.text.html|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=542|issue=2|pages=L119|accessdate=2 January 2015|bibcode=2000ApJ...542L.119C|last1=Chabrier|first1=G.|last2=Baraffe|first2=I.|last3=Allard|first3=F.|last4=Hauschildt|first4=P.|year=2000|doi=10.1086/312941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In planets==
It has been shown that deuterium fusion should also be possible in planets. The mass threshold for the onset of deuterium fusion atop the solid cores is also at roughly 13 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mollière|first1=P.|last2=Mordasini|first2=C.|title=Deuterium burning in objects forming via the core accretion scenario|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|date=7 November 2012|volume=547|pages=A105|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201219844|arxiv = 1210.0538 |bibcode = 2012A&amp;A...547A.105M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Peter|last2=D'Angelo|first2=Gennaro|last3=Lissauer|first3=Jack J.|last4=Fortney|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Saumon|first5=Didier|title=Deuterium Burning in Massive Giant Planets and Low-mass Brown Dwarfs Formed by Core-nucleated Accretion|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 June 2013|volume=770|issue=2|pages=120|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/120|arxiv = 1305.0980 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...770..120B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other reactions==

Though fusion with a proton is the dominant method of consuming deuterium, other reactions are possible. These include fusion with another deuterium nucleus to form [[helium-3]], [[tritium]], or (more rarely) [[helium-4]], or with helium to form various [[isotopes of lithium|isotopes]] of [[lithium]].&lt;ref name="RolfsRodney"&gt;{{Cite book

The [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit organisation]] works to co-operatively address technology-related skills issues through [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based]] advice, services and programmes.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt; It is led by its [[Advocacy group|constituency]], to operate in the interests of employers by ensuring that the UK is equipped to compete in the worldwide [[digital economy]].&lt;ref name="business"&gt;{{cite web|title=About e-skills UK|url=http://www.businessitguide.com/page/about-us/|work=Business IT Guide – IT explained|publisher=e-skills UK|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2000–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

e-skills UK aims to address the current and future needs of the Business and Information Technology sector in the UK, including [[skills shortage]]s and [[gender inequality]] in the UK IT industry. The group publishes the ''e-skills Bulletin'', and the ''Regional Gap-UK'' report on [[skills gap]]s. The ''Technology Insights'' report details which skills are most needed.

The group has also developed sets of qualifications for IT workers. The group devised the e-skills passport and IT User Qualification (ITQ) qualifications, as its [[National Occupational Standards]].  

==History==
e-skills UK existed in name before 2003 as one of the [[National Training Organisation]]s (NTO). Their website was launched in 2000.

The National Training Organisations became the Sector Skills Councils (SSC) in April 2003. SSCs were started by the [[Sector Skills Development Agency]], under the leadership of chief executive being Christopher Duff. The numbers of the organisations reduced to 23, and funding was increased. e-skills UK was one of the first Councils to be formed. e-skills UK was initially given a five-year licence to be the SSC for the IT and Telecoms industry, under the leadership of Karen Price.&lt;ref name=price/&gt; In March 2005 e-skills UK was one of four SSCs to publish their first Sector Skills Agreement, outlining what they hoped to realistically achieve; the other councils to publish agreements at that time were the Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies (SEMTA), [[Skillset]] and [[ConstructionSkills]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Computer Clubs for Girls, or CC4G, began in [[South East England]] in 2002, designed to educate girls about the potential of technology. The pilot scheme started in 280 schools, with £2.8&amp;nbsp;million funding by SEEDA, and run by Melody Hermon. Computer Clubs for Girls was launched nationwide on 14 June 2005 for girls aged 10–14 at 3,600 schools, and cost £8.5&amp;nbsp;million. By 2006, around 1,000 schools had registered and 58,000 girls were in the scheme.

In the [[2006 Birthday Honours]] Karen Price, chief executive officer of e-skills UK, received an [[Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire (OBE)]].&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/58014/supplement/1|title=Birthday Honours List 2006|last=|first=|date=17 June 2006|website=The Gazette Official Public Record|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, e-skills UK was rated 'outstanding'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100806153725/http://www.ukces.org.uk//upload/pdf/090422%20Final%20e-skills%20UK%20Recommendation%20UPDATED%20WITH%20INTRO.pdf|title=SSC Relicensing Panel Recommendation - e-skills UK|last=|first=|date=16 July 2009|website=The National Archives - UKCES|publisher=UK Government|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the process to re-license Sector Skills Councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100806151741/http://www.ukces.org.uk/sector-skills-councils/ssc-relicensing-process/relicensing-decisions/|title=SSC Relicensing Decisions|last=|first=|date=6 August 2010|website=The National Archives - UKCES|publisher=UK Government|access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, e-skills UK developed a £5.6&amp;nbsp;million scheme with the [[Open University]] called ''Vital'', to train school teachers on technology in a form of [[continuing professional development]] (CPD). Vital was launched at the annual [[BETT]] [[Trade fair|trade show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.vital.ac.uk|work=vital|publisher=Open University|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 e-skills UK, [[Google]] and [[BT Group]] formed the [[Getting British Business Online]] project (GBBO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.gbbo.co.uk|work=Getting British Business Online|publisher=Google|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the group reported that the UK IT industry was around 8% of the UK economy,&lt;ref name=eskills-insights&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.e-skills.com/insights2010 | title = IT &amp; Telecoms Insights 2010 | publisher = e-skills UK | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered 5.7% of the working population (IT and telecoms). 860,000 persons worked in the IT industry, plus another approximately 680,000 in IT-related positions. The report concluded that "continued adoption and exploitation of IT &amp; Telecoms technologies could generate an additional £35&amp;nbsp;billion to the UK economy."&lt;ref name=eskills-insights/&gt;

'''''Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi''''' is a [[sculpture]] created by American artist [[Richard Serra]]. Originally created in 1986 for the [[Reina Sofia Museum]], the sculpture was put into storage in 1988. In 2006, the museum admitted that they had lost the sculpture and had no idea where it was. Serra created a replicate sculpture which is currently on display in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/equal-parallel-guernica-bengasi|title=Equal-Parallel: Guernica-Bengasi |website=museoreinasofia.es |publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the [[Reina Sofia Museum]] for the exhibition 'Referencias: Un encuentro artístico en el tiempo' (''References: An artistic encounter in time''), which took place between 26 May-15 September 1986.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4626502.stm|title= Madrid 'mislays' Serra sculpture|date=19 January 2006 |website= bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News |access-date=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 January 2006 |title=El Reina Sofía ha 'perdido' una escultura de 38 toneladas que dejó en depósito hace 14 años | url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/01/18/cultura/1137601181.html |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serra was paid $200,000 for the art work, which weighed 38 tonnes.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In March 1988, the sculpture was placed into storage with the company Fluiters S.A., who specialized in the storage of works of art. In November 1990, the sculpture was taken out of storage and placed back on display briefly. On 25 November 1990 the sculpture was placed back into storage with the company Macarrón S.A. According to museum documentation, the sculpture was still in the storage through the year 1992.

In October 2005, the museum director Ana Martínez de Aguilar wanted to display the sculpture and found that it could not be located.&lt;ref name="EM" /&gt; The company it had been stored with had gone into receivership in 1998 and the sculpture could not be accounted for. The [[ABC (newspaper)|Spanish newspaper ''ABC'']] speculated that the sculpture may have been sold for scrap metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tremlett|first= Giles|date=19 January 2006 |title=Museum discovers loss of 38-tonne sculpture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/19/arts.spain|work=The Guardian |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the museum made a deal with Serra to create a [[replica]] of the original. In 2009 the replica was reinstated in the museum and is currently exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 February 2009 |title=La escultura robada de richard serra vuelve a verse desde manana en el reina sofía en una réplica gemela |url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/sociedad/noticias/1025919/02/09/La-escultura-robada-de-richard-serra-vuelve-a-verse-desde-manana-en-el-reina-sofia-en-una-replica-gemela.html |work=El Economist |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date=5 December 2017|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">'''Extended order''' is an [[economics]] and [[sociology]] concept introduced by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]''. It is a description of what happens when a system embraces [[Specialization (functional)|specialization]] and [[trade]] and "constitutes an information gathering process, able to call up, and put to use, widely [[dispersed knowledge|dispersed information]] that no [[central planning]] agency, let alone any individual, could know as a whole, possess or control.”&lt;ref name="Hayek"&gt;Hayek, F.A. "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism". The University of Chicago Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} The result is an interconnected web where people can benefit from the actions and knowledge of those they don't know. This is possible and efficient because a proper [[law|legal]] framework replaces [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], which is only practical in small circles of people who know each other socially. The extended order is at the heart of Hayek's thesis, in ''The Fatal Conceit'', where he argues that "our civilization depends, not only for its origin but also for its preservation, on what can be precisely described only as the extended order of human cooperation, an order more commonly, if somewhat misleading, known as [[capitalism]].”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Development of the extended order in society==
The ''extended order'' "is a framework of institutions – economic, legal, and moral – into which we fit ourselves by obeying certain rules of conduct that ''we never made'', and which ''we have never understood'' in the sense of which we understand how the things that we manufacture function.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|14}} This "order resulted ''not'' from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional &amp; largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection – the comparative increase in population &amp; wealth – of those groups that happened to follow them.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The adoption of these practices, by these groups, “increased their access to valuable information of all sorts, &amp; enabled them to be 'fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The extended order's formation “required individuals to change their ‘natural’ or instinctual’ responses to others, something strongly resisted", whereas any &amp; all "constraints on the practices of the small group, it must be emphasized &amp; repeated, are ''hated''.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is because man “knows so many objects that seem desirable but for which he is not permitted to grasp, and he cannot see how other beneficial features of his environment depend on the discipline to which he is forced to submit – a discipline forbidding him to reach out for these same appealing objects. Disliking these constraints so much, we can hardly be said to have selected them; rather, these constraints selected us: they enabled us to survive.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

The evolutionary process of the extended order can be stimulated by increases in individual freedom and has even realized some of its greatest advances during times of anarchy, however it can (and quite often has throughout history) been hindered by government constraint, as Hayek says, "Protection of several property, not the direction of its use by government, laid the foundations for the growth of the dense network of exchange of services that shaped the extended order."&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The extended order is "not a creation of man's reason but a distinct second endowment conferred on him by cultural evolution."&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|52}}

Not being genetically transferred, the continuing cultural evolution of the extended order requires teaching &amp; passing on to each new generation the prevailing traditions, customs, morality &amp; rules.&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|25}} This cultural evolutionary requirement was also analyzed by [[Will Durant|Will]] and [[Ariel Durant]] who said: "Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again."&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant and Ariel Durant, "[[The Lessons of History]]". Simon &amp; Schuster. 1968; p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Thermophile]]s, a type of extremophile, produce some of the bright colors of [[Grand Prismatic Spring]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]
An '''extremophile''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|extremus}}'' meaning "extreme" and Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|philiā}}'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}}) meaning "love") is an [[organism]] that thrives in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment|extreme conditions]] that are detrimental to most [[life|life on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rampelotto | first1 = P.

==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that [[microbial life]] has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot, for example—that would be completely inhospitable to [[complex organisms]]. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far under the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration Rover Launches - Press kit |accessdate=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe, each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as [[polyextremophile]]s. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as ''Thermococcus barophilus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1999 | title = Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | doi = 10.1099/00207713-49-2-351 | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 351–359 | pmid=10319455 | last1 = Marteinsson | first1 = VT | last2 = Birrien | first2 = JL | last3 = Reysenbach | first3 = AL | last4 = Vernet | first4 = M | last5 = Marie | first5 = D | last6 = Gambacorta | first6 = A | last7 = Messner | first7 = P | last8 = Sleytr | first8 = UB | last9 = Prieur | first9 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the [[Atacama Desert]] might be a [[radioresistant]] [[xerophile]], a [[psychrophile]], and an [[oligotroph]]. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low [[pH]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Ajar Nath|last2=Verma|first2=Priyanka|last3=Kumar|first3=Murugan|last4=Pal|first4=Kamal K.|last5=Dey|first5=Rinku|last6=Gupta|first6=Alka|last7=Padaria|first7=Jasdeep Chatrath|last8=Gujar|first8=Govind T.|last9=Kumar|first9=Sudheer|date=2014-05-31|title=Diversity and phylogenetic profiling of niche-specific Bacilli from extreme environments of India|journal=Annals of Microbiology|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=611–629|doi=10.1007/s13213-014-0897-9|issn=1590-4261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms===
; [[Acidophile (organisms)|Acidophile]]: An organism with optimal growth at [[pH]] levels of 3 or below

; [[Alkaliphile]]: An organism with optimal growth at [[pH]] levels of 9 or above

; [[Anaerobe]]: An organism that does not require [[oxygen]] for growth such as ''[[Spinoloricus cinzia]]''. Two sub-types exist: [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobe]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]. A facultative anaerobe can tolerate anaerobic and aerobic conditions; however, an obligate anaerobe would die in the presence of even trace levels of oxygen

; [[Cryptoendolith]]: An organism that lives in microscopic spaces within rocks, such as pores between aggregate grains; these may also be called [[endolith]], a term that also includes organisms populating fissures, [[aquifer]]s, and faults filled with groundwater in the deep subsurface

; [[Halophile]]: An organism requiring at least 0.2[[molarity|M]] concentrations of salt ([[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]) for growth&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchioli, R. &amp; Thomas, T. 2000. Extremophiles. In: J. Lederberg. (ed.) Encyclopedia of Microbiology, Second Edition, Vol. 2, pp. 317–337. Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Hyperthermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures above 80&amp;nbsp;°C, such as those found in hydrothermal systems

; [[Hypolith]]: An organism that lives underneath rocks in cold deserts

; [[Lithoautotroph]]: An organism (usually bacteria) whose sole source of [[carbon]] is [[carbon dioxide]] and exergonic inorganic [[oxidation]] ([[chemolithotrophs]]) such as ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]''; these organisms are capable of deriving energy from reduced mineral compounds like [[pyrite]]s, and are active in [[geochemical cycle|geochemical cycling]] and the weathering of parent [[bedrock]] to form soil

; [[Metallotolerant]]: Capable of tolerating high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution, such as [[copper]], [[cadmium]], [[arsenic]], and [[zinc]]; examples include ''[[Ferroplasma]] sp.,'' ''[[Cupriavidus metallidurans]]'' and [[GFAJ-1]]&lt;ref name='refute'&gt;{{cite news | title = Studies refute arsenic bug claim | date = 9 July 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18770964 | work = BBC News | accessdate =10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= GFAJ-1 Is an Arsenate-Resistant, Phosphate-Dependent Organism |journal=Science |date=8 July 2012 |id= |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/07/06/science.1218455 |accessdate =10 July 2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1218455 |pmid=22773139 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |pages=467–70 |last1=Erb |first1=Tobias J. |last2=Kiefer |first2=Patrick |last3=Hattendorf |first3=Bodo |last4=Günther |first4=Detlef |last5=Vorholt |first5=Julia A.|author5-link=Julia Vorholt|bibcode = 2012Sci...337..467E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Absence of Detectable Arsenate in DNA from Arsenate-Grown GFAJ-1 Cells |journal=Science |date=8 July 2012 |id= |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/07/06/science.1219861 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1219861 |pmid=22773140 |pmc=3845625 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |pages=470–3 |last1=Reaves |first1=Marshall Louis |last2=Sinha |first2=Sunita |last3=Rabinowitz |first3=Joshua D. |last4=Kruglyak |first4=Leonid |last5=Redfield |first5=Rosemary J.|arxiv = 1201.6643 |bibcode = 2012Sci...337..470R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Oligotroph]]: An organism capable of growth in nutritionally limited environments

; [[Osmophile]]: An organism capable of growth in environments with a high sugar concentration

; [[Piezophile]]: Also referred to as [[barophile]], is an organism that lives optimally at high [[pressure]]s such as those deep in the ocean or underground;&lt;ref name="DworkinFalkow2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dworkin|first1=Martin|last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley|title=The Prokaryotes: Vol. 1: Symbiotic Associations, Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqh43LFTGBQC&amp;pg=PA94|date=13 July 2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-25476-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; common in the deep terrestrial subsurface, as well as in [[oceanic trench]]es. Piezophilic organisms live under conditions of extreme pressure. High pressures can cause proteins to fold into themselves. Piezophiles have less large bulky amino acids that would take up space and prevent the other amino acids from coming close enough to create the reinforced area around the core.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Lewis|  first2=Hunter|last3=Trejo| first3=Eric| last4=Winston| first4=Vern| last5=Evilia|first5=Caryn| title=Protein Adaptations in Archaeal Extremophiles|journal=Archaea|volume=2013| url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2013/373275/|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2013/373275|pmid=24151449|pmc=3787623|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Polyextremophile: A '''polyextremophile''' (faux Ancient Latin/Greek for 'affection for many extremes') is an organism that qualifies as an extremophile under more than one category

; [[Psychrophile]]/Cryophile: An organism capable of survival, growth or reproduction at temperatures of -15&amp;nbsp;°C or lower for extended periods; common in cold soils, [[permafrost]], [[polar ice]], cold ocean water, and in or under alpine snowpack. Psychrophilic organisms live in environments at temperature below -15&amp;nbsp;°C. Low temperatures cause the energy within proteins to slow, which prevents them from functioning.  Their proteins have adapted their amino acid composition to live in  cold conditions. They have a high amount of [[glycine]] amino acids, which small size allows for more flexibility within the protein once it is folded. Psychrophiles also have a low concentration of charged amino acids, hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids, and proline residues. The low amount of charged amino acids reduces the amount of interactions between them, while the reduced amount of hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids allows the non-polar core of the protein to be smaller. Psychrophilic proteins have a small amount of [[proline]] amino acids because they cause a rigid structure. These adaptations allow psychrophilic proteins to be more flexible so they do not freeze under cold conditions.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Radioresistant]]: Organisms resistant to high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], most commonly ultraviolet radiation, but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation

; [[Thermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 45–122&amp;nbsp;°C. Normally high temperatures cause proteins to unfold and prevent them from functioning; thermophilic proteins have adapted their proteins to cope with these conditions. They have a higher amount of [[cysteine]] amino acids, which form [[disulfide bond]]s once the protein has folded. These disulfide bonds cause the protein to fold up tighter and become more rigid. They also have more charged amino acids, both positive and negative, that interact with each other to increase how rigid the protein is. When proteins become more rigid they are less likely to unfold due to high temperature. Even one extra disulfide bond can raise the temperature at which the protein folds by 6&amp;nbsp;°C. These adapted proteins allow thermophilic extremophiles to survive at high temperatures.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Thermoacidophile]]: Combination of [[thermophile]] and [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]] that prefer temperatures of 70–80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH between 2 and 3

; [[Xerophile]]: An organism that can grow in extremely dry, desiccating conditions; this type is exemplified by the soil microbes of the [[Atacama Desert]]
&lt;!--; [[GFAJ-1]]: An [[organism]] in the family [[Halomonadaceae]] that can tolerate extreme levels of [[arsenic]], but [[GFAJ-1]] can go a step further. When starved of [[phosphorus]], it can incorporate [[arsenic]] into its [[DNA]] and continue growing.--&gt;

== In astrobiology ==
[[Astrobiology]] is the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]: [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth]]. Astrobiology makes use of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[solar physics]], [[biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[ecology]], [[planetary science]], [[geography]], and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.

For example, analogous deserts of [[Antarctica]] are exposed to harmful [[UV radiation]], low temperature, high salt concentration and low mineral concentration. These conditions are similar to those on [[Mars]]. Therefore, finding viable microbes in the subsurface of Antarctica suggests that there may be microbes surviving in [[Endolith|endolithic communities]] and living under the Martian surface. Research indicates it is unlikely that Martian microbes exist on the surface or at shallow depths, but may be found at subsurface depths of around 100 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Wynn-Williams|first1=D.

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in [[Japan]] involved a variety of [[bacteria]] including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of [[prokaryotic cell]]s is essential for successful growth under [[hypergravity]]. The research has implications on the feasibility of [[panspermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |website=National Geographic- Daily News|publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru |author2=Hirokazu Shimoshige, Mikiko Tsudome, Sada-atsu Mukai, Robert W.

On September 2015, scientists from [https://www.cnr.it/en CNR-National Research Council] of Italy reported that [[Sulfolobus solfataricus|''S.soflataricus'']] was able to survive under Martian radiation at a wavelength that was considered extremely lethal to most bacteria.

On June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University conclusively reported that [[endospore]]s of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299±28&amp;nbsp;m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecraft may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal impact speed is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barney|first1=Brandon L.|last2=Pratt|first2=Sara N.|last3=Austin|first3=Daniel E.|title=Survivability of bare, individual Bacillus subtilis spores to high-velocity surface impact: Implications for microbial transfer through space|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=June 2016|volume=125|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2016.02.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063315300088|bibcode=2016P&amp;SS..125...20B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid [[asphalt]] lake, [[Pitch Lake]]. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells/gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25051/ Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake.] ''the physics arXiv blog'' 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2047 Microbial Life in a Liquid Asphalt Desert.]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, until recently [[boron]] tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria.

== Industrial uses ==
The thermoalkaliphilic [[catalase]], which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, ''[[Thermus brockianus]]'', found in [[Yellowstone National Park]] by [[Idaho National Laboratory]] researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30&amp;nbsp;°C to over 94&amp;nbsp;°C and a pH range from 6–10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the ''T. brockianus'' catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA transfer==
Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell's chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnsborg | first1 = O | last2 = Eldholm | first2 = V | last3 = Håvarstein | first3 = LS. | year = 2007 | title = Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function | url = | journal = Res Microbiol | volume = 158 | issue = 10| pages = 767–78 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 | pmid = 17997281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below.  However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.

The bacterium ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.  This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile.  ''D. radiodurans'' is competent to perform [[Transformation (genetics)|genetic transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = BE | last2 = Setlow | first2 = JK. | year = 1968 | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 176–83 | pmid = 5303325 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.1.176|bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M | pmc=285920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.

'''Feminist sexology''' is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of [[sex]] and [[gender]] in relation to the [[sexual lives]] of [[women]]. Sexology has a basis in psychoanalysis, specifically Freudian theory, which played a big role in early sexology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohler|first=Bertram J.|last2=Galatzer-Levy|first2=Robert M.|date=2008-01-03|title=Freud, Anna, and the Problem of Female Sexuality|journal=Psychoanalytic Inquiry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–26|doi=10.1080/07351690701787085|issn=0735-1690}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reactionary field of feminist sexology seeks to be inclusive of experiences of sexuality and break down the problematic ideas that have been expressed by sexology in the past. [[Feminist]] sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly.

==Themes==
Many of the topics that feminist sexologists study include (but are not limited to) [[reproductive rights]], [[sex work]], [[gay]] and [[transgender]] identities, [[marriage]], [[pornography]] and [[gender roles]]. Much of the work within feminist sexology has been done within the last few decades, focusing on the movements of sexual liberation in the 1960s and 1970s, the introduction of an easily handled and effective means of contraception, [[lesbian]] and transgender visibility, and the stronger waves of women taking charge of their lives. There has been much debate about whether the sexual revolution was really beneficial to women, if a pro-sex attitude can really be achieved within the context of Western society, but as new voices are lifted, layers of interpretation and knowledge can be gathered.

* Lesbianism - Lesbianism is a major theme of feminist sexology. Lesbian society and culture is one that is often over-looked by general society resulting in lesbian women being disregarded and ultimately ignored in public and professional spaces. In the workplace, for example, lesbian women are often still sexualized and forced to play the role of the ‘heterosexual female.’ Feminist theorist Adrienne Rich discusses this type of oppression in her article, “Compulsory Heterosexuality.” Adrienne Rich claims,
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Women endure sexual harassment to keep their jobs and learn to behave in a complacently and ingratiatingly heterosexual manner… the woman who too decisively resists sexual overtures in the workplace is accused of being ‘dried-up and sexless, or lesbian.”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory heterosexuality and lesbian existence. ''Signs: Journal of women in culture and society'', ''5''(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The lesbian in society is of utmost importance in that she bears the weight of judgement and oppression on her shoulders for love and the progression of the woman. On page 649 of “Compulsory Heterosexuality” Rich writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Prostitution - In Gayle Rubin’s article “Thinking Sex,” Rubin discusses the shift of prostitution from a once socially acceptable occupation to a now isolated and reprimanded occupation in modern-day society. This shift in society perception known as the “modernization of sex.” The modernization of sex in the case of prostitution is defined as; the organization of sex groups such as prostitutes, homoesexuals, sadomasochists, etc. into localized populations. On page 156 of “Thinking Sex” Rubin regards the occupation of prostitution and its place in present-day society,
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“Sex work is an occupation… Prostitutes are a criminal sexual population stigmatized on the basis of sexual activity… Prostitutes are the primary prey of vice police.”&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Rubin, G. (1984). Thinking sex: Notes for a radical theory of the politics of sexuality. ''Social Perspectives in Lesbian and Gay Studies; A Reader'', 100-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Anti-prostitution laws have also surfaced in recent years, dismantling prostitution in local jurisdictions and restricting various forms of sexual commerce. On page 163, Rubin writes how these actions are justified:
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“[These actions are] rationalized by portraying them as menaces to health and safety, women and children… or civilization itself. Even when activity is acknowledged to be harmless, it may be banned because it is alleged to ‘lead’ to something ostensibly worse.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Children and Sexuality

In her article “Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality,” Gayle Rubin states that society teaches children about gender and sex; they know nothing about it when they are born, because gender and sex are socially constructed ideas.  Society teaches our children about social norms through actions. This models gender through behavior and children learn to act in a certain way depending if they are male or female.&lt;br /&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the idea of masturbation was considered to be a taboo and unhealthy practice.  What was thought of as premature sexual interest in a child was strongly discouraged, because sexual excitement of any kind was thought to damage the health and discourage the maturation of a child. In the past, parents have resorted to extreme measures to prevent children from masturbating, such as tying them down to keep from touching themselves or even making permanent surgical changes to their genitals. While these extreme measures have for the most part been abandoned in today’s society, the attitude that the idea of sex is harmful to children still endures. &lt;br /&gt;

According to Anne Fausto-Stearling, Infant Genital Surgery is a cosmetic surgery performed on infants who do not fit into a defined gender category (sometimes with or without the parent’s consent).  The surgery reshapes their sexual reproductive organs into either male or female gender binaries without considering the child’s wishes or what they may have chosen later in life.  This can lead to gender confusion and unhappiness as the child grows, and may even have a biological physical impact on how the child’s reproductive organs develop.

* Sex and Respectability
Gayle Rubin argues that modern society judges sex acts through their theoretical value.  She states that “Marital, reproductive heterosexuals are alone at the top erotic pyramid.”  This means that because the people engaging in sex are married, heterosexual, and the possibility of reproduction is present, the act of sex has a higher value in accordance with societal norms.  Unmarried heterosexual sex is also valued, but not as much. Monogamous, heteronormative lesbian and gay relationships are not quite as respected, but are considered to still be of minimal value. “The most despised sexual castes currently include transsexuals, transvestites, fetishists, sadomasochists, sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models...” Solitary sex acts, or masturbation, are not even considered a part of the hierarchy.  These sex acts are ordered in such a way because of their ability to reproduce and create children. “According to this system, sexuality that is ‘good’, ‘normal’, and ‘natural’ should ideally be heterosexual, marital, monogamous, reproductive, and non-commercial.”  Anything relating to sex that breaks these societally prescribed rules is considered to be “bad” and “unnatural,” such as homosexuality, fetish objects, the use of pornography, and casual sex, amongst others.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;“All these hierarchies of sexual value – religious, psychiatric, and popular – function in much the same ways as do ideological systems of racism, ethnocentrism, and religious chauvinism. They rationalize the well-being of the sexually privileged and the adversity of the sexual rabble.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influential thinkers==
* [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] - Fausto-Sterling, with a background in biology, has written several books on the subject of how gender interacts and is shaped by biology, society and culture. In her book, Sexing the Body, she takes a close look on how the definition of our sex and gender as a species by the society relegates our sexual identities and actions. She also tackles these subjects in her other works, including her books ''Myths of Gender'' and ''Love, Power and Knowledge'' (which she co-wrote with Hilary Rose.)
* [[Gayle Rubin]] - Rubin, a [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]], focuses on many subjects, notably [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]] and [[sexual subcultures]]. She has been a strong voice in the "pro-sex" arena of sexology, debating strongly the intersection of [[sexual identity]] and societal structure in the 1980s, during which it was dubbed the "[[Feminist Sex Wars]]." She also worked with [[Patrick Califia]] studying the gay [[Leather subculture|leather scene]].

==Three Main Points==

;Male power
Under the patriarchal culture of sexual desire, women are suppressed to express their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women’s fear of desire keeps them quiet and justify society’s belief that men have the power and authority in the relationships. Women are not allowed to express their sexual needs and male power is against masturbation.

While being taught to be conservative about sexual desire, women are also taught in a contradictory way that their bodies should be readily available for the pleasure of men without having a sexual voice. Sexology has a basis within psychology and the way the DSM-5 has categorized female sexual dysfunctions play into issues of male power over the sexuality of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Chloë|date=2015|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction, Feminist Sexology, and the Psychiatry of the Normal|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=41|issue=2|pages=259–292|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel, K. (2010). The history of ‘female sexual dysfunction’ as a mental disorder in the 20th century. ''Current opinion in psychiatry,'' ''23''(6), 536.&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sexual dysfunction among women, most are categorized as the woman having lowered sexual desire that causes “personal distress” over a period of time. Often times, the personal distress that women are feeling is due to relationship problems, and an irritated partner from the lack of sexual desire. “Women are diagnosed and treated as sexually disordered because they have sex-related marital tensions, even if they are personally well adjusted to their sexual response.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The DSM-5 fails to recognize other reasons a woman may not want to engage in sexually activity, and does not talk about “sexual communication, emotion, whole body experience, taboo and danger, commitment, attraction, sexual knowledge, safety, respect, feelings about bodies, breast cycles, pregnancy, contraception or getting old.” Furthermore, the sexual sciences do not necessarily repress female sexuality as they base it on heteronormative masculinity without giving women a voice about their own sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women not having a voice about their own sexuality is a highly recognized problem in various fields of feminist theory. In “The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,” Audre Lorde offers the solution that the erotic can be used as power to gain a voice about sexuality that is not based on male desire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “Our acts against oppression become integral with self, motivated and empowered from within,” states Audre Lorde. For Lorde, “the erotic” is not just sexuality; it is the power for people to love and be passionate about what they do in life. She sees “the erotic” as “power” because she believes that if women have erotic “power”, they can have voice and be themselves in their lives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lorde, Audre. The Uses of the Erotic. Kore Press, Jan. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the concept of [[compulsory heterosexuality]] makes the society believes that lesbian's sexuality is out of the norm. While there is a general recognition that the majority of sexual acts occur without the intent of reproduction, the definition of sex is still biological in nature, meaning that sex is heterosexual sex and that entails vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Politics of Sexual Knowledge: Feminism and Sexology Textbooks|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men believe that lesbians would defeat their power so they force heterosexuality as a default sexual orientation and disdain lesbians to make coming out difficult. Lesbianism is a threat to male supremacy because it destroys the myth about female inferiority, weakness, passivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. ''Lesbians in Revolt''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having said this, ideas about homosexuality are rooted in problematic ideas that were set forth by men in academic power. Homosexuality in general has historically been viewed by 20th century sexologists and psychoanalysts to be a disorder that people must normalize from.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexology in culture : labelling bodies and desires|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Bland, Lucy., Doan, Laura L., 1951-|isbn=9780226056678|location=Chicago|oclc=38747894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality from Sigmund Freud’s point of view was seen as a pathology in which people were affected by due to disturbances within psychosexual stages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From Freud’s theories about homosexuality, some came to the conclusion that homosexuality was something that could be treated. Additionally, Richard von Krafft-Ebing referred to lesbianism as being “incurable” although he still discussed how it could be treated.&lt;ref&gt;Maciejewski, S. P. (2016). The Relationship Between Sexology and the Lesbian Identity in Early 20th-Century Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sexual Violence
Sexual assault, rape and domestic sexual violence are serious issues in our society. Each year, for 35 of every 1,000 college women, those life-changing events will include a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Bonnie S., Francis T. Cullen, and Michael G. Turner. The Sexual Victimization of College Women. National Institute of Justice, Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people blame sexual harassment and rape on women for staying outside at night, wearing short skirts, or flirting. The society puts the fault on women’s behaviors, trying to make them feel bad. When women start thinking themselves as “trouble makers”, they remain silent. Moreover, many victims are afraid of embarrassing their families and believe that rape victims rarely get justice, instead they will be scolded. Even though all women face this oppression, women of color are more vulnerable to sexual assault than white women. The Jezebel stereotype portrays women of colors as “unrapeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sapac.umich.edu/article/57 | title=Communities of Color and the Impacts of Sexual Violence &amp;#124; Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jezebel stereotype began when 17th century European travelled to Africa and misinterpreted the nudity and polygamy of natives as uncontrollable sexual lust. This view of Black women was also perpetuated during slavery as a means to justify the sexual abuse, rape, and exploitation of these women by their slave owners.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/jezebel/index.htm|title=The Jezebel Stereotype - Anti-black Imagery - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype is still widely used today in cinema, music, television and other forms of media.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* Jezebel: The stereotype that deems African American women as promiscuous, seductive, hypersexual, uncaring, and willing to use sex as a way of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.skepticink.com/gps/2015/04/28/mammy-jezebel-sapphire-or-queen-stereotypes-of-the-african-american-female/|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, or Queen? Stereotypes of the African-American Female • Great Plains Skeptic|date=2015-04-28|work=Great Plains Skeptic|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by this stereotype is a belief that Black women should be responsible for being sexual assaulted. Society justifies rape as a crime that only happens to women who asked for it.
Sexual violence is also a significant problem that is faced by trans and gender-nonconforming people. Trans people are often discriminated against by medical professionals, police officers, the court system, and other authoritative figures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iamoneofthem-why-we-need-to-represent-trans-people_us_58e7a32be4b0acd784ca5768|title=#IAmOneOfThem: Why We Need To Represent Trans People In Sexual Assault Advocacy|last=Clements|first=K. C.|date=2017-04-07|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, trans people are extremely vulnerable to sexual assault and often are not offered the resources to seek help, cope, and heal in a non judgmental setting. When looking at intersections of race, class, and ability, trans people are even more likely to be sexually assaulted when they face multiple levels of oppression.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
;Control of Body
Women face the issue of not being able to make decisions regarding their reproductive rights or their bodies generally. Women are still fighting for access to birth control and the right of choice when it comes to abortion. Birth control and abortion have been highly politicized which has ended up politicizing women’s bodies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The politics of women's bodies : sexuality, appearance, and behavior|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Weitz, Rose, 1952-|isbn=9780195109948|location=New York|oclc=36470306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor women and women of color are likely to have even less option and access to making reproductive choices. In the Supreme Court Case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, banned public facilities and employees in Missouri from performing abortions unless it was a life saving procedure for the mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Prior to this, Maher v. Roe determined that welfare payments could not be used for non therapeutic abortions even though they could be used expenses related to childbirth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These court decisions have ultimately worked in a way that do not allow poor women to choose to have an abortion.

Furthermore, women of color, especially Black, Latina, and Native American women have fallen victim to sterilization abuse. Native American women have faced being sterilized without consent or by being coerced as a result of the ideologies of imperialism, capitalism, patriarchy, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpio|first=Myla Vicenti|date=2004|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian Women and Sterilization Abuse|jstor=29768273|journal=Social Justice|volume=31|issue=4 (98)|pages=40–53|doi=10.2307/29768273|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization abuse and the use birth control were seen as “a duty, not a right” for poor women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, A. (2003). Racism, birth control and reproductive rights. ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory–A Reader'', 353-367.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues within reproductive rights and control of the body are not isolated to the western world but are also global issues. Many women around the world, especially in Africa and Asia, are the victims of sex trafficking, sex slavery, child labor, genital mutilation or cutting and sterilization. Those women neither have controls of their own bodies nor freedom to speak for themselves. The documentary, based on the book, [[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]], focuses on this issues in six different countries. It talks about what sexual oppression women are facing in these places, how the government ignores and justifies the issues, and what organizations are working to fight for these victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/half-the-sky/ | title=Half the Sky &amp;#124; Independent Lens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fish ladder''', also known as a '''fishway''', '''fish pass''' or '''fish steps''', is a structure on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as [[dam]]s, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and [[waterfall]]s) to facilitate [[Fish migration#Classification|diadromous]] fishes' natural [[Fish migration|migration]].&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_52259_19092-46291--,00.html|title=What is a Fish Ladder?|publisher=[[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]]|accessdate=27 April 2012|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term ''[[ladder]]'') into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.

==History==
[[File:Denil fish ladder.jpg|thumb|right|Denil Fishway on Salmon Creek, [[Montana]]]]
Written reports of rough fishways date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833–1950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852–1854, the Ballisodare Fish Pass was built in [[County Sligo]] in Ireland to draw [[salmon]] into a river that had not supported a fishery. In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in [[Rhode Island]], United States, on the [[Pawtuxet Village|Pawtuxet Falls]] Dam. The ladder was removed in 1924, when the [[Providence, Rhode Island|City of Providence]] replaced the wood dam with a [[concrete]] one. Concrete ladders are not always an improvement – the electric field-sensitive organs of the [[paddlefish]] are overloaded in the proximity of the [[rebar]] and other metal used in concrete construction, preventing them from gaining access to their spawning grounds and contributing to a catastrophic decline in their numbers.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

As the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.&lt;ref&gt;Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctBsJJ0oKHEC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Fish+passage+technologies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WPVWTaHnGtOdcZb1oe8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities''] Diana Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4289-2016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Fish pass.jpg|thumb|right|A small fish ladder on the [[River Otter, Devon]]]]

{{see also|eel ladder|fish migration}}

There are six main types of fishways:
* Pool and weir
* Baffle fishway (Denil, Larinier, Alaskan Steeppass, or other baffle configuration)
* Fish elevator
* Rock-ramp fishway
* Vertical-slot fish passage
* Fish siphon

A '''pool and weir''' is one of the oldest styles of fish ladders. It uses a series of small dams and pools of regular length to create a long, sloping channel for fish to travel around the obstruction. The channel acts as a fixed [[canal lock|lock]] to gradually step down the water level; to head upstream, fish must jump over from box to box in the ladder.

A '''baffle fishway''' uses a series of symmetrical close-spaced baffles in a channel to redirect the flow of water, allowing fish to swim around the barrier. Baffle fishways need not have resting areas, although pools can be included to provide a resting area or to reduce the velocity of the flow. Such fishways can be built with [[hairpin turn|switchbacks]] to minimize the space needed for their construction.
Baffles come in variety of designs. The original design for a Denil fishway was developed in 1909 by a Belgian scientist, G. Denil; it has since been adjusted and adapted in many ways. The ''Alaskan Steeppass'', for example, is a modular prefabricated Denil-fishway variant originally designed for remote areas of Alaska. Baffles have been installed by [https://arcg.is/1XCCrj Project Maitai] in several waterways in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand, to improve fish passage as part of general environmental restoration.

A '''fish elevator''' or '''fish lift''', as its name implies, breaks with the ladder design by providing a sort of [[elevator]] to carry fish over a barrier. It is well suited to tall barriers. With a fish elevator, fish swim into a collection area at the base of the obstruction. When enough fish accumulate in the collection area, they are nudged into a hopper that carries them into a flume that empties into the river above the barrier.

On the [[Connecticut River]], for example, two fish elevators lift up to 500 fish at a time, 52 feet (15.85 m), to clear the [[Holyoke Dam]]. In 2013, the elevator carried over 400,000 fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Connecticut River Migratory Fish
|url=http://www.fws.gov/r5crc/fish/old13.html |website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rock-ramp fishway''' uses large rocks and timbers to create pools and small falls that mimic natural structures. Because of the length of the channel needed for the ladder, such structures are most appropriate for relatively short barriers. They have a significant advantage in that they can provide fish spawning habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Luther P. Aadland |title=Reconnecting Rivers: Natural Channel Design in Dam Removals and Fish Passage |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |year=2010 |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/streamhab/reconnecting_rivers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vertical-slot fish passage''' is similar to a pool-and-weir system, except that each "dam" has a narrow slot in it near the channel wall. This allows fish to swim upstream without leaping over an obstacle. Vertical-slot fish passages also tend to handle reasonably well the seasonal fluctuation in water levels on each side of the barrier. Recent studies suggest that navigation locks have a potential to be operated as vertical slot fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Silva S., Lowry M., Macaya-Solis C., Byatt B., Lucas M.

Turbulent flow field comparison and related suitability for fish
passage of a standard and a simplified low‐gradient vertical slot
fishway. River Research and Applications, 33, 1295-1305.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fish siphon''' allows the pass to be installed parallel to a water course and can be used to link two watercourses. The pass utilises a syphon effect to regulate its flow. This style is particularly favoured to aid flood defence.

==Effectiveness==
Fish ladders have a mixed record of effectiveness. They vary in effectiveness for different types of species, with one study showing that only three percent of American Shad make it through all the fish ladders on the way to their spawning ground.&lt;ref name="BlockedMigration"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waldman|first1=John|title=Blocked Migration: Fish Ladders On U.S. Dams Are Not Effective|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/blocked_migration_fish_ladders_on_us_dams_are_not_effective/2636/|website=Yale Environment 360|publisher=Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Sciences|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectiveness depends on the fish species' swimming ability, and how the fish moves up and downstream. A fish passage that is designed to allow fish to pass upstream may not allow passage downstream, for instance.&lt;ref name="UpstreamBattle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kraft|first1=Amy |date=February 20, 2013 |title=Upstream Battle: Fishes Shun Modern Dam Passages, Contributing to Population Declines|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/upstream-battle-fishes-shun-modern-dam-passages-population-declines/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish passages do not always work.
In practice a challenge is matching swimming performance data to hydrodynamic measurements.&lt;ref name="Katopodis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Katopodis, C., Gervais, R.]  |title= Fish Swimming Performance Database and Analyses |journal=DFO CSAS Research Document No. 2016/002, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Ottawa, Canada  |pages= 1–550 |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang2017b"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]]  |title= How a better understanding of Fish-Hydrodynamics Interactions might enhance upstream fish passage in culverts |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:696033  |journal=Civil Engineering Research Report No. CE162  |pages= 1–43 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swim tests rarely use the same protocol and the output is either a single-point measurement or a bulk velocity. In contrast, physical and numerical modelling of fluid flow (i.e. hydrodynamics) deliver a detailed flow map, with a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Regulatory agencies face a difficult task to match hydrodynamic measurements and swimming performance data.

==Culverts==
During the last three decades, the ecological impact of [[culvert]]s on natural streams and rivers has been recognised. Baffles may be installed along the barrel invert to provide some fish-friendly alternative.&lt;ref name="Olsen2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olsen, A. and Tullis, B.  |title= Laboratory Study of Fish Passage and Discharge Capacity in Slip-Lined, Baffled Culverts |journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages= 424–432 |issn= 0733-9429 |year=2013 |doi=10.1061/(asce)hy.1943-7900.0000697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_Uys2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] and Uys, W. |title= Baffle Designs to Facilitate Fish Passage in Box Culverts: A Preliminary Study |url= https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:396517 |journal=6th IAHR International Symposium on Hydraulic Structures, Hydraulic Structures and Water System Management |pages= 295–304 |doi= 10.15142/T300628160828 |isbn= 978-1-884575-75-4 |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabonce2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cabonce, J., Fernando, R., Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Using Triangular Baffles to Facilitate Upstream Fish Passage in Box Culverts: Physical Modelling| url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:653838 |publisher= Hydraulic Model Report No. CH107/17, School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, 130 pages |year=2017 |isbn= 978-1-74272-186-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low discharges, the baffles decrease the flow velocity and increase the water depth to facilitate fish passage. At larger discharges, baffles induce lower local velocities and generate recirculation regions. Unfortunately, baffles can reduce drastically the culvert discharge capacity for a given afflux,&lt;ref name="Lariner2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larinier, M.  |title= Fish Passage through Culverts, Rock Weirs and Estuarine Obstructions |journal=Bulletin Français de Pêche et Pisciculture |volume=364 |issue=18 |pages= 119–134 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing substantially the total cost of the culvert structure to achieve the same design discharge and afflux. It is believed that fish-turbulence interplay may facilitate upstream migration, albeit an optimum design must be based upon a careful characterisation of both hydrodynamics and fish kinematics.&lt;ref name="Wang2017b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Baffle Systems to Facilitate Upstream Fish Passage in Standard Box Culverts: How About Fish-Turbulence Interplay? |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:678859 |journal=37th IAHR World Congress, IAHR &amp; USAINS, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |volume=3 |pages= 2586–2595 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WangChanson2018"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Modelling Upstream Fish Passage in Standard Box Culverts: Interplay between Turbulence, Fish Kinematics, and Energetics |journal=River Research and Applications |volume=34|issue=3  |pages= 244-252 |year=2018 |doi=10.1002/rra.3245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fog bow''', sometimes called a '''white rainbow''',&lt;ref name="BBC 22 November 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38063662?SThisFB|title= Amazing white rainbow snapped over Scottish moor| author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 22 November 2016|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC| accessdate= 22 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a similar phenomenon to a [[rainbow]]; however, as its name suggests, it appears as a bow in [[fog]] rather than [[rain]].&lt;ref name="Met Office"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/rainbows/fogbow|title= What is a fogbow?|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= metoffice.gov.uk/ |publisher= [[Met Office]]| accessdate= 22 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the very small size of water droplets that cause fog—smaller than {{convert|0.05|mm|in|sp=us}}—the fog bow has only very weak colors, with a red outer edge and bluish inner edge.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In many cases, when the droplets are very small, fog bows appear white, and are therefore sometimes called ''white rainbows''. This lack of color is the feature of a fog bow that distinguishes it from a [[Glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], which has multiple pale-colored rings caused by diffraction. When droplets forming it are almost all of the same size, the fog bow can have multiple inner rings, or supernumeraries, which are more strongly colored than the main bow.  According to [[NASA]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fogbow's lack of colors is caused by the smaller water drops&amp;nbsp;... so small that the [[wavelength]] of light becomes important. Diffraction smears out colors that would be created by larger rainbow water drops&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061115.html APOD: 2006 November 15 - A Fog Bow Over California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A fog bow seen in clouds, typically from an aircraft looking downwards, is called a ''cloud bow''. Mariners sometimes call fog bows ''sea-dogs''.

==Direction==
A fog bow is seen in the same direction as a rainbow, thus the sun would be behind the head of the observer and the direction of view would be into a bank of fog (which may not be noticeable in directions away from the bow itself). Its outer radius is slightly less than that of a rainbow.

When a fog bow appears at night it is called a ''lunar fog bow''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogmoon.htm Lunar Fogbow]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gel bracelets''', or '''jelly bracelets''' are an inexpensive type of [[wristband]] often made from [[Silicone]]. They come in a variety of colors, and several can be worn on each arm. They have been popular in waves throughout the [[Western world]] and elsewhere since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (2003).

==Urban legend of sex bracelets==
{{see also|Handkerchief code}}
During a resurgence in popularity in 2003, gel bracelets became the subject of a widespread [[urban legend]] linking them to a supposed sex game explaining their popularity among young teenagers: they were subsequently dubbed "'''sex bracelets'''".&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aguilar, Alexa|author2=Bell, Kaitlin|date=November 18, 2003|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/News/A9286BCB3F0E79D386256DE30017FF18?OpenDocument&amp;Headline=Rumors+link+bracelets+to+sex+game+|title=Rumors Link Bracelets to Sex Game.|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|archiveurl=https://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-110317398/rumors-link-bracelets-sex-game|archivedate=November 19, 2003|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/12/10/sex.bracelet.ap/|title=Student 'sex bracelets' an urban legend?|date=December 12, 2003|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 10, 2006|location=CHICAGO, Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031220191943/http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/12/10/sex.bracelet.ap/|archivedate=December 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to rumors, people who wore the jewelry implied they were willing to engage in various acts with whoever pulled them from their wrists; the acts ranged from hugging and [[kiss]]ing to [[sexual intercourse]], and were determined by the bracelet's color.

In October 2003, the rumors were prominent enough in Alachua Elementary School in [[Gainesville, Florida]] that the principal banned the bracelets to avert disruption and inappropriate comments about them.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031018/LOCAL/210180317&amp;SearchID=73258459105519|title=Principal puts ban on 'sex bracelets'|last=James|first=Douane D.|date=October 18, 2003|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|accessdate=September 30, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307005654/http://search.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20031018%2FLOCAL%2F210180317&amp;SearchID=73258459105519|archivedate=2007-03-07|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subsequently banned in other schools around Florida and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The effectors of these early bans did not insinuate that the rumors were true; however, some later media reports suggested that they may have been,&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;For example, see: {{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/family/2649800/detail.html|title='Sex Bracelets' Cause Parental Concern|date=November 20, 2003|work=NBC Philadelphia|publisher=NBC10.com|accessdate=September 30, 2006|location=RALEIGH, N.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211223640/http://www.nbc10.com/family/2649800/detail.html|archivedate=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating something of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The supposed meanings of the colours of the bands were reported in the British press in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1486387/Blair-joins-wristband-celebrities-who-make-charity-cool.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Sally | last=Pook | title=Blair joins wristband celebrities who make charity cool | date=March 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar set of stories surfaced (or re-surfaced) in the British media in 2009, in which the bracelets were allegedly nicknamed ''shag bands''.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fury-over-sex-bracelets-sold-420820|title=Fury over 'sex' bracelets sold to school children|last=Stretch|first=Euan|date=25 Sep 2009|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=25 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article6910040.ece|title=Would you let your daughter wear a "shag band"?|last=Midgley|first=Carol|date=10 Nov 2009|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=10 Nov 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2658958/Bracelet-which-means-your-child-is-having-SEX.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024020040/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2658958/Bracelet-which-means-your-child-is-having-SEX.html|archivedate=2015-10-24|title=Bracelet which means your child is having SEX|last=Pearce|first=Dulcie|date=29 Sep 2009|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=London|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories circulated widely in Brazil during the 2009–2010 summer, where the bracelets were referred to as ''pulseiras do sexo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL1412235-5605,00-PULSEIRA+DO+SEXO+GERA+POLEMICA+ENTRE+PAIS+E+EDUCADORES+EM+SP.html |title=‘Pulseira do sexo’ gera polêmica entre pais e educadores em SP|trans-title='Sex bracelets' generates controversy among parents and educators in São Paulo |author=Paulo Toledo Piza|date=13 December 2009|language=Portuguese|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, a 13-year-old girl in Brazil was raped by three teenage boys after one of them snatched the bracelet she was wearing. The police stated that the crime was motivated by the use of sex bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1552238-5598,00-APOS+TER+PULSEIRA+DO+SEXO+ARRANCADA+ADOLESCENTE+E+ESTUPRADA+EM+LONDRINA.html |title=Após ter 'pulseira do sexo' arrancada, adolescente é estuprada em Londrina|trans-title=After 'sex bracelet' ripped off teen is raped in Londrina|author=Glauco Araújo|date=31 March 2010|language=Portuguese|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions associate different colors with sex acts (similar to the [[handkerchief code]]). For example, purple might be associated with kissing, red with [[lap dance|lapdancing]], and black with intercourse.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt; Some versions said the involved action occurs at parties held for the purpose, making them similar to contemporary rumors of "[[rainbow party (sexuality)|rainbow parties]]", a gathering at which groups of girls wearing varying shades of [[lipstick]] supposedly take turns [[fellatio|fellating]] their classmates, leaving an array of colors on their penises. Other tales of teenage [[group sex|sex parties]] have circulated at various times. [[Folkloristics|Folklorist]] Barbara Mikkelson of [[snopes|snopes.com]] associates the "sex bracelet" stories with similar ones of the past.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; In the 1970s, pulltabs from [[beverage can|aluminum cans]] and labels from [[beer bottle]]s were supposedly considered "sex coupons" and obligated any girl presented with one to sleep with the bearer; by the 1990s the rumors shifted to include an assortment of plastic items, including some worn as bracelets. According to Mikkelson, there is likely little truth behind the stories, and the vast majority of teenagers who contact her site express shock and disappointment that so many have believed them.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

At least one particular type of gel bracelet called the MY Single Band was specifically designed to advertise the wearer's relationship status.&lt;ref name=nydaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Victoria|title=Will bracelets for singles revolutionize dating?|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/single-band-shows-world-single-article-1.1434446|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last=Dockterman|first=Eliana|title=MY Single Band: A Bracelet That Advertises You’re Single|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/09/01/wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve-bracelets-advertise-youre-single/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1 September 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release, creators, Rina Mardahl and Rob Young, compared their concept to that of [[wedding rings]] that show the married status of a wearer,&lt;ref name=pr&gt;{{cite press release | title =Meeting Other Singles Just Got a Whole Lot Easier!  | publisher =[[PR Newswire]] | date =20 August 2013 | url =http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/meeting-other-singles-just-got-a-whole-lot-easier-220313101.html | accessdate = 1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young saying he "saw hundreds of people each day that could potentially be a suitable partner, yet there was no way of knowing their relationship status."&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last=De Lacey|first=Martha|title=Would you wear a wristband to show you're single?

The study of '''geometric morphometrics in anthropology''' has made a major impact on the field of [[morphometrics]] by aiding in some of the technological and methodological advancements. Geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables. The landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size, position, and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats, especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes, which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelditch2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology, which has more recently been named virtual anthropology. Virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology, the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape (such as geometric morphometrics) and form...&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Gerhard|title=Virtual Anthropology|journal=Yearbook of Physical Anthropology|date=2015|issue=156|pages=22–42|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22658|pmid=25418603|volume=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with [[Francis Galton]] (1822-1911). Galton was a polymath and the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Slice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slice|first1=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2007|issue=1|pages=261–81|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120613|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base-line registration approach for shape comparisons.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitteroecker|first1=Philipp|last2=Gunz|first2=Philipp|title=Advances in Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Evolutionary Biology|date=2009|issue=2|pages=235–247|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; This was later adapted by Fred Bookstein and termed “two-point coordinates” or “Bookstein-shape coordinates”.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|title=Morphometric Tools for Landmark Data: Geometry and Biology|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

In the 1940s, [[D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (biologist and mathematician, 1860-1948)  looked at ways to quantify that could be attached to biological shape based on developmental and evolutionary theories. This led to the first branch of multivariate morphometrics, which emphasized matrix manipulations involving variables.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohlf|first1=F. James|last2=Bookstein|first2=Fred L.|title=Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometrics Workshop|date=1990|publisher=Special Publication 2, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Bookstein (currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna) began using Cartesian transformations and [[David George Kendall]] (statistician, 1918-2007) showed that figures that hold the same shape can be treated as separate points in a geometric space.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Gunz|first3=Philipp|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|title=Anthropology Takes Control of Morphometrics|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|date=2004|volume=2|issue=28|pages=121–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1996, Leslie Marcus (paleontologist, 1930-2002) convinced colleagues to use morphometrics on the famous [[Ötzi|Ötzi skeleton]], which helped expose the importance of the applications of these methods.&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004 /&gt;

==Traditional morphometrics==
[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|left|BirdMorpho]] 
Traditional morphometrics is the study of morphological variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Mark|last2=Sheets|first2=David H.|title=A Practical Introduction to Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Paleontological Society Papers|date=2010|volume=16|issue=Quantitative Methods in Paleobiology|pages=163–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Dean C.|last2=Rohlf|first2=F. James|last3=Slice|first3=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics: Ten Years of Progress Following the 'Revolution'|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|date=2004|volume=71|pages=5–16|doi=10.1080/11250000409356545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: [[principal components]], [[factor analysis]], [[canonical analysis|canonical variate]], and [[discriminant function analysis]]. It is also possible to study [[allometry]], which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics is that it does not capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to be based on.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; Geometric morphometrics tries to correct these problems by capturing more variability in shape.

==Steps in a geometric morphometric study==
There is a basic structure to successfully performing and completing every geometric morphometric study:
# '''Design Study''': what is your objective/hypothesis? what morphology must you capture to explore this?

==Data collection methods==

===Landmarks===
The first step is to define your landmark set. Landmarks have to be anatomically recognizable and the same for all specimens in the study. Landmarks should be selected to properly capture the shape trying to be observed and capable of being replicated. The sample size should be roughly three times the amount of landmarks chosen and they must be recorded in the same order for every specimen.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===Semilandmarks===
[[File:3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl.png|thumb|upright=0.5|3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl]]
Semilandmarks, also called sliding landmarks, are used when the location of a landmark along a curvature might not be identifiable or repeatable.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Semilandmarks were created in order to take landmark based geometric morphometrics to the next step by capturing the shape of difficult areas such as smooth curves and surfaces.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; In order to obtain a semilandmark, the curvature still has to start and end on definable landmarks, capture observed morphology, remain homologous across specimens in the same steps seen above for regular landmarks, be equal in number, and equally distant apart.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; When this approach was first proposed, Bookstein suggested gaining semilandmarks by densely sampling landmarks along the surface in a mesh and slowly thinning out the landmarks until the desired curvature was obtained.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Newer landmark programs aid in the process but there are still some steps that must be taken in order for the semilandmarks to be the same across the whole sample. Semilandmarks are not placed on the actual curve or surface but on tangent vectors to the curve or tangent planes to the surface. The sliding of semilandmarks in new programs is performed by either selecting a specimen to be the model specimen for the rest of the specimens or using a computational sample mean from tangent vectors. Semilandmarks are automatically placed in most programs when the observer chooses a starting and ending point on definable landmarks and sliding the semilandmarks between them until the shape is captured. The semilandmarks are then mapped onto the rest of the specimens in the sample.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Since shape will differ between specimens, the observer has to manually go through and make sure the landmarks and semilandmarks are on the surface for the rest of the specimens. If not they must be moved to touch the surface, but this process still maintains the correct location. There is still room for improvement to these methods but this is the most consistent option at the moment. Once mapped on, these semilandmarks can be treated just like landmarks for statistical analysis.

===Deformation grid===
This is a different approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Bookstein proposed the use of a [[thin-plate spline]] (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Superimposition==

===[[Generalized Procrustes analysis]] (GPA)===
Landmark and semilandmark coordinates can be recorded on each specimen, but size, orientation, and position can vary for each of those specimens adding in variables that distract from the analysis of shape. This can be fixed by using superimposition, with generalized procrusted analysis (GPA) being the most common application. GPA removes the variation of size, orientation, and position by superimposing the landmarks in a common coordinate system.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The landmarks for all specimens are optimally translated, rotated, and scaled based on a least-squared estimation. The first step is translation and rotation to minimize the squared and summed differences (squared Procrustes distance) between landmarks on each specimen. Then the landmarks are individually scaled to the same unit Centroid size. Centroid size is the square root of the sum of squared distances of the landmarks in configuration to their mean location. The translation, rotation, and scaling bring the landmark configurations for all specimens into a common coordinate system so that the only differing variables are based on shape alone. The new superimposed landmarks can now be analyzed in multivariate statistical analyses.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

==Statistical analysis==

===[[Principal components analysis]] (PCA)===
In general, principal components analysis is used to construct overarching variables that take the place of multiple correlated variables in order to reveal the underlying structure of the dataset. This is helpful in geometric morphometrics where a large set of landmarks can create correlated relationships that might be difficult to differentiate without reducing them in order to look at the overall variability in the data.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Reducing the number of variables is also necessary because the number of variables being observed and analyzed should not exceed sample size.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Principal component scores are computed through an eigendecomposition of a sample’s covariance matrix and rotates the data to preserve procrustes distances. In other words, a principal components analysis preserves the shape variables that were scaled, rotated, and translated during the generalize procrustes analysis. The resulting principal component scores project the shape variables onto low-dimensional space based on eigenvectors.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The scores can be plotted various ways to look at the shape variables, such as scatterplots. It is important to explore what shape variables are being observed to make sure the principal components being analyzed are pertinent to the questions being asked. Although the components might show shape variables not relevant to the question at hand, it is perfectly acceptable to leave those components out any further analysis for a specific project.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

===[[Partial least squares regression|Partial least squares]] (PLS)===
Partial least squares is similar the principal components analysis in the fact that it reduces the number of variables being observed so patterns are more easily observed in the data, but it uses a linear regression model. PLS is an approach that looks at two or more sets of variables measured on the same specimens and extracts the linear combinations that best represent the pattern of covariance across the sets.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The linear combinations will optimally describe the covariances and provide a low-dimensional output to compare the different sets. With the highest shape variation covariance, mean shape, and the other shape covariances that exists among the sets, this approach is ideal for looking at the significance of group differences. PLS has been used a lot in studies that look at things such as sexual dimorphism, or other general morphological differences found at the population, subspecies, and species level.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; It has also been used to look at functional, environmental, or behavioral differences that could influence the found shape covariance between sets&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate regression]]===
Multiple or multivariate regression is an approach to look at the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a dependent or influential variable. It is best used in geometric morphometrics when analyzing shape variables based on an external influence. For example, it can be used in studies with attached functional or environmental variables like age or the development over time in certain environments.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The multivariate regression of shape based on the logarithm of centroid size (square root of the sum of squared distances of landmarks) is ideal for [[allometric]] studies. Allometry is the analysis of shape based on the biological parameters of growth and size. This approach is not affected by the number of dependent shape variables or their covariance, so the results of regression coefficients can be seen as a deformation in shape.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Some applications in anthropology==

===Human evolution===

====The human brain====
The human brain is unique from other species based on the size of the [[visual cortex]], [[temporal lobe]], and [[parietal cortex]], and increased [[gyrification]] (folds of the brain). There have been many questions as to why these changes occurred and how they contributed to cognition and behavior, which are important questions in human evolution. Geometric morphometrics has been used to explore some of these questions using virtual [[endocasts]] (casts of the inside of the cranium) to gather information since brain tissue does not preserve in the fossil record. Geometric morphometrics can reveal small shape differences between brains such as differences between modern humans and [[Neanderthals]] whose brains were similar in size.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rein|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Harvati|first2=Katerina|title=Geometric Morphometrics and Virtual Anthropology: Advances in human evolutionary studies|journal=Journal of Biological and Clinical Anthropology|date=2014|volume=71|pages=41–55|doi=10.1127/0003-5548/2014/0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neubauer and colleagues looked at the endocasts of [[chimpanzees]] and modern humans to observe brain growth using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found that there is an early “[[globularization]] phase” in human brain development that shows expansion of the parietal and cerebellar areas, which does not occur in chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neubauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neubauer|first1=S.|last2=Gunz|first2=P.|last3=Hublin|first3=J.|title=Endocranial shape changes during growth in chimpanzees and humans: A morphometric analysis of unique and shared aspects|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=555–566|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.011|pmid=20727571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunz and colleagues extended the study further and found that the “globularization phase” does not occur in Neanderthals and instead Neanderthal brain growth is more similar to chimpanzees. This difference could point to some important changes in the human brain that led to different organization and cognitive functions&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Golovanova|first3=L.|last4=Doronichev|first4=V.|last5=Maureille|first5=B.|last6=Hublin|first6=J.|title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development: Insights from a new cranial reconstruction of the Neanderthal newborn from Mezmaiskaya|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=62|issue=2|pages=300–313|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.013|pmid=22221766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Maureille|first3=B.|last4=Hublin|first4=J.|title=Brain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=21|pages=921–922|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.018|pmid=21056830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pleistocene cranial morphology====
There have been many debates on the relationships between [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] hominin crania from [[Eurasia]] and Africa because they display a mosaic of both primitive and derived traits. Studies on cranial morphology for these specimens have created arguments that Eurasian fossils from the Middle Pleistocene are a transition between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and later hominins like Neanderthals and modern humans. However, there are two sides to the argument with one side saying that the European and African fossils are from a single taxon while others say that the Neanderthal lineage should be included. Harvati and colleagues decided to attempt to quantify the craniofacial features of Neanderthals and European Middle Pleistocene fossils using 3D landmarks to try to add to the debate. They found that some features were more Neanderthal like while others were primitive and likely from the Middle Pleistocene African hominins, so the argument could still go either way.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvati2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvati|first1=K.|last2=Hublin|first2=J.|last3=Gunz|first3=P.|title=Evolution of middle-late Pleistocene human cranio-facial form: a 3D approach|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=445–464|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.005|pmid=20708775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freidline and colleagues further added to the debate by looking at both adult and subadult crania of modern and Pleistocene hominins using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found similarities in facial morphology between Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa and a divide in facial morphology during the Pleistocene based on time period. The study also found that some characteristics separating Neanderthals from Middle Pleistocene hominins, like the size of the nasal aperture and degree of midfacial prognathism, might be due to allometric differences&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Freidline&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freidline|first1=SE|last2=Gunz|first2=G.|last3=Harvati|first3=K.|last4=Hublin|first4=J|title=Middle Pleistocene human facial morphology in an evolutionary and developmental context|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=63|issue=5|pages=723–740|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.08.002|pmid=22981042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern human variation===

====Ancestry and sex estimation of crania====
Crania can be used to classify ancestry and sex to aid in [[forensic]] contexts such as crime scenes and mass fatalities. In 2010, Ross and colleagues were provided federal funds by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] to compile data for population specific classification criteria using geometric morphometrics. Their aim was to create an extensive population database from 3D landmarks on human crania, to develop and validate population specific procedures for classification of unknown individuals, and develop software to use in forensic identification. They placed 3D landmarks on 75 craniofacial landmarks from European, African, and Hispanic populations of about 1000 individuals with a Microscribe digitizer. The software they developed, called [http://www.3d-id.org/ 3D-ID], can classify unknown individuals into probable sex and ancestry, and allows for fragmentary and damaged specimens to be used.&lt;ref name=RossSlice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Ann H.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Williams|first3=Shanna E.|title=Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls|date=2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the full manuscript can be found here: [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls]

====Sex estimation of os coxae====
Geometric morphometrics can also be used to capture the slight shape variations found in postcranial bones of the human body such as ''[[os coxae]]''. Bierry and colleagues used 3D CT reconstructions of modern adult pelvic bones for 104 individuals to look at the shape of the [[obturator foramen]]. After a normalization technique to take out the factor of size, they outlined the obturator foramen with landmarks and semilandmarks to capture its shape. They chose the obturator foramen because it tends to be oval in males and triangular in females. The results show a classification accuracy of 88.5% for males and 80.8% for females using a [[Fourier Analysis|Discriminant Fourier Analysis]].&lt;ref name=Bierryetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bierry|first1=Guillaume|last2=Le Minor|first2=Jean-Marie|last3=Schmittbuhl|first3=Mathieu|title=Oval in Males and Triangular in Females?

They placed landmarks and semilandmarks on 2D photographic images of 121 left pelvic bones from a collection of undocumented skeletons at the Museu Anthropológico de Coimbra in Portugal. Since the pelvic bones were of unknown origin, they used a [[K-means clustering|K-means Cluster Analysis]] to determine a sex category before performing a [[Discriminant function analysis|Discriminant Function analysis]]. The results had a classification accuracy for the [[greater sciatic notch]] of 90.9% and the ischiopubic ramus at 93.4 to 90.1%&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Paula N.|last2=Bernal|first2=Valeria|last3=Perez|first3=Ivan S.|title=Geometric Morphometric Approach to Sex Estimation of Human Pelvis|journal=Forensic Science International|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.04.012|volume=189|issue=1–3|pages=68–74|pmid=19442464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3933">'''Green Power Usage Effectiveness''' (GPUE) is a proposed measurement of both how much [[sustainable energy]] a computer [[data center]] uses, its [[carbon footprint]] per usable [[kilowatt hour]] (kWh) and how efficiently it uses its power; specifically, how much of the power is actually used by the computing equipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead). It is an addition to the [[power usage effectiveness]] (PUE) definition and was first proposed by [[Greenqloud]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenqloud.com/greenpowerusageeffectiveness-gpue/ GPUE – Green Power Usage Effectiveness - GreenQloud]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Green Grid]] has developed the Power Usage Effectiveness metric &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreengrid.org/sitecore/content/Global/Content/white-papers/The-Green-Grid-Data-Center-Power-Efficiency-Metrics-PUE-and-DCiE.aspx The Green Grid - The Green Grid Data Center Power Efficiency Metrics: PUE and DCiE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217182325/http://thegreengrid.org/sitecore/content/Global/Content/white-papers/The-Green-Grid-Data-Center-Power-Efficiency-Metrics-PUE-and-DCiE.aspx |date=2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or PUE to measure a data centers' effectiveness of getting power to IT equipment. What the PUE tells in simple terms is how much extra energy is needed for each usable kWh for the IT equipment due to the power going into cooling, power distribution loss etc. and it’s a simple formula (in theory):

PUE = Total Facility Power/IT Equipment Power

The PUE can change depending on where measurements are made, when they are made and the timespan the measurements are made in.
Data centers are subtracting factors from their PUE to lower it e.g. district heating. Some of the issues with PUE are being addressed with the PUEx definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serverproblemsolved.com/itprimers/pue-power-usage-effectiveness-metrics-data-center-energy-efficiency-green-grid/ New PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) standards for data center energy efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

GPUE is a way to "weigh" the PUE to better see which data centers are truly green in the sense that they indirectly cause the least amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be emitted by their use of sustainable or unsustainable energy sources.

This new metric GPUE or Green Power Usage Effectiveness is defined as:

GPUE = G × PUEx (for inline comparison of data centers)&lt;br&gt;
or = G @ PUEx  (a better display and for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission calculations)

The "G" is the key factor here and it is a simple calculated value:

G = Weighed sum of energy sources and their lifecycle KG CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KWh

G =∑( %EnergySource × ( 1 + weight) )

Adding 1 to the weight is to "weigh" (multiply) with the PUE to get a number that is comparable to PUE. The weights taken directly from the "lifecycle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh for electricity generation by power source" table above we got from the 2008 Sovacool Study &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;  e.g. the weight for unscrubbed coal is e.g. 1.050 (kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh) while hydroelectric river generation has a weight of 0.013. An unknown energy source or a "mix" will get the same as the maximum value which for now is the same as coal.

Example:

PUE 1.20, 50/50 Coal/Hydro&lt;br&gt;
G = 0.5*(1+1.050) + 0.5*(1+0.013)&lt;br&gt;
G = 1.531, GPUEx = 1.84 or 1.531@1.20

Kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per usable kWh = (G-1) × PUEx = 0.64&amp;nbsp;kg

{{lead too short|date=July 2018}}
'''Gross anatomy''' (also called '''topographical anatomy''') is the study of [[anatomy]] at the visible ([[macroscopic]]) level.

==Techniques of study==
Gross anatomy is studied using both [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive and noninvasive]] methods with the goal of obtaining information about the macroscopic structure and organization of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and organ systems. Among the most common methods of study is [[dissection]], in which the corpse of an animal or a human [[cadaver]] is [[surgery|surgically]] opened and its organs studied. [[Endoscopy]], in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the subject, may be used to explore the internal organs and other structures of living animals. The anatomy of the [[circulatory system]] in a living animal may be studied noninvasively via [[angiography]], a technique in which [[blood vessel]]s are visualized after being injected with an opaque dye. Other means of study include [[Radiology|radiological]] techniques of [[medical imaging|imaging]], such as [[X-ray]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].

==In medical and healthcare professional education==
Most doctoral health profession schools, such as medical, [[Physician Assistant]], and dental schools, require that students complete a practical (dissection) course in gross human anatomy. Such courses aim to educate students in basic human anatomy and seek to establish anatomical landmarks that may later be used to aid [[medical diagnosis]]. Many schools provide students with [[cadaver]]s for investigation by dissection, aided by dissection manuals, as well as cadaveric atlases (e.g. [[Frank H. Netter|Netter's]], [[Rohen]]'s). 

Working intimately with a cadaver during a gross anatomy course has been shown to capture the essence of the patient-provider relationship. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aziz|first1=M. Ashraf|last2=Mckenzie|first2=James C.|last3=Wilson|first3=James S.|last4=Cowie|first4=Robert J.|last5=Ayeni|first5=Sylvanus A.|last6=Dunn|first6=Barbara K.|title=The human cadaver in the age of biomedical informatics|journal=The Anatomical Record|date=15 February 2002|volume=269|issue=1|pages=20–32|doi=10.1002/ar.10046}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expense of maintaining cadaveric dissection facilities has limited the time and resources available for gross anatomy teaching in many medical schools, with some adopting alternative prosection-based or simulated teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Older|first1=J |title=Anatomy: a must for teaching the next generation.|journal=Surgeon J R Coll Surg Edinb Irel|date=2004|volume=2|pages=79–90|doi=10.1002/ca.20662}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, coupled with decreasing time dedicated to gross anatomical courses within the growing greater medical school curriculum, has caused controversy surrounding the sufficiency of anatomical teaching with nearly half of newly qualified doctors believing they received insufficient anatomy teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=J. Ashraf|last2=White|first2=M|last3=Tang|first3=S|last4=CMaxwell-Armstrong|first4=C |last5=James|first5=D|title=Are we teaching sufficient anatomy at medical school? The opinions of newly qualified doctors|journal=Clinical Anatomy|date=2008|volume=21|pages=718–724|doi=10.1002/ca.20662}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medical schools have implemented on-screen anatomical lessons and tutorials to teach students surgical procedures. The use of technological visual aids and gross dissection are more effective together than either approach alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marker|first=David|last2=Juluru|first2=Krishna|date=|year=2012|title=Strategic Improvements for Gross Anatomy Web-Based Teaching|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ari/2012/146262/|journal=Anatomy Research International|volume=2012|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, online flashcards and quizzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PracticeAnatomy.com - review human anatomy in pictures|url=https://practiceanatomy.com|website=practiceanatomy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been used as well.

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by [[Bolivia]]. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on [[International Mother Earth Day]] on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature.

This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?cat=136 |title=Rights of Mother Earth « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/initiatives/HarmonywithNature.html |title=Initiatives of the President of the 65th Session - General Assembly of the United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherearthrights.org/2009/12/22/the-united-nations-approved-the-resolution-%E2%80%9Charmony-with-nature%E2%80%9D-proposed-by-bolivia/ |title=The United Nations approved the resolution "Harmony with Nature" proposed by Bolivia « Mother Earth |publisher=Motherearthrights.org |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=1975 |title=UN Approves Two More Resolutions by Bolivia / ONU aprueba dos resoluciones más propuestas por Bolivia « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=2016 |title=UN General Assembly Debates Harmony With Nature « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/speech-by-bolivia-at-un-dialogue-on-harmony-with-nature/ |title=Speech by Bolivia at UN Dialogue on Harmony with Nature « World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the proposal==

The proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows.

'''Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)'''

The achievement of [[sustainable development]] in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the [[World Charter for Nature]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm |title=A/RES/37/7. World Charter for Nature |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rio Declaration]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_sids/sids_pdfs/BPOA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Earth Charter]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ECI Sec 3 |url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html |title=Read the Charter |publisher=Earthcharterinaction.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/ |title=World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would include the following premises:

'''I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM'''

1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this [[anthropocentric]] vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.

2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.

3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[geosphere]]. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term ''[[wikt:Mother Earth|Mother Earth]]'', we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.

4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.

'''II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY'''

5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.

6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.

7. Sustainable development seeks to [[eradicate poverty]] in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.

8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.

9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.

10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.

11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.

'''III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'''

12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.

13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.

14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.

15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.

16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the [[right to water]], but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause [[desertification]], lack of food, temperature increase, [[sea level rise]], migrations, [[acid rain]], and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.

17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.

18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1&amp;nbsp;°C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the [[Kyoto Protocol]], not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.

19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.

20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical [[ecological debt]] for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.

22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.

23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a [[financial transaction tax]] should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.

24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.

25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.

26. [[Intellectual property rights]] over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to [[food sovereignty]], [[biodiversity]], access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of [[intellectual property over life]] should be abolished.

27. [[Gross Domestic Product]] is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.

28. Respect for the [[sovereignty of States]] is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.

29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.

30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.

31. An International Tribunal of [[Environmental justice|Environmental]] and [[Climate Justice]] must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.

32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.

33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.

34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.

'''IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS'''

35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.

36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.

37. [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]] and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.

38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.

39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.

40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as [[carbon sinks]], and worse to promote their commercialization as does [[REDD]] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.

42. [[“Green” capitalism]] will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, [[wealth condensation|concentrations of wealth]], and speculative processes.

'''V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION'''

43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.

44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.

45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402182458/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=Rio+20 - United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The term '''hybrid neural network''' can have two meanings: 
#[[biological neural networks]] interacting with [[artificial neural network|artificial neuronal models]], and
#[[Artificial neural networks]] with a [[Computationalism|symbolic]] part (or, conversely, symbolic computations with a [[Connectionism|connectionist]] part). 

As for the first meaning, the [[artificial neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in hybrid networks can be [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog circuit|analog]]. For the digital variant [[voltage clamp]]s are used to monitor the [[membrane potential]] of [[neuron]]s, to computationally simulate artificial neurons and synapses and to stimulate biological neurons by inducing synaptic. For the analog variant, specially designed electronic circuits connect to a network of living neurons through electrodes. 

As for the second meaning, incorporating elements of symbolic computation and artificial neural networks into one model was an attempt to combine the advantages of both paradigms while avoid the shortcomings. Symbolic [[Knowledge representation|representation]]s have advantages with respect to explicit, direct control, fast initial coding, dynamic variable binding and knowledge abstraction. Representations of artificial neural networks, on the other hand, show advantages for biological plausibility, learning, robustness (fault-tolerant processing and graceful decay), and generalization to similar input. Since the early 1990s many attempts have been made to reconcile the two approaches.

The '''hydrosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὕδωρ ''hydōr'', "water"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Du%28%2Fdwr ὕδωρ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and σφαῖρα ''sphaira'', "sphere"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is the combined mass of [[water]] found on, under, and above the surface of a [[planet]], [[minor planet]] or [[natural satellite]]. Although, the hydrosphere has been around for longer than 4 billion years. It continues to change in size. This is caused by sea floor spreading and [[continental drift]], which rearranges the land and ocean. &lt;ref&gt;“Our Changing Planet: an Introduction to Earth System Science and Global Environmental Change.” Our Changing Planet: an Introduction to Earth System Science and Global Environmental Change, by Fred T.

It has been estimated that there are 1,386 million cubic kilometers of water on Earth.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998&gt;{{cite report|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html |publisher=UNESCO |date=1998 |accessdate=13 June 2013 |title=World Water Resources: A New Appraisal and Assessment for the 21st Century |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927160221/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes water in liquid and frozen forms in groundwater, oceans, lakes and streams. Saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount. [[Fresh water]] accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and mountain glaciers.  30.8% is in the form of fresh [[groundwater]]. Only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt; The total mass of the [[Earth]]'s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonnes]], which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. About 20 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonnes]] of this is in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] (for practical purposes, 1 cubic meter of water weighs one tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]], an area of some 361 million square kilometers (139.5 million square miles), is covered by [[ocean]]. The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of [[salt]] per kilogram of sea water (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael J.|last=Kennish|year=2001|title=Practical handbook of marine science|page=35|edition=3rd|publisher=CRC Press|series=Marine science series|isbn=0-8493-2391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water cycle==
{{main article|Water cycle}}
[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|right|393x393px]]
The [[water cycle]] refers to the transfer of water from one state or reservoir to another. Reservoirs include [[Water vapor|atmospheric moisture]] (snow, rain and clouds), streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, [[groundwater]], [[wikt:subterranean#English|subterranean]] [[aquifer]]s, [[polar ice cap]]s and saturated soil. [[Solar energy]], in the form of heat and light ([[insolation]]), and [[gravity]] cause the transfer from one state to another over periods from hours to thousands of years. Most [[evaporation]] comes from the oceans and is returned to the earth as snow or rain.&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;{{rp|27}} [[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] refers to evaporation from snow and ice. Transpiration refers to the expiration of water through the minute pores or stomata of trees. [[Evapotranspiration]] is the term used by [[hydrology|hydrologists]] in reference to the three processes together, transpiration, sublimation and evaporation.&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;

[[Marq de Villiers]] has described the hydrosphere as a [[closed system]] in which water exists. The hydrosphere is intricate, complex, interdependent, all-pervading and stable and "seems purpose-built for regulating life."&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003&gt;{{cite book|author= Marq de Villiers|title= Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource|url= |accessdate= |year=2003|publisher= McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-7710-2641-6|oclc = 43365804|edition=2|pages=453}}, revised 2003|[[Governor General's Award for English-language non-fiction|Governor General's Award]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} De Villiers claimed that, "On earth, the total amount of water has almost certainly not changed since geological times: what we had then we still have. Water can be polluted, abused, and misused but it is neither created nor destroyed, it only migrates. There is no evidence that water vapor escapes into space."&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

"Every year the turnover of water on Earth involves 577,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water. This is water that evaporates from the oceanic surface (502,800 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and from land (74,200 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation, 458,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on the ocean and 119,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface (119,000 - 74,200 = 44,800 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) represents the total runoff of the Earth's rivers (42,700 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) and direct groundwater runoff to the ocean (2100 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year). These are the principal sources of fresh water to support life necessities and man's economic activities."&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt;

Water is a basic necessity of life. Since 2/3 of the Earth is covered by water, the Earth is also called the blue planet and the watery planet.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According to planetary geologist, [[Ronald Greeley]], "Water is very common in the outer solar system."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Europa holds more water than earth's oceans.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrosphere plays an important role in the existence of the atmosphere in its present form. Oceans are important in this regard. When the Earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of Mercury. Later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere. The gases and water vapor released as the Earth cooled became its present atmosphere. Other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere. As the Earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain. The atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water. In turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain. This rain water filled the depressions on the Earth's surface and formed the oceans. It is estimated that this occurred about 4000 million years ago. The first life forms began in the oceans. These organisms did not breathe oxygen. Later, when [[cyanobacteria]] evolved, the process of conversion of carbon dioxide into food and oxygen began. As a result, Earth's atmosphere has a distinctly different composition from that of other planets and allowed for [[Evolutionary history of life|life to evolve on Earth]].

==Recharging reservoirs==
According to Igor A. Shiklomanov, it takes 2500 years for the complete recharge and replenishment of oceanic waters, 10,000 years for [[permafrost]] and ice, 1500 years for deep groundwater and mountainous glaciers, 17 years in lakes and 16 days in rivers.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt;

==Specific fresh water availability==
"Specific water availability is the residual (after use) per capita quantity of fresh water."&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt; Fresh water resources are unevenly distributed in terms of space and time and can go from floods to water shortages within months in the same area. In 1998 76% of the total population had a specific water availability of less than 5.0 thousand m3 per year per capita. Already by 1998, 35% of the global population suffered "very low or catastrophically low water supplies" and Shiklomanov predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the twenty-first century with "most of the Earth's population will be living under the conditions of low or catastrophically low water supply" by 2025. There is only 2.5% of fresh water in the hydrosphere and only 0.25% of water is accessible for our use.

It was established in 1991 in [[Moscow]].

The basic areas and directions of the scientific researches involve: global problems of contemporary civilization and [[Russia]]; analysis and forecasting of Russia’s socio-political development; social dynamics, structure and stratification of Russian society; methods and instruments for sociological research; sociology of management; [[political]] and [[economic sociology]]; demographic and migratory processes; sociology of federate and interethnic relations; social problems of [[national security]]; sociology of [[human rights]]; sociology of youth; [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], etc.

The Institute makes a socio-political analysis of the decisions made by the governmental, legislative and executive bodies.

Since 1992 on it has been engaged in a “How do you do, Russia?” sociological monitoring conducted under the strategic socio-political research.

The ISPR boasts a solid sociological and demographic data bank.

It publishes some scientific journals including ''Eurasia'', ''Nauka. Kultura. Obshchestvo'' /''Science. Culture. Society''/ (previously known as ''Nauka. Kultura. Predprinimatelstvo.'' /''Science. Politics. Entrepreneurship''/), methodical materials and manuals on sociology.

The Institute runs postgraduate and doctoral courses. 

The International [[UNESCO]] Chair of Social and Humanitarian Sciences has been set up at the Institute.

The Institute has such branches as the United South Branch, North Caucasian Center, North Ossetian Center of Social Research, etc.

The ISPR maintains close links and cooperates with scientific institutions of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], academic and scientific circles of the former USSR member-states, as well as with Great Britain, Germany, Israel, China, Netherlands, USA, France and other countries.

[[File:Başlıca İslâm çini ve keramik merkezleri.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Chief places named in connection with Islamic pottery.]]

Medieval '''Islamic pottery''' occupied a geographical position between [[Chinese ceramics]], then the unchallenged leaders of Eurasian production, and the pottery of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Europe.  For most of the period it can fairly be said to have been between the two in terms of aesthetic achievement and influence as well, borrowing from China and exporting to and influencing Byzantium and Europe. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, as pottery (but less often glass) also was in China, but was much rarer in Europe and Byzantium.  In the same way Islamic restrictions greatly discouraged figurative wall-painting, encouraging the architectural use of schemes of decorative and often [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically-patterned]] [[tile]]s, which are the most distinctive and original speciality of Islamic ceramics.

The era of Islamic [[pottery]] started around 622. From 633, [[Muslim]] armies moved rapidly towards [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]] and later [[Andalusia]]. The early history of Islamic pottery remains somewhat obscure and speculative as little evidence has survived.  Apart from tiles which escaped destruction due to their use in architectural decoration of buildings and mosques, much early medieval pottery vanished.

The Muslim world inherited significant pottery industries in Mesopotamia, [[Persia]], Egypt, North Africa ([[African Red Slip]]) and later other regions. Indeed, the origin of glazed pottery has been traced to Egypt where it was first introduced during the fourth millennium BCE.  However most of these traditions made heavy use of figurative decoration, which was greatly reduced, though not entirely removed, under Islam.  Instead Islamic pottery developed geometric and plant-based decoration to a very high level, and made more use of decorative schemes made up of many tiles than any previous culture.

Good health [to the owner]." Terracotta, white slip ground and slip underglaze decoration, Khurasan (Iran), 11th–12th century.]]
A distinct Muslim style in pottery was not firmly established until the 9th century in [[Iraq]] (formerly Mesopotamia), [[Syria]] and [[Persia]].  During this period pieces mainly used white [[tin-glaze]].  Information on earlier periods is very limited.  This is largely due to the lack of surviving specimens in good condition which also limits the interest in the study of ceramics of these periods.  Archaeological excavations carried out in Jordan uncovered only a few examples from the Umayyad period, mostly unglazed vessels from Khirbat Al-Mafjar.&lt;ref&gt;Baramki, D.C., "The pottery from Khirbet El-Mefjer", ''The Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine'' (QDAP 1942),  vol. 10, pp.65-103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, J.A., "Umayyad pottery from sites in East Jordan2, ''Jordan'', Vol.4, 1975, pp.25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the East, evidence shows that a production centre was set up in [[Samarkand]] under the [[Samanid]] dynasty who ruled this region and parts of [[Persia]] between 874 and 999 A.D.  The most highly regarded technique of this centre is the use of [[calligraphy]] in the decoration of vessels.  East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called "epigraphic ware", has been described as "probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278-290&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese influence===
{{main article|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}
During the Abbasid dynasty pottery production gained momentum, largely using tin glazes mostly in the form of opaque white glaze.  Some historians, such as Arthur Lane, attribute the rise of such industry to Chinese influence. Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih’s Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‘Ali ibn ‘Isa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), “twenty pieces of Chinese Imperial [[porcelain]] (Chini faghfuri),  the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph’s court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain”.
[[File:Plate dragon Louvre MAO696.jpg|thumb|Plate with dragon. Persia, 17th century, inspired by 15th-century Chinese blue and white porcelain]]

According to Lane, the influence of Chinese pottery progressed in three main phases.  The first contact with [[China]] took place in 751 when the Arabs defeated the Chinese at the [[Battle of Talas]].  It has been argued that imprisoned Chinese potters and paper makers could have taught the Muslims the art of pottery and paper-making.  In 800’s Chinese stoneware and porcelain reached the Abbasids.  The second phase took place in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period noted for the decline of pottery industry following the fall of the Seljuk dynasty.  This period also saw the invasion of the Mongols who brought Chinese pottery traditions.

The influence of ceramics from the [[Tang Dynasty]] can be seen on [[lustreware]]s, produced by [[Mesopotamia]]n potters, and on some early white wares excavated at [[Samarra]] (in modern-day [[Iraq]]). Ceramics from this period were excavated at [[Nishapur]] (in modern-day [[Iran]]) and [[Samarkand]] (in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]).

[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early Chinese [[blue and white porcelain]], c 1335, early [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Jingdezhen]], using a Middle-eastern shape]]
By the time of the [[Mongol invasion of China]] a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own [[fritware]] bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of [[Korean pottery]], but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140-141 especially&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger [[celadon]] dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East.  Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of [[Chinese blue and white porcelain]], which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming.  Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the [[arabesque]]s and [[scroll (art)|plant scrolls]] of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels.  This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves.  The [[cobalt blue]] that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in [[Quanzhou]], convenient for the huge [[Jingdezhen]] potteries, and other ports to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 137-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the [[Ming dynasty]] was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries.  This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the [[Zhengde Emperor]]'s (r. 1505-1521) flirtation with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic innovations===
{{see also|Hispano-Moresque ware|İznik pottery|Alchemy and chemistry in Islam}}

From between the eighth and eighteenth centuries, the use of [[Ceramic glaze|glazed ceramics]] was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]], for the production of [[tin-glazed pottery]], was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters.  The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]] originating in 9th-century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; It was a vitreous or semivitreous ceramic ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Terminology Of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products. ASTM Standard C242.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cup lustre Louvre OA8179.jpg|thumb|left|9th-century [[lustreware]] bowl from [[Iraq]]]]

[[Lusterware]] was produced  in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Lusterware was later produced in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid]] caliphate in the 10th-12th centuries. While some production of lustreware  continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]]&amp;mdash;first in the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of [[Al-Andalus]], notably at [[Málaga]], and then [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], then later to Italy, where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]].

Another innovation was the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Brought to Italy from Spain, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.

[[Fritware]] refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. [[Frit]] was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Bernsted 2003, ''Early Islamic Pottery: Materials and Techniques'', London: Archetype Publications Ltd., 25; R.B. Mason and M.S. Tite 1994, The Beginnings of Islamic Stonepaste Technology, ''Archaeometry'' 36.1: 77&lt;/ref&gt; This type of pottery has also been referred to as “stoneware" and “faience” among other names.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from [[Baghdad]] has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and [[diopside]] crystals formed within the glass fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of “inclusions of crushed [[pottery]]” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze.&lt;ref name="Masonand"&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the [[hardness]] and [[density]] of the [ceramic] body.”&lt;ref name="Masonand" /&gt;

==Middle (1200–1400)==

By this period the distinctive Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, and continued to develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to [[Islamic art]].  In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, “a man from [[Baghdad]]” to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the [[mihrab]] of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must have led to the establishment of a satellite centre for the production of ceramics in [[Quairawan]], but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Marcais G., ''Les faiences a reflets metalliques de la grande Mosquee de Kairouan'', Paris, 1928, pp.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The events leading to the collapse of the [[Fatimid]] reign in 1171 caused ceramic production to move out to new centres, via processes similar to those described above with respect to [[Iraq]].  As a result, Persia  became a centre of revival under the Seljuk rule (1038–1327).  This is not coincidental as the Seljuks expanded their rule over Persia, Iraq, Syria, and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as well as [[Anatolia]] and Muslim [[Asia Minor]].   All of these had been, for some considerable time, centres of old pottery.
[[File:Coupe iran.JPG|thumb|left|Bowl with hunters, [[Persian pottery]] from 12th–13th century.]]
The Seljuks brought new and fresh inspiration to the Muslim world, attracting artists, craftsmen and potters from all regions including Egypt.  In addition to continuing the production of similar (although more refined) [[Tin-glazing|tin]] and lustre glaze ceramics, the Seljuks (in Persia) were credited for the introduction of a new type sometimes known as "Faience". This is made from a hard white [[frit]] paste coated with transparent [[alkaline]] glaze.

[[Hispano-Moresque ware]] emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] in the 13th century, probably after potters escaped the instability after the fall of the Fatimids.  It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms.  The first centre was [[Málaga]], producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the [[Reconquista|reconquered]] Christian city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], outlying suburbs of which such as [[Manises]] and [[Paterna]] became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character.  The potters were mostly still Muslim or [[Morisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Caiger-Smith|Caiger-Smith, Alan]], ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World'', Chapters 6 &amp; 7, (Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out.  Frit was made of ten parts of powdered [[quartz]], one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made [[Pottery#Methods of shaping|wheel throwing]] of the faience easier, and allowed a better quality of work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Allan,''The History of So-Called Egyptian Faience in Islamic Persia''[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ToZNNX9ByKcJ:onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.1973.tb00087.x/pdf+clay+in+Islamic+Faience&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjQqKQNJACMRhHBF4olfMRaqbohZCsx8Lzwp62x9CoF89N2Aqg7g_vIfVaSHY9gbxiS3kL65qWZmc1bHicjUsSazPR8peLN5zIfbVa_8Vp44i0a6ajlDRCvUszsfBW51oW5z3kf&amp;sig=AHIEtbS8aaJN_ZqzN-NjalLSjuYd5tmE_A]&lt;/ref&gt;  The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts.  These act as a [[flux]] and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature.  The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, O., ''Persian Lustre Ware'', London 1985, .p.32. Cited in Febervari Gesa (2000), op., cit, .p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century.  This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability.  This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on.  These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, A. (1947) ''Early Islamic Pottery'', Faber and Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Carved decoration in ceramics, [[sgraffito]], is an old tradition used in ninth-century Islamic pottery; it is an engraving technique based on incising the design with a sharp tool through a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] to reveal the red [[earthenware]] body. The vessel is then coated with glaze.

The Seljuks also developed the so-called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background.  These are produced by a technique which consists of coating the white [[fritware]] body with a thick black [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], out of which the decoration is then carved.  Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied.  According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries.  The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque clay slip instead.

The influence of [[Blue and white porcelain]] of the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming dynasties]] is evident in many ceramics made by Muslim potters. [[İznik pottery]] from around [[İznik]] in [[Anatolia]] was supported by the Ottoman court and produced the finest [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration.  A characteristic bold red was developed.  İznik ware had a major influence on [[Europe]]an decorative arts: for example, on Italian [[Maiolica]].  The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by [[Miletus ware]] from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Tite 1989, İznik Pottery: An Investigation of the Methods of Production, ''Archaeometry'' 31.2: 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Its best period lasted until the late 16th century.  It consists of a body, [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], and glaze, where the body and glaze are “quartz-frit.”&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The “frits” in both cases “are unusual in that they contain [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] as well as [[sodium oxide|soda]]”; the lead oxide would help reduce the [[coefficient of thermal expansion|thermal expansion coefficient]] of the ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled “frit” is “interstitial glass” which serves to connect the quartz particles.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 120, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael S. Tite argues that this glass was added as frit and that the interstitial glass formed on firing.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th century saw the finest period of the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of Valencia, produced by largely Muslim potters in a Christian kingdom, though the southern industry centred on Málaga had ended by the mid-century.  Persian pottery under the [[Safavid dynasty]] (from 1502) was also heavily influenced by Chinese blue and white porcelain, which to a large extent replaced it in court circles; fine 16th-century Persian pieces are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, p. 262, no. 395&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Islamic parts of [[Southeast Asia]], modern [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], were export markets that were close at hand for the Chinese and later the Japanese, helped by the European trading companies, especially the [[Dutch East India Company]].  The Buddhist countries of the region also exported.  Special types of wares were developed for them, such as the Chinese [[Kraak ware]] and [[Swatow ware]], mostly producing large dishes for serving communally to a table. In the face of such competion, local wares were few and simple.   

The Islamic world as a whole never managed to develop [[porcelain]], but had an avid appetite for imports of it.  East Asian porcelain, first Chinese then [[Japanese export porcelain]] in the 17th century, was joined in the 18th century by the wares from Europe, in particular [[Vienna porcelain]], which specialized in the Eastern market, and by the latter part of the century was sending as many as 120,000 pieces per year to the [[Ottoman Empire]], many small cups and saucers for [[Turkish coffee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', p. 96, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The smaller scale factories of the Islamic world could not compete with the sophisticated imports arriving from both east and west, and local production became a craft affair, repeating now-traditional patterns.

==Study of Islamic pottery==
Arthur Lane produced two books which made substantial contribution to understanding the history and merit of Muslim ceramics.  The first book was dedicated to the study of early ceramics from the [[Abbasid]] period till the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] times, sketching the various events which played a significant role in the rise and fall of particular styles.  In his second work, Lane used the same rhetorical style adopted in the first book, this time devoting his attention to later periods from the Mongols to nineteenth-century [[İznik pottery|İznik]] and Persian pottery.

Following Lane's works, numerous studies appeared. The most comprehensive works adopting a general view are those by [[R.L. Hobson]], [[Ernst J. Grube]], [[Richard Ettinghausen]], and more recently [[Alan Caiger-Smith]] and [[Gesa Febervari]].  Additional contributions were made by those specializing in particular temporal or regional history of Muslim pottery such as [[Georges Marcais]] in his work on North Africa, [[Oliver Watson]] on Persia and [[J.R. Hallett]] on Abbasid Pottery.

'''Learning about Forests''' (LEAF) is one of the five programs run by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE), a [[non-governmental organization]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. LEAF aims to encourage school classes and teachers to use [[forests]] for educational activities. The ''vision'' is to see an increased level of awareness and knowledge the key role the forest plays on our planet. The program's ''mission'' is to spread [[environmental education]] concerning forests and all their values among school children all around the world.

==Member organizations==
In August 2013, LEAF was composed of twenty-one organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAF Member Organi[z]ations|url=http://www.leaf-international.org/Side.cfm?ID_kanal=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4070">The '''Leonard–Merritt mass estimator''' is a formula for estimating the mass of a spherical [[stellar system]] using the apparent (angular) positions and [[proper motions]] of its component [[star]]s. The distance to the stellar system must also be known.

Like the [[virial theorem]], the Leonard–Merritt estimator yields correct results regardless of the degree of velocity anisotropy. Its statistical properties are superior to those of the virial theorem. However, it requires that two components of the velocity be known for every star, rather than just one for the virial theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimator has the general form

&lt;math&gt;

\langle M(r)\rangle = {16\over 3\pi G} 
\langle R\left(2V_R^2 + V_T^2\right)\rangle.

&lt;/math&gt;

The angle brackets denote averages over the ensemble of observed stars. &lt;math&gt; M(r) &lt;/math&gt; is the mass contained within a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the stellar system; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the projected distance of a star from the apparent center; &lt;math&gt;V_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; are the components of a star's velocity parallel to, and perpendicular to, the apparent radius vector; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

Like all estimators based on moments of the [[Jeans equations]], the Leonard–Merritt estimator requires an assumption about the relative distribution of mass and light. As a result, it is most useful when applied to stellar systems that have one of two properties:
# All or almost all of the mass resides in a central object, or,
# the mass is distributed in the same way as the observed stars.
Case (1) applies to the nucleus of a galaxy containing a [[supermassive black hole]]. Case (2) applies to a stellar system composed entirely of luminous stars (i.e. no [[dark matter]] or [[black holes]]).

In a cluster with constant mass-to-light ratio and total mass &lt;math&gt;M_T&lt;/math&gt;, the Leonard–Merritt estimator becomes:

&lt;math&gt;M_T = {32\over 3\pi G} 
\langle R \left(2V_R^2 + V_T^2\right)\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, if all the mass is located in a central point of mass &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;, then:

&lt;math&gt;M_0 = {16\over 3\pi G} 
\langle R\left(2V_R^2 + V_T^2\right)\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

In its second form, the Leonard–Merritt estimator has been successfully used to measure the mass of the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''mating call''' is the auditory signal used by animals to attract mates. It can occur in males or females, but literature is abundantly favored toward researching mating calls in males. In addition, mating calls are often the subject of [[mate choice]], in which the preferences of one gender for a certain type of mating call can drive sexual selection in a species. This can result in [[sympatric speciation]] of some animals, where two species diverge from each other while living in the same environment.

There are many different mechanisms to produce mating calls, which can be broadly categorized into vocalizations and mechanical calls. Vocalizations are considered as sounds produced by the [[larynx]] and are often seen in species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects. Mechanical calls refer to any other type of sound that the animal produces using unique body parts and/or tools for communication with potential mates. Examples include crickets that vibrate their wings, birds that flap their feathers, and frogs that use an air sac instead of lungs.

== Vocalizations ==

=== Birds ===
[[File:Song Sparrow (8381415679).jpg|thumb|Song sparrow]]
[[File:SND 4458a.ogg|thumb|Mating call of Japanese bush warbler,  ''Horornis diphone'']]The use of vocalizations is widespread in avian species and are often used to attract mates. Different aspects and features of bird song such as structure, amplitude and frequency have evolved as a result of sexual selection.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemeth|first=E|author2=Kempenaers, B |author3=Matessi, G |author4= Brumm, H |title=Rock sparrow song reflects male age and reproductive success.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e43259|pmid=22927955|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0043259 |pmc=3426517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large song repertoires are preferred by females of many avian species.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfaff|first=JA|author2=Zanette, L |author3=MacDougall-Shackleton, SA |author4= MacDougall-Shackleton, EA |title=Song repertoire size varies with HVC volume and is indicative of male quality in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=Aug 22, 2007|volume=274|issue=1621|pages=2035–40|pmid=17567560|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0170 |pmc=2275172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hypothesis for this is that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain's [[HVC (avian brain region)|song control nucleus]] (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success. In [[song sparrow]]s, males with large repertoires had larger HVCs, better body condition and lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health. This supports the idea that song sparrows with large song repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the male's "quality". Possible explanations for this adaptation include direct benefits to the female, such as superior parental care or territory defense, and indirect benefits, such as good genes for their offspring.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007 /&gt;

[[Japanese bush warbler]] songs from island populations have an acoustically simple structure when compared to mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamao|first=Shoji|title=Acoustic structure of songs in island populations of the Japanese bush warbler, Cettia diphone, in relation to sexual selection|journal=Journal of Ethology|year=2012|volume=31|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/s10164-012-0341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Song complexity is correlated with higher levels of sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in [[purple-crowned fairywren]]s; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=ML|author2=Kingma, SA |author3=Peters, A |title=Male songbird indicates body size with low-pitched advertising songs.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e56717|pmid=23437221|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056717|pmc=3577745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[rock sparrow]], song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra pair copulation frequency.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012/&gt;[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|Red deer stag during rut]]

Bird calls are also known to continue after pair formation in several socially [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]] bird species. In one experimental population of [[zebra finch]]es, there was increased singing activity by the male after breeding.&lt;ref name="bolund2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolund|first=Elisabeth|author2=Schielzeth, Holger |author3=Forstmeier, Wolfgang |title=Singing activity stimulates partner reproductive investment rather than increasing paternity success in zebra finches|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=6|pages=975–984|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1346-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is positively correlated with the partner's reproductive investment. The female finches were bred in cages with two subsequent males that differed with varying amounts of song output. Females produced larger [[Bird egg|eggs]] with more orange yolks when paired with a male with a high song output. This suggests that the relative amount of song production in paired zebra finch males might function to stimulate the partner rather than to attract extra-pair females.&lt;ref name="bolund2012" /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
During the [[breeding season]], mammals will call out to the opposite sex. Male [[koala]]s that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlton | first1 = B.

Male-male competition is rarely exhibited in koalas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = W. A. H. | last2 = Bercovitch | first2 = F.

Acoustic signaling is a type of call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism's location, condition and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = M.

When females hear these songs, named a 'whistle', they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own. This action is termed 'calling of the sexes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = SONGS , SCENTS , AND SENSES : SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE GREATER SAC-WINGED BAT , SACCOPTERYX BILINEATA | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 1401–1410 | doi=10.1644/08-mamm-s-060.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red deer]] and [[spotted hyena]]s along with other mammals also perform acoustic signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, C.

[[File:Tungara Frog (Engystomops pustulosus) Calling.jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

=== Amphibians ===
Most frogs use an air sac located under their mouth to produce mating calls. Air from the lungs channels to the air sac to inflate it, and the air sac resonates to produce a mating call. The larynx is larger and more developed in males, which causes their call to be louder and stronger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B.

In the [[Tungara frog|túngara frog]], males use a whining call followed by up to seven clucks. Males who have a whine-cluck call are more successful in attracting females than males whose call is a whine alone. The ability to produce clucks is due to a specialized fibrous mass attached to the frog's vocal folds, creating an unusual vocalization similar to the two-voiced songs found in some birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Animal communication: Complex call production in the túngara frog|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7089/full/441038a.html|journal = Nature|date = 2006-05-04|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 38-38|volume = 441|issue = 7089|doi = 10.1038/441038a|first = M.|last = Gridi-Papp|first2 = A. S.|last2 = Rand|first3 = M. J.|last3 = Ryan|pmid=16672962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common toad]], sexual competition is driven in large part by fighting—successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access to mating with that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Competitive mate searching in male common toads, Bufo bufo|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347279900708|journal = Animal Behaviour|pages = 1253–1267|volume = 27|doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(79)90070-8|first = N.B.|last = Davies|first2 = T.R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads Bufo bufo|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v274/n5672/abs/274683a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1978-08-17|pages = 683–685|volume = 274|issue = 5672|doi = 10.1038/274683a0|first = N. B.|last = Davies|first2 = T. R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ===
While mating calls in insects are usually associated with mechanical mating calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer]], males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then take advantage of the female's "freezing" response to mate with the female.

In the [[Arctiinae (erebid moths)|Japanese lichen moth]], however, the female is able to distinguish between the sounds made by males and those made by bats and other predators.As a result, the males use ultrasonic clicking as a more conventional mating signal, compared to the "deceptive" courtship song used in the Asian Corn Bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution of deceptive and true courtship songs in moths|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02003|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-06-20|pmc = 3687589|pmid = 23788180|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep02003|first = Ryo|last = Nakano|first2 = Takuma|last2 = Takanashi|first3 = Annemarie|last3 = Surlykke|first4 = Niels|last4 = Skals|first5 = Yukio|last5 = Ishikawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical calls==
Mating calls also take form through mechanical processes. Animals that are unable to vocalize their call may use their body to attract mates.

=== Crickets ===
[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|Mating call of field cricket, ''Gryllus pennsylvanicus'']]

In the field cricket, ''Gryllus integer'', males rub their wings together to create a rapid trill that produces sound.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. V. | year = 2000 | title = Crickets with extravagant mating songs compensate for predation risk with extra caution | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1444| pages = 671–675 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1054 | pmid=10821611 | pmc=1690585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males individually vary in the durations of their trilling or, what is more sophisticatedly called, bout length. The bout length of each male is heritable and passed on to his future offspring. Also, females prefer to mate with males that have longer bout lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = AV | year = 1986 | title = Female preferences for male calling bout duration in a field cricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 73–77 | doi=10.1007/bf00303845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that males with longer bout lengths produce more offspring than males with shorter bout lengths.

Other factors that influence the formation of these bout lengths include temperature and predation. In field crickets, males prefer warmer sites for mating as shown by an increase in the frequency of their mating calls when they were living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. | last2 = Perez | first2 = D. | last3 = Lichti | first3 = N. | last4 = Yew | first4 = J. | year = | title = Temperature preferences of male field crickets (Gryllus integer) alter their mating calls | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A| volume =  188| issue = | pages =  799–805| doi=10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation also affects the mating calls of field crickets. When in a potentially dangerous environment, males cease calling for longer periods of time when interrupted by a predator cue.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"/&gt; This suggests that there is an interplay between intensity of mating call and risk of predation.

=== Sonation ===
{{main|Sonation}}
As described in [[Sonation]], "the term sonate is described as the deliberate production of sounds, not from the throat, but rather from structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers, or by the use of tools". In several amphibian and fish species, other special structures are used to produce different sounds to attract mates. Birds are common users of sonation, although several amphibian and fish species have been shown to use sonation as a form of mating call as well. In general, sonation is one factor that plays into how a female may choose a mate. There are other features of mating such as territory defense or mate defense, which contribute to the cause of finding suitable mates.

As outlined below, each species uses a distinct method to produce a non-vocal mating call in order to be most successful in attracting mates. The examples below represent the most common examples found in the literature, although many more examples may exist in nature that are still currently unknown.
[[File:Feather of male Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl).jpg|thumb|Feather of male ''Pavo cristatus'' (Indian peafowl). These feathers are used in sonation to create infrasound with intent of mating.]]

==== Birds ====
The feathers, the beak, the feet, and different tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers to produce a [[drumming (snipe)|"drumming"]] sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a "rattle" or "throbbing" noise.&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, P. H. "On the "bleating" or "drumming" of the snipe (Gallinago coelestis)." Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Vol. 77. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Palm cockatoos use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise to attract the attention of mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Patricia M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1915 | title = Enhanced: The Music of Nature and the Nature of Music | url = | journal = Science Online | volume = 291 | issue = | pages = 52–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bustards]] are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = Juan C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Correlates of male mating success in great bustard leks: the effects of age, weight, and display effort | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = 10| pages = 1589–1600 | doi=10.1007/s00265-010-0972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mirafra apiata]]'', commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maclean | first1 = Gordon L | year = 1970 | title = Breeding behaviour of larks in the Kalahari Sandveld | url = | journal = Annals of the Natal Museum | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 388–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of birds use sonation for mating calls such as manakins and hummingbirds. However, peacocks exhibit a feature of sonation that reveals intrasexual and intersexual properties of this type of mating call.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infrasound in mating displays: a peacock's tale|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215000391|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 241–250|volume = 102|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.029|first = Angela R.|last = Freeman|first2 = James F.|last2 = Hare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males move their feathers to produce low-frequency sonations ([[infrasound]]) and sonate more frequently in response to sonations by other males. This is attributable to a male's desire to advertise its presence above other males looking for mates, suggesting that sonation carries an intrasexual function. In addition, females show increased alertness when hearing the infrasound signals produced by males' wing-shaking, which highlights how the two sexes use sonation to interact with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Fish ====

While most bird species use their feathers, tools, or feet to produce sounds and attract mates, many fish species use specialized internal organs to sonate. In [[Gadidae|Gadoid fish]], special muscles attached to the swimbladder assist in the production of knocking or grunting sounds to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Just Rasmussen | first2 = Knud | year = 1978 | title = The calls of gadoid fish | url = | journal = Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom | volume = 58 | issue = 04| pages = 891–911 | doi=10.1017/s0025315400056848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lepidoptera ====
In many lepidoptera species including the adzuki bean borer ([[Ostrinia scapulalis]]), ultrasonic mating calls are used to attract females and keep them motionless during copulation. These pulses have an average frequency of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takanashi|first=Takuma|last2=Nakano|first2=Ryo|last3=Surlykke|first3=Annemarie|last4=Tatsuta|first4=Haruki|last5=Tabata|first5=Jun|last6=Ishikawa|first6=Yukio|last7=Skals|first7=Niels|date=2010-10-04|title=Variation in Courtship Ultrasounds of Three Ostrinia Moths with Different Sex Pheromones|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13144|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation due to mating call differences ==

Differences in mating calls can lead to the separation of different populations within a species. These differences can be due to several factors, including body size, temperature, and other ecological factors.These can arise in the form of tonal, temporal, or behavioral variations in mating calls that subsequently lead to the separation of populations. The separation of these populations due to differences in mating call and mating call preferences can lead to the evolution and creation of new, unique species.

This type of speciation is most often sympatric speciation: where two or more species are created from an existing parent species that all live in the same geographic location. Although there is an absence of research on mammals and birds, this phenomenon has been heavily researched in several frog species around the world. The examples below illuminate speciation due to mating call differences in several frog species around the world. These distinct species are included because they are the focus of the majority of current research. 
[[File:Gastrophryne olivacea01a.jpg|thumb|Two ''Microhyla olivacea'' in a mating position]]

=== ''Microhyla olivacea'' and ''Microhyla carolinensis'' ===
These two species of narrow-mouthed frog live in the southern United States and have overlapping ranges in Texas and Oklahoma. Researchers have discovered that these two different species alter the frequencies of their call in the overlap zone of their ranges. For example, the ''Microhyla olivacea'' mating call has a significantly lower midpoint frequency in the overlap zone than the mating call outside this zone. This leads researchers to suggest that the differences in mating call in the overlap zone of ''M. olivacea and M. carolinensis'' act as an isolating mechanism between the two species. They also hypothesize that the evolution of these differences in mating call led to the separation of these two different frog species from one common species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mating Call in the Speciation of Anuran Amphibians|last = Blair|first = Frank|date = 1958|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/282007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Engystomops petersi 1.jpg|thumb|
''Engystomops petersi''
]]

=== ''Engystomops petersi'' ===
Female preferences for specific male mating calls can lead to sexual selection in mating calls. Females may prefer a specific type of call that certain males possess, in which only those males will be able to mate with females and pass on their genes and specific mating call. As a result, this female preference may lead to divergence of two species.

In Amazonian frogs, sexual selection for different calls has led to the [[Reproductive isolation|behavioral isolation]] and speciation of the túngara frog (''Engystomops petersi)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual selection drives speciation in an Amazonian frog|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1608/399|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2007-02-07|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 1702375|pmid = 17164204|pages = 399–406|volume = 274|issue = 1608|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3736|first = Kathryn E.|last = Boul|first2 = W. Chris|last2 = Funk|first3 = Catherine R.|last3 = Darst|first4 = David C.|last4 = Cannatella|first5 = Michael J.|last5 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated. From their research, scientists believe that differences in female preferences for mating call type have led to the evolution of this speciation process. Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not. For this reason, the differences in call have led to the mechanical separation of this species.

=== ''Pseudacris triseriata'' ===
[[File:Western Chorus Frog (6922520670).jpg|thumb|A Chorus Frog making a mating call]]
Several studies have shown that the species ''Pseudacris triseriata'' (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, ''P. t. maculata'' and ''P. t. triseriata,'' due to speciation events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Speciation within the Chorus Frog Pseudacris triseriata: Morphometric and Mating Call Analyses of the Boreal and Western Subspecies|journal = Copeia|date = 1989-08-08|pages = 704–712|volume = 1989|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1445498|first = James E.|last = Platz|jstor=1445498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.

(1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Monopolies of knowledge''' arise when the [[ruling class]] maintains political power through control of key communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.357.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that monopolies of knowledge gradually suppress new ways of thinking. Entrenched hierarchies become increasingly rigid and out of touch with social realities. Challenges to elite power are often likely to arise on the margins of society. The arts, for example, are often seen as a means of escape from the sterility of conformist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'', introduced and edited by William Christian. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Innis]] developed the concept of monopolies of knowledge in his later writings on [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Monopolies of knowledge|communications theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Toronto: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurs in [[ancient Egypt]] where a complex writing system conferred a monopoly of knowledge on literate priests and scribes. Mastering the art of writing and reading required long periods of apprenticeship and instruction, confining knowledge to this powerful class.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's warnings about monopolies of knowledge take on particular urgency in the years immediately preceding his death in 1952. In his later writings, he argued that industrialization and mass media had led to the mechanization of a culture in which more personal forms of oral communication were radically devalued.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, pp.80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; "Reading is quicker than listening," Innis wrote in 1948. "The printing press and the radio address the world instead of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the concept ==

When discussing the monopolies of knowledge, Innis focuses much of his concern on the United States, where he feared that mass-circulation newspapers and magazines along with privately owned broadcasting networks had undermined independent thought and local cultures and rendered audiences passive in the face of what he calls the "vast monopolies of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''The Strategy of Culture''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. Carey]] notes that Innis worried about the centralized control of information and entertainment by advertising-driven media. "The very existence of a commodity such as 'information' and an institution called 'media' make each other necessary," Carey writes. "More people spend more time dependent on the journalist, the publisher, and the program director. Every week they wait for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [magazine]."&lt;ref&gt;Carey, James W. (1992) ''Communication As Culture: Essays on Media and Society'', p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fashion his concept of monopolies of knowledge, Innis drew on several fields of study, including economics, history, communications and technology.

===Economics and the price system===

In his 1938 essay, ''The Penetrative Powers of the Price System'', Innis anticipates his later concept of monopolies of knowledge.  Although he does not precisely define what he means by the "price system", he does show how trade and technology shaped modern industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.217-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis suggests, for example, that the shift from coal and iron to oil and electricity had profound implications that no one in industrial societies could escape. He mentions the growth of cities with people living in large apartment buildings made possible by developments in electrical equipment on the one hand, and the dispersal of populations over wide metropolitan areas as a result of the automobile and paved roads, on the other.

The inhabitants of modern industrial societies even eat differently than their more rural forebears. "The demands of population in congested areas, under the direction of scientific work in nutrition," Innis writes, "have shifted from carbohydrates to vitamins or from wheat to dairy products, live-stock, fruits and vegetables."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he adds, city dwellers are influenced by cheap, mass-circulation newspapers which peddle political stereotypes along with department store ads.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Essays), pp.266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the industrial economy monopolizes how people live, work, communicate and think.&lt;ref&gt;See, Kroker, Arthur. (1984) ''Technology and the Canadian Mind''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, pp.120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and classical studies===

Innis's concept of monopolies of knowledge was also influenced by the scholar [[Solomon Gandz]] who published a lengthy paper in 1939 on the significance of the [[oral tradition]] in the development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandz advanced the idea that the control of language in the oral tradition was grounded in religious institutions which ensured a civilization's continuity by preserving its traditions. At the same time, however, religious elites often shared their power with political elites who controlled the use of military force, thereby ensuring a civilization's success in conquering and holding territory.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.358-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis incorporated these ideas in his concept of [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Time and space|time-biased and space-biased media]]. He argued that civilizations and empires flourished when there was a [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Balance.2C bias and empire|balance]] between time- and space-biased media.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of one type of medium over the other, however, undermined stability demonstrating that unbalanced monopolies of knowledge could gradually lead to the decline and fall of civilizations and empires.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Innis's discussion of the priestly monopoly over writing that undermined the Egyptian empire. Innis (Empire), pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued this was, in fact, happening to Western civilization which had become [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Western civilization in peril|dangerously unbalanced]] partly because of the monopoly of knowledge exercised by space-biased communications technologies such as the daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the newspaper reflected an obsession with what he termed "present-mindedness".&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers and the news agencies that served them could transmit large amounts of information over long distances, but this speed of transmission and the emphasis on immediacy obliterated continuity and memory. "Time," Innis wrote, "has been cut into pieces the length of a day's newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (1954) "Concept of Monopoly and Civilization." ''Explorations'', No. 3 quoted in Carey, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of electronic media—radio and later, television—added more speed and immediacy contributing cumulatively to the erasure of cultural memory. Moreover, these space-biased media could be used by political elites to mobilize large populations—as in [[Nazi Germany]]—to support disastrous wars of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of writing==

Innis placed special emphasis on monopolies of knowledge that are based on the control of written media. "We can conveniently divide the history of the West into the writing and printing periods," he writes in [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C printing and speech|''Empire and Communications'']].&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===

"The sword and the pen worked together," Innis writes. "The written record signed, sealed, and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government. Small communities were written into large states and states were consolidated into empire." Innis adds that the monarchies of Egypt and Persia as well as the Roman empire "were essentially products of writing."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome's adoption of papyrus facilitated the [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C empire and religion|spread of writing]] and the growth of bureaucratic administration needed to govern vast territories.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), pp.120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of the alphabet strengthened monopolies of knowledge in a variety of ancient empires.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis warns about the power of writing to create mental "grooves" which determine "the channels of thought of readers and later writers."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printing and paper===

Innis believed that the [[printing press]] was a decisive invention in the history of the West. [[Lewis Mumford]] pointed out that printing was "a completely mechanical achievement...the type for all future instruments of reproduction: for the printed sheet...was the first completely standardized product."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis (1946) ''Technics and Civilization''. London: George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., p.135.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Innis, the printing press and the accompanying medium of paper ushered in not just the mechanization that would become characteristic of an industrial society based on mass production, but also the mechanization of knowledge itself. By that, Innis meant that printing led to the production of beliefs and practices that reinforced monopolies of knowledge characteristic of industrial culture.&lt;ref&gt;See, Innis, Harold (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'' introduced and edited by William Christian, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this can be seen in the large-scale production of [[newsprint]] in the 19th century that had far-reaching effects. Newsprint fostered the development of big newspaper plants that needed larger numbers of readers to deliver to big advertisers such as [[department store]]s. Department stores themselves reflected new ways of marketing to rising numbers of city dwellers. To attract more readers, newspaper proprietors began to run [[comics]] and to rely on the "excitement and sensationalism" of foreign wars. Such coverage influenced British and American foreign policies, sometimes disastrously.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis also warned that printed books could produce conformity of thought akin to the regimentation of workers in industrial factories.&lt;ref&gt;See Housser, Signe, ''Harold A. Innis and Michel Foucault: A Communications Perspective on Knowledge Construction''[http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/bitstream/1892/7718/1/b16625535.pdf], MA Thesis, Simon Fraser University, 1984, pp.66-67. Housser draws on ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis''. 2/42, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeats the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|Biblical commandment against worshiping graven images]], but suggests that in our unconscious society, this prohibition is not interpreted to apply to the printed word.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Idea File), 1/1, p.3. Innis writes: "Thou shalt not worship any graven image—not interpreted to mean the printed word or those words themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Kuhns, societies dominated by print media regard only printed knowledge as "essentially valid." Textbook publishers exert a huge influence on education at all levels while schools and universities refuse to accept knowledge in other than printed forms. "The monopoly of knowledge protects its own with wary vigilance," Kuhns writes.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhns, William. (1971) ''The Post-Industrial Prophets: Interpretations of Technology''. New York: Weybright and Talley, pp.154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in Mumford's words, with the advent of the printed book, learning "became book-learning."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Levinson]] writes that "[l]iteracy probably constitutes the most significant monopoly of knowledge in human history."&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Paul. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution''. New York: Routledge, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, however, that in open, democratic societies, public education systems are dedicated to breaking this monopoly by teaching students how to read and write, thereby giving them full access to printed knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, pp.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New media==

We can look at the [[Internet]] as being a factor in creating knowledge monopolies. Those who have the skills to use the technology have the power to choose what information is communicated. The significance of the Internet in the creation of these monopolies, in more recent years, has been somewhat diminished due to increased knowledge and awareness of how to use the technology. At the same time, the ever-increasing complexity of digital technologies strengthens monopolies of knowledge as the ''New York Times'' points out in a series which began on April 27, 2009, called ''The Digital Arms Race'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country’s power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets — in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/us/28cyber.html?pagewanted=all]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wherever new media arise, so too do monopolies of knowledge concerning how to use the technologies to reinforce the power and control of elite groups.

[[Image:Boerbok.jpg|thumb|100px|A Boer goat buck, This is some of the breed of goat found at Ogongo Agricultural College]]
The '''Ogongo  Agricultural College''' is a college based in [[Omusati Region]], in the northern part of Namibia. The college was founded in 1973 to train locals in agriculture. The college was closed between 1988 and 1992 due to civil disorder.The Ogongo Agricultural College is part of the University of Namibia  and it has led to job creation for the local population and attracts visitors from across the country as well as abroad. Apart from employment, the college, which is at the moment known as the University of Namibia Ogongo campus offers the inhabitants a variety of agricultural products such as milk, vegetables as well as meat. the campus in addition is a relief to poor parents and guardians who could not afford to send their children to a far away town such as Windhoek in order for them to get tertiary education, the campus is situated in the village and therefore cuts even costs for transport, accommodation and food as some student commute from home to school everyday. apart from that, the campus is also of great help to its inhabitants on the fact that it offers its open buildings to host various community functions such as award ceremonies of the local schools, weddings, or most commonly the entertainment events like Miss Ogongo and others . by doing this the institution promotes youth empowerment of the youth in the village. The Campus is on a 4,350 ha farm of which 1000 ha serves as a game park. This offers a unique opportunity to conduct almost all student field practical on campus and a further opportunity for research and community engagements in agriculture production and the management of natural resources.

 Indeed, the campus is mandated to develop innovative ways of crop and animal production as well as environmental management and instil this knowledge in the student clientele and the community.Training at Ogongo focuses on Agriculture, Management of natural resources and Environmental Science. Specifically, students may opt for any of the four (4) flagship programmes, namely the Bachelor of Science Degree in Crop Science, Bachelor of Science Degree in Integrated Environmental Science, Diploma in Agriculture as well as the Diploma in Natural Resources Management. All students admitted at Ogongo have a chance to be accommodated in the University hostels, making it very convenient to access the Campus facilities even at night. Being a Campus with a low student population, inter-personal interactions are actualized creating a homely, conducive learning environment.[http://www.unam.edu.na/ogongo-campus]

'''Oliva Sabuco de Nantes Barrera''' (1562–1622) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] writer in [[Holistic health|holistic medical philosophy]] in the late 16th – early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1991, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interested in the interaction between the physical and psychological phenomena; therefore she wrote a collection of medical and psychological treatises that target human nature and explain the effects of emotions on the body and soul.&lt;ref name = Waithe265&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; She analyzed theoretical claims of ancient philosophers and wrote an early theory of what is now considered [[Applied Psychology|applied psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

She was born in [[Alcaraz]], Spain in 1562 and was baptized in the Holy Trinity church on December 2 of that same year.&lt;ref name = Cannon&gt;Cannon 1916, p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was Francisca de Cozar and her father was Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; By 1580, at the age of 18, she was married to Don Acacio de Buedo.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; Although not much is known about her formal education it is evident that Oliva Sabuco was taught medicine by her father.&lt;ref&gt;Kersey 1989, p. 1143.&lt;/ref&gt; She was well acquainted with classical and contemporary philosophy and was knowledgeable about medical theory.&lt;ref name=Waithe268&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; By age 25 she already published a novel far ahead of her time.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Mind–body coexistence===
Sabuco combined ancient Greek and Christian philosophies, along with [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] views in order to explain how the mind and body interact in a [[holistic]] manner.&lt;ref name=WVZ15&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed human nature to be a single concept, where the rational soul and spiritual soul must co-occur for a human being to exist.&lt;ref name=WVZ15/&gt; A human being would be considered a corpse with no potential for living when it lacked either of the two souls.&lt;ref name=WVZ15/&gt; Sabuco agreed with [[Aristotle|Atristotle's]] vision of form and matter in relation to the body: they both believed the interaction between the mind and body was the formal organization of a whole living human being.&lt;ref name=WVZ16&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory differed in the sense that the human being could not exist until the divine soul/mind coexisted with the body/matter.&lt;ref name=WVZ16/&gt;

Her approach to the mind–body interaction mirrored that of [[Plato|Plato’s]].  The mind was in charge of moral judgments and reasons which caused the body to react in certain ways.  Therefore, the body carried out the moral judgments that were processed. Sabuco placed emphasis on self-knowledge and the capacity of the mind to exercise free will.  Self-knowledge and ethical decisions allowed hope, health, strength and a natural life span to be placed on the human body while free will directed the passions and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmony and a healthy state===
According to Sabuco, the soul was divided into three parts: the sensitive, the biological, and the intellectual soul, all which would be in a harmonic balance with one another.&lt;ref name=WVZ17&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between the four humors, hot, cold, wet, and dry must also be in harmony in order for the human organ system to be in a healthy state.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Sabuco used a temperature-humidity schema, derived from [[Hippocrates]], to evaluate illnesses and individuals’ state of health.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Although her ideas originated from Hippocrates’s [[humorism|four bodily humors]], Sabuco denied the importance of his theory and insisted the focus lie on the severity of temperature and humidity.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; For example, illnesses, disabilities and premature death were results of disharmony among the three parts of the soul or the temperature-humidity schema.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Sabuco also coined the term chilo, which was a white liquid energizing force that traveled through a complex network of anatomical channels from one organ system to another.&lt;ref name=WVZ18&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilo maintained the proper temperature and humidity within the body; nonetheless, an imbalance could lead to negative states of health.&lt;ref name=WVZ18/&gt;  The purpose of chilo was to communicate movement to the bodily organs and orient them to carry out the goal meant to be accomplished.&lt;ref name=Waithe264&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
Sabuco’s theory of moral philosophy incorporated traditional views of virtue ethics. Good and evil were intertwined in the world and could banish each other.&lt;ref name=WVZ27&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory stated how something good could be present in evil and something evil could be present in good.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; There was never such a concept as pure evil or pure good. Within her theory of human nature only two evils existed, avoidable diseases and premature aging.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; Sabuco promoted moderation and temperance to control emotions and passions; her theory originated from Plato’s concept of [[sophrosyne]], where self-understanding is used to obtain wisdom and virtue.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; However, she referenced temperance as the most important virtue that was obtained through self-knowledge. Temperance and wisdom were then labeled as the answers to evil because they sustained human life and provided peace, happiness, and content between emotions and the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===

The second part of her work described astronomical and geological events and how they support the theory of human nature. It was important to learn how the [[macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]] functions because humans were a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] within the board world.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; Understanding how the world came to be would teach humans how to live in that world.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; A person's condition, whether improving or declining was related to cosmology.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; Such topics included the moon, the magnitude of the Earth and its atmosphere, solar and lunar eclipses and the magnitude of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's life cycle would improve or decline just like a moon's cycle would be waxing or waning.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Within macrocosm, the moon was defined as the brain of the world which provided moisture and growth to its waters.&lt;ref name=Pomata49&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Microcosm, on the other hand, described the sun as the heart of the world which gave warmth and life to the world.&lt;ref name=Pomata49/&gt; The emphasis was placed on the brain, making it more significant than the heart, as the moon was more vital than the sun.&lt;ref name=Pomata49/&gt;

===World improvements: judicial, legislative, and social thoughts===

Sabuco introduced smaller systems of reformation into her idea of human nature. Sabuco advocated for the creation of legislative, judicial and social reforms in the welfare rights of the powerless, people such as peasants, workers and householders.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The powerless were the ones whose health was severely impacted the most by the misery and despair of everyday life.&lt;ref name=Pomata6&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess and greed should be avoided because they were bad for the social and individual body.&lt;ref name=Pomata6/&gt;

She argued for a legal reformation of judicial laws, doctrines of appeals and better protection under the law. She reasoned that the individuals who created the laws would be the only ones who would comprehend them.&lt;ref name=WVZ29&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the laws would not be applicable or fair to lower socioeconomic classes who did not partake in the creation of them. Laws must be clear, written in simple language and precise so proper justice could be granted to the poor.&lt;ref name=WVZ29/&gt; Sabuco also argued against juridical doctrines of appeal to authority figures of Roman law.&lt;ref name=WVZ30&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Authoritarian power was passed down through generations and individuals' verdicts had varying interpretations from previous generations of authorities who lacked knowledge about the present case.&lt;ref name=WVZ30/&gt;  As a result, she believed protection under the law was unequal for most of the public and most did not receive proper justice.&lt;ref name=WVZ30/&gt;

Legislative reformation should include protection for farmers and peasants because their labor and production was essential in the survival of others within the nation. She was a strong proponent of preventing the authority from confiscating land, livestock, and crops.&lt;ref name=WVZ31&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabuco criticized university policies and the objectives of the education system. She mentioned the lack of proper criteria for an individual regarding admissions and recommended examiners evaluate potential candidates' abilities when granting admission. She also denounced the importance of charging students tuition because students were admitted who could afford tuition but lacked the proper aptitude to succeed.&lt;ref name=WVZ31/&gt;

===Physical medicine and remedies===

Sabuco disagreed with the traditional medical theory and thought its failure to control medicine was due to people's ignorance on the  impact of emotions on physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions such as anger, sadness, love, excessive joy, hatred, shame and distrust caused imbalances in the bodily humors which squeezed the humor and humidity out of the brain where the soul was located.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The only true appropriate medicine would comfort the brain and be in accordance between the body and the soul.&lt;ref name=WVZ24&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Words and deeds that generated joy and hope and taking care of the stomach were the three pillars of health that could comfort the brain.&lt;ref name=WVZ24/&gt; If optimism, contented happiness and abdominal temperature were left unattended they could lead to sorrow, discontent and melancholy.&lt;ref name=Pomata6&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Another general remedy mentioned was the diversion of humor through bodily openings so it would not reach internal organs.&lt;ref name=Pomata6/&gt;

==Treatise==

The book, published in [[Madrid]] in 1587, was called ''Nueva Filosofia de la Naturaleza del Hombre (New Philosophy of Human Nature)''.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10&gt;Waithe 2007, p. 1, 3, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of seven separately titled treatises.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt; The first five, ''Knowledge of One’s Self'',''Composition of the World as It Is'', ''Things That Will Improve This World and Its Nations'', ''Treatments and Remedies of Proper Medicine'', and ''Proper Medicine Derived from Human Nature''' are written in the [[Castilian language]].&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;  While the last two, ''Brief Exposition on Human Nature: The Foundations of the Art of Medicine'', and ''Proper Philosophy of the Nature of Composite Things, of Humans, and of the World, Unknown to the Ancients'', are written in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;  This book, in its entirety, was dedicated to [[Philip II of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's,'' p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first treatise within Sabuco’s most famous book, ''New Philosophy of Human Nature'', introduces a discussion between three peasants, whom she identified as shepherds and who critique the views of others.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; These three shepherds continue as the main characters throughout the remaining six treatises and their discussions cover various topics of human nature. The identity of her characters represents the significance of remaining in close contact with nature and staying isolated from society so societal views will not sully the mind.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; She purposely included peasants as characters in order to demonstrate how philosophy and medicine are relevant regardless of social class.&lt;ref name=Waithe3&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Sabuco believed her theory should be relevant to simple folks and applicable to their lives.&lt;ref name=Waithe3/&gt; The  treatises emphasized the universe by describing the theory on mutual interdependence of the soul, body, and cosmos.&lt;ref name =Waithe265/&gt;
  
In the pages of her treatise she explored many ideas amongst which are the comparison of a human body to an upside down tree.&lt;ref name=G240&gt;''Gentleman's,'' p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the brain, like in the root of a tree, that all diseases begin and it is possible to cure them through various methods amongst which are words of cheerfulness, sound thought, and even to the hearing of music.&lt;ref name=G240/&gt; The process of using wise words against violent emotions such as anger, she called "Rhetorical Insinuation" because it explored the idea of being able to persuade the will through words.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn 1998, p. 875.&lt;/ref&gt; She explored how emotions have an effect on the human body and how one can control their effects by focusing on the chief organ of the body, the brain.&lt;ref name=Winters&gt;Winters 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Father Feyjoo, much of the research she did contributed to the ability of physicians following her to develop some of the first theories around nervous diseases.&lt;ref name=G240/&gt;

Going back to the idea of the brain as King, she wrote how during sleep the brain was feed all its necessary nutrients, which have been, throughout the day, collected in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Barona&gt;Barona 1993, p. 176, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the nutrients were taken to the brain and nervous fluid was created, it was allocated throughout the body by a fluid aside from red blood.&lt;ref name=Barona /&gt; Some have postulated that she was referring to a concept similar to white blood cells when she wrote this for she makes mention of a fluid white in color nourishing the body with information.&lt;ref name=Winters /&gt;

==Fame and influence==

Her work has sometimes been compared with [[Descartes]]' ''[[Passions of the Soul|The Passion of the Soul]]'', for like him she imagined the seat of the soul to be in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Keitt 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; We know that she was famous in her day because in 1604, while she was still alive, Franciscio Lopez de Uveda, a physician and poet from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], expressed that a character he was working on would out fame people like Oliva Sabuco and [[Don Quixote]], thus implying her name to be one associated with fame.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt; In addition to this, the famous French physician Charles le Pois cited Sabuco’s influence on his own views regarding diseases such as hysteria.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;

==Summary==

Without definitively solving the mind body problem, Sabuco moves philosophy a step in that direction by providing both a new chemical explanation, with white fluid as a vehicle of mind body interaction, and an explanation of the role of emotions on physical health.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;

==Later life==
Credit for her work was sometimes given to her father, Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez, because of a powerful letter written by him claiming the work as his own.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; His letter and a promissory note written by Sabuco's husband and brother were implemented a year following the publication of the book.&lt;ref name=Waithe264/&gt; The letter claimed Don Miguel Sabuco as the true author of ''New Philosophy of Human Nature'' and an explanation stating that her name was included in an attempt to honor her but she had no legal interest in the volume nor authority over it.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholarship has defended her case, claiming that she was the writer. Because of the nature of her material, she incurred the attention of the [[Spanish Inquisition|inquisitors]] and had all her books burned.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1995, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; She lived out her days in the convent of Dominican nuns in Alcaraz and took on a monastic habit.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; There, she eventually died around the year 1622.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt;

==Honours==
A crater on the [[planet Venus]] was named ''Barrera'' in her honour, see [[List of craters on Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/614?__fsk=-450930971 Barrera] Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU). Accessed March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oral sex''', sometimes referred to as '''oral intercourse''', is [[sexual activity]] involving the stimulation of the genitalia of a person by another person using the [[Human mouth|mouth]] (including the lips, tongue or teeth) or [[throat]]. [[Cunnilingus]] is oral sex performed on female genitals, while [[fellatio]] is oral sex performed on a penis.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book|author =Janell L.

Oral sex is often regarded as [[taboo]],&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice.

==Practice==
[[File:Wiki-fellatio.png|thumb|Female performing fellatio]]
Oral sex may be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]].

===Sexual variants===
[[Facesitting]] is a form of oral sex in which the receiver sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. Oral sex can also be performed by both partners at the same time in the so-called [[69 (sex position)|"sixty-nine" position]]. Spitting and/or swallowing of the ejaculatory fluids or giving a [[Pearl necklace (sexuality)|pearl necklace]] may cause different sexual stimulations. [[Autofellatio]] is a possible but rare variant; [[autocunnilingus]] may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines.

An act of [[group sex]] restricted to one woman giving oral sex to several men is referred to as a ''gangsuck'', ''blowbang'' or ''lineup'', all derivatives of the slang term ''[[gang bang]]'' for group sex. [[Bukkake (sex act)|Bukkake]] and [[gokkun]] may also involve oral sex.

===Preserving virginity===
[[File:ChinaScrollPN3 detail, left, threesome.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A late 19th century [[Beijing]] [[hand scroll]] depicting oral sex]]

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving [[virginity]], especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed ''[[technical virginity]]'' (which additionally includes [[anal sex]], [[mutual masturbation]] and other [[non-penetrative sex]] acts, but excludes [[Sexual intercourse|penile-vaginal sex]]).&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002| pages = 1920–1921 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liUcCPXcpAAC&amp;pg=PA1920|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

Oral sex alone cannot result in pregnancy and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"&gt;{{cite book | title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | pages = 286–289 | accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286|quote=Noncoital forms of sexual intimacy, which have been called outercourse, can be a viable form of birth control.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For conception to take place, [[sperm]] from the [[human penis|penis]] must enter the [[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s and fertilize the female's [[Ovum|egg]]. In humans, there is no connection between the [[gastrointestinal system]] and the [[reproductive system]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;However, this has happened in [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/teen-girl-vagina-pregnant-sperm-survival-oral-sex/story?id=9732562 bizarre circumstances] involving a stabbing.&lt;/ref&gt; and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by [[acid]]s in her [[stomach]] and [[protein]]s in the [[small intestine]]. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of [[nutrient]]s. However, there is a potential risk of pregnancy if [[semen]] comes in contact with the [[vagina]]l area in some way, such as semen in the [[ejaculate]] finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.

Oral sex is not necessarily an effective method of preventing [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), although some forms of STIs are believed to be less commonly spread in this way, and oral sex has been recommended as a form of [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name="testing"&gt;[http://www.gmhc.org/health/testing/geffen_sti.html Geffen Testing Center's HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis C Information Sheet].

Oral sex should be limited to the protected areas. A makeshift dental dam can be made out of a [[condom]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/dental-dams "How to Make a Dental Dam Using a Condom"], UCSB SexInfoOnline, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or a latex or [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile glove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.about.com/od/prevention/ht/dentaldamhowto.htm|title=How to Make Your Own Dental Dam From a Condom|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but using a real dental dam is seen as preferable; this is because real dental dams cover a larger area, avoid accidents caused by "slipping" outside the covered area, and avoid the risk that makeshift versions may be accidentally damaged or poked with the scissors during the cutting procedure. Plastic wrap may also be used as a barrier during oral sex, but there exists no conclusive scientific research regarding how effective it may or may not be at preventing disease transmission. Certain kinds of plastic wrap are manufactured to be microwaveable and are designed to have pores that open when heated, but there also exists no scientific research on what effect, if any, this has on disease transmission when used during oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/saferse1/a/plastic-wrap-oral-sex.htm|title=Plastic Wrap and Oral Sex|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people complain that the thickness of the plastic dulls sensation.

===Prevalence===
A report issued in September 2005 by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] was the basis of an article in the September 26, 2005 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. The report comes from the results of a computer-administered [[statistical survey|survey]] of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 44, and states that over half the teenagers questioned have had oral sex. While some headlines have interpreted this as evidence that oral sex among teenagers is "on the rise", this was the first comprehensive study of its kind to examine the matter.&lt;ref name="lemonick"&gt;Lemonick, Michael D., [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1106324,00.html "A Teen Twist on Sex"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', New York, September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated in 2009: "Studies indicate that oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents."&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Research also indicates that "males are more likely than females to have received oral sex, whereas equal proportions of men and women have given oral sex."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

==Health risks and other studies==

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)| year = 2008| accessdate = December 6, 2011|url =https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf}} Also see [https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Pratt| title = HIV &amp; AIDS: A Foundation for Nursing and Healthcare Practice | publisher = [[CRC Press]]|pages=306| isbn = 0340706392|year=2003| accessdate = August 21, 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=naSG-2RgRiYC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and Society, Volume 1|isbn =0761479066|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2009–2010|page=61|accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his or her genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after performing oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of [[condom]]s or [[Safe sex#Barrier protection|other effective barrier methods]] when performing or receiving oral sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and [[oral cancer]] with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people. In 2005, a research study at [[Malmö University]]'s Faculty of Odontology suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the [[cancer]] patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.

Another study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' suggests a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between oral sex and [[head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Miscarriage reduction===
Fellatio may reduce the risk of [[miscarriage]]s by inducing [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|immunological tolerance]] in the woman by exposure to the proteins in her partner's semen, a process known as [[paternal tolerance]]. While any exposure to a partner's semen appears to decrease a woman's chances for the various immunological disorders that can occur during pregnancy, immunological tolerance could be most quickly established through the oral introduction and gastrointestinal absorption of semen.&lt;ref name="pmid10706945"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koelman CA, Coumans AB, Nijman HW, Doxiadis II, Dekker GA, Claas FH |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10706945 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''| date=February 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that some of the studies potentially included the presence of confounding factors, such as the possibility that women who regularly perform fellatio and swallow semen also engage in more frequent intercourse, the researchers also noted that, either way, "the data still overwhelmingly supports the main theory" behind all their studies—that repeated exposure to semen establishes the maternal immunological tolerance necessary for a safe and successful pregnancy.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP |title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896827 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
[[File:Fellatio.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Fellatio]] in [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] ]]
{{See also|Cunnilingus|Fellatio}}

Cultural views on oral sex range from aversion to high regard.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; It, especially fellatio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html "The History of Fellatio"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524143842/http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html |date=May 24, 2006 }}, ''Salon.com'', May 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; has been considered [[taboo]], or at least discouraged, in many cultures and parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Laws of some jurisdictions regard oral sex as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative sex]] for the purposes of [[Sex and the law|sexual offenses]] with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice itself, in contrast to anal sex or [[extramarital sex]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], fellatio was considered profoundly taboo.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp105.htm |title=Irrumation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual acts were generally seen through the prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two [[Latin]] words for the act: ''irrumare'' (to penetrate orally), and ''fellare'' (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it was considered to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have [[Halitosis|foul breath]] and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"/&gt;

In contrast to historical views on fellatio, cunnilingus is revered as a spiritually fulfilling practice in Chinese [[Taoism]], which regards it as having the ability to enhance [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Paz (1969) ''Conjunctions and Disjunctions''; trans. Helen R. Lane. London: Wildwood House; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Western culture]], oral sex is widely practiced among adolescents&lt;ref name="lemonick"/&gt; and adults.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Some state that since it does not result in reproduction, it is therefore unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buschmiller|first=Rev. Robert|title=Oral Sex in Marriage|url=http://www.presentationministries.com/brochures/OralSex.asp|publisher=Presentation Ministries|accessdate=November 22, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206194539/http://www.presentationministries.com/publications/OralSex.asp|archivedate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find it less intimate because it is not a face-to-face practice,&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; or believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pina"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2804438|last=Pina-Cabral|first=Joao de|title=Tamed Violence: Genital Symbolism is Portuguese popular culture|journal=Man|year=1992|volume=28|issue=1|series=N.S|pages=101–120|jstor=2804438}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is humiliating or unclean are opinions that are, at least in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Pina"/&gt; Opposite these views, people also believe that oral sex "is one of the most intimate behaviors that a couple can engage in because it requires total trust and vulnerability."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

While commonly believed that [[lesbian sexual practices]] involve cunnilingus for all [[women who have sex with women]] (WSW), some have an aversion to cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

==Terminology and slang==
There are many words which refer to oral sex, including [[euphemism]]s and [[sexual slang]]. Like all aspects of sexuality, there exists a large number of variations on a theme, a few common ones being:

* Giving head – A common slang term for giving oral sex to either a man or woman is ''giving head'', from the term ''head job'' (in contrast to ''[[hand job]]'', manual stimulation). A play on the slang term ''head'' resulted in the slang term ''brains'', or ''brain salad surgery'', ''domes'' or ''getting domes.''
* Plate – A once common [[British English|British]] [[rhyming slang]] for ''fellate'' that arose in the gay slang language of [[Polari]] that spread in the 1960s. The term is less common today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ Polari]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181306/http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cunnilingus is also sometimes referred to as ''muff diving'', ''eating out'' or ''poon-job'', a slang term and a cunnilingus variant of ''[[blow job]]'', where ''poon'' is short for ''poontang'' or ''punani''.
* Additionally, in lesbian culture, several common slang terms used are ''carpet munching'', ''giving lip'', ''lip service'' or ''[[Tipping the Velvet|tipping the velvet]]'' (a faux-"Victorian" expression invented by novelist [[Sarah Waters]]).

Other slang terms for oral sex include ''going down on'' (male or female), ''licking out'' and ''muff diving'' (female), ''blow job'' (male), ''dome'' (male or female), ''sucking off'' (male), ''playing the skin flute'' (male recipient), ''rolling cigars'' (male recipient), ''lolly-gagging'' (gay male-on-male), ''gaining knowledge'' (male recipient) and ''bust down'' (male). Forced fellatio is often called ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | date = 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | issue= 641| bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s, in particular the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 247–250}}

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[Mathematics]] seeks to discover and explain abstract patterns or regularities of all kinds.&lt;ref name=Steen&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]]. ''The Science of Patterns''.

''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Visual patterns in nature find explanations in [[chaos theory]], fractals, logarithmic spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, [[L-system]]s form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;
[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry'', Dialectics and Humanism, vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible patterns in nature are governed by [[physical law]]s; for example, [[meander]]s can be explained using [[fluid dynamics]].

In [[biology]], [[natural selection]] can cause the development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including [[camouflage]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''On the Origin of Species''. 1859, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sexual selection]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; and different kinds of signalling, including [[mimicry]]&lt;ref name=Wickler&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickler |first=Wolfgang |authorlink=Wolfgang Wickler |date=1968 |title=Mimicry in plants and animals |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cleaning symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter&gt;Poulin, R.; Grutter, A.S.

== Types of pattern ==

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

Fractal-like patterns occur widely in nature, in phenomena as diverse as clouds, [[river|river networks]], geologic [[fault line]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[coastline]]s,&lt;ref name=Batty&gt;{{cite journal | journal=New Scientist | date=1985-04-04 | title=Fractals – Geometry Between Dimensions | author=Batty, Michael | page=31 | volume=105 |issue=1450}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[animal coloration]], [[snowflake|snow flakes]],&lt;ref name="snowflake"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aHux78oQbbkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=snowflake+fractals+book#v=onepage&amp;q=snowflake%20fractals%20book&amp;f=false | page=25 | author=Meyer, Yves | author2=Roques, Sylvie | title=Progress in wavelet analysis and applications: proceedings of the International Conference "Wavelets and Applications," Toulouse, France – June 1992 | date=1993 | publisher=Atlantica Séguier Frontières| isbn=9782863321300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crystal]]s,&lt;ref name="crystal"&gt;{{cite book| page=78 | author=Carbone, Alessandra | author2=Gromov, Mikhael | author3=Prusinkiewicz, Przemyslaw | title=Pattern formation in biology, vision and dynamics | date=2000|publisher=World Scientific | isbn=9789810237929}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[blood vessel]] branching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fractal aspects of three-dimensional vascular constructive optimization| author=Hahn, Horst K.| author2=Georg, Manfred| author3=Peitgen, Heinz-Otto | editor=Losa, Gabriele A. | editor2=Nonnenmacher, Theo F.| title=Fractals in biology and medicine | date=2005 | publisher=Springer| pages=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[actin cytoskeleton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadegh|first=Sanaz|date=2017|title=Plasma Membrane is Compartmentalized by a Self-Similar Cortical Actin Meshwork|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031|journal=Physical Review X|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031|pmc=5500227|pmid=28690919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[wind wave|ocean waves]].&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite book | pages=44–46 | title=Fractals and chaos: an illustrated course | author=Addison, Paul S. | date=1997 | publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy configurations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

Patterns can form for other reasons in the [[patterned vegetation|vegetated landscape]] of [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J. | author2=Valentin, C. | author3=Seghieri, J. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2001 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s.&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt; Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the [[Mima mounds]] of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of [[pocket gopher]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |title=‘Digital gophers’ solve Mima mound mystery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the so-called [[fairy circle]]s of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=The secret of Namibia's 'fairy circles' may be explained at last|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/18/the-secret-of-namibias-fairy-circles-may-be-explained-at-last|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute''' (QSMI) ({{lang-th|สถานเสาวภา}} ''Sathan Saovabha'') in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], is a [[institute]] that specialises in the [[husbandry]] of venomous [[snakes]], the extraction and [[research]] of [[snake venom]], and vaccines, especially [[rabies vaccine]]. It houses the '''[[snake farm]]''', a popular tourist attraction.

The origins of the institute can be traced back to 1912 when [[Vajiravudh|King Rama VI]] granted permission for a government institute to manufacture and distribute [[rabies]] vaccine at the suggestion of [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Prince Damrong]], whose daughter, [[:th:หม่อมเจ้าบันลุศิริศานต์ ดิศกุล|Princess Banlusirisarn]], died from rabies infection. It was officially opened on 26 October 1913 in the Luang Building on Bamrung Muang Road as the ''Pastura Institute'' after [[Louis Pasteur]], who discovered the first vaccine against rabies. In 1917 it was renamed the ''Pasteur Institute'' and placed under the supervision of the [[Thai Red Cross Society]]. The institute also produced vaccine against [[smallpox]]. The Travel and Immunization Clinic is now located here. If offers vaccines and pre-travel consultation. 

In the early-1920s the king offered his private property for the construction of a new home for the institute on Rama IV Road. The new buildings were officially opened on 7 December 1922, now named for the king's mother, [[Saovabha Phongsri|Queen Saovabha Phongsri]]. At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture [[antivenom]] for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by [[Savang Vadhana|Queen Savang Vadhana]], then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.

Research into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites. Normally only an [[antidote]] that is based from the same snake's venom can save the individual's life.

The snake farm houses thousands of some of the most venomous snakes in the world, such as the [[king cobra]] and all sorts of [[Viperidae|viper]]s. Visitors can see handlers interact with [[Pythonidae|python]]s, and venom extractions can be seen. There is also a museum, and lectures are given.

The QSMI and the snake farm are near [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]], on the corner of [[Henri Dunant Road]] and Rama IV Road.

== Chemical interactions ==

=== Chemical availability ===
Exudates, such as [[organic acid]]s, change the chemical structure of the rhizosphere in comparison with the bulk soil.

Exudates come in the form of chemicals released into the rhizosphere by cells in the roots and cell waste referred to as "rhizodeposition." This rhizodeposition comes in various forms of organic carbon and nitrogen that provide for the communities around plant roots and dramatically affect the chemistry surrounding the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinsinger|first=Philippe|last2=Gobran|first2=George R.|last3=Gregory|first3=Peter J.|last4=Wenzel|first4=Walter W.|date=November 2005|title=Rhizosphere geometry and heterogeneity arising from root-mediated physical and chemical processes|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=168|issue=2|pages=293–303|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01512.x|pmid=16219069|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exopolysaccharides, such as PGA, affect the ability of roots to uptake water by maintaining the stability of the rhizosphere and controlling the flow of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2000|title=Root- and microbial-derived mucilages affect soil structure and water transport|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2389.2000.00327.x|journal=European Journal of Soil Science|volume=51|issue=3|pages=435|last1=Czarnes|first1=S.|last2=Hallett|first2=P.

Although it goes beyond the rhizosphere area, it is notable that some plants secrete [[Allelopathy|allelochemicals]] from their roots which inhibit the growth of other organisms.

== Ecology of the rhizosphere ==
Rhizodeposition allows for the growth of communities of microorganisms directly surrounding and inside plant roots. This leads to complex interactions between species including mutualism, predation/parasitism, and competition.

=== Predation ===
Predation is considered to be top-down because these interactions decrease the population, but the closeness of the interactions of species directly effects the availability of resources causing the population to also be affected by bottom-up controls.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0846:TIBDPI]2.0.CO;2|year=2003|volume=84|issue=4|pages=846|title=Top-Down is Bottom-Up: Does Predation in the Rhizosphere Regulate Aboveground Dynamics?|journal=Ecology|last1=Moore|first1=John C.|last2=McCann|first2=Kevin|last3=Setälä|first3=Heikki|last4=De Ruiter|first4=Peter C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without soil fauna, microbes that directly prey upon competitors of plants and plant mutualists, interactions within the rhizosphere would be antagonistic toward the plants. Soil fauna provide the top-down component of the rhizosphere while also allowing for the bottom-up increase in nutrients from rhizodeposition and inorganic nitrogen. The complexity of these interactions have also been shown through experiments with common soil fauna, such as nematodes and protists. Predation by bacterial-feeding nematodes was shown to influence nitrogen availability and plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1942528|title=Interactions of Bacteria, Fungi, and their Nematode Grazers: Effects on Nutrient Cycling and Plant Growth|journal=Ecological Monographs|first1=Russell E.|last1=Ingham|first2=J. A.|last2=Trofymow|first3=Elaine R.|last3=Ingham|first4=David C.|last4=Coleman|date=1985|volume=55|issue=1|pages=119–140|doi=10.2307/1942528}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an increase in the populations of bacteria in which nematodes were added. Predation upon ''Pseduomonas'' by amoeba shows predators are able to upregulate toxins produced by prey without direct interaction using supernatant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Predator-Prey Chemical Warfare Determines the Expression of Biocontrol Genes by Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas fluorescens|first1=Alexandre|last1=Jousset|first2=Laurène|last2=Rochat|first3=Stefan|last3=Scheu|first4=Michael|last4=Bonkowski|first5=Christoph|last5=Keel|date=August 2010|journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol.|volume=76|issue=15|pages=5263–5268|doi=10.1128/AEM.02941-09|pmid=20525866|pmc=2916451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of predators to control the expression and production of biocontrol agents in prey without direct contact is related to the evolution of prey species to signals of high predator density and nutrient availability.

The [[food web]] in the rhizosphere can be considered as three different channels with two different sources of energy; the detritus-dependent channels are fungi and bacterial species and the root energy dependent channel consists of nematodes, symbiotic species, and some arthropods.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This food web is constantly in flux as the amount of detrius available and the rate of root sloughing changes as roots grow and age. This bacterial channel is considered to be a faster channel because of the ability of species to focus on more accessible resources in the rhizosphere and have faster regeneration times compared with the fungal channel. All three of these channels are also interrelated to the roots that form the base of the rhizosphere ecosystem and the predators, such as the nematodes and protists, that prey upon many of the same species of mircroflora.

=== Competition ===
[[Allelopathy]] and [[autotoxicity]] and negative root-root communications&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How plants communicate using the underground information superhighway|first1=Harsh Pal|last1=Bais|first2=Sang-Wook|last2=Park|first3=Tiffany L|last3=Weir|first4=Ragan M|last4=Callaway|first5=Jorge M|last5=Vivanco|date=2004|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=26–32|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2003.11.008|pmid=14729216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The competition between plants due to released exudates is dependent geometrical properties, which determine the capacity of interception of exudates from any point in relation to the plants’ roots, and physicochemical properties, which determine the capacity of each root to take up exudates in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raynaud|first=Xavier|last2=Jaillard|first2=Benoît|last3=Leadley|first3=Paul W.|date=2008|title=Plants May Alter Competition by Modifying Nutrient Bioavailability in Rhizosphere: A Modeling Approach|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=171|issue=1|pages=44–58|doi=10.1086/523951|pmid=18171150|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrical properties are the density of roots, root diameter, and distribution of the roots and physicochemical properties are exudation rate, decay rate of exudates, and the properties of the environment that affect diffusion. These properties define the rhizosphere of roots and the likelihood that plants can directly compete with neighbors.

Plants and soil microflora indirectly compete against one another by tying up limiting resources, such as carbon and nitrogen, into their biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01001-X|title=Competition for nitrogen between plants and soil microorganisms|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=12|issue=4|pages=139|year=1997|last1=Kaye|first1=Jason P.|last2=Hart|first2=Stephen C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition can occur at varying rates due to the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in detritus and the ongoing mineralization of nitrogen in the soil. Mycorrhizae and heterotrophic soil microorganisms compete for both carbon and nitrogen depending upon which is limiting at the time, which itself heavily depends on the species, scavenging abilities, and the environmental conditions affecting nitrogen input. Plants are less successful at uptake of organic nitrogen, such as amino acids, than the soil microflora that exist in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owen|first=A.G|last2=Jones|first2=D.L|title=Competition for amino acids between wheat roots and rhizosphere microorganisms and the role of amino acids in plant N acquisition|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|language=en|volume=33|issue=4–5|pages=651–657|doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00209-1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This informs other mutualistic relationships formed by plants with relation to nitrogen uptake.

Competition over other resources, such as oxygen in limited environments, are directly affected by the spatial and temporal locations of species and the rhizosphere. In methanotrophs, proximity to higher density roots and the surface are important and help to determine where they are dominant over heterotrophs in rice paddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methane Oxidation and the Competition for Oxygen in the Rice Rhizosphere|first1=Peter van|last1=Bodegom|first2=Fons|last2=Stams|first3=Liesbeth|last3=Mollema|first4=Sara|last4=Boeke|first5=Peter|last5=Leffelaar|date=August 2001|journal=Appl.

The weak connection between the various channels of energy is important in regulation in the populations of both predator and prey and the availability of resources to the biome. Strong connections between resource-consumer and consumer-consumer create coupled systems of oscillators which are then determined by the nature of the available resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Weak trophic interactions and the balance of nature|first1=Kevin|last1=McCann|first2=Alan|last2=Hastings|first3=Gary R.|last3=Huxel|date=22 October 1998|journal=Nature|volume=395|issue=6704|pages=794–798|doi=10.1038/27427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems can then be considered cyclical, quasi-periodic, or chaotic.

=== Mutualism ===
Plants [[Secretion|secrete]] many compounds through their roots to serve symbiotic functions in the rhizosphere. [[Strigolactone]]s, secreted and detected by [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi, stimulate the [[germination]] of spores and initiate changes in the mycorrhiza that allow it to colonize the root. The parasitic plant, ''[[Striga (plant)|Striga]]'' also detects the presence of strigolactones and will germinate when it detects them; they will then move into the root, feeding off the nutrients present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnaud Besserer, Virginie Puech-Pagès, Patrick Kiefer, Victoria Gomez-Roldan, Alain Jauneau, Sébastien Roy, Jean-Charles Portais, Christophe Roux, Guillaume Bécard, Nathalie Séjalon-Delmas|first=|year=2006|title=Strigolactones Stimulate Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi by Activating Mitochondria|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e226|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040226|pmid=16787107|pmc=1481526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreas Brachmann, Martin Parniske|first=|year=2006|title=The Most Widespread Symbiosis on Earth|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e239|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040239|pmid=16822096|pmc=1489982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbiotic [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] bacteria, such as ''[[Rhizobium]]'' species, detect compounds like [[flavonoids]] secreted by the roots of leguminous plants and then produce [[nod factor]]s which signal to the plant that they are present and will lead to the formation of [[root nodule]]s. In these nodules bacteria, sustained by nutrients from the plant, convert nitrogen gas to a form that can be used by the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1120260109|pmid=22493242|pages=6751–6756|title=Plant-activated bacterial receptor adenylate cyclases modulate epidermal infection in the Sinorhizobium meliloti-Medicago symbiosis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=17|year=2012|last1=Tian|first1=C.

Even though these organisms are thought to be only loosely associated with plants they inhabit, they may respond very strongly to the status of the plants. For example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere of the [[rice plant]] exhibit [[Diurnality|diurnal]] cycles that mimic plant behavior, and tend to supply more fixed nitrogen during growth stages when the plant exhibits a high demand for nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sims GK, Dunigan EP|year=1984|title=Diurnal and seasonal variations in nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction) of rice roots|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=16|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(84)90118-4|last2=Dunigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In exchange for the resources and shelter that plants and roots provide, fungi and bacteria control pathogenic microbes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fungi that perform such activities also serve close relationships with species of plants in the form of mycorrhizal fungi, which are diverse in how they relate to plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the bacteria that make the rhizosphere their home also form close relationships in order to be more competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1996|title=Cellular interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere bacteria|journal=Protoplasm|volume=193|pages=123-131|doi=10.1007/BF01276640|last1=Bianciotto|first1=V.|last2=Minerdi|first2=D.|last3=Perotto|first3=S.|last4=Bonfante|first4=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which plays into the bigger cycles of nutrients that impact the ecosystem, such as biogeochemical pathways.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Community structure ===
Bais et al. (2004) call the rhizosphere an information super highway because of the proximity of data points, which include roots and other organisms in the soil, and the methods for transferring data using exudates and communities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This description has been used to explain the complex interactions that plants, their fungal mutualists, and the bacterial species that live in the rhizosphere have entered into over the course of their evolution. Certain species like ''[[Trichoderma]]'' are interesting because of their ability to select for species in this complex web. ''Trichoderma'' is a [[Biological Control Agent|biological control agent]] because of evidence that it can reduce plant pathogens in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mechanisms Employed by Trichoderma Species in the Biological Control of Plant Diseases: The History and Evolution of Current Concepts|journal=Plant Disease|volume=87|pages=4-10|last=Howell|first=C. R.|doi=10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.1.4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants themselves also impact which bacterial species are in the rhizosphere which are selected against because of the introduction of exudates and the relationships that it maintains. The control of which species are in these small diversity hotspots can drastically affect the capacity of these spaces and future conditions for future ecologies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biological Control of Soilborne Plant Pathogens in the Rhizosphere with Bacteria|journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology|first=D.

It originated in California in 2008 and was formally adopted by the state in 2011. 

== About ==
This SoBL is a seal that can be earned by students who are learning a second language aside from their native English or who are learning [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]] and will be noted on the recipient's transcript or diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leadwithlanguages.org/language-advocacy/the-biliteracy-seal/|title=The Seal of Biliteracy|last=|first=|date=|work=Lead with Languages|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/seal-of-biliteracy-ells/|title=What the Seal of Biliteracy Can Do for English Language Learners|website=New America|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates for the SoBl can be bilingual in any two languages, which includes American Sign Language, and have proficiency in all language domains such as listening, speaking, reading and writing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sealofbiliteracy.org/faq/|title=The Seal of Biliteracy|website=The Seal of Biliteracy|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Kristin J. Davin and Amy J. Heineke have stated that the program's benefits are stronger efforts for academic success, bilingualism, and official recognition for their efforts. 

In the United States, biliteracy has not always been the method of teaching English to [[English-language learner|English Language Learners]] (ELLs). In the past ELLs learned through the Sink or Swim method of total English immersion education, not having culturally relevant testing questions, or equitable assessment in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, E., Henderson, K. and Hinojosa, R. (2014) An Overview of U.S. Bilingual Education: Historical Roots, Legal Battles and Recent Trends. Texas Education Review 2 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent behind the SoBL is that it will, “offer a promising policy solution to increase biliteracy among K–12 students, both as a means to promote the maintenance of students’ home languages and encourage native English speakers to study additional languages” and make them "attractive to future employers".&lt;ref&gt;Davin, K.

== History and eligibility ==
The SoBL was first developed in California in 2008 by Californians Together and was implemented in 2010 along with [[Velázquez Press]]. In 2011, legislation creating a California State Seal of Biliteracy was passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPA2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Seal+of+Biliteracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIxcHkg_PeAhXht1kKHSxWBmkQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Seal%20of%20Biliteracy%22&amp;f=false|title=Promoting the Educational Success of Children and Youth Learning English: Promising Futures|last=|first=|date=2017-08-25|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309455404|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been adopted by multiple states, including Colorado and New Jersey. It is only awarded to students in the public school system; students in private schools are not eligible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/el/er/ssbfaq.asp|title=State Seal of Biliteracy FAQs - Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=CA Dept of Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain this Seal students must pass a proficiency exam. In the state of California students have to pass the the California Assessment of English Performance and Progress before they may obtain this Seal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Students must also complete all ELA (English Language Arts) courses with a grade point average of 2.0 or above prior to high-school graduation in order to be eligible to obtain the Seal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The SoBL has been adopted into legislature in multiple states and the District of Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmplBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25&amp;dq=%22Seal+of+Biliteracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYpL-0hPPeAhXiwVkKHZrkBlQ4ChDoAQgpMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Seal%20of%20Biliteracy%22&amp;f=false|title=The Bilingual Advantage: Language, Literacy and the US Labor Market|last=Callahan|first=Rebecca M.|last2=Gándara|first2=Patricia C.|date=2014-10-03|publisher=[[Channel View Publications|Multilingual Matters]]|year=|isbn=9781783092444|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; however elements defined as barriers to success by students includes a lack of awareness of the Seal and the assessment exams needed to obtain the Seal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sealofbiliteracy.org/doc/seal-biliteracy-implementation-benefits-challenges.pdf|title=Seal of Biliteracy Implementation: Benefits &amp; Challenges|last=|first=|date=|website=Seal of Biliteracy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students expressed a lack of awareness and preparedness until their senior year of high-school and in turn this made them ineligible for the seal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specific schools that have implemented the SoBL include [[Norwalk High School (California)|Norwalk High School]] in California and [[Logan-Rogersville High School|Logan-Rogersville High Schoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l in Missouri.

A '''self-regulatory organization''' ('''SRO''') is an organization that exercises some degree of regulatory authority over an industry or profession. The regulatory authority could exist in place of government regulation, or applied in addition to government regulation.  The ability of an SRO to exercise regulatory authority does not necessarily derive from a grant of authority from the government.

In United States securities law, a self-regulatory organization is a defined term. The principal federal regulatory authority—the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)—was established by the Federal [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].  The SEC originally delegated authority to the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] and to the [[List of stock exchanges#United States of America|national stock exchanges]] (e.g., the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]) to enforce certain industry standards and requirements related to securities trading and brokerage. On July 26, 2007 the SEC approved a merger of the enforcement arms of the NYSE and the NASD, to form a new SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In addition, Congress created the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) as an SRO charged with adopting investor protection rules governing broker-dealers and banks that underwrite, trade and sell tax-exempt bonds, 529 college savings plans and other types of municipal securities.

The [[American Arbitration Association]] is also an SRO with official, statutory status.

Because of the prominence of the SROs in the securities industry, the term SRO is often used too narrowly to describe an organization authorized by statute or government agency to exercise control over a certain aspect of the industry.

The [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR) is an example of an SRO that fills the vacuum left by the absence of government oversight or regulation.  The NAR sets the rules for [[multiple listing service]]s and how brokers use them.  Another example is the [[American Medical Association]] which sets rules for ethics, conflicts, disciplinary action, and accreditation in medicine.

'''Special sciences''' are those sciences other than [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that are presumed to be [[reductionism|reducible]] to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[neuroscience]]—indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics—are special sciences.  The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[Jerry Fodor]], for instance, has argued for ''strong autonomy'', concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974): "Special sciences and the disunity of science as a working hypothesis", ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qazi Syed Hayatullah''' (died c. 1135 AH / 1722 AD) was a Muslim scholar of [[Fiqh]] from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]], India). He belonged to the family of [[Gardēzī Sadaat]].

==Biography==
Qazi Syed Hayatullah was a scholar of [[Fiqh]], an expert in [[sharia]] laws, from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]]). He was also a good orator and stayed at [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] for a long time, where he gained both name and fame in teaching Fiqh. At Sakras, he built a rich library after collecting large number of books. He also built his own beautiful [[Haveli]] at [[Mohallah]] Sayidwadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|publication-place = ʻAlīgaṛh |author = Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman| pages = 43–47 (Qazi Syed Hayatullah) | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3006896M/Ḥayāt-i_Karam_Ḥusain |title = Ḥayāt-i Karam Ḥusain |publication-date = 1983, revised second edition 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His ancestors Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut ibn Mir Imaduddin ibn Syed Shamsuddin) came to India during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]] (1211–1235).

Like his father [[Qazi Syed Inayatullah]], his wife also belonged to [[Pinangwan]]. He had one daughter, who was married to Mohammad Ammad of [[Pinangwan]], and two sons: Syed Mohammad Zaman and Syed Mohammad Mureed.

Syed Mohammad Zaman was affirmed [[Qazi]] after his father.
{{main|Qazi Syed Mohammad Zaman}}

Syed Mohammad Mureed had a horse business. He was not only a good horse rider but also an expert in [[Archery]]. He, most of the times, stayed in [[Ujjain]] and hence after death also buried near Ujjain at Dargah Shah Mahmood, Ghalla Mandi along with his father-in-law Mohammad Ikram and brother-in-law Abu Ishaq. Syed Mohammad Mureed with his wife Noorun Nisan had one son Mohammad Muneer and three daughters, Bibi Sahiba, Jamiatun Nisan and Sahibun Nisan. Bibi Sahiba was married to Mohammad Aziz ibn Mohammad Azim (husband of Bibi Khadija daughter of Mohammad Asadullah), while Jamiatun Nisan and Sahibun Nisan were married to Abu Turab (son of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza) and Mohammad Munawwar (son of Mohammad Adil) respectively. Jamiatun Nisan had one daughter Jamal Daulat and two sons Mian Mohammad Yar and Mohammad Hasan. Mohammad Hasan along with Ghulam Qutubuddin, was killed in a battle with [[Ahirs]] on 26 August 1797 at [[Rewari]]. In the same battle, another relative to Mohammad Hasan, Syed Hisamuddin with his colleague Ahmad Beg Khan was also killed by [[Ahirs]] and their graves are located besides the wall of Masjid located inside the fort. The son of Mohammad Hasan, Ghulam Saroor was a prominent physician who died in [[Mecca]], after performing [[Hajj]] on 11 [[Moharram]] 1294 AH. Mian Mohammad Yar (born 1176 AH / 1762 AD) was quite a religious person and was married to Wajihun Nisan (daughter of Shah Abul Ghais). The son of Mohammad Yar Mohammad Ali was married to Sahibun Nisan (daughter of Shah Mohammad Shoeb).

Mohammad Muneer was married to the daughter of Syed Aminuddin ibn Syed Nasiruddin and had one daughter Fahamun Nisan, who was married to Mohammad Rasheed (died 10 [[Rabi' al-awwal]] 1203 AH/1788 AD). Fahamun Nisan had two sons – Aulad Ali and Murad Ali. Both had good business of horses. The daughter of Murad Ali, Fahimun Nisan was married on 12 [[Shawwal]] 1246 AH / 1830 AD with Aminuddin ibn Fasihuddin. While returning from [[Hajj]] in 1852, Aminuddin died as a result of a [[storm surge]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

'''Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde''' (12 February 1873, [[Leeuwarden]] &amp;ndash; 27 April 1937 near [[Locarno]] in a plane crash) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physician]] and [[gynæcologist]] who served as  director at the Gynæcological Institute in [[Haarlem]]. His 1926 book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' (''The Perfect Marriage'') made him an instant international celebrity. The book advocated knowledge and sensuality in erotic life. In [[Germany]] ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 in spite of the fact that it was placed on the list of forbidden books, [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In Protestant and social democratic [[Sweden]], ''Det fulländade äktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s.

The English translation, ''[[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]]'' was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition, selling well over a half-million copies.

He is credited with showing in 1905 that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle.  This contributed to the improvement of [[calendar-based methods]] of birth control, and later to the creation of other [[fertility awareness]] systems.

Two double major programs with the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] exist: chemical engineering and materials science and engineering, and chemical engineering and nuclear engineering.

Popular undergraduate courses such as Chem 4A (general chemistry) and Chem 12A (organic chemistry) are taught by College of Chemistry faculty.

Graduate programs include the M.S. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering and Ph.D. in chemistry.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

==Faculty==
As of 2015, the faculty at the College includes 10 members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]], 28 members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and 33 members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. 3 members of the faculty have been awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

==Campus==
The College of Chemistry is located on the east side of the UC Berkeley campus. It includes [[Gilman Hall]], a National Historic Landmark, where plutonium was first identified in 1941. Pimentel Hall is one of the largest lecture halls on campus, and features a revolving stage to allow for setup of chemistry demos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/map/googlemap/|title=Google map - UC Berkeley|last=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the College are linked by a network of underground hallways and laboratories.

The '''University of Bordeaux''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Université de Bordeaux'') was founded in 1441 in France. In 1970, the University was split up in four separate universities. It was reestablished on 1 January 2014 from the merger of three of the new universities: [[University of Bordeaux 1|Bordeaux 1]], [[Bordeaux Segalen University|Victor Segalen University (Bordeaux 2)]], and [[Montesquieu University - Bordeaux IV|Montesquieu University (Bordeaux 4)]]. The University of Bordeaux is part of the [[Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine]].

== History ==
The original ''Université de Bordeaux'' was established by the papal bull of [[Pope Eugene IV]] on 7 June 1441 when Bordeaux was an English town. The initiative for the creation of the university is attributed to Archbishop [[Pey Berland]]. It was originally composed of four faculties: arts, medicine, law, and theology. The law faculty later split into faculties of civil law and canon law. A professorship in mathematics was founded in 1591 by Bishop [[François de Foix]], son of Gaston de Foix, [[Earl of Kendal]].

This university was disestablished in 1793, and then was re-founded on 10 July 1896.

In 1970 the university was split into three universities: Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux 2, and Bordeaux 3. In 1995, Bordeaux 4 split off from Bordeaux 1.

In 2007 the universities were grouped together as ''[[Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine|Communauté d'universités et établissements d'Aquitaine]]''

From 1 January 2014, the university of Bordeaux were reunited, except for [[Bordeaux Montaigne University|Bordeaux 3]] which chose not to take part to the merger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-bordeaux.fr/]&lt;/ref&gt;
