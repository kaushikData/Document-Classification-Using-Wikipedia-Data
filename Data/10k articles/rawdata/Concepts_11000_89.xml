      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12699">The '''2010 Hong Kong democracy protests''' reflect the growing force of the pro-democracy movement, and were sparked by events that year including electoral reforms&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the arrest of a high-profile Chinese activist, [[Liu Xiaobo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo|title=Nobel peace prize goes to Liu Xiaobo|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2010-10-08|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The democracy movements of 2010 can be seen as a precursor to the events of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|2014 Umbrella Revolution]].

== Historical context ==

=== The Basic Law ===
Hong Kong, as a former British colony, was reunified with mainland China in 1997 under the concept of “[[One country, two systems|One Country, Two Systems]]”. While originally a concept with no legal power, a committee consisting of 59 members from different backgrounds and industries joined together after the signing of [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] to create the basic laws of the new Hong Kong under China based on the ideas stipulated in the Declaration and thus gave national legitimacy to the concept. Effective July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was to be treated as fully autonomous from mainland China. This is followed in the Declaration by the promise that “[Hong Kong] will remain unchanged for 50 years”, until 2047.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basic Law and Hong Kong - The 15th Anniversary of Reunification with the Motherland|last=Wu|first=Bangguo|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democracy in Hong Kong ===
Hong Kong’s chief executive is chosen by an 800-member committee, while its legislature of 60 is half elected and half chosen by interest groups called functional constituencies, While a democratic style of government election is promised in Hong Kong’s constitution, China ruled in 2007 that Hong Kong cannot directly elect a leader until 2017 and its legislature until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1971283,00.html|title=Is Hong Kong Getting Any Closer to Real Democracy?|last=Rose|first=Adam|date=2010-03-11|work=Time|access-date=2018-01-21|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== New Year protest ===
According to figured offered by the Hong Kong police, 9000 people marched to Beijing’s representative office. Organizers claim that more than 30,000 protesters turned up to reignite the democracy movement at times when locals were preoccupied with economic issues. A diverse group of organizations joined the march but largely aligned themselves with three headline causes: 'true' [[universal suffrage]], abolition of the small-circle [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and freedom for Chinese dissident Liu Xiabo. The exception was protesters opposing the location of a Hong Kong connection to the Mainland's national high-speed rail network through a New Territories village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010-01-04|title=Hong Kong January 1 Democracy Demonstration: One March, Four Causes|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10HONGKONG10_a.html|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters carried out colorful banners such as “Democracy Now!” Some demonstrators held aloft portraits of Liu Xiaobo, demanding the release of the prominent writer and activist. Hundreds of police erected steel barricades and with minor scuffles when they tried to prevent a small number of protesters from storming the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protest/thousands-in-new-year-hong-kong-march-for-democracy-idUSTRE6000CD20100101|title=Thousands in new year Hong Kong march for democracy|last=|first=|date=2010-01-01|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New year marches are a fixture on the political calendar in Hong Kong.

=== May 2nd protest ===
More than 3000 people marched from Victoria Park to the Central Government Offices to demand full democracy in Hong Kong in the [[2010 March for universal suffrage|May 2nd Protest]]. In January 2010, the Five Constituencies Referendum triggered a [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|by-election]] when five pan-democrats stepped down. The protest happened a couple of weeks before the scheduled by-election on 16 May 2010, during which few politicians tried to turn it into a referendum on political reform that unsurprisingly failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16167654|title=Protest vote|website=The Economist|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 1st protest ===
[[Hong Kong 1 July marches|July 1st protests]] are annual protest rallies originally held by the [[Civil Human Rights Front]]. The holiday commemorates the day of handover from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[China]] in 1997 and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The July 1st march in 2010 was the first public march for democracy in Hong Kong after the unprecedented acceptance by Beijing of a limited democratic reform proposal by the Democratic Party under a document titled the '[[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012]]'. While this was seen by a step forward for Hong Kong, many were disappointed in the pan-democracy camp for going back on their word to settle for something less than pure universal suffrage. As a result, approximately 52,000 people took part in the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-467834|title=52,000 March for Suffrage in Hong Kong|website=CNN iReport|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anniversary parade was organized by opposition pro-government groups, attended by 2000 people. Several hundred democratic party members faced verbal abuse and chants such as “shame on you” and “you betrayed Hong Kong’s people” throughout the march to the Hong Kong government headquarters for selling out to Beijing.

=== League of Social Democrats and the Civic Party resignation ===
In January 10, five legislators from the [[Civic Party]] and the [[League of Social Democrats]], one from each of Hong Kong’s electoral districts resigned their seats as a part of the ‘Five Constituencies Resignation’ concept for meaningful political reform. [[Albert Chan]], [[Alan Leong]], [[Tanya Chan]], “Longhair” [[Leung Kwok-hung]], and [[Wong Yuk-man]] resigned from the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1773233/road-universal-suffrage-timeline-hong-kongs-journey-votes|title=The road to universal suffrage: A timeline of Hong Kong’s journey to votes for all|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to trigger by-elections by pitting pro-democracy candidates against pro-China ones in hopes for a de facto [[referendum]] on full democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-hong-kong-lawmakers-seek-referendum-on-democracy-2010jan26-story.html|title=Hong Kong lawmakers seek 'referendum' on democracy|last=Writer|first=MIN LEE, Associated Press|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Basic Law of Hong Kong does not provide for official referenda. Their resignations were submitted on 26 January 2010, with effect on 29 January 2010. They resigned in spite of Beijing warning them not to, Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]] claimed that the “so-called referendum” had no legal grounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/26/hong-kong-democracy-bid|title=Hong Kong MPs quit in attempt to push Beijing towards direct elections|last=Kong|first=Associated Press in Hong|date=2010-01-26|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|by-elections]] were nevertheless held on 16 May 2010. Following a boycott by the pro-government parties, the five who resigned were returned to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] by voters. The by-election was criticized as a waste of taxpayers’ money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8684996.stm|title=Hong Kong 'democracy' by-election|date=2010-05-15|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Arrest of Liu Xiaobo ===
Protesters called for the release of the Chinese activist [[Liu Xiaobo]], who was detained on 8 December 2008. He was formally arrested and sentenced to eleven years of imprisonment and two years’ deprivation of political rights on 25 December 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power” in the manifesto he co-authored, Charter 08.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-dissident/chinas-top-dissident-arrested-for-subversion-idUSTRE55N0F020090624|title=China's top dissident arrested for subversion|last=|first=|date=2009-06-24|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral reform package ===
The Central Government unveiled a package of [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|electoral reforms]], calling for 10 new seats in the legislature from 60 to 70 of which 40 will be directly elected, the first time a majority of seats will be determined by popular vote. It also called for an extra 400 people to be added to the 800-member committee that nominates and elects the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hketolondon.gov.hk/news/docs/Final_10_APR.pdf|title=Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office|last=|first=|date=2010|work=Hong Kong Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill requires a vote of 40, or a two-thirds majority threshold to pass.  Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed the bill on 25 June 2010 with 46 lawmakers, including moderates, in favor. 12 others, including members from the League of Social Democrats and all five members of the Civic Party, voted against it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/06/25/hongkong.politics/index.html|title=Hong Kong passes electoral reform - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By  Elizabeth Yuan,|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents view that the bill does not go far enough and does not set any concrete roadmap for Hong Kong’s universal suffrage, leaving uncertainty. The [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pan-democracy camp]] attacked the conservative proposals as a rehash of those already rejected in 2005, but the Hong Kong government under Donald Tsang said its proposals were “more democratic”, and could not exceed what was authorized by Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Michael|date=February 2011|title=Prospects for Democracy in Hong Kong: The 2012 Election Reforms|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40992.pdf|journal=CRS Report for Congress|volume=|pages=|via=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-democratic party was split when The Democratic Party opted to vote with the Beijing government, parting company with the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats. The Chief Executive assented on 29 June 2010, and China’s parliament ratified the decision on 28 August. It was the first time Hong Kong's legislature had passed major reforms to electoral arrangements since the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. A previous attempt in 2005 was voted down by opposition democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-democracy/hong-kong-passes-historic-reforms-amid-muted-protest-idUSTRE65O0W920100625|title=Some see sell-out as Hong Kong passes electoral reforms|last=|first=|date=2010-06-25|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Mainland reaction ===
Beijing was wary of upsurges of public discontent in Hong Kong. The Chinese government did not immediately comment after the resignation of five legislators, but it criticized the resignation plan in a statement afterwards, calling it a challenge to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-censorship/china-blocks-bbc-website-as-hong-kong-tensions-rise-idUSKCN0I505S20141016|title=China blocks BBC website as Hong Kong tensions rise|last=|first=|date=2014-10-16|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive management''' ('''AM'''), also known as '''adaptive resource management''' ('''ARM''') or '''adaptive environmental assessment and management''' ('''AEAM'''), is a structured, [[iteration|iterative]] process of robust [[decision making]] in the face of [[uncertainty]], with an aim to reducing uncertainty over time via [[system monitoring]]. In this way, decision making simultaneously meets one or more [[resource management]] objectives and, either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future management. Adaptive management is a tool which should be used not only to change a system, but also to learn about the system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management|last=Holling|first=C.S.|publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons|year=1978|isbn=9781932846072|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because adaptive management is based on a learning process, it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge in using the adaptive management approach lies in finding the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EMxPZu99B_MC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false|title=Adaptive Environmental Management: A Practitioner's Guide|last=Allan|first=Catherine|last2=Stankey|first2=George Henry|date=2009-06-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp;amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has more recently been employed in implementing [[international development]] programs.

==Objectives==
There are a number of scientific and social processes which are vital components of adaptive management, including:
* Management is linked to appropriate temporal and spatial scales
* Management retains a focus on [[statistical power]] and controls
* Use of computer models to build synthesis and an embodied ecological consensus
* Use of embodied ecological consensus to evaluate strategic alternatives
* Communication of alternatives to political arena for negotiation of a selection

The achievement of these objectives requires an open management process which seeks to include past, present and future [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. Adaptive management needs to at least maintain [[Glasnost|political openness]], but usually aims to create it. Adaptive management must therefore be a [[scientific]] and social process. It must focus on the development of new [[institutions]] and institutional strategies in balance with [[scientific hypothesis]] and experimental frameworks (resilliance.org).

Adaptive management can proceed as either passive or active adaptive management, depending on how learning takes place. Passive adaptive management values learning only insofar as it improves decision outcomes (i.e. passively), as measured by the specified utility function. In contrast, active adaptive management explicitly incorporates learning as part of the objective function, and hence, decisions which improve learning are valued over those which do not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive management of renewable resources|last=1944-|first=Walters, Carl J.|date=1986-01-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0029479704|oclc=13184654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, as new knowledge is gained, the models are updated and optimal management strategies are derived accordingly. Thus, while learning occurs in both cases, it is treated differently. Often, deriving actively adaptive policies is technically very difficult, which prevents it being more commonly applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Gemma|last2=Crammond|first2=Brad|last3=Malbon|first3=Eleanor|last4=Carey|first4=Nic|date=2015-09-18|title=Adaptive Policies for Reducing Inequalities in the Social Determinants of Health|journal=International Journal of Health Policy and Management|volume=4|issue=11|pages=763–767|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2015.170|issn=2322-5939|pmc=4629702|pmid=26673337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Key features of both passive and active adaptive management are:
*Iterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*[[Feedback]] between monitoring and decisions (learning)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference
*[[Bayesian inference]]
*Embracing [[risk]] and uncertainty as a way of building understanding

However, a number of process failures related to information feedback can prevent effective adaptive management decision making:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Elzinga, Caryl|last2=W|first2=Salzer, Daniel|last3=W|first3=Willoughby, John|date=1998-01-01|title=Measuring &amp; Monitering Plant Populations|journal=U.s. Bureau of Land Management Papers|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usblmpub/17/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[data collection]] is never completely implemented
* data are collected but not analyzed
* [[data analysis|data are analyzed]] but results are inconclusive
* data are analyzed and are interesting, but are not presented to decision makers
* data are analyzed and presented, but are not used for decision-making because of internal or external factors

==History==
The use of adaptive management techniques can be traced back to peoples from ancient civilisations. For example, the [[Yap]] people of Micronesia have been using adaptive management techniques to sustain high [[population density|population densities]] in the face of resource scarcity for thousands of years (Falanruw 1984). In using these techniques, the Yap people have altered their environment creating, for example, coastal [[mangrove]] depressions and [[seagrass]] meadows to support fishing and termite resistant wood (Stankey and Shinder 1997).

The origin of the adaptive management concept can be traced back to ideas of [[scientific management]] pioneered by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] in the early 1900s (Haber 1964). While the term "adaptive management" evolved in natural resource management workshops through decision makers, managers and scientists focussing on building simulation models to uncover key assumptions and uncertainties (Bormann ''et al.'' 1999)&lt;!-- ### This sentence is incomplete. Managagers and sci. did what? --&gt;

Two ecologists at The [[University of British Columbia]], [[C. S. Holling|C.S. Holling]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and C.J Walters&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; further developed the adaptive management approach as they distinguished between passive and active adaptive management practice. [[Kai Lee]], notable Princeton physicist, expanded upon the approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s while pursuing a post-doctorate degree at UC [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. The approach was further developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], while C.S. Holling was director of the Institute. In 1992, Hilbourne described three learning models for federal land managers, around which adaptive management approaches could be developed, these are reactive, passive and active.

Adaptive management has probably been most frequently applied in Yap, [[Australia]] and [[North America]], initially applied in [[fishery]] management, but received more broad application in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most successful applications of adaptive management has been in the area of waterfowl harvest management in North America, most notably for the [[mallard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=James D.|last2=Johnson|first2=Fred A.|last3=Williams|first3=Byron K.|last4=Boomer|first4=G. Scott|date=2015-06-01|title=On formally integrating science and policy: walking the walk|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=539–543|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12406|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptive management in a conservation project and program context can trace its roots back to at least the early 1990s, with the establishment of the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/index.html Biodiversity Support Program]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989.  BSP was a [http://www.usaid.gov/ USAID]-funded consortium of WWF&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/ WWF]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nature Conservancy (TNC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnc.org/ The Nature Conservancy]&lt;/ref&gt; and World Resources Institute (WRI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/ World Resources Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Analysis and Adaptive Management Program sought to understand the conditions under which certain conservation strategies were most effective and to identify lessons learned across conservation projects.  When BSP ended in 2001, TNC and Foundations of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosonline.org/ Foundations of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS, a non-profit which grew out of BSP) continued to actively work in promoting adaptive management for conservation projects and programs.  The approaches used included Conservation by Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/cbdgateway/ Conservation by Design]&lt;/ref&gt; (TNC) and Measures of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/M/bo3559851.html Measures of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS).

In 2004, the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/ Conservation Measures Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; – which includes several former BSP members – developed a common set of standards and guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management/ | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; for applying adaptive management to conservation projects and programs.

==Use in environmental practices==
Applying adaptive management in a conservation project or program involves the integration of project/program design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn. The three components of adaptive management in environmental practice are:

*''Testing assumptions'' is about systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is not, however, a random trial-and-error process.  Rather, it involves using knowledge about the specific site to pick the best known strategy, laying out the assumptions behind how that strategy will work, and then collecting monitoring data to determine if the assumptions hold true.
*''Adaptation'' involves changing assumptions and interventions to respond to new or different information obtained through monitoring and project experience.
*''Learning'' is about explicitly documenting a team's planning and implementation processes and its successes and failures for internal learning as well as learning across the conservation community.  This learning enables conservation practitioners to design and manage projects better and avoid some of the perils others have encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stankey|first=George H.|last2=Clark|first2=Roger N.|last3=Bormann|first3=Bernard T.|last4=Stankey|first4=George H.|last5=Clark|first5=Roger N.|last6=Bormann|first6=Bernard T.|title=Adaptive management of natural resources: theory, concepts, and management institutions.|url=https://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20657/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about a managed system is only useful in cases where management decisions are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rout|first=Tracy M.|last2=Hauser|first2=Cindy E.|last3=Possingham|first3=Hugh P.|date=2009-03-01|title=Optimal adaptive management for the translocation of a threatened species|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=515–526|doi=10.1890/07-1989.1|issn=1939-5582|pmid=19323207|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:181588/UQ181588_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to environmental projects and programs==
[[Image:CMP Cycle - 2008-02-20.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: CMP Adaptive Management Cycle]]

''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management ''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation'']&lt;/ref&gt; lays out five main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1).  The ''Open Standards'' represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community.  Since the release of the initial ''Open Standards'' (updated in 2007 and 2013), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these ''Open Standards'' to their work.  In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards.

Some recent write-ups of adaptive management in conservation include:  wildlife protection (SWAP, 2008), forests ecosystem protection (CMER, 2010), coastal protection and restoration (LACPR, 2009), natural resource management (water, land and soil), species conservation especially, fish conservation from [[overfishing]] (FOS, 2007) and [[climate change]] (DFG, 2010). In addition, some other examples follow:
 
*In 2006–2007, FOS worked with The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to develop an evaluation system help NFWF gauge impact across the various coral reef habitat and species conservation projects;
*In 2007, FOS worked with the Ocean Conservancy (OC) to evaluate the effectiveness of this Scorecard in helping to end overfishing in domestic fisheries.
*Between 1999–2004, FOS worked for WWF's Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) Program to ensure that Asian elephants and rhinos thrive in secure habitats within their historical range and in harmony with people.
*The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is developing and implementing adaptation strategies to help protect, restore and manage fish and wildlife, with the understanding that some level of climate change will occur and that it will have profound effects on ecosystems in the United States.
*The Adaptive Management program was created by CMR to provide science-based recommendations and technical information to assist the Forest Practices Board. In April 2010, the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Annual Science Conference was held in Washington.
*In 2009, The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Technical Report has been developed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) according to adaptive management process.
*Since 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service has been managing its marine protected areas using adaptive management in an ongoing process of learning through the  Science for Active Management (SAM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sam4wio.weebly.com Science for Active Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Program.

==In international development==

The concept of adaptive management is not restricted to natural resources or ecosystem management, as similar concepts have been applied to [[international development]] programming.&lt;ref&gt;"2 Adaptive Management Theories, Frameworks, and Practices." National Research Council. 2004. Adaptive Management for Water Resources Project Planning.  Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rondinell, D. A. (1993) Development Projects as Policy Experiments: an adaptive approach to development administration, 2nd ed, Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt; This has often been a recognition to the "wicked" nature of many development challenges and the limits of traditional planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, M. and Rittel, H. (1973), "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning", Policy Sciences, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramalingam, B., Laric, M. and Primrose, J.

(2008) "Wicked Problems: The Implications for Public Management", 12th Annual Conference International Research Society for Public Management, Vol. Panel on Public Management in Practice, 26–28 March 2008, Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal changes facing international development organizations is the need to be more flexible, adaptable and focused on learning.&lt;ref&gt;S.

One recent example of the use of adaptive management by international development donors is the planned Global Learning for Adaptive Management (GLAM) programme to support adaptive management in [[Department for International Development]] and [[USAID]]. The program is establishing a centre for learning about adaptive management to support the utilization and accessibility of adaptive management.&lt;ref&gt;Funds for NGOs.

Collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) is a concept related to the operationalizing of adaptive management in international development that describes a specific way of designing, implementing, adapting and evaluating programs.&lt;ref&gt;Altschuld, J.

#collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
#learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking the time to reflect on implementation, and
#adapting strategically based on applied learning. CLA practices have tangible benefits; for instance, a recent study recently found that companies "which apply more data-driven and adaptive leadership practices perform better" when examined against those which focus less on those practices.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, P., Tse, M., Khan, Z. and Rao-Nicholson, R.

==Use in other practices as a tool for sustainability==
Adaptive management as a systematic process for improving environmental management policies and practices is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking [[sustainability]] solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive management as a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions.  The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies.
Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework to ensure that the organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, &amp; Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (Verine, 2008). This "learning to manage by managing to learn" (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy.

Sustainable community development requires recognition of the relationship between environment, economics and social instruments within the community. An adaptive management approach to creating sustainable community policy and practice also emphasizes the connection and confluence of those elements. Looking into the cultural mechanisms which contribute to a community value system often highlights the  parallel to adaptive management practices, "with [an] emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability" (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000). Often this is the result of indigenous knowledge and historical decisions of societies deeply rooted in ecological practices (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000).  By applying an adaptive management approach to community development the resulting systems can develop built in sustainable practice as  explained by the Environmental Advisory Council (2002), "active adaptive management views policy as a set of experiments designed to reveal processes that build or sustain resilience. It requires, and facilitates, a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options" (p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

In an ever-changing world, adaptive management appeals to many practices seeking sustainable solutions by offering a framework for decision making that proposes to support a sustainable future which, "conserves and nurtures the diversity—of species, of human opportunity, of learning institutions and of economic options"(The Environmental Advisory Council, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

== Effectiveness ==
It is difficult to test the effectiveness of adaptive management in comparison to other management approaches. One challenge is that once a system is managed using one approach it is difficult to determine how another approach would have performed in exactly the same situation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553–1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|pmid=27755756|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study tested the effectiveness of formal passive adaptive management in comparison to human intuition by having natural resource management students make decisions about how to harvest a hypothetical fish population in an online computer game. The students on average performed poorly in comparison to the computer programs implementing passive adaptive management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/sometimes-even-bad-models-make-better-decisions-than-people-4956bade3990#.cnenr5clc|title=Sometimes, Even Bad Models Make Better Decisions Than People|last=Standard|first=Pacific|date=2016-03-11|newspaper=Pacific Standard|access-date=2016-12-22}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">The '''Architecture Design and Assessment System''' (ADAS) was a set of software programs offered by the [[Research Triangle Institute]] from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Frank, D.L. Franke, and W.F. Ingogly, "An Architecture Design and Assessment System,"VLSI Design, Vol. 6, No. 8, Aug. 1985, pp. 30-50&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[petri net]]-like graph model of a system was graphically created. The hierarchical graphs were simulated to determine resource utilization and throughput.  Functional simulation of the model could be realized by attaching [[C (programming language)]] or [[Ada (programming language)]] code to the nodes.   This enabled dynamic resource assignment, timing, and priority.

==Simulation Model==

An ADAS model consisted of nodes connected by directed arcs.

For abstract simulation a node represents a [[process (systems engineering)]] in the system that you are modeling.  The readiness for execution or firing of this process requires that: its inputs are satisfied, space is available for its outputs, and its shared resource/hardware is available.  During execution the node consumes its inputs, uses the resource for the prescribed duration, then produces its outputs.

The inputs and outputs of a process are represented by discrete tokens.   These tokens flow along the arcs in the graph.   If the maximum arc size is greater than one, then an arc would represent a buffer between system processes.

To refine the model of the system, a subgraph could be placed below the node to refine the behavior of that process.

Physical and behavioral properties were attached to nodes and arcs in the form of attributes.  The attribute definition language allowed the computation of attributes from ancestor attributes and global values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">An '''automated efficiency model (AEM)''' is a [[mathematical model]] that estimates a real estate property’s efficiency by using details specific to the property which are available publicly and/or housing characteristics which are aggregated over a given area such as a zip code. AEMs have some similarities to an [[automated valuation model]] (AVM) in terms of concept, advantages and disadvantages.

AEMs calculate specific efficiencies such as location, water, energy or solar efficiency. The Council of Multiple Listing Services defines an AEM as, “any algorithm or scoring model that estimates the [efficiency] of a home without an on-site inspection. They are similar to Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), but are more reliant on public data such as square footage...and estimated energy usage.&lt;ref name="CMLS Green Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

Most AEMs calculate a property’s selected efficiency by analyzing available public information and may also apply proprietary data or formulas, and allow for a user such as a home owner to make additional inputs.  Housing characteristics such as age of the home or square footage may be obtained by data providers such as those on this [[list of online real estate databases]] or a similar offerings. Estimates of energy usage may be available from published sources such as through the Residential Energy Consumption Survey by the [[Energy Information Administration]].

== Examples of use ==
By design, the AEM score output is provided as a preliminary comparison tool so the score of one property may be compared to other homes, against an average score for the area, etc. Primary users may vary from buyers and sellers to real estate agents and appraisers as they complete relevant comparisons.  For example, REColorado, the multiple listing service covering the Denver metro area, presents a UtilityScore widget on homes for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McPherson|first1=Marian|title=UtilityScore comes to REcolorado.com|url=http://www.inman.com/2016/09/19/utilityscore-comes-to-recolorado/|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=Inman News|date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zillow publishes a Sun Number score on the home fact sheet so website visitors can compare the solar energy potential of prospective properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Number Partnership with Zillow Brings Solar Potential Scores to Millions of Americans|url=https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-sun-number-partnership-zillow-brings-solar|website=EERE Success Story|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trulia has published a report using automated estimates from UtilityScore to present water, natural gas and electric rates into a single price per square foot by zip code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Kelli|title=Before you buy that home, avoid utility bill shock|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/26/before-you-buy-that-home-avoid-utility-bill-shock.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=CNBC|date=26 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond usage for consumer preliminary comparisons, usage of AEMs varies by industry.  AEMs may also be used by solar installers, home improvement contractors, efficiency inspectors, and mortgage lenders.

In the [[photovoltaics]] industry, installers use Sun Number to reduce the soft costs associated with motivating consumers to invest in solar systems and in recording property specifications to create quotes. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] has found that Sun Number eliminates 7–10 days from the quotation process when solar suitability is determined digitally and eliminates the need for an onsite inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herman|first1=David|title=New Blueprint for Rooftop Solar Analysis|url=http://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SB_SEPT_OCT_2013.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=Solar Builder Magazine|date=September–October 2013|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEMs have been used in the mortgage industry to support a niche loan product called a [[Location Efficient Mortgage]] (LEM). During underwriting, an AEM such as the H+T Affordability Index is used to calculate the location efficient value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birdsell|first1=T.|last2=Dewar|first2=J.|last3=Sommers|first3=K.|last4=Zeidman|first4=M.|title=An Overview of Two Land Use Planning Tools Location Efficient Mortgages and Inclusionary Zoning|url=http://courses.washington.edu/udp501/501%20papers/Assign4_LEM+IZ.doc|website=Washington University|publisher=Washington University|accessdate=28 February 2017|archiveurl=http://dtpr.lib.athabascau.ca/action/download.php?filename=mais/700/suzannezemanProject.pdf|pages=2|format=Thesis|date=2012|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to National Mortgage Professional Magazine AEMs may one day be incorporated into loan underwriting as well, “Since utilities are as big or bigger part of home expenses than even real estate taxes, we may see [estimated utility usage] begin to be factored into underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Councilman|first1=J.|title=News from NAMP: October 20, 2016. Utility Bills May Be Coming to the Internet|url=http://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/blog/news-namb-october-2016-0|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=National Mortgage Professional Magazine|date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Methodology ==
AEMs generate a score for a specific property based on both publicly available housing characteristics about the subject property as well as mathematical modeling. AEMs are technology-driven scores without an onsite inspection or human assessment. For more accurate information unique to a specific property an onsite inspection such as an [[energy audit]] is required.

Detailed information on the data accessed to calculate an AEM, the modeling formulas and algorithms are generally not published.  A summary of general information is listed in the table below:

== Advantages ==
As shown in the section above, AEMs tend to rely on public information rather than information which is private to the resident such as actual utility bills. Utility bills can vary based on the occupancy and [[personal property]] within a structure.  The public information used in AEMs is relatively static as it is focused on details of the structure, location and/or mechanical systems and therefore tends to reflect the [[real property]] transferred during a real estate transaction.

According to the Council of Multiple Listing Services advantages are, “AEMs provide consumers with a quick comparison of all properties across a specified market. Since most focus on the attached systems and structure, they are only meant to reflect the efficiency of the real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Disadvantages ==
According to the Council of Multiple Listing Services advantages are, “AEMs are dependent on data used, the assumptions made, and the model methodology. Since models and methodologies differ and no on-site inspections are performed, accuracy may vary among scoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Cognitive psychology ==
In [[cognitive psychology]], a '''basic category''' is a category at a particular level of the category inclusion hierarchy (i.e., a particular level of generality) that is preferred by humans in  learning and memory tasks.  The term is associated with the work of psychologist [[Eleanor Rosch]], who demonstrated basic category preferences in a number of classic experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/4610/9778_083247.pdf|title=Principles of Categorization|last=Rosch|first=Elizabeth|date=1978|website=Unifr.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Gold''''' is a 2006 documentary film that follows the efforts of an Ethiopian coffee-union manager as he travels the world to obtain a better price for his workers' [[coffee bean]]s. The film was directed and produced by Marc James Francis and Nick Francis from [[Speakit Films]], and co-produced by Christopher Hird. It premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |archivedate=22 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film focuses on the coffee growers of the [[Oromia Region]] of southern and western [[Ethiopia]], the birthplace of coffee. It follows [[Tadesse Meskela]], the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]], as he visits coffee-growing regions in [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]] and Oromia (including the Kilenso Mokonisa Cooperative in the [[Bule Hora]] [[woreda]] in the [[Borena Zone]] of the Oromia Region), as well as a coffee processing center, a coffee auction house, and his union's headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. He also travels to England and the United States in an effort to promote Ethiopian coffee by eliminating the numerous middlemen. There is also a scene where coffee farmers pray to God for a higher price, which was filmed at the Negele Gorbitu Cooperative, located near [[Irgachefe]] in the [[Gelana Abaya|Abaya]] woreda of the Borena Zone. The Ethiopian coffee farmers speak about their lives, with one explaining that he is cutting down his coffee plants and planting ''[[khat]]'' (a plant containing [[cathinone]], an [[amphetamine]]-like stimulant) instead, due to the low price he is getting for coffee because of the explosion in the number of coffee farmers across the globe, and the comparatively higher price he can get for ''khat''.

The film also includes footage of the [[New York Board of Trade]], a [[commodity markets|commodity-trading]] floor in New York City, where the "C" international benchmark price of coffee is set each business day based on supply and demand, and explores the effects that these international prices (which by 2006 were at an all-time low) have on Ethiopian coffee growers. Other footage was shot at the first [[Starbucks]] and the [[World Barista Championship]] at the 2005 [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] conference in Seattle; and at a café and the [[Illy]] coffee company in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. These scenes stand in stark contrast to the footage of the impoverished conditions faced by the Ethiopian coffee farmers and their families.

==Production==
In July 2003, Nick Francis  and Marc James Francis travelled to Ethiopia and started making the film. The meeting with Tadesse Meskela, the manager of Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union, was a decisive moment in the production of the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Notes|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/production-notes|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiring passion and determination of Tadesse, along with his continuous efforts to improve the lives of the farmers he represents, made Nick Francis and Marc James Francis decide much further in the production process to centre the film narrative around Tadesse's journey, his character functioning as a guide into the coffee world. The Ethiopian footage was filmed on two occasions (in 2003 and 2005), for six weeks each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portafilter.net/2006/11/podcast-56-black-gold-movie.html |title=Podcast 56 - Black Gold The Movie |publisher=portafilter.net |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first shoot in Ethiopia, the crew flew to Cancun to document the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]], where pivotal decisions that affect Africa's economy and development were being made in setting the trade rules and where the struggle for fairer international trade rules was played out. Unprecedented, that year developing countries refused to be forced into signing agreements that were against their interests, and the WTO talks completely collapsed. After the team's return to the UK, they spent the following months developing a rough cut of ''Black Gold''. During these months, the direction of the film took shape, along with the rest of the necessary shoots meant to develop the thrust of the narrative. In 2005, the team returned to Ethiopia for further shoots.

Although [[Starbucks]], [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], and [[Nestlé]]—the world's largest sellers of coffee—are mentioned in the film, all five companies declined invitations to be interviewed for the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes" /&gt; By the end of 2005, the final cut of ''Black Gold'' was done and officially premiered during the 2006‘s edition of Sundance Film Festival.

==Music==
[[Andreas Kapsalis]], whom Marc James Francis and Nick Francis met during the Sundance Documentary Composers Lab, wrote the final soundtrack. In doing so, he used in part Mathew Coldrick's Ethiopian instrumental samples, recorded from Ethiopia. Joe Henson, Kunja Chatterton, and Mathew Herbert also contributed to the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soundtrack|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/soundtrack|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
In the first few weeks after the premiere, the film helped to generate donations approximately up to $25,000. The dilapidated school featured in the film was built.

Tadesse Meskela, the main character in ''Black Gold'', was able to increase the market price for his cooperative union's coffee. Tadesse Meskela was invited to 10 Downing Street, where he took his message directly to [[Tony Blair]].

After seeing the film, the UN have invited Tadesse to New York to do a presentation about his co-operatives at the 46th Session of the [[Commission for Social Development]].

''Black Gold'' was screened at the [[World Bank]] and [[European Union]], as part of debates about trade policy and development. The Ethiopian ambassadors based at Berlin, Washington, D.C., and London attended screenings.

Since the first showing of ''Black Gold'' during Sundance, Starbucks sent people to screenings of the film in what has been called by one journalist "going on a charm offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carnevale|first=Rob|title=Black Gold - Marc and Nick Francis interview|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/black-gold-marc-and-nick-francis-interview|publisher=indielondon.co.uk|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seager|first=Ashley|title=Starbucks stirred by fair trade film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/29/development.filmnews|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the film became more and more popular, Starbucks flew Tadesse and four other African coffee producers to their Seattle headquarters for a weekend conference, which was seen by many as a PR stunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian coffee farmer Tadesse Meskela Gudeta tastes Indonesian coffee Thursday at Starbucks' African Coffee Celebration|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/photo/Ethiopian-coffee-farmer-Tadesse-Meskela-Gudeta-904004.php|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siel|title=Black Gold: A Coffee Film That Has Starbucks Scared|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/black-gold-a-coffee-film-that-has-starbucks-scared.html|publisher=treehugger.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, just before the film premiered at the London Film Festival in October 2006, a memo received by Starbucks staff from the headquarters leaked to the ''Black Gold forum''.

[[File:Brawling, 喧嘩, PA160113aaa.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[yakuza]]'s fight by festival of Japan]]

'''Brawling''' (probably connected with German language ''brüllen'', to roar, shout), in law, was the offence of quarrelling, or creating a disturbance in a [[church (building)|church]] or churchyard. Brawling was covered in [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastic courts]] until 1860. It has rarely been prosecuted since then.

==History==
During the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in England religious controversy too often became converted into actual disturbance, and the ritual lawlessness of the [[Wikt:parochial|parochial]] [[clergy]] very frequently provoked popular violence. To repress these disturbances the [[Brawling Act 1551]] was passed in 1551, by which it was enacted: "that if any person shall, by words only, quarrel, chide or brawl in any church or churchyard, it shall be lawful for the ordinary of the place where the same shall be done and proved by two lawful witnesses, to suspend any person so offending, if he be a layman, from the entrance of the church, and if he be a clerk, from the ministration of his office, for so long as the said ordinary shall think meet, according to the fault."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brawling |volume=4 |page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Act of 1553 added the punishment of imprisonment until the party should repent. The Brawling Act 1551 was partly repealed in 1828 and wholly repealed as regards laymen by the [[Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860]]. Under that Act, which applies to [[Ireland]] as well as to England, persons guilty of riotous, violent or indecent behaviour, in churches and chapels of the Church of England or Ireland, or in any chapel of any religious denomination, or in England in any place of religious worship duly certified, or in churchyards or burial-grounds, were liable on conviction before two justices to a penalty of not more than £5, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two months. This enactment applied to clergy as well as to laity, and a clergyman of the Church of England convicted under it could also be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Act 1892]] (''Girt v. Fillingham'', 1901, L.R. Prob. 176).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

When Mr [[John Kensit|J. Kensit]] during an ordination service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] "objected" to one of the candidates for ordination, on grounds which did not constitute an impediment or notable crime within the meaning of the ordination service, he was held to have unlawfully disturbed the [[bishop]] of [[London]] in the conduct of the service, and to be liable to conviction under the Act of 1860 (''Kensit'' v. ''Dean and Chapter of St Paul's'', 1905, L.R. 2 K.B. 249). The public worship of [[Protestant]] Dissenters, [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Jews]] in England had before 1860 been protected by a series of statutes beginning with the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] of 1689, and ending with the [[Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855]]. These enactments, though not repealed, were for practical purposes superseded by the summary remedy given by the Act of 1860. In Scotland disturbance of public worship is punishable as a [[breach of the peace]] (''Dougall'' v. ''Dykes'', 1861, 4 Irvine 101).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the British Empire===
In British possessions abroad, interference with religious worship was usually dealt with by legislation, and not as a common-law offence. In [[India]] it was an offence voluntarily to cause disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (Penal Code, s. 296). Under the [[Queensland Criminal Code]] of 1899 (s. 207) penalties were imposed on persons who wilfully and without lawful justification or excuse (the proof of which lies on them) disquiet or disturb any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, or assault any forces lawfully officiating at such meeting, or any of the persons there assembled.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the United States===
In the United States disturbance of religious worship is treated as an offence under the [[common law]], which is in many states supplemented by legislation (see Bishop, ''Amer. Crim. Law,'' 8th ed. 1892, vol. i. s. 542, vol. ii. ss. 303-305; California Penal Code, s. 302; ''Revised Laws of Massachusetts'', 1902, chap. 212, s. 30.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

(Dissenting correction to the above)

==Modern case==
In 1998, [[Peter Tatchell]] of [[OutRage!]] was prosecuted for interrupting the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s Easter sermon with a short gay rights speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924202506/http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 legislation (which transferred jurisdiction away from the ecclesiastic courts) was used to try him; his defense focused on the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. He was convicted and fined £18.60 (referring to the 1860 legislation) plus court costs.

'''Charles Martin''' (August 31, 1959 – January 26, 2005) was a [[Professional sports|professional]] [[American football]] player, who is best known for his career with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and in particular for causing a season-ending injury to [[Chicago Bears]] [[Starting lineup|starting]] [[quarterback]] [[Jim McMahon]] on November 23, 1986. Martin also played for the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the [[USFL]], the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], and the [[Houston Oilers]] and [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[NFL]].

== Early career ==
Martin attended [[Cherokee High School (Georgia)|Cherokee High School]] in [[Canton, Georgia]] and was nicknamed "Too Mean" for his tendency to pile on ball carriers after the whistle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-01/sports/0502010334_1_charles-martin-bears-division-ii-all-american|title=To Bears fans, Charles Martin will always be recalled for the body slam that ended Jim McMahon's season in 1986.

== Professional career ==

=== Birmingham Stallions ===
Martin began his pro football career with the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the [[USFL]] in 1983, but was cut after his first season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Edmonton Eskimos ===
Martin was signed by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in early 1984 but was cut before he could make it through a season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Green Bay Packers ===
Martin immediately jumped into a starting role once he was signed by the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/1985-chicago-bears/1985-bears-coverage-usfl-demise-hurts-bears/|title=1985 Bears Coverage: USFL demise hurts Bears|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed with the Packers after he was not selected in the Supplemental Draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9o2_k8zu4QC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=charles+martin+usfl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JQPQFA7bgQ&amp;sig=1QjiBG2L7KcV9-r9XbTy84VJ1w4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih2fKUqZnYAhUnzoMKHTx0A2wQ6AEIbDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20martin%20usfl&amp;f=false|title=Packers by the Numbers: Jersey Numbers and the Players who Wore Them|last=Maxymuk|first=John|date=2003|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|isbn=9781879483903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== 1986 McMahon incident ====
During pre-game warm-ups, Martin displayed a white hand-towel with a list of five Bears offensive players' numbers: 9 for [[Jim McMahon]], 34 for [[Walter Payton]], 83 for [[Willie Gault]], 63 for [[Jay Hilgenberg]] and 29 for [[Dennis Gentry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/thirty-years-ago-bears-packers-featured-the-dirtiest-hit-in-nfl-history-102016|title=Thirty years ago, Bears-Packers featured the dirtiest hit in NFL history|date=2016-10-20|work=FOX Sports|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin wore the towel during the game.

Replays showed that Martin hit McMahon at least two seconds after the pass was thrown, well after McMahon was out of the play. McMahon landed full force on his previously injured shoulder,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a situation exacerbated by [[Soldier Field]]'s artificial turf surface of the time—and was knocked out for the rest of the season.  Martin was ejected from the game by referee [[Jerry Markbreit]] and suspended for two games.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/26/sports/martin-of-packers-suspended.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | title=Martin Of Packers Suspended | date=November 26, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markbreit later said that Martin complained about the ejection until the threat of letting Bears players come after him was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4675356/the-infamous-hit-from-the-refs-perspective|title=The infamous hit from the ref's perspective|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, the Packers defensive coordinator defended Martin, saying "We tell people that if we intercept a pass, go get anybody near you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 Things Packers Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die|last=Reischel|first=Rob|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60078-398-2|location=Chicago|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, and would remain the longest suspension for an on-field incident until [[Albert Haynesworth]] of the [[Tennessee Titans]] was suspended five games for stomping on the head of [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Andre Gurode]] in [[2006 NFL season|2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577|title=Haynesworth penalty comes in: Five games|date=2006-10-02|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin played for the Packers from [[1984 NFL season|1984]]–[[1987 NFL season|1987]]. He was cut early in the 1987 season after being implicated in a Green Bay bar fight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Hans Memling - Allegory with a Virgin - WGA14896.jpg|thumb|right|[[Allegory]] of chastity by [[Hans Memling]]]]

'''Chastity''' is one of the [[seven virtues|seven virtues]] and it is defined as refraining from deviant [[Human sexual activity|sexual conduct]]. Chastity is usually defined within the [[morality|moral]] standards and guidelines of a culture, civilization or [[religion]]. The term is closely associated (and can be used interchangeably) with [[sexual abstinence]], especially in the context of [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chastity |title=Chastity &amp;#124; Define Chastity at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chastity |title=Chastity &amp;#124; Define Chastity at Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The words "chaste" and "chastity" stem from the [[Latin]] adjective ''castus'' ("pure"). The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century. At that time, they meant slightly different things. "Chaste" meant "virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse" (referring to [[extramarital sex]]),&lt;ref name=etymonlineChaste&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaste|title=chaste - Origin and meaning of chaste by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=podDictEtym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podictionary.com/?p=605|title=podictionary - for word lovers - daily stories, trivia &amp; dictionary etymology|author=|date=|website=podictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while "chastity" meant "virginity".&lt;ref name="podDictEtym" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=chastity|title=chastity - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the late 16th century did the two words come to have the same basic meaning as a related adjective and noun.&lt;ref name="etymonlineChaste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="podDictEtym" /&gt;

==In Abrahamic religions ==
For many Muslims and Christians, acts of sexual nature are [[fornication|restricted to marriage]]. For unmarried persons, chastity is identified with [[sexual abstinence]]. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]], and [[prostitution]], are considered [[sin]]ful.

===Christianity===
{{Redirect|Vow of chastity|vows of Catholic Religious|Evangelical counsels|vows of chastity in other Christian Churches|Religious vows}}

In many [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions, chastity is synonymous with sexual purity. Chastity means not having any sexual relations before marriage. It also means fidelity to husband or wife during marriage. In [[Catholicism|Catholic]] morality, chastity is placed opposite the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of [[lust]], and is classified as one of [[seven virtues]]. The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous. Reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[marriage]], the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship that excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. After marriage, a third form of chastity, often called "vidual chastity", is expected of a woman while she is in mourning for her late husband. For example, Anglican Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]] defined 5 rules in ''Holy Living'' (1650), including abstaining from marrying "so long as she is with child by her former husband" and "within the year of mourning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Holy Living |chapter = Chapter II, Section III, Of Chastity | author = [[Jeremy Taylor]] | year = 1650 | url = http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/taylor/holyliving/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular ethical system may not prescribe each of these. For example, Roman Catholics view sex within marriage as chaste, but prohibit the use of artificial contraception as an offense against chastity, seeing contraception as unnatural, contrary to God's will and design of human sexuality. Many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities allow for artificial contraception, seeing the restriction of family size by artificial contraception as possibly not contrary to God's will. A stricter view is held by the [[Shakers]], who prohibit marriage (and [[sexual intercourse]] under any circumstances) as a violation of chastity. The [[Catholic Church]] has set up various rules regarding [[clerical celibacy]], while most Protestant communities allow clergy to marry.

Celibacy is required of [[Christian monasticism|monastic]]s—monks, nuns and friars—even in a rare system of [[double cloister]]s, in which husbands could enter the (men's) monastery while their wives entered a (women's) sister monastery. Required celibacy among the clergy is a relatively recent practice: it became Church policy at the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139. It was not uniformly enforced among the clergy until 200 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'Reformation', Penguin Books, 2003, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Catholic priests are permitted to marry, provided they do so before ordination and outside monastic life.

''Vows of chastity'' can also be taken by laypersons, either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic [[Beguines and Beghards]] in the past) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to [[contemplation]]), or both. Some protestant religious communities, such as the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], take vows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-order/our-vows|title=Our Vows|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of chastity as part of the church membership process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voluntary aspect has led it to being included among the main [[counsels of perfection]].

Chastity is a central and pivotal concept in Roman Catholic [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]. Chastity's importance in traditional Roman Catholic teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=I. "Male and Female He Created Them . . ." |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P84.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2332}} It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Catholic life because it involves an ''apprenticeship in self-mastery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=II. The Vocation to Chastity |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P85.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2339}} By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS, not evangelical church), chastity is very important, quoting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Physical intimacy between husband and wife is a beautiful and sacred part of God's plan for His children. It is an expression of love within marriage and allows husband and wife to participate in the creation of life. God has commanded that this sacred power be expressed only between a man and a woman who are legally married. The law of chastity applies to both men and women. It includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one's spouse after marriage.

"The law of chastity requires that sexual relations be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.

"In addition to reserving sexual intimacy for marriage, we obey the law of chastity by controlling our thoughts, words, and actions. Jesus Christ taught,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:27–28)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/chastity/what-is-the-law-of-chastity?lang=eng|title=What Is the Law of Chastity?|author=|date=|website=lds.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LDS teaching also includes that sexual expression within marriage is an important dimension of spousal bonding apart from, but not necessarily avoiding its procreative result.

=== Islam ===
Chastity is mandatory in Islam. Sex outside legitimacy is prohibited, for both men and women whether married or unmarried.

The most famous personal example of chastity in the Quran is Virgin Mary (Mariam) :

"And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds." (21 :91)

'''"'''And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah ."He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"'''"''' (19:17-20)

Extramarital sex is forbidden and the Quran says:

"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (17:32)

"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." (25:68-70)

The injunctions and forbiddings in Islam apply equally to men and women. The legal punishment for adultery is equal for men and women.  Social hypocrisy in many societies over history had led to a double standard when considering sin committed by men versus sin committed by women. Society tended to be more lenient and permissive towards men forgiving men for sins not forgivable when women do them. At the root of the contemporary wave of free sex for both sexes was apparently to establish equality and remove discrimination between man and woman. Instead of calling for equal cleanliness the call was for equal dirt. Not so in Islam. and in a list of commendable deeds the Quran says:

"Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward." (33:35)

Because the sex desire is usually attained before a man is financially capable of marriage, the love to God and mindfulness of Him should be sufficient motive for chastity:

"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful." (24:33) The prophet's prescription to the youth was:

Those of you who own the means should marry for this should keep their eyes uncraving and their chastity secure. Those who don't, may practise fasting for it curbs desire. " (Ibn Massoud)

Chastity is an attitude and a way of life. In Islam it is both a personal and a social value. A Muslim society should not condone relations entailing or conducive to sexual license. Social patterns and practices bent on flaring up the sexual desire are frowned upon by Islam be the means permissive ideologies, pruritic art or neglect of moral upbringing.  Personal freedoms should never be taught as the freedom to challenge God's injunctions or trespass over the limits He drew.

===Bahá'í Faith===
Chastity is highly prized in the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Similar to other Abrahamic religions, [[Bahá'í teachings]] call for the restriction of sexual activity to that between a wife and husband in [[Bahá'í marriage]], and discourage members from using pornography or engaging in sexually explicit recreational activities. The concept of chastity is extended to include avoidance of alcohol and mind-altering drugs, profanity, and gaudy or immoderate attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compilation of Compilations (Volume 1)|last=Research Department|first=Universal House of Justice|publisher=Baha'i Publications Australia|year=1991|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=|chapter=A Chaste and Holy Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Eastern religions ==

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]]'s view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of [[Ashrama (stage)]] or the stages of life. The first of these stages, known as ''[[Brahmacharya]],'' roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy and chastity are considered the appropriate behavior for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[student]]s during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder ([[Grihastha]]). [[Sanyasa|Sanyasis]] and Hindu monks or [[Sadhu]]s are also celibate as part of their [[asceticism|ascetic]] discipline.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], premarital or extra-marital sex is strictly forbidden. However, it is encouraged to marry and live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation (as opposed to sannyasa or living as a monk, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India). A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.

=== Jainism ===
Celibacy is a must for all [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks and nuns]]. Chastity (Bhramacharya) is one of the five major vows of [[Jainism]]. The general Jain code of [[ethics]] requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity.

===Buddhism===
The teachings of [[Buddhism]] include the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], comprising a division called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|right action]]. Under the [[Five Precepts]] ethical code, [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā]] lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while [[Bhikkhu]] and [[Bhikkhuni]] monastics should practice strict chastity.

=== Daoism ===
The [[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]]  of the [[Daoist]] religion include No Sexual Misconduct, which is interpreted as prohibiting extramarital sex for lay practitioners and marriage or sexual intercourse for monks and nuns.

'''''Chokmâh''''' ({{lang|he|[[:wikt:חכמה|חָכְמָה]]}} ,חכמה [[ISO 259]] {{transl|he|ḥoḵma}} or ''khok-maw''') is the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word rendered as "[[wisdom]]" in English Bible versions ([[LXX]] {{lang|grc|σοφία}} ''[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'', [[Vulgate]] ''{{lang|la|sapientia}}'').&lt;ref name=Strong&gt;''[[Strong's Concordance]]'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2451&amp;t=KJV H2451]:
"from H2449 [חָכַם ''chakam'' "wise"]; wisdom (in a good sense):—skilful, wisdom, wisely, wit."
"The KJV translates Strong's H2451 in the following manner: wisdom (145x), wisely (2x), skilful man (1x), wits (1x)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word occurs 149 times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;
The Talmud ([[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 31a) describes knowledge of the Talmudic order of [[Kodshim]] as a high level of wisdom, ''chokhmah''.

It is [[cognate]] with the Arabic word for "wisdom", ''[[ḥikma]]'' {{lang|ar|حكمة}} ([[Semitic root]] {{lang|sem|ḥ-k-m}}). 
Adjectival {{transl|he|[[hakham|ḥaḵam]]}} "wise" is used as a honorific, as in ''[[Talmid Chacham]]'' (lit. "student of a sage") for a  [[Torah study|Torah scholar]], or ''[[hakham Bashi]]'' for a [[chief rabbi]].

In the [[Kabbalah]], ''Chokhmah'' is the uppermost of the [[sephirot]] of the right line (''kav yamin'', the "Pillar of Mercy") in the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. 
It is to the bottom right of [[Keter (Kabbalah)|Keter]], with [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] across from it. Under it are the ''sephirot'' of [[Chesed (Kabbalah)|Chesed]] and [[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]]. It commonly has four paths going to Keter, Binah, [[Tiphereth (Kabbalah)|Tifereth]], and Chesed. (Some kabbalists{{Who|date=July 2010}} attribute a path between Chokhmah and [[Gevurah (Kabbalah)|Gevurah]].)

==Hebrew Bible==
{{see|Sophia (wisdom)}}
Proverbs personifies Divine Wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation ({{bibleverse||Prov|8:22–31|KJV}} cf. 3:19; {{bibleverse||Wisdom|8:4-6|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Sir|1:4,9|KJV}}). Wisdom dwelt with God ({{bibleverse||Prov|8:22–31|KJV}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Sir|24:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Wisdom|9:9-10|KJV}}) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings ({{bibleverse||Job|28:12–13, 20–1, 23–27|KJV}}). It was God who "found" wisdom ({{bibleverse||Bar|3:29-37|KJV}}) and gave her to [[Israelites|Israel]]: "He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men." ({{bibleverse||Bar|3:36-37|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Sir|24:1-12|KJV}}). As a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20–33; 8:1–9:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). 
Wisdom 7:22b-8:1 is a famous passage describing Divine Wisdom, including the passage:
"For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets." ({{bibleverse||Wisdom|7:25-27|KJV}}). 
[[Solomon]], as the archetypal wise person, fell in love with Wisdom: "I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty." ({{bibleverse||Wisdom|8:2|KJV}}).&lt;ref&gt;For a summary account of wisdom in the Hebrew Bible cf. R.E. Murphy, "Wisdom in the Old Testament", ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' (1992), vi. 920–931.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kabbalah==
{{More footnotes|date=July 2010}}
According to the Bahir: "The second (utterance) is [[wisdom]], as is written: 'Y-H-W-H acquired me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old' (Prov 8:22). And there is no 'beginning' but wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Green. ''A Guide to the Zohar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, "Wisdom comes from nothingness".&lt;ref&gt;Job. 28:12&lt;/ref&gt; This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of God associated with Chokhmah is [[Yah (Yahweh)|Yah]].

Chokhmah  appears in the configuration of the ''sefirot'' at the top of the right axis, and corresponds in the ''tzelem Elokim'' ("the Divine image") to the right eye, or right hemisphere of the brain.

In its fully articulated form, Chokhmah  possesses two ''partzufim'' ("faces" or "features"): the higher of these is referred to as ''Abba Ila'ah'' ("the higher father"), whereas the lower is referred to as Yisrael Saba ("Israel, the Elder"). These two ''partzufim'' are referred to jointly as ''Abba'' ("father").

Chokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness. The ''partzuf'' of ''Abba Ila'ah'' is associated with the power to spontaneously extract such insight from the superconscious realm, whereas the ''partzuf'' of ''Yisrael Saba'' is associated with the power to subsequently direct it into consciousness.

The "wisdom" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. These seeds of truth can then be conveyed to the companion power of Binah for the sake of intellectual analysis and development.

Chokhmah is the primary ("beginning") force in the creative process, [[Creativity]], as it is said: "You have made them all with Chokhmah." (Psalms 104:24) The first word of the [[Torah]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ''Breishit'' means "In the beginning (God created the heavens and the earth)", is translated (Targum Yonatan) as "With Chokhmah (God created…)."

Chokhmah is also called Fear, 'because it has no measure of boundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it'.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; The book of Job states 'Behold the fear of God is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding' (Job 28:28).

In the array of sefirot in three columns (''gimel kavim''), Chokmah is situated at the top of the right column, and corresponds to the right hemisphere of the [[brain]]. There are several aspects of Chokhmah:

The word Chokhmah itself may be broken into two words -- ''koach'' ("potential") and ''ma'' ("what is"). Thus, Chokhmah means "the potential of what is", or, "the potential to be." This aspect of Chokhmah describes the state of Chokhmah in relation to the sefira of Keter. As Chokhmah emanates from Keter, the first dawning of the "Infinite Light", it "appears" in an obscure and undefined state that is a virtual non-being. Thus the verse states, "and Chokhmah emerges from nothingness" (Job 28:12, see Zohar II, 121a, Zohar III, 290a, commentaries). The light of the [[Ein Sof (Kabbalah)|Ein Sof]] becomes unified in the world of ''[[Atziluth]]'' through clothing itself first in the sefira of Chokhmah. In the soul, Chokhmah is associated with the power of intuitive insight.

In the Zohar Chokhmah is the primordial point which shines forth from the will of God and thus, is the starting point of Creation. All things are still undifferentiated at this point and only become intelligible at Binah.

&lt;!--

The word Chokhmah  is read in the [[Zohar]] (Numbers 220b) as ''koach mah'', "the power of selflessness", or, alternatively, as ''cheich mah'', "the palate of selflessness."

"The power of selflessness" implies not only the attribute of selflessness itself, but the great creative power that selflessness entails.

"The palate of selflessness" is the soul's ability to "taste" Divinity by virtue of one's state of selflessness, as is said (Psalms 34:8): "Taste and see that God is good." In general, the sense of sight relates to Chokhmah  (the lightning-flash referred to above). From this verse we learn that there is an inner, spiritual sense of taste in Chokhmah  that precedes and arouses the sense of sight.

In Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]]'s commentary on the [[Bahir]] he says "Wisdom (Chokhmah) is therefore the first thing that the mind can grasp, and is therefore called a "beginning." and according to the [[Hasidic Judaism]] site Inner.org, Chokhmah refers to "the first power of conscious intellect within Creation."

==Qualities derived from Chokhmah==

===Ethical Behaviour===
Chokhmah has 2 faces, one facing keter above, and the other overseeing the over sefirot. Therefore, to emulate this Sefira, one aspect should be in communion with his Creator in order to increase his wisdom, and the other should be to teach others the wisdom that the Holy One has endowed him.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Modern occultism==
According to the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the name of God associated with Chokmah is [[Jehovah]], the [[archangel]] that presides over it is [[Raziel]], the order of [[angel]]s that reside in it are the [[Ophanim]] (the wheels), the Heaven of [[Assiah]] associated with it is called Mazloth, implying the fulfillment of destiny, and the mundane chakra associated with it is the [[Zodiac]].

In [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[Liber 777]]'', Chokhma is represented as The Four twos of the [[Tarot]], Illuminating, [[Thoth]], [[Vishnu]], [[Philosophy of happiness|Joy]], [[Odin]], [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], [[Athena]], [[God]] the Father, [[Man]], [[Amaranth]], [[Lingam]], [[Hashish]], [[Phosphorus]], [[Musk]], and [[yin and yang|Yang]] (not a complete list).

The term '''conditioned emotional response''' ''(CER)'' can refer to a specific learned behavior or a procedure commonly used in classical or Pavlovian conditioning research. It may also be called "conditioned suppression" or "conditioned fear response (CFR)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour [4th Canadian ed.]|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, On. Canada|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an "emotional response" that results from [[classical conditioning]], usually from the association of a relatively neutral stimulus with a painful or fear-inducing unconditional stimulus. As a result, the formerly neutral stimulus elicits fear. For example, if seeing a dog (a neutral stimulus) is paired with the pain of being bitten by the dog (unconditioned stimulus), seeing a dog may become a conditioned stimulus that elicits fear (conditioned response).

In 1920 [[John B. Watson]] and Rosalie Rayner demonstrated such fear conditioning in the [[Little Albert experiment]]. They started with a 9-month boy called “Albert”, who was unemotional but was made to cry by the loud noise (unconditioned stimulus) of a hammer striking a steel bar.  Albert initially showed no fear of a white rat (neutral stimulus), but after the sight of the rat had been accompanied five times by the loud noise, he cried and tried to escape the rat, showing that the rat had become a conditioned stimulus for fear. Although the Watson and Rayner work with Little Albert clearly falls under the broad umbrella of "conditioned fear" they did not use the term CER and thought they were applying more general conditioning principles to human behavior.

In 1941 [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[William Kaye Estes]] were the first to use the term "CER" and demonstrated the phenomenon with rats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5vx3vhstNoC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;lpg=PA367&amp;dq=conditioned+emotional+response+skinner+1941&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a-92gvoE9N&amp;sig=mZuPyMNoi97pmwpGq_yVVstEGw4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EeN5UayFBY-ArQHkmYDoBA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=conditioned%20emotional%20response%20skinner%201941&amp;f=false Principles of Learning and Behavior by Michael P. Domjan]&lt;/ref&gt;
They trained food-deprived rats to lever-press (operant conditioning) for food pellets, maintained on a variable interval (VI) schedule of reinforcement. Periodically, a tone was presented, for a brief amount of time, which co-terminated with electric shock to the metal floor (classical delay conditioning). The rats, upon receipt of the first shock, displayed the expected unconditional responses to the shock (e.g., jumping, squealing, urinating, etc.), however with subsequent presentations of the tone-shock trials, those responses habituated somewhat. The largest change in behavior occurred during the time the tone was presented. That is, lever-pressing during the tone reduced to near zero levels. Given that the tone-shock pairings were likely sufficient to produce classical conditioning, Estes and Skinner hypothesized that the tone elicited fear that interfered or interrupted ongoing operant behavior. In a sense, the now CS (tone) "paralyzed in fear" the rat. Note that the suppression of lever-pressing was robust, even though the operant, lever-press - food contingency was not altered at all. This experiment is critical in experimental psychology for it demonstrated that the interaction of classical and operant conditioning contingency could be powerful in altering behavior. This work sparked a number of experiments on this interaction, resulting in important experimental and theoretical contributions on autoshaping, negative automaintenance, and potentiated feeding, to name a few.

More importantly, the CER procedure solved a serious experimental problem in classical conditioning. In Pavlov's original demonstration of classical conditioning, he used a backward conditioning arrangement as the control condition. Briefly, in that procedure, the dogs experienced the same number of US presentations (food) and the same number of CS presentations (metronome ticking) as the experimental groups, but the timing of the CS and US presentations were reversed. The US preceded the CS, rather than the other way around. In the backward conditioning control procedure popular with Pavlov, his dogs did not salivate to the presentation of the CS, in contrast to those that received forward conditioning. However, the dogs did learn something - the presentation of the metronome predicted the absence of the food. This phenomenon we now call "conditioned inhibition." However, since Pavlov was studying conditioned excitation, by measuring drops of saliva, he could not experimentally measure the inhibition of salivation. There was a floor effect as the dogs could not salivate below 0 drops of saliva. Thus, the lack of salivation by Pavlov's dogs led him to conclude that no conditioning resulted, however, he could not measure conditioning. The CER procedure obviates this problem because conditioning is typically measured with a "suppression ratio", the ratio of responding during the CS period relative to a period of equal length but without the CS (usually immediately prior to the presentation of the CS). A measure of 0.5 indicates no conditioning, while measures that deviate from 0.5 reflect effective conditioning, relatively (0 is indicative of asymptotic conditioning). CER can, therefore, measure both conditioned excitation and conditioned inhibition.

The [[amygdala]], located in the temporal lobe, is a key brain region involved in the conditioned fear response and contributes to the autonomic, hormonal, and behavioral factors associated with that response. According to studies by Coover, Murison, &amp; Jellestad and Davis and LeDoux in 1992, when a dog's amygdala is damaged, it does not show fear, and, when tamed by human beings, the dog's stress hormone levels in the blood are lower than they are in a normal dog. Similarly, humans become less likely to report feelings of fear after their amygdala has been damaged due to injury or stroke.

The most common measure of the CFR is the [[Measures of conditioned emotional response|suppression ratio]].

'''Countersignaling''' or '''countersignalling''' is the behavior where agents with the highest level of a given property invest less into proving it than individuals with a medium level of the same property. This concept is primarily useful for analyzing human behavior and thus relevant to economics, sociology and psychology.

==Signals and signaling theory==
Many of the things that people and animals want to know about each other, such as toughness, cooperativeness or fertility, are not directly observable. Instead, observable indicators of these unobservable properties must be used to communicate them to others. These are signals. Signaling theory deals with predicting the level of effort that individuals, the signalers, should invest to communicate their properties to other individuals, the receivers, and how these receivers interpret their signals.

Two conditions have to be fulfilled before signaling theory should be applied. First, there has to be informational asymmetry between the signaler and receiver (I know more about my own level of toughness than you do). Second, the potential for divergence or conflict of interest between the signaler and receiver. Without either of these two conditions, there is no need for signals as the problem is merely one of communication. Once these conditions are fulfilled, signals have to be used by individuals to prove to the other person their underlying hidden property.

Much research is concerned with understanding what signals signalers should send to convince a receiver that they have a certain property, and what signals a receiver should be convinced by. One way of doing this is by putting money on the table just to prove that you can; someone without the property would not be able to do the same. For example, in biology [[peacock]]s expend energy on elaborate plumage that increase their risk of dying. By doing this they demonstrate their genetic fitness, as genetically less fit males can only grow small plumage, while genetically better individuals can grow larger ones. (In [[biology]], this is known as the [[handicap principle]].)

'''Countersignaling''' by contrast, is showing off by not showing off, or by playing humble. For instance, the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' are eager to flaunt their wealth, and often surround themselves with expensive luxury items. Those with old money are more understated, preferring not to waste money on such frivolities.&lt;ref name= "Rand"&gt;Nick Feltovich, Rick Harbaugh and Ted To, [http://kelley.iu.edu/riharbau/cs-randfinal.pdf "Too cool for school? Signalling and Countersignalling"], ''RAND Journal of Economics'', Vol. '''33''', Winter 2002, 630-649&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Conceptually"&gt;Conceptually.org, [https://conceptually.org/concepts/signalling-and-countersignalling/ "What are signalling and countersignalling?"], Date accessed: October 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different models that deal with this behavior and explain how rational individuals – those interested only in maximising certain utility – would find countersignaling beneficial.

One of these is by Feltovich, Harbaugh and To.&lt;ref name= "Rand"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Signal failure? The economics of understatement. ''The Economist'' May 2003. Covering the same Feltlvich/Harbaugh/To paper.&lt;/ref&gt; They developed a formal model in which receivers of signals judge the senders of signals based not only on what can be inferred from the signal sent, but also on additional information, which is assumed to be helpful but not perfect. For example, senders might be of low, medium, or high quality, and the additional information might be adequate for distinguishing low from high but not necessarily from distinguishing medium from low or high. Under certain circumstances, medium-quality senders will have an incentive to signal (to ensure that they can be distinguished from low-quality ones), but high-quality senders may not—they are not likely to be mistaken for low-quality senders in any case, and signaling behavior may mark them as medium.

'''Damnation''' (from Latin ''[[:wikt:damnatio|damnatio]]'') is the concept of [[Divine judgment|divine punishment]] and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth. In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian religious]] tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of [[Maat]] as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would be devoured by [[Ammit]]. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade through a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in [[Gehenna]] or [[heaven]] for their [[sin]] {{bibleref2c|Mark|3:29}}. A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in [[Hell]], or living in a state wherein they are divorced from [[Heaven]] and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In traditional Abrahamic [[demonology]], the [[Devil]] rules Hell, where he and his [[demons]] punish the damned.

Following the religious meaning, the words ''damn'' and ''goddamn'' are a common form of religious [[profanity]], in modern times often [[Semantic change|semantically weakened]] to the status of mere [[interjection]]s.

==Etymology==
[[Classical Latin]] ''damnum'' means "damage, cost, expense; penalty, fine", ultimately from a [[PIE]] root ''*dap-''. The verb ''damnare'' in [[Roman law]] acquired a legal meaning of "to pronounce judgement upon".

The word entered [[Middle English]] usage from Old French in the early 14th century.
The secular meaning survives in English "to condemn" (in a court of law), or "damning criticism". The noun ''damnation'' itself is mostly reserved for the religious sense in Modern English, while ''condemnation'' remains common in secular usage.

During the 18th century and until about 1930, the use of ''damn'' as an expletive was considered a severe profanity and was mostly avoided in print. The expression "not worth a damn" was recorded in 1802.&lt;ref name="Wood 1802"&gt;{{cite book |title= The History Of The Administration Of John Adams, Late President Of The United States |author= Wood, J. |date= 1802 |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofadminis00wood |page= 187 |lccn= 07013451 |oclc= 21065740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''damn'' as an adjective, short for ''damned'', was recorded in 1775. ''Damn Yankee'' (a Southern US term for "Northerner") dates back to 1812.

==Christianity==
{{further|Hell|Sin|Last Judgement|Christian eschatology|Universal reconciliation}}
In most forms of [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] belief, damnation to [[Christian views on hell|hell]] is what humanity deserves for its sins. [[Catholic]] and many [[Protestant]] denominations hold that human sin is the product of the [[fall of man]] of Adam and Eve in the [[book of Genesis]]. In some Christian denominations, only the sins that the [[Ten Commandments]] describe cause damnation, but others apply more strict terms. The reasons for being damned have varied widely through the centuries, with little consistency between different forms of Christianity (i.e., Catholic or Protestant). "Sins" ranging from murder to dancing have been said to lead to damnation.
Christian denominations have differing views on [[soteriology]], but a mainstream view is that believers can only escape damnation by salvation from [[Jesus]] Christ.

One conception is of suffering and denial of entrance to [[Heaven]], often described in the [[book of Revelation]] as burning in a [[Lake of Fire]]. Another conception, derived from the scripture about ''[[Gehenna]]'' is simply that people will be discarded (burned), as being unworthy of preservation by God.

In Eastern Christian traditions ([[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]), as well as some Western traditions, it is seen as a state of opposition to the love of God, a state into which all humans are born but against which [[Jesus Christ]] is the [[mediation|Mediator]] and Redeemer. Eastern traditions have established their views on Paradise and Gehenna from theologians like [[Isaac of Nineveh]] and [[Basil of Caesarea]] and the Fathers of the Church. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition theologians can describe God by presenting [[Apophatic theology|negative]] descriptions of what God is not, and describe Gehenna in similar ways.

==Hinduism==
In Hindusim, one of the three main acharyas, Acharya Madhva or Madhvacharya differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of [[eternal damnation]]. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, ''[[mukti-yogyas]]'', qualifies for liberation, another, the ''[[nitya-samsarins]]'', subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, ''[[tamo-yogyas]]'', who are condemned to eternal [[hell]] (''andhatamasa''). No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths.

==As profanity==
"Damn" is nowadays a mildly profane word in English, although "God damn" (or "Goddamn") may be considered blasphemous by religious people, who regard it as a violation of the commandment against [[taking God's name in vain]]. "Dang" (mainly US) or "darn" are common [[euphemism]]s, specifically [[minced oath]]s, for "damn".  The profanity of "damn" and its derivatives (e.g. "damned", "damnation") is effectively limited to cases where the word is not used in its literal meaning, e.g., "The damned dog won't stop barking!" (but the line of [[Arthur Miller]]'s character John Proctor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Arthur|title=The Crucible (play)|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; to his servant, "God damns all liars" uses the word in its literal sense and has not been seen as objectionable).  Use of the word or its derivatives in their figurative forms may impact on the ratings of movies and television programmes.

In [[Indian English]], there is an incorrect etymology connecting "I don't give a damn" with the [[Dam (Indian coin)|dam]], a 16th-century copper coin. [[Salman Rushdie]], in a 1985 essay on the dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms '[[Hobson-Jobson]]', ends with this:
:"'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a small copper coin weighing one [[tolah]], eight [[masha]]s and seven [[surkh]]s, being the fortieth part of a [[rupee]].' Or, to put it more concisely, a [[Dam (Indian coin)|dam]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Rushdie]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fApCKZT91kC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=frankly+my+dear+don't+give+small+copper+coin+weighing+tolah+eight+mashas+seven+surkhs+being+fortieth+part+rupee+put+more+concisely+dam Hobson-Jobson] essay, in the book ''Travelers' Tales India'' by James O'Reilly and Larry Habegger&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, there are designated places for conducting Dharna, and a permission is required for it. Often, those practicing dharna break the permission leading to clashes with law enforcement.

Dharna generally refers to fixing one's mind on an object.  It refers to whole-heartedly pledging toward an outcome or to inculcating a directed attitude. Dharna is consciously and diligently holding a point of view with the intent of achieving a goal.

The word originates from the Sanskrit word ''dharnam''.

In Pakistan, the term was first used in 1958 by [[Abdul Qayyum Khan]] against the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Firoz Khan Noon|Feroze Khan]]'s [[Feroze Khan administration|administration]] to remove his [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Iskander Mirza]] but its effective usage was made by [[Naeem Siddiqui]] proposed the to use dharna politics for obtaining objectives and latter on Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Jammat e Islami organised dharna in Pakistan in 1993, Imran Khan, Dr.Tahir ul Qadri and other political and religious leaders are now attempting to use this strategy for their purposes.

'''Evidence of absence''' is [[evidence]] of any kind that suggests something is missing or that it does not exist.

Per the traditional [[aphorism]], "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," positive evidence of this kind is distinct from a lack of evidence or ignorance&lt;ref name="Turvey2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=B.E. |last=Turvey |year=2008 |title=Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780123741004 |lccn=2008274380 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oge7LFaN5xYC&amp;pg=PA267 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; of that which should have been found already, had it existed.&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Martin |year=2007 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |series=Cambridge Companions to Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521842709 |lccn=2006005949 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |quote=[Advocates] of the presumption of atheism... insist that it is precisely the absence of evidence for theism that justifies their claim that God does not exist. The problem with such a position is captured neatly by the aphorism, beloved of forensic scientists, that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." The absence of evidence is evidence of absence only in case in which, were the postulated entity to exist, we should expect to have more evidence of its existence than we do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard [[Irving Copi]] writes:{{quote |In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence. |Copi |''Introduction to Logic'' (1953), p. 95}}

==Overview==
The [[Argument from ignorance#Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence|difference]] between evidence that something is absent (e.g., an observation that suggests there were no dragons here today) and a simple absence of evidence (e.g., no careful research has been done) can be nuanced. Indeed, scientists will often debate whether an experiment's result should be considered evidence of absence, or if it remains absence of evidence. The debate is whether the experiment would have detected the phenomenon of interest if it was there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vision and Visual Perception The Conscious Base of Seeing|last=Schreuder |first= Duco A.|year=2014 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[argument from ignorance]] for "absence of evidence" isn't necessarily fallacious, for example, that a potentially life saving new drug poses no long term health risk unless proved otherwise. On the other hand, were such an argument to rely imprudently on the ''lack'' of research to promote its conclusion, it would be considered an [[informal fallacy]] whereas the former can be a persuasive way to shift the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in an argument or [[debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Nonfallacious arguments from ignorance |publisher=American Philosophical Quarterly |year=1992 |pages=381–387 |url=http://dougwalton.ca/papers%20in%20pdf/92nonfallacious.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Sagan]] criticized such "impatience with ambiguity" with cosmologist [[Martin Rees]]' maxim, "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altman|first1=Douglas G|last2=Bland|first2=J Martin|title=Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence|journal=British Medical Journal|date=1995|volume=311|issue=19 August|page=485|pmid=7647644|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/311/7003/485.long|accessdate=19 December 2016|pmc=2550545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink= Carl Sagan |year= 1997 |edition=1st |page=213 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-345-40946-9 |oclc=32855551 |quote=Appeal to ignorance—the claim that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa (e.g., ''There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore UFOs exist—and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.''

[[File:Attic-roof-DE-0a.jpg|thumb|200px|An [[Proof by exhaustion|exhaustive inspection]] of the attic for vermin can provide evidence of absence, but any sign of mice will always suffice to the contrary.]]
In carefully designed [[science|scientific]] experiments, even [[null result]]s can be evidence of absence. For instance, a hypothesis may be [[falsifiability|falsified]] if a vital predicted observation is not found [[empiricism|empirically]]. (At this point, the underlying [[hypothesis]] may be rejected or revised and sometimes, additional [[ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc explanations]] may even be warranted.) Whether the [[scientific community]] will accept a null result as evidence of absence depends on many factors, including the [[statistical power|detection power]] of the applied methods, the [[confidence interval|confidence]] of the inference, as well as confirmation bias within the community.

===Proof and evidence===
{{main|problem of induction}}

The [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic, [[Sextus Empiricus]], questioned the [[apodicticity]] of [[inductive reasoning]] because a [[universal rule]] cannot be established from an incomplete set of [[particular]] instances: "When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite".&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' trans. [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]] (Loeb edition) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Until about the middle of the previous century induction was treated as a quite specific method of inference: inference of a [[universal affirmative]] proposition (All swans are white) from its instances (a is a white swan, b is a white swan, etc.) The method had also a probabilistic form, in which the conclusion stated a probabilistic connection between the properties in question... The Oxford English Dictionary defines “induction”, in the sense relevant here, as follows: "[The] process of inferring a general law or principle from the observation of particular instances..."

[Much] of what contemporary [[epistemology]], logic, and the philosophy of science count as induction infers neither from observation nor from particulars and does not lead to general laws or principles. [Induction] was understood to be what we now know as ''[[enumerative induction]] or universal inference''; inference from particular instances:
:''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are all ''F''s that are also ''G''... [to a general law or principle] All ''F''s are ''G''.

A weaker form of enumerative induction, singular predictive inference, leads not to a generalization but to a singular prediction:
:1. ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are all ''F''s that are also ''G''.
:2. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also ''F''... [therefore]
:3. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also ''G''.

Singular predictive inference also has a more general probabilistic form:
:1. The proportion ''p'' of observed ''F''s have also been ''G''s.
:2. ''a'', not yet observed, is an ''F''... [therefore]
:3. The probability that ''a'' is ''G'' is ''p''.&lt;ref name="sep-induction-problem"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Vickers |editor=Edward N.

==Proving a negative==
A [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something.&lt;ref name="Hales4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hales|first=Steven D.|date=Summer 2005|title=Thinking tools: You ''can'' prove a negative|url=http://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf|journal=[[Think (journal)|Think]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=4|issue=10|pages=109–112|doi=10.1017/S1477175600001287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that it is impossible to prove a negative is a pseudologic, because there are many proofs that substantiate negative claims in mathematics, science, and economics, including [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]. There can be multiple claims within a [[debate]]. Nevertheless, whoever makes a claim carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim.

A negative claim may or may not exist as a counterpoint to a previous claim. A [[proof of impossibility]] or an evidence of absence argument are typical methods to fulfill the burden of proof for a negative claim.&lt;ref name="Hales4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Attacking Faulty Reasoning|Attacking faulty reasoning: a practical guide to fallacy-free arguments]]|last=Damer|first=T.

Philosopher Steven Hales argues that typically one can logically be as confident with the negation of an affirmation. Hales says that if one's [[epistemology|standards]] of [[certainty]] leads them to say "there is never 'proof' of [[non-existence]]", then they must also say that "there is never 'proof' of ''existence'' either". Hales argues that there are many cases where we may be able to prove something does not exist with as much certainty as proving something does exist.&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf |first=Steven D. |last=Hales |title=Thinking Tools: You ''can'' Prove a Negative |journal=Think |doi=10.1017/S1477175600001287 |year=2005 |pages=109–112 |issue=10 |volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cochlea''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|l|i|ə}} is Latin for “snail, shell or screw” and originates from the Greek word κοχλίας ''kohlias''. The modern definition, the auditory portion of the [[inner ear]], originated in the late 17th century. Within the mammalian cochlea exists the [[organ of Corti]], which contains [[hair cell]]s that are responsible for translating the vibrations it receives from surrounding fluid-filled ducts into [[electrical impulse]]s that are sent to the brain to process sound.&lt;ref name=Dugdale /&gt; This spiral-shaped cochlea is estimated to have originated during the early [[Cretaceous Period]], around 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Further, the auditory innervation of the spiral-shaped cochlea also traces back to the Cretaceous period.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The evolution of the human cochlea is a major area of scientific interest because of its favourable representation in the [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; During the last century, many scientists such as evolutionary biologists and paleontologists strove to develop new methods and techniques to overcome the many obstacles associated with working with ancient, delicate artifacts.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; In the past, scientists were limited in their ability to fully examine specimens without causing damage to them.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; In more recent times, technologies such as micro-CT scanning became available.&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt; These technologies allow for the visual differentiation between fossilized animal materials and other sedimentary remains.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; With the use of X-ray technologies, it is possible to ascertain some information about the auditory capabilities of extinct creatures, giving insight to human ancestors as well as their contemporary species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt;

== Comparative anatomy ==
While the basic structure of the inner ear in [[lepidosaurs]] (lizards and snakes), [[archosaurs]] (birds and crocodilians) and [[mammals]] is similar, and the organs are considered to be homologous, each group has a unique type of auditory organ.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The hearing organ arose within the lagenar duct of stem reptiles, lying between the saccular and lagenar epithelia. In lepidosaurs, the hearing organ, the basilar papilla, is generally small, with at most 2000 hair cells, whereas in archosaurs the basilar papilla can be much longer (&gt;10mm in owls) and contain many more hair cells that show two typical size extremes, the short and the tall hair cells. In mammals, the structure is known as the organ of Corti and shows a unique arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells. All mammalian organs of Corti contain a supporting tunnel made up of pillar cells, on the inner side of which there are inner hair cells and outer hair cells on the outer side. The [[definitive mammalian middle ear]] and the elongated cochlea allows for better sensitivity for higher frequencies.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

=== Lepidosaurs ===
As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) middle ear transmits sound to the footplate of the columella, which sends a pressure wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. In contrast, lizards tend to have two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5–8&amp;nbsp;kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Archosaurs ===
In birds and crocodilians, the similarity of the structure of the [[basilar papilla]] betrays their close evolutionary relationship. The basilar papilla is up to about 10mm long and contains up to 16500 hair cells. While most birds have an upper hearing limit of only about 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, the barn owl can hear up to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz and thus close to the human upper limit.&lt;ref name=Koeppl /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
{{See also|Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles}}
Egg-laying mammals, the monotremes (spiny anteater and platypus), do not have a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7&amp;nbsp;mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Amphibians ===
Amphibians have unique inner ear structures. There are two sensory papillae involved in hearing, the basilar (higher frequency) and amphibian (lower frequency) papillae, but it is uncertain whether either is homologous to the hearing organs of lepidosaurs, archosaurs and mammals and we have no idea when they arose.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Fish ===
Fish have no dedicated auditory epithelium, but use various vestibular sensory organs that respond to sound. In most teleost fishes it is the saccular macula that responds to sound. In some, such as goldfishes, there is also a special bony connection to the gas bladder that increases sensitivity allowing hearing up to about 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Neanderthals to modern humans ===
The size of cochlea has been measured throughout its evolution based on the fossil record. In one study, the basal turn of the cochlea was measured, and it was hypothesized that cochlear size correlates with body mass. The size of the basal turn of the cochlea was not different in Neanderthals and Holocene humans, however it became larger in early modern humans and Upper Paleolithic humans. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the cochlea is similar between Neanderthals and Holocene humans, relative to plane of the lateral canal, whereas early modern and upper Paleolithic humans have a more superiorly placed cochlea than Holocene humans. When comparing hominins of the Middle Pleistocene and Neanderthals and Holocene humans, the apex of the cochlea faces more inferiorly in the hominins than the latter two groups. Finally, the cochlea of European middle Pleistocene hominins faces more inferiorly than Neanderthals, modern humans, and Homo erectus.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt;
Human beings, along with Apes, are the only mammals that do not have high frequency (&gt;32&amp;nbsp;kHz) hearing.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt; Humans have long cochleae, but the space devoted to each frequency range is quite large (2.5mm per octave), resulting in a comparatively reduced upper frequency limit.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The human cochlea has approximately 2.5 turns around the modiolus (the axis).&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Humans, like many mammals and birds, are able to perceive auditory signals that displace the eardrum by a mere picometre.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;

== The ear ==
Because of its prominence and preserved state in the fossil record, until recently, the ear had been used to determine phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; The ear itself contains different portions, including the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear and all of these show evolutionary changes that are often unique to each lineage [14]. It was the independent evolution of a tympanic middle ear in the Triassic era that produced strong selection pressures towards improved hearing organs in the separate lineages of land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The cochlea is the tri-chambered auditory detection portion of the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt; Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials.&lt;ref name=Fernandez /&gt; This leads to the investigation of the relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

This spiral-shaped cochlea that is in both marsupial and placental mammals is traced back to approximately 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name= Manley /&gt; The development of the most basic basilar papilla (the auditory organ that later evolved into the Organ of Corti in mammals) happened at the same time as the water-to-land transition of vertebrates, approximately 380 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The actual coiling or spiral nature of the cochlea occurred to save space inside the skull.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The longer the cochlea, the higher is the potential resolution of sound frequencies given the same hearing range.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The oldest of the truly coiled mammalian cochleae were approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

The earliest evidence available for primates depicts a short cochlea with prominent laminae, suggesting that they had good high-frequency sensitivity as opposed to low-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; After this, over a period of around 60 million years, evidence suggests that primates developed longer cochleae and less prominent laminae, which means that they had an improvement in low-frequency sensitivity and a decrease in high-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; By the early Miocene period, the cycle of the elongation of the cochleae and the deterioration of the laminae was completed.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Evidence shows that primates have had an increasing cochlear volume to body mass ratio over time.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; These changes in the cochlear labyrinth volume negatively affect the highest and lowest audible frequencies, causing a downward shift.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Non-primates appear to have smaller cochlear labyrinth volumes overall when compared to primates.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Some evidence also suggests that selective forces for the larger cochlear labyrinth may have started after the basal primate node.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt;
 
Mammals are the subject of a substantial amount of research not only because of the potential knowledge to be gained regarding humans, but also because of their rich and abundant representation in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; The spiral shape of the cochlea evolved later on in the evolutionary pathway of mammals than previously believed, just before the therians split into the two lineages marsupials and placentals, about 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley  /&gt;

=== The evolution of prestins ===

Parallel to the evolution of the cochlea, [[prestins]] show an increased rate of evolution in therian mammals. Prestins are located in the outer hair cells of mammalian cochlea and are considered motor proteins. They are found in the hair cells of all vertebrates, including fish, but are thought to have initially been membrane transporter molecules. A high concentration of prestins are found only in the lateral membranes of therian outer hair cells (there is uncertainty with regard to concentrations in monotremes). This high concentration is not found in inner hair cells, and is also lacking in all hair cell types of non-mammals.&lt;ref name=Koeppl2 /&gt;  Prestin also has a role in motility, which evolved a greater importance in the motor function in land vertebrates, but this developed vastly differently in different lineages. In certain birds and mammals, prestins function as both transporters and motors, but the strongest evolution to robust motor dynamics only evolved in therian mammals. It is hypothesized that this motor system is significant to the therian cochlea at high frequencies because of the distinctive cellular and bony composition of the organ of Corti that allows the prestins to intensify movements of the whole structure.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;
Modern ultra-sound echolocating species such as bats and toothed whales show highly evolved prestins, and these prestins show identical sequence alterations over time. Unusually, the sequences thus apparently evolved independent from each other during different time periods. Furthermore, the evolution of neurotransmitter receptor systems (acetylcholine) that regulate the motor feedback of the outer hair cells coincides with prestin evolution in therians. This suggests that there was a parallel evolution of a control system and a motor system in the inner ear of therian mammals.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Homoplasies (convergent evolution) ===
Land vertebrates evolved middle ears independently in each major lineage, and are this the result of parallel evolution.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The configurations of the middle ears of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Furthermore, it is apparent that the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.&lt;ref name=Kitazawa /&gt;

In certain languages, the '''final form''' is a special character used to represent a letter only when it occurs at the end of a word. 
Some languages that use final form characters are: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]] and one letter in [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[ς]]).

The lowercase [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letter "s" had separate medial ([[long s|ſ]]) and final (s) in the orthographies of many European languages from the medieval period to the early 19th century; it survived in the German [[Fraktur]] script until the 1940s.

==Hebrew==
In the [[Hebrew alphabet]] the final form is called '''sofit''' ({{lang-he|סופית}}, meaning "final" or "ending"). The following five  Hebrew letters take a final form:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Letter name !! Non-final!! Final (sofit)
|-
| [[Mem]] || מ || ם
|-
| [[Nun (letter)|Nun]] || נ || ן
|-
| [[Tsadi]] || צ || ץ
|-
| [[Pe (letter)|Pe]] || פ || ף
|-
| [[Kaph|Kaf]] || כ || ך
|}

This set of letters is known acronymically as אותיות מנצפ"ך.

The now final forms ן ץ ף ך predate their non-final counterparts; They were the default forms used in any position within a word. Their [[descender]] eventually bent forwards when preceding another letter to facilitate writing. A final form of these letters is also called pshuta (פשוטה, meaning extended or plain).

The Letter מ also had a descender (𐡌), however, its current final form ם was a variant of מ used interchangeably in all positions. One instance of a medial ם is preserved in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Isaiah 9:6). Arguably, Genesis 49:19-20 have a final מ.

[[Modern Hebrew]] uses the forms פ כ finally, when [[Orthographic transcription|transcribing]] a [[plosive]] pronunciation, for example מיקרוסקו'''פ''' (microsco'''p'''e), מובאר'''כ''' (Mubara'''k''', مبار'''ك''').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''free loop''' is a variant of the mathematical notion of a [[Loop (topology)|loop]].  Whereas a loop has a distinguished point on it, called a basepoint, a free loop lacks such a distinguished point.  Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  Then a free loop in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence class]] of [[continuous function]]s from the [[circle]] &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Two loops are equivalent if they differ by a reparameterization of the circle.  That is, &lt;math&gt;f \sim g&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\psi : S^1 \rightarrow S^1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g = f\circ\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, a free loop, as opposed to a based loop used in the definition of the [[fundamental group]], is a map from the circle to the space without the basepoint-preserving restriction.  Free homotopy classes of free loops correspond to [[conjugacy class]]es in the fundamental group.

Recently, interest in the space of all free loops &lt;math&gt;LX&lt;/math&gt; has grown with the advent of [[string topology]], i.e. the study of new algebraic structures on the [[singular homology|homology]] of the free loop space.

'''''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel''''' is a sociological book written by James Ron, Harold E. Stassen Chair in International Affairs at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Inspired by his time as a member of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], as a research consultant for [[Human Rights Watch]], and as a research consultant for the [[International Red Cross]], Ron asks: "what explains why states use different kinds of violence in some cases and not others?" For Ron, institutional distinctions and international norms are key to explaining diverse repertoires of state violence against similar victims.

== Summary ==

In ''Frontiers and Ghettos'', James Ron argues that states use different methods and degrees of coercion against perceived national enemies as a result of variation in institutional contexts. 
When a targeted group is ghettoized, they are likely to become victims of severe, police-style repression but not [[ethnic cleansing]] or [[murder]]. Contrarily, when a targeted group exists on a frontier, they are more likely to become victims of cleansing and death instead of repression. This is because in ghettos, states have unrivaled control but are also bound by international and domestic legal and moral obligations to its inhabitants. Along frontiers, states have less control as well as fewer and weaker moral obligations. According to Ron, the more that a state controls a given territory, the more it feels a “bureaucratic, moral, and political sense of responsibility” for the fate of those within it.&lt;ref&gt;Ron, J. (2003). Frontiers &amp; Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of responsibility leads states to choose less overtly violent modes of repression in ghettos as compared to when states target populations exist on the periphery.

== Case Studies ==

James Ron examines five cases of ethnic violence and ethnic policing in two States, [[Serbia]] and [[Israel]], over similar periods of time. The cases are as follows:

# [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[ethnic cleansing]] on the [[Bosnia]]n frontier from 1992-1993.
# [[Serbs|Serbian]] ethnic policing against non-serbs in the [[Sandzak]] and [[Vojvodina]] from 1992-1993.
# [[Serbs|Serbian]] switch from ethnic policing in [[Kosovo]] from 1990-1997 to [[ethnic cleansing]] in 1998-1999.
# [[Israel]]i repression of [[Palestinians]] during The [[First Intifada]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] in 1988.
# [[Israel]]i destruction of [[PLO]] forces and Palestinian refugees during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].

Ron uses field interviews, newspaper reports and academic publications to illustrate the importance of institutional context for explaining repertoires of state violence. He argues that [[Serbia]] engaged in [[ethnic cleansing]] in [[Bosnia]] because in 1992, Bosnia became a frontier. On the other hand, [[Israel]] policed [[Palestinians]] in 1988 because [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] at the time was a ghetto, even though the threat posed by Palestinians during the 1988 uprising was greater. The more states controlled territories and peoples, the less likely their security forces were to ethnically cleanse perceived national enemies.

== Reception ==

''Frontiers and Ghettos'' was favorably received by many [[sociologists]] and [[political scientists]] as well as human rights organizations working on issues related to [[state violence]]. For example, the historian [[L. Carl Brown]], writing for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, wrote that the book offered "a well-documented study of Ron's chosen examples and a sophisticated framework for understanding other such situations."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Carl. (2003). Review of ''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' in ''Foreign Affairs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Anthony Obserschall compliments Ron for his "engaging and promising" [[hypothesis]] as well as his "fascinating" use of detail that make the footnotes as pleasurable to read as the main  text."&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' by James Ron. Review by: Anthony Oberschall. ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1657-1659&lt;/ref&gt; However, Obserschall also critiques Ron on several grounds. For example, he argues that (1) the ethnic policing versus cleansing distinction is too crude for legal and normative evaluations of state violence, and (2) the frontier concept is applied inconsistently for the comparisons Ron wishes to make. In the former critique, Obserschall notes how 750 Palestinians were killed during The [[First Intifada]], 13,000 were wounded, hundreds lost their homes, and thousands were arrested and detained. In the latter critique, Obserschall writes that the Lebanese frontier and Bosnian frontier are not as comparable as Ron makes them out to be. [[Bosniaks]] in Bosnia were unarmed and defenseless whereas Palestinian paramilitaries in South Lebanon were heavily armed and frequently engaged in cross-border military actions against Israelis. Political Scientist [[Darius Rejali]] writes that Ron argues "persuasively" why it is important to study not just why violence is done, but how. He adds, "[Ron's] "study of the practice shows that international norms are far more robust than political scientists normally imagine".&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' by James Ron. Review by: Darius Rejali. ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 34, No. 1 (Autumn 2004), pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometrical frustration occurs when a set of [[degrees of freedom]] is incompatible with the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] it occupies.

A purely [[geometry|geometric]] example of this is the impossibility of close-packing [[pentagon]]s in [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]]. Another is atomic [[magnetic moment]]s with [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] interactions. These [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] lower their [[interaction energy]] by pointing [[antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]] to their neighbors.

In the case of two dimensional space, the [[triangular lattice]] is the simplest example of such frustration. With a triangular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]], the two spins can easily accommodate two sides, but the third spin is frustrated. If this third spin is up, then two arrangements out of the three are compatible, but one is incompatible. This leads to a huge degeneracy in the [[ground state]] with non-zero [[entropy]]. This frustration leads to breaking [[symmetry]], which leads to [[ferroelectricity]].

'''''Ignotum per ignotius''''' ([[Latin]] for "the unknown by the more unknown") describes an explanation that is less familiar than the concept it would explain.

An example would be: "The oven felt hot because of [[Fourier's Law]]." It is unlikely that a person unfamiliar with the hotness of ovens would be enlightened by a reference to a fundamental law of physics. Of course, such a person might exist in theory, so ''ignotum per ignotius'' is not strictly a logical fallacy; it is just a criticism of an argument on rhetorical grounds, stating that such an argument is not useful in a particular context.

==''Ignotum per æque ignotum''==
'''''Ignotum per æque ignotum''''', meaning "the unknown by the equally unknown", is a related form of [[fallacy]] in which one attempts to prove something unknown by deducing it from something else that is also not known to be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]], ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', Day 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}

'''Ishvara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईश्वर, [[IAST]]: Īśvara) is a concept in [[Hinduism]], with a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt; In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, depending on the context, ''Ishvara'' can mean supreme soul, ruler, lord, king, queen  or husband.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt; In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, ''Ishvara'' means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]].&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73/&gt;

In [[Shaivism]], ''Ishvara'' is synonymous with "[[Shiva]]", sometimes as ''Maheshvara'' or ''Parameshvara'' meaning the "Supreme lord", or as an [[Ishta-deva]] (personal god).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=235, 379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vaishnavism]], it is synonymous with [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=olilea/&gt; In traditional [[Bhakti]] movements, Ishvara is one or more deities of an individual's preference from Hinduism's polytheistic canon of deities. In modern sectarian movements such as [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]], Ishvara takes the form of a monotheistic  God.&lt;ref name=rkpr/&gt; In [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, it is any "personal deity" or "spiritual inspiration".&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt; In [[Advaita Vedanta]] school, Ishvara is a monistic Universal Absolute that connects and is the Oneness in everyone and everything.&lt;ref name=lance&gt;Lance Nelson (1996), Living liberation in Shankara and classical Advaita, in Living Liberation in Hindu Thought (Editors: Andrew O. Fort, Patricia Y. Mumme), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791427064}}, pages 38-39, 59 (footnote 105)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jkoller/&gt;

==Etymology==
The root of the word Ishvara comes from ''īś-'' (ईश, Ish) which means "capable of" and "owner, ruler, chief of",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell]] (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately cognate with English ''own'' (Germanic ''[[:wikt:agnian|*aigana-]]'', PIE ''*aik-''). The second part of the word ''Ishvara'' is ''vara'' which means depending on context, "best, excellent, beautiful", "choice, wish, blessing, boon, gift", and "suitor, lover, one who solicits a girl in marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, page 270&lt;/ref&gt; The composite word, ''Ishvara'' literally means "owner of best, beautiful", "ruler of choices, blessings, boons", or "chief of suitor, lover".

As a concept, ''Ishvara'' in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, variously means God, Supreme Being, Supreme Soul, lord, king or ruler, rich or wealthy man, god of love, deity Shiva, one of the [[Rudra]]s, prince, husband and the number eleven.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apte Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 306&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Īśvara'' never appears in [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=madhav/&gt; However, the verb ''īś-'' does appear in Rig veda, where the context suggests that the meaning of it is "capable of, able to".&lt;ref name=madhav&gt;Madhav Deshpande (1991), Sense and Syntax in Vedic (Editors: Joel Brereton and Stephenie Jamison), Volumes 4-5, Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004093560}}, pages 23-27&lt;/ref&gt; It is absent in [[Samaveda]], is rare in [[Atharvaveda]], appears in [[Samhita]]s of [[Yajurveda]]. The contextual meaning, however as the ancient Indian grammarian [[Pāṇini]] explains, is neither god nor supreme being.&lt;ref name=madhav/&gt;

The word ''Ishvara'' appears in numerous ancient [[Dharmaśāstra#Principal Root Texts|Dharmasutra]]s. However, [[Patrick Olivelle]] states that there ''Ishvara'' does not mean God, but means [[Veda]]s.&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; Deshpande states that ''Ishvara'' in Dharmasutras could alternatively mean king, with the context literally asserting that "the Dharmasutras are as important as ''Ishvara'' (the king) on matters of public importance".&lt;ref name=patrick&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2006), Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE: Society in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195305326}}, page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Saivite]] traditions of [[Hinduism]], the term is used as part of the compound "[[Maheshvara]]" ("great lord") as a name for [[Shiva]].  In [[Mahayana Buddhism]] it is used as part of the compound "[[Avalokiteśvara]]" ("lord who hears the cries of the world"), the name of a [[bodhisattva]] revered for his compassion. When referring to divine as female, particularly in [[Shaktism]], the feminine ''{{IAST|Īśvarī}}'' is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
Among the six systems of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa]] do not consider the concept of ''Ishvara'', i.e., a supreme being, relevant. [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Vedanta]] and [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.

Desmarais states that Isvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=mmd&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (''[[Bhakti]]''), nor does it give ''Ishvara'' characteristics typically associated with a deity.&lt;ref name=mmd/&gt; In Yoga school of Hinduism, states Whicher, Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt; Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, explain the term ''Ishvara'' as the "Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings".&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knut"/&gt; Malinar states that in Samkhya-Yoga schools of Hinduism, ''Isvara'' is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.&lt;ref&gt;A Malinar (2014), Current Approaches: Articles on Key Themes, in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (1951), Philosophies of India, Reprinted by Routledge in 2008, {{ISBN|978-0415462327}}, pages 242-243, 309-311&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] movement considers Krishna as the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700710492}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]] movements – influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India – conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord.&lt;ref name=rkpr&gt;RK Pruthi (2004), Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization, {{ISBN|978-8171417803}}, pages 5-6, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] of Ramanuja and [[Dvaita|Dvaita Vedanta]] of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the ''Prakriti'' (material world) and ''Purusa'' (soul, spirit).

Radhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in ''Isvara'' concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of "personal God" where the "ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed".&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan and Moore (1967, Reprinted 1989), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 37-39, 401-403, 498-503&lt;/ref&gt; Riepe, and others,&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 73-76&lt;/ref&gt; state that schools of Hinduism leave the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Isvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of "deity of one's choice" or "formless [[Brahman]] (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)".&lt;ref name=riepe&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1975), Our savage god: The perverse use of eastern thought, {{ISBN|978-0836206111}}, pages 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1966), Hinduism, Oxford University Press, 1980 edition: pages 126-129, Reprinted in 1983 as {{ISBN|978-0198880127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Samkhya school of Hinduism===
[[Samkhya]] is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars.&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Garbe (2013), Die Samkhya-Philosophie, Indische Philosophie Volume 11, {{ISBN|978-1484030615}}, pages 25-27 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Jacobsen]], Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Isvara is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Yoga school of Hinduism===
The Yogasutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, uses the term ''Ishvara'' in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra's release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is ''Isvara''? These commentaries range from defining ''Isvara'' from a "personal god" to "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of ''Isvara'' in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali defines ''Isvara'' (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, ''puruṣa-viśeṣa'')",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=25|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n33/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|क्लेश कर्म विपाकाशयैःपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष '''ईश्वरः''' ॥२४॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of ''Isvara'' as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, ''aparamrsta'') by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, ''klesha''), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (कर्म, ''karma''), one's life fruits (विपाक, ''vipâka''), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).&lt;ref name=se5&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=aparAmRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes aparAmRSTa], [http://spokensanskrit.de kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya]; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali's concept of Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=knut&gt;[[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]] (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vaisesika school of Hinduism===
[[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on ''Ishvara'' for its [[atomism|atomistic]] naturalism philosophy. To it, substances and ''paramāṇu'' (atoms) were eternal, they moved and interacted based on impersonal, eternal ''adrsta'' (अदृष्ट, invisible) laws of nature.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Goel (1984), Indian philosophy: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and modern science, Sterling, {{ISBN|978-0865902787}}, pages 149-151&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Ishvara'', among others, entered into Vaisheshika school many centuries later in 1st millennium AD.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674001879}}, page 836&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution in ideas aimed to explain how and why its so-called "atoms" have a particular order and proportions. These later-age ancient Vaiśeṣika scholars retained their belief that substances are eternal, added Ishvara as another eternal who is also omniscient and omnipresent (not omnipotent). Ishvara did not create the world, according to this school of Hindu scholars, but He only created invisible laws that operate the world and then He becomes passive and lets those hidden universal laws do its thing.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt; Thus, Vaisheshika's Ishvara mirrors [[Deus otiosus]] of [[Deism]]. Vaisheshika school's ''Ishvara'', states [[Klaus Klostermaier]], can be understood as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He "winds up the clock, and lets it run its course".&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, page 337&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Nyaya school of Hinduism===
Early [[Nyaya]] school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 18-19, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including ''Ishvara''. Verses 19-21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt;

सिद्धान्तसूत्र : तत्कारितत्वादहेतुः&lt;br&gt;

Centuries later, the 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada revisited the premise of Ishvara. He was followed by [[Udayana]], who in his text ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'', interpreted "it" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as "human action" and "him" as "Ishvara", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara.&lt;ref name=csharma&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt; In developing his arguments, he inherently defined ''Ishvara'' as efficient cause, omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, giver of gifts, ability and meaning to humanity, divine creator of the world as well as the moral principles, and the unseen power that makes the [[karma]] doctrine work.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VR Rao (1987), Selected Doctrines from Indian Philosophy, {{ISBN|81-70990009}}, pages 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Mimamsa school of Hinduism===
[[Mīmāṃsā]] scholars of Hinduism questioned what is ''Ishvara'' (God)?&lt;ref name=fxc3&gt;FX Clooney (1997), What’s a god? The quest for the right understanding of devatā in Brāhmaṅical ritual theory (Mīmāṃsā), International Journal of Hindu Studies, August 1997, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 337-385&lt;/ref&gt; They used their ''[[pramana]]'' tools to cross examine answers offered by other schools of Hinduism. For example, when Nyaya scholars stated God is omnipotent, omniscient and infallible, that the world is the result of God's creation which is proved by the presence of creatures, just like human work proves human existence, Mimamsa scholars asked, why does this God create the world, for what reason? Further, they added, it cannot be because of Ishvara's love to human beings because this world – if Ishvara created it – is imperfect and human souls are suffering in it. Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism raised numerous objections to any definition of Ishvara along with its premises, deconstructed justifications offered, and considered Ishvara concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).&lt;ref name=fxc3/&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P. Bilimoria (2001), Hindu doubts about God: Towards Mimamsa Deconstruction, in Philosophy of Religion: Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 4, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3611-2}}, pages 87-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vedanta school of Hinduism===

====Advaita Vedanta====
[[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism proclaims that at the empirical level Ishvara is the cause of the universe and the one who awards the fruits of every action. He is defined as the one without likes and dislikes, as well embodied with compassion (vaiShamya NairgghruNya doSha vihInaH).  Ishvara is that which is "free from ''avidya'' (ignorance), free from ''ahamkrti'' (ego-sense), free from ''bandhana'' (bondage)", a Self that is "pure, enlightened, liberated".&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;&lt;ref name=jkoller&gt;John Koller (2012), Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-107&lt;/ref&gt; 
Having accepted and established Ishvara, Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the real nature of Ishvara (existence, consciousness and bliss) is non different from the real nature of an individual. This gives room in Advaita Vedanta to show the nature of Ishvara as both the material and instrumental cause of this universe and the individual who is limited in his own capacities as unreal and declare that there is oneness between the two having negated the qualities. This establishes Ishvara as 'saguNa' or with attributes from the empirical existence and 'nirguNa' from the absolute sense.  This oneness is accepted only at the level of 'mukti' or ultimate realization and not at the 'vyavahara' or empirical level. At the absolute level there is no otherness nor distinction between ''Jiva'' (living being) and ''Ishvara'', and any attempts to distinguish the two is a false idea, one based on wrong knowledge, according to Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hacker (1978), Eigentumlichkeiten dr Lehre und Terminologie Sankara: Avidya, Namarupa, Maya, Isvara, in Kleine Schriften (Editor: L. Schmithausen), Franz Steiner Verlag, Weisbaden, pages 101-109 (in German), also pages 69-99&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
ईश्वरः अहम् &lt;br&gt;
Ishvara, I am.
|[[Adi Shankara]]| Upadesasahasri 2.3.1, 2.10.8 &lt;ref name=lance/&gt;}}

Other Advaitin Hindu texts resonate with the [[monism|monist]] views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is "above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything"; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself – he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free from fears, from delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, page 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 547-551&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting metaphor is that when the "reflection" of the Cosmic Spirit falls upon the mirror of ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' (''{{IAST|Māyā}}''; the principle of illusion, which binds the mind), it appears as the Supreme Lord.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}"/&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} Brahman is not thought to have such attributes in the true sense.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-884852-02-5}}"&gt;See generally, Swami Bhaskarananda, ''The Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 1994) {{ISBN|1-884852-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} However it may be helpful to project such attributes onto Brahman.

====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====
''Ishvara'', in [[Vishishtadvaita]] Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is a composite concept of dualism and non-dualism, or "non-dualism with differentiation".&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;McCasland et al. (1969), Religions of the world, Random House, {{ISBN|978-0394303840}}, page 471&lt;/ref&gt; Ishvara, Vishishtadvaitin scholars such as the 11th century [[Ramanuja]] state, is the supreme creator and synonymous with [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="Chari1988p212"&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita concepts provided the foundation for several Bhakti movements of Hinduism, such as those by [[Sri Aurobindo]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; and has been suggested as having influenced Basava's [[Lingayatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 243-244&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dvaita Vedanta====
The Dvaita ([[Dualistic cosmology#In Hinduism|dualism]]) sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded by 13th century Madhva, defines ''Ishvara'' as creator God that is distinct from ''Jiva'' (individual souls in living beings).&lt;ref name=rajpra&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narayana]] (Vishnu) is considered to be ''Ishvara'', and the [[Vaishnavism]] movement arose on the foundation developed by Dvaita Vedanta sub-school.&lt;ref name=olilea&gt;Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvara'' (God) is a complete, perfect and the highest reality to Dvaitins, and simultaneously the world is separate reality for them, unlike competing thoughts in other sub-schools of Vedanta.&lt;ref name=olilea/&gt; In [[Dvaita]] sub-school, ''Jiva'' (individual soul) is different, yet dependent on ''Ishvara'' (God). Both possess the attributes of consciousness, bliss and existence, but the individual soul is considered atomic, while God is all encompassing. The attributes of ''Jiva'' struggle to manifest, while of God it is fully manifested.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt;

Madhva states there are five permutations of differences between ''Jiva'' (individual souls) and ''Ishvara'' (God): between God and souls, between God and matter, between souls and matter, between one soul and another soul, and between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative.&lt;ref name=tompad/&gt; Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with Everyone and fusion with Universal Absolute, to the state of [[moksha]] in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.&lt;ref name=tompad&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The world, called ''Maya'', is held as the divine will of Ishvara.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt; ''Jiva'' suffers, experiences misery and bondage, state Dvaitins, because of "ignorance and incorrect knowledge" (''ajnana''). Liberation occurs with the correct knowledge and attainment unto Lord Narayana.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt; It is His grace that gives salvation according to Dvaita sub-school, which is achievable by predominance of ''sattva'' [[Guṇa|guna]] (moral, constructive, simple, kindness-filled life), and therefore Dvaitins must live a [[Dharma|dharmic]] life while constantly remembering, deeply loving ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt;

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
{{IAST|Acintya bhedābheda}} is a sub-school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference'', in relation to the power creation and creator, Ishvara, ([[Krishna]]).&lt;ref name=Kaviraja&gt;{{cite book | author = Kaviraja, K.G. | year = | title =  Sri Caitanya-caritamrita. Bengali text, translation, and commentary by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada | publisher = [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] | isbn =}}[http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 ''Madhya'' 20.108-109] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153501/http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 |date=11 May 2008 }} "It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of Krishna because he is the marginal energy of Krishna and a manifestation simultaneously one with and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of sunshine or fire."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa Upaniṣad}} 1.25: ''{{IAST|...na bhinnam. nā bhinnamābhirbhinno na vai vibhuḥ}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable', ''bheda'' translates as 'difference', and ''abheda'' translates as 'one-ness'. Spirit souls are considered part of God and thus one with Him in quality, and yet at the same time different from Him in quantity. This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spiritual Dialectics|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|publisher=Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=96|quote=Hence, he called his philosophy Achintya Bhedabhed vad, or Inconceivable Simultaneous Oneness and Difference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caitanya's philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva completed the progression to devotional [[theism]]. [[Rāmānuja]] had agreed with [[Śaṅkara|{{IAST|Śaṅkara}}]] that the Absolute is one only, but he had disagreed by affirming individual variety within that oneness. [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] had underscored the eternal duality of the Supreme and the [[Jiva|Jīva]]: he had maintained that this duality endures even after liberation. Caitanya, in turn, specified that the Supreme and the jīvas are "inconceivably, simultaneously one and different" (acintya-bheda-abheda).&lt;ref name = SDG&gt;{{Cite book| first = dasa Goswami| last = Satsvarupa| author-link = Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| title =Readings in Vedit Literature: The Tradition Speaks for Itself|   publisher = Assoc Publishing Group| year = 1976| pages = 240 pages | isbn = 0-912776-88-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Carvaka school of Hinduism===
[[Cārvāka]], another atheist tradition in Hinduism, was materialist and a school of [[philosophical scepticism]]. They rejected all concepts of ''Ishvara'' as well as all forms of supernaturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Flint, {{Google books|7es0AQAAIAAJ|Anti-theistic theories|page=463}}, Appendix Note VII - Hindu Materialism: The Charvaka System; William Blackwood, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Raman (2012), Hinduism and Science: Some Reflections, Zygon - Journal of Religion and Science, 47(3): 549–574, Quote (page 557): "Aside from nontheistic schools like the [[Samkhya]], there have also been explicitly atheistic schools in the Hindu tradition. One virulently anti-supernatural system is/was the so-called Carvaka school.", {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9744.2012.01274.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 67, Quote: "Of the three heterodox systems, the remaining one, the Caravaka system, is a Hindu system."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isolation''' ({{lang-de|Isolierung}}) is a [[defence mechanism]] in [[psychoanalytic theory]] first proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]].  While related to [[Psychological repression|repression]] the concept distinguishes itself in several ways.  It is characterized as a mental process involving the creation of a gap between an unpleasant or threatening cognition, and other thoughts and feelings.  By minimizing associative connections with other thoughts, the threatening cognition is remembered less often and is less likely to affect [[self-esteem]] or the [[self concept]].&lt;ref name = foo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F. |author2=Karen Dale |author3=Kristin L. Sommer|title=Freudian Defense Mechanisms and Empirical Findings in Modern Social Psychology: Reaction Formation, Projection, Displacement, Undoing, Isolation, Sublimation, and Denial|journal=Journal of Personality|date=1 December 1998|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1081–1124|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00043}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Freud illustrated the concept with the example of a person beginning a train of thought and then pausing for a moment before continuing to a different subject.  His theory stated that by inserting an interval the person was  "letting it be understood symbolically that he will not allow his thoughts about that impression or activity to come into associative contact with other thoughts."&lt;ref name=freud&gt;{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The standard edition of the complete works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. 20)|year=1961|publisher=Hogarth Press|location=London|pages=77–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a defense against harmful thoughts, isolation prevents the self from allowing these cognitions to become recurrent and possibly damaging to the self-concept.

==Evidence==
A wide range of studies supports the conclusion that people defend themselves against threats by mentally isolating them.  Repressors have been shown to process information in a rushed, shallow, or minimal fashion.&lt;ref name=bonanno&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=G. A.|author2=Davis, P. J. |author3=Singer, J. L. |author4=Schwartz, G.

This high level of processing develops strong associative links with similar information.  When a depressed person tries to avoid a damaging cognition, they often think of some other negatively affecting thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=J. A.|author2=Weary, G.|title=Depression and the impression-forming continuum: Piecemeal processing despite the availability of category information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1993|volume=64|pages=636–645|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from human and animal studies shows that isolation prompts sensitivity to social threats and motivates the renewal of social connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J. T. | last2 = Hawkley | first2 = L.C. | last3 = Norman | first3 = G.J. | last4 = Berntson | first4 = G.G. | year = 2011 | title = Social isolation | url = | journal = Ann. N.Y. Acad.

One study showed that people would remain satisfied with their performance in the face of negative feedback as long as they could keep the feedback isolated from performance standards.  The researchers would present the standards either before the performance, or after the performance but before the feedback, or after both the performance and the feedback. The people who received the standards early recalled them as well as the others, but simply ignored it.  They managed to isolate their feedback from the standards thereby minimizing the threat to their self-esteem.  Those who received the standards later were less satisfied with their performance, unable to avoid their lack of success as compared to the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schul|first=Y|author2=Schiff, M.|title=On the costs and benefits of ignorance: How performance satisfaction is affected by knowing the standard prior to performance|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995|volume=21|pages=491–501|doi=10.1177/0146167295215007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of isolation has been referred to as trivializing.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

Another noteworthy type of isolation is referred to as "temporal bracketing", in which some perceived failure or shortcoming is buried away in one's past, effectively removing its impact on the current self.  This type of separation from the past can be seen in religious conversion or "born again" experiences, in certain drug addiction recovery programs, and in the throwing away of delinquent files in the legal system.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  These socially accepted practices effectively make isolation socially permissible, at least in certain instances; and those behaviors seem to relieve some of the stress from past events.  People with low self-esteem often use temporal bracketing when describing past failures.  By isolating themselves from whatever misdeed they are bringing to cognition, they contend that it has nothing to do with their current state or relationships with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=R.

=== Effect ===
Habitual repressors have been shown to have fewer unhappy memories than other people, but the difference rests in the secondary associations.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  Research of repressors concluded that they had equally strong negative reactions to bad memories, however those memories did not evoke other negative feelings as much as they did for non-repressors.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=R.

Further research will be needed for accounts of isolation to be considered fully concrete.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

[[File:Asubha_Body_Contemplation.png|thumb|upright=2|right|alt=Asubha Contemplation Illustration|Illustration of the first two [[asubha]] contemplations: bloated corpse and discolored, bluish corpse. From an early 20th century manuscript found in [[Chaiya District]], [[Surat Thani Province]], [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;from [http://zugangzureinsicht.org/html/lib/authors/buddhadasa/dhammawithpictures_en.html Teaching Dhamma by pictures: Explanation of a Siamese Traditional Buddhist Manuscript]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
{{Buddhism}}

In [[Buddhism]], '''''{{IAST|kammaṭṭhāna}}''''' is a [[Pali]] word (Sanskrit: '''''karmasthana''''') which literally means ''the place of work''. Its original meaning was someone's occupation (farming, trading, cattle-tending, etc.). It has several [[Polysemy|distinct but related]] usages, all having to do with [[Buddhist meditation]].

==Etymology==
Its most basic meaning is as a word for meditation. In Burma senior meditation practitioners are known as "kammatthanacariyas" (meditation masters). [[Buddhaghosa]] uses "kammatthana" to refer to each of his forty meditation objects listed in the third chapter of the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', which are partially derived from the [[Pāli Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa &amp; Nanamoli (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91 (II, 27–28, "Development in Brief"), 110ff. (starting with III, 104, "enumeration").  It can also be found sprinkled earlier in this text as on p. 18 (I, 39, v. 2) and p. 39 (I, 107).  Throughout Nanamoli translates this term as "meditation subject."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Pali literature]], prior to the post-canonical Pali [[atthakatha|commentaries]], the term ''{{IAST|kammaṭṭhāna}}'' comes up in only a handful of discourses and then in the context of "work" or "trade."&lt;!-- **START OF NOTE** --&gt;{{refn|group=note|For instance, in the first three [[nikaya]]s, the term is found only in the ''Subha Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 99), although there it is found 22 times. In this discourse, it is contextualized, for instance, in this question to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] by the Brahmin Subha:
:"Master Gotama, the brahmins say this: 'Since the work of the household life [Pali: ''{{IAST|gharāvāsa-kammaṭṭhāna}}''] involves a great deal of activity, great functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, it is of great fruit.  Since the work of those gone forth [Pali: ''{{IAST|pabbajjā-kammaṭṭhāna}}''] involves a small amount of activity, small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings, it is of small fruit.' What does Master Gotama say about this?"&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} &amp; Bodhi, 2001, p. 809; the square-bracketed Pali is from Bodhgaya News' searchable [[Tipitaka]] database at [http://bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=3693].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the famed [[Dighajanu Sutta]] ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 8.54):
:"And what does it mean to be consummate in initiative? There is the case where a lay person, by whatever occupation he makes his living [Pali: ''{{IAST|yena kammaṭṭhānena jīvikaṃ kappeti}}''] — whether by farming or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king's man or by any other craft — is clever and untiring at it, endowed with discrimination in its techniques, enough to arrange and carry it out. This is called being consummate in initiative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.054.than.html Thanissaro, 1995]; the square-bracketed Pali is from Bodhgaya News' searchable [[Tipitaka]] database at [http://bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=sutta%20pitaka&amp;action=next&amp;record=6649].&lt;/ref&gt;

An identical phrasing can be found in the very next discourse, the Ujjaya Sutta (AN 8.55)&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=sutta%20pitaka&amp;action=next&amp;record=6653]&lt;/ref&gt;, and in the Dutiya Sampadā Sutta (AN 8.76)&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=6689]&lt;/ref&gt; A last canonical use of this term can be found in the Sakya Sutta (AN 10.46):
:"What do you think, Sakyans. Suppose a man, by some profession or other [Pali: ''yena kenaci kammaṭṭhānena''], without encountering an unskillful day, were to earn a half-kahapana. Would he deserve to be called a capable man, full of initiative?" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.046.than.html Thanissaro, 2000]; the square-bracketed Pali is from Bodhgaya News' searchable [[Tipitaka]] database starting at [http://bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=6888].&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!-- **END OF NOTE** --&gt;

The [[Thai Forest Tradition]] names itself ''Kammaṭṭhāna Forest tradition''.

== Buddhaghosa's forty meditation subjects ==

:(4) neither perception nor non-perception.

One is of perception of disgust of food (''aharepatikulasanna'').

The last is analysis of the four elements (''[[Mahābhūta|catudhatuvavatthana]]''): earth (''pathavi''), water (''apo''), fire (''tejo''), air (''vayo'').

Each kammatthana can be suggested, especially by a spiritual friend  (''[[Kalyana mittata|{{IAST|kalyāṇa-mitta}}]]''), to a certain individual student at some specific point, by assessing what would be best for that student's temperament and the present state of his or her mind.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Buddhaghosa &amp; Nanamoli (1999), p. 90, which states:  "He should approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meditation subjects and jhanas ==
{{JhanaFactors}}

According to Gunaratana, following Buddhaghosa, due to the simplicity of subject matter, all four ''jhanas'' can be induced through ''[[ānāpānasati]]'' (mindfulness of breathing) and the ten ''[[kasina]]s''.&lt;ref name="Gunaratana 1988"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html Gunaratana (1988)].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gunaratana, the following meditation subjects only lead to "access concentration" (''upacara samadhi''), due to their complexity: the recollection of the Buddha, dharma, sangha, morality, liberality, wholesome attributes of Devas, death, and peace; the perception of disgust of food; and the analysis of the four elements.&lt;ref name="Gunaratana 1988"/&gt;

Absorption in the first ''jhana'' can be realized by mindfulness on the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness of the body. However, these meditations cannot go beyond the first jhana due to their involving applied thought (''[[vitaka]]''), which is absent from the higher jhanas.&lt;ref name="Gunaratana 1988"/&gt;

Absorption in the first three ''jhanas'' can be realized by contemplating the first three ''brahma-viharas''. However, these meditations cannot aid in attaining the fourth jhana due to the pleasant feelings associated with them. Conversely, once the fourth jhana is induced, the fourth ''brahma-vihara'' (equanimity) arises.&lt;ref name="Gunaratana 1988"/&gt;

== Meditation subjects and temperaments ==

All of the aforementioned meditation subjects can suppress the [[Five Hindrances]], thus allowing one to fruitfully pursue [[Paññā|wisdom]].  In addition, anyone can productively apply specific meditation subjects as [[Antidote (Buddhism)|antidotes]], such as meditating on foulness to counteract lust or on the breath to abandon discursive thought.

The [[Pali literature|Pali commentaries]] further provide guidelines for suggesting meditation subjects based on one's general temperament:
* '''Greedy:''' the ten foulness meditations; or, body contemplation.
* '''Hating:''' the four ''brahma-viharas''; or, the four color ''kasinas''.
* '''Deluded:''' mindfulness of breath.
* '''Faithful:''' the first six recollections.
* '''Intelligent:''' recollection of marana or Nibbana; the perception of disgust of food; or, the analysis of the four elements.
* '''Speculative:''' mindfulness of breath.

The six non-color ''kasinas'' and the four formless states are suitable for all temperaments.&lt;ref name="Gunaratana 1988"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2213">'''Maimonides' rule''' is named after the 12th-century rabbinic scholar [[Maimonides]], who identified a correlation between class size and students' achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1162/003355399556061| title = Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement| journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]| volume = 114| issue = 2| pages = 533–575| year = 1999| last1 = Angrist | first1 = J. D.| last2 = Lavy | first2 = V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this rule is widely used in educational research to evaluate the effect of class size on students' test scores. Maimonides' rule states that a class size may rise to an upper limit of 40 students. Once this quota is reached the class is cut in half, so instead of one class with forty-one students there are now two classes: one with twenty students and one with twenty-one students.

[[Joshua Angrist]] and Victor Lavy (1999) have used "the nonlinear relationship between the local number of students and the class size predicted by Maimonides' rule to estimate the impact of class size on student performance, and evaluate the effect of being just below the number of students for whom an additional teacher would be brought up, and of being just above this number."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite web|last=Case|first=Anne|title=The Primacy of Education|url=http://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/WP_203.pdf|work=Working Papers|publisher=Research Program in Development Studies|accessdate=5 March 2013|format=PDF|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their results have shown highly irregular patterns in class size that are precisely mirrored in student achievement. They have found that a reduction in predicted class size of ten students is associated with a 0.25 [[standard deviation]] increase in fifth-graders' test scores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qVNLt3Cei1EC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=%22Maimonides%27+Rule%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tECKvNEKPg&amp;sig=OtoecnOlFOPvo6mEXG3OA8MEKsY&amp;hl=iw&amp;ei=PRC6SqOlEpfbjQfFjJ3_BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Maimonides%27%20Rule%22&amp;f=false Understanding poverty p.278]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1750">The '''mixed mating model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that describes the [[mating system]] of a [[plant]] [[population]] in terms of the degree of [[self-fertilisation]] present. It is a fairly simplistic model, employing several simplifying assumptions, most notably the assumption that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or [[outcrossing]] with a completely [[random]] mate. Thus the only model [[parameter]] to be [[parameter estimation|estimated]] is the [[probability]] of self-fertilisation.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A. H. D.| year = 1989 | chapter = Isozyme analysis of plant mating systems |editor1=[[Soltis, D. E.]] |editor2=[[Soltis, P. S.]] | title = Isozymes in Plant Biology | pages = 73–86 | publisher = Dioscorides Press | location = Portland|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixed mating model originated in the 1910s, with [[plant breeding|plant breeders]] who were seeking evidence of [[outcrossing]] contamination of self-pollinating [[crop]]s, but a formal description of the model and its parameter estimation was not published until 1951. The model is still in common use today, though a number of more complex models are also now in use. For example, a weakness of the model lies in its assumption that [[inbreeding]] occurs only as a result of self-fertilisation; in reality, inbreeding may also occur through outcrossing between closely related individuals. The [[effective selfing model]] relaxes this assumption by seeking also to estimate the degree of shared ancestry of outcrossing mates.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

[[File:La naumaquia-Ulpiano Checa.JPG|thumb|right|320px|Naumachia (detail): an imaginative recreation by [[Ulpiano Checa]], first exhibited in 1894.]]
The  '''naumachia''' (in [[Latin]] ''naumachia'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] ναυμαχία/''naumachía'', literally "naval combat") in the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] world referred to both the staging of [[naval warfare|naval battles]] as mass entertainment, and the basin or building in which this took place.

== Early ''naumachiae'' ==
The first known ''naumachia'' was given by [[Julius Caesar]] in Rome in 46 BC on occasion of his quadruple [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. After having a basin dug near the [[Tiber]], capable of holding actual [[bireme]]s, [[trireme]]s and [[quinquereme]]s, he made 2000 combatants and 4000 rowers, all prisoners of war, fight. In 2 BC on the occasion of the inauguration of the [[Forum of Augustus|Temple of Mars Ultor]] ("[[Mars (mythology)#Mars Ultor|Mars the Avenger]]"), Augustus gave a naumachia based on Caesar's model. As cited in Res Gestæ (§ 23), he created a basin on the right bank of the Tiber where 3000 men, not counting rowers, fought in 30 vessels with rams and a number of smaller boats.

[[Claudius]] gave a ''naumachia'' in 52 AD on a natural body of water, [[Fucine Lake]], to celebrate the completion of drainage work and tunneling on the site. The combatants were prisoners who had been condemned to death. Suetonius' account, written many years after the event, has them salute the emperor with the phrase ''"[[Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant|morituri te salutant]]"'' ("those who are about to die salute you"). There is no evidence that this form of address was used on any occasion other than this single naumachia.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is attested in  Suetonius, ''Lives'', Claudius, 21, 1214 &amp; a century later, by Cassius Dio, 60, 33, 3‑4, who referred to the same event and probably used Suetonius or a now lost common source. Suetonius gives Claudius' reply as "aut non" ("or not"), which the naumachiarii misinterpret as a general pardon, much to the fury of the emperor. See Leon, HJ, ''Morituri Te Salutamus'', Transactions of the American Philological Association, 1939, 70, 46-47: available online at Bill Thayer's website [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/70/Morituri_Te_Salutamus*.html] (accessed 1 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The naumachia was thus a bloodier show than gladiatorial combat, which consisted of smaller engagements and where the combat did not necessarily end with the death of the losers. More exactly, the appearance of naumachia is closely tied and only slightly earlier than that other spectacle, "group combat", which did not pit single combatants against one another, but rather used two small armies. There again, the combatants were frequently those on death row and did not have the specialized training of true [[gladiator|gladiators]]. Caesar, creator of the naumachia, simply had to transpose the same principle to another environment.

Through the choreography of the combat, the naumachia had the ability to represent historical or pseudo-historical themes. Each of the fleets participating represented a maritime power of [[Ancient Greece]] or the [[Hellenistic]] east: [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrians]] for Caesar’s naumachia, [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and [[Athenian Empire|Athenians]] for that of Augustus, [[History of Sicily|Sicilians]] and [[Rhodes|Rhodeans]] for that of Claudius. It required significantly greater resources than other such entertainments, and as such these spectacles were reserved for exceptional occasions, closely tied to celebrations of the emperor, his victories and his monuments. The specific nature of the spectacle as well as the historical themes borrowed from the Greek world are closely tied to the term naumachia. This word, a phonetic transcription of the Greek word for a naval battle (ναυμαχία / naumakhía), has since come to also refer to the large artificial basins created for them.

==''Naumachia'' building==
Caesar’s naumachia was probably a simple basin dug into the low-lying ground on the northern or southern banks of the Tiber, and fed by its waters; the exact location is unknown; most likely [[Trastavere]] or the [[Campus Martius]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, K. M., "Launching into History: Aquatic Displays in the Early Empire", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 83 (1993), p. 50; Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, DOI: 10.2307/300978 {{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naumachia of Augustus is better known: in his [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestæ (23)]] Augustus himself indicates that the basin measured 1800 x 1200 Roman feet (approximately 533 x 355 meters). [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 16, 200), describes an island formed in the center, probably rectangular and connected to the shore by a bridge where the privileged spectators likely sat.

Taking into consideration the size of the basin and the dimensions of a trireme (approximately 35 x 4.90 meters), the thirty vessels used would hardly be able to manoeuvre. Knowing that the crew of a Roman trireme was approximately 170 rowers and 50 to 60 soldiers, a simple calculation allows us to see that to achieve the number of 3000 men the vessels of Augustus' fleet would have to have held more combatants than an actual fleet. The spectacle thus focused less on the movement of the vessels than the actual presence of them in the artificial basin, and the hand-to-hand combat which developed.

It was different for Claudius' naumachia. The two fleets each consisted of 50 vessels, which corresponds to the number of vessels in each of the two military fleets based at [[Misenum]] and at [[Ravenna]]. Lake Fucino was large enough that only part of it was needed, surrounded by pontoons, and there was room enough for the vessels to manoeuvre and ram each other. The naumachia of Claudius therefore truly reproduced naval combat.

According to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]] in ''[[De aquaeductu]]'' (''De aquis urbis Romæ'', 11, 1-2 : opus naumachiæ), the water supply for the naumachia of Augustus was specially constructed, with the surplus used to water neighbouring gardens in the Trans Tiberim. This was the [[Aqua Alsietina]] [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]], remains of which have been found on the slopes of [[Janiculum]] (the "8th hill of Rome") below the monastery of [[San Cosimato]]. There are several theories as to the precise location of the site; the latest of which places it between [[Via Aurelia]] in the north and the church of [[San Francesco a Ripa]] in the southeast, in the loop of the Tiber. The republican viaduct discovered in the Via Aurelia near [[San Crisogono]] may also have served as a conduit for the basin. 

The basin did not last very long. During the reign of Augustus it was partly replaced (Suetonius, ''Augustus'', 43, 1)  by the ''nemus Cæsarum'' (sacred forest of the Caesars), later renamed "forest of Gaius and Lucius" for the grandsons of Augustus (Dion Cassius, 66, 25, 3). This vast area was probably built upon by the end of the 1st century.

==''Naumachiae'' in amphitheatres==
[[File:Naumachia2.gif|thumb|Old engraving.]]
A new development occurred during the reign of [[Nero]]: a naumachia in an [[amphitheatre]]. Suetonius (''Nero'', XII, 1) and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]] (''Roman History'', LXI, 9, 5) speak of such a spectacle in 57 AD in a wooden amphitheatre inaugurated by the last of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Nothing is known of the site other than that it was built on the [[Campus Martius]]. Nero presented another ''naumachia'' in 64 AD. This was preceded by hunts and followed by gladiatorial combat and a great banquet (Dio Cassius, LXII, 15, 1). It is unknown what form these games took. It was probably the same wooden amphitheatre, given that there is no mention of its destruction before the [[great fire of Rome]] which happened shortly afterwards. 

For the inauguration of the [[Colosseum]] in 80 AD, [[Titus]] gave two ''naumachiae'', one in the Augustinian basin, again using several thousand men, and the other in the new amphitheatre (Dion Cassius, LXVI, 25, 1-4). According to Suetonius (''Domitian'', IV, 6-7), [[Domitian]] organised a ''naumachia'' inside the Colosseum, undoubtedly circa 85 AD, and another one in the year 89 AD in a new basin dug beyond the Tiber; with the stone removed serving to repair the [[Circus Maximus]], which had burnt on two sides. It was probably in the time between these two ''naumachia'' that Domitian completed the network of rooms underneath the Colosseum that are visible today, at the same time precluding such spectacles in the arena. 

The arena at the Colosseum only measured 79.35 x 47.20 meters, far removed from the dimensions of the Augustinian basin. A ''naumachia'' in the Colosseum could therefore not have been as grand as the previous ones. One can imagine a confrontation between the crews of several reproductions of warships, potentially life-size or reasonably close to it, but actual maneuvers or even floating seems doubtful. It is known that stage-props were used to represent ships, sometimes with mechanisms to simulate shipwrecks, both on stage and in the arena ([[Tacitus]], ''Annales'', XIV, 6, 1 ; Dion Cassius LXI, 12,2).

==Water in the amphitheatres==
The use of enough water to float vessels in amphitheatres raises technical questions. Amphitheatres were not exclusively used for ''naumachiae''; they would have been filled and drained rapidly enough for use in gladiatorial combats and other spectacles. The rapid transition between water shows and earth-based shows seems to have been one of the great attractions. Dion Cassius underscores this as it relates to Nero's ''naumachia'' (LXI, 9, 5); [[Martial]] does as well speaking of Titus' ''naumachia'' in the Colosseum (''Book of Spectacles'', XXIV). The only surviving written sources offer no descriptions of the mechanisms or engineering involved. Archaeology provides no clues: the basement of the Colosseum has since been modified. Only two provincial amphitheatres, those at [[Verona]] and [[Amphitheatre of Mérida|Mérida, Spain]], provide any technical evidence.

The central pit of the Verona amphitheatre was deeper than the rooms normally found underneath the arena, and served as a basin. It was connected to two axial conduits. One, circulating under the West gallery of the arena, was not connected to the drainage system and had to be connected to an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] in order to fill the basin. The East conduit was deeper and designed to drain water into the [[Adige River]]. The basin at the Mérida amphitheatre, at only 1.5 meters, was shallower than that at Verona. Because it is so shallow—less than the height of a standing man—it cannot be confused with an underground service room. This basin was equipped with access stairs and covered with material similar to that used for swimming pools and [[Roman baths]]. It was also served by two conduits, the western one of which connected to the nearby San Lazaro aqueduct.

The dimensions of these basins rule out any but the most basic of ''naumachiae'': the one at Mérida measures a mere 18.5 x 3.7 meters. Only the most modest of water spectacles could have taken place here. This leads one to conclude that, even assuming that the Colosseum had a similar basin before construction of the ''[[hypogeum]]'' (underground complex), ''naumachiae'' would have been performed on only a shallow layer of water covering the surface of the arena, the minimum required to float the ships.

== Decline of Roman ''naumachia'' ==
The introduction of new technologies initially led to an increased number of ''naumachia''. The first three ''naumachia'' were spaced about 50 years apart; the following six, most of which took place in amphitheatres, occurred in a space of 30 years. Less costly in material and human terms, they could afford to be staged more frequently. Less grandiose, they became a feature of the games, but could not be considered exceptional.  The [[iconography]] bears witness to this. Of some twenty representations of a ''naumachia'' in [[Roman art]], nearly all are of the [[Pompeian Styles#Fourth Style|Fourth Style]], of the time of [[Nero]] and the [[Flavian dynasty]].

After the Flavian period, ''naumachiae'' disappear from the texts almost completely.  Apart from a mention in the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a late source of limited reliability, only the town records (''fastia'') of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]] tells us that in 109 [[Trajan]] inaugurated a ''naumachia'' basin. This site was discovered in the 18th century on the grounds of the  [[Vatican City]], behind the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].  Subsequent digs have revealed the complete site plan.  It had [[bleacher]]s (tiered stands for spectators) and the surface was about one sixth the size of the Augustan ''naumachia''.  In the absence of any texts, it has to be assumed that it was only used at the time of Trajan.

Nevertheless, if late Roman Empire sources and persistence into the [[Middle Ages]] in terms of the [[toponymy]] of ''naumachia'' and ''dalmachia'' at the site are taken into consideration, it still existed into the 5th century.  Moreover, the presence of bleachers on its perimeter is a strong indicator of regular shows. According to the Ostia municipal records, the inauguration involved 127 pairs of gladiators; leading one to believe that as in the amphitheatre, the restrictive space at Trajan's basin was not conducive to large combats involving many untrained prisoners, or would have required over-simplification of naval combats, leading to a preference for single combat.  In this form, and with a dedicated site, ''naumachiae'' could easily have continued (though likely at a reducing frequency) for several centuries without mention in sources, as they would not have been particularly worthy of mention: they simply lost their grandeur and impressive character.

In the provinces, the influence of Roman ''naumachiae'' is easily discernible, but limited and reduced to local and innocuous naval games and re-enactments. A competition which went under the name of ''naumaciva'' was part of the [[Panathenaic Games]] between the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Ephebos]] from the Flavian period onward. It replaced the [[regatta]]s which had taken place at these games earlier.  If [[Ausonius]] is to be believed, (Moselle, 200-2,29), a ''naumachia'' was held on the [[Moselle River]] between local youth.

== Post-Roman ''naumachiae'' ==
[[File:Milan Naumanchia, 1807.jpeg|thumb|right|A modern naumachia held in the Civic Arena of Milan in 1807]]
A ''naumachia'' was performed for [[Henry II of France]] in [[Rouen]] in 1550. Another was held in [[Milan]] for [[Napoleon]] in 1807.

[[Parc Monceau]] in [[Paris]] features a ''naumachia'' water feature, surrounded by a colonnade. In 18th and 19th century England, several parks featured mock naval battles with model ships, which were also referred to as ''naumachia''. [[Peasholm Park]] in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], England, still stages such an event. Smaller, theatre-based [[aqua drama]]s were also popular. 

New York artist [[Duke Riley]] staged a naumachia in 2009 at the [[Queens Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;In Queens, a Battle on the Low Seas, and May the Best Artist Win, New York Times, Libby Nelson, Aug. 14, 2009 [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/arts/design/15duke.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neeti Saara''' or '''Neeti Sastra''' is a popular collection of morals written by Baddena, a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] poet. Baddena (1220-1280? AD)  is the composer of the most famous [[Sumathi Satakam]] as well as Niti Sastra. Complete details about his origin are not known. But, He was believed to be a Chola prince and was called as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Samanta Raju (vassal) under the Kakateeya [[Rudrama Devi]] (reign: 1262-1296 AD) during the thirteenth century.
In the post mauryan age, kamandhaka wrote 'neetisara' based on kautilya's artha shastra and serves as an important literary source of guptan age.

==Popular verses from Neeti Sastra==
1. I shall expound Nitisara (essence of maxims on right conduct) compiled from all scriptures, bowing down to Vishnu, the lord of the universe.

2. Listen to the complete essence of dharma (right action) and contemplate on it. “Do not do unto others what one would not like others to do unto oneself”.

3. Do not act without examining the situation carefully; one ought to act only after scrutinizing the situation carefully. Otherwise, one will have to grieve like the brahmani (Brahman woman) who killed the mongoose ([[Neeti_Sastra#References|1]]).

4. Man is bound to experience the fruits of his good and bad actions. The karma does not diminish even after billions of days of Brahma (2) unless one experiences fruits of karma.

5. One cannot earn or retain wealth without undergoing suffering. There is suffering in earning wealth as well as in spending it. Is not wealth the home of suffering?

6. Only a learned person can understand the hardship borne by another learned person to earn knowledge just as a barren woman cannot understand the severe pain endured by a pregnant woman.

7. The parents who do not educate a child are his enemies since he is humiliated in an assembly of learned men like a crane among swans.

8. Onion does not lose its smell even if it is planted in a basin of [[Camphor]], tended using musk and watered using the dew from rose petals.

9. A student acquires quarter of knowledge from the teacher, a quarter from self study, a quarter from class mates and the final quarter in course of time.

10. When a girl is getting married, the father of the girl looks for education in the bride groom; the mother for wealth, the kith and kin for family reputation and the girl for beauty.

11. A scorpion has poison in its tail. A bee has poison in its head. [[Takshaka]] has poison in its teeth. An evil person has poison in all his limbs.

12. Sky is the strength of birds, water the strength of fish; king the strength of the weak and wailing the strength of babies.

13. Renounce that wife who is quarrelsome, steals money, faithless and speaks ill of her husband, eats before feeding her husband or children and visits others‟ houses, even if she is the mother of ten sons.

14. An ideal wife will have these six virtues – she will be like a counselor in dealing with various situations, like a maid servant in serving her husband, like Goddess [[Lakshmi]] in beauty, like the earth in patience, like a mother in giving love and be like a [[Courtesan]] in bedroom.

15. Keep aloof from a horse that is drenched in water, mad elephant, bull that is maddened with lust and an uncultured man who is educated.

16. Helping an evil person will cause harm to one even as feeding milk to a snake will only increase its poison.

17. The fruit of giving charity to a knower of Truth (Brahma Jnani) multiplies like an arrow, shot by Arjuna that turns into ten arrows when he takes aim, hundred when he shoots them, thousand on the way and a shower of arrows when they hit the target.

18. Even God does not know about the leaps of a horse, roaring of clouds, minds of women, destiny of man, lack of rain or excess of rain. Then how can a man know these?

19. Attainment of wealth by an incompetent person, knowledge by a man of ignoble descent, a woman by undeserving person, etc. are in vain like the rainfall on a mountain.

20. Win the whole world by truth, sorrow by charity, elders by service and the enemies by archery.

21. Jati (jasmine) among flowers, [[Vishnu]] among men, [[Rambha (actress)|Rambha]] among women, Kanchi among cities, Ganges among rivers, [[Rama]] among kings, Magha among poetic compositions and Kalidasa among poets excel the others.

22. He who gives birth, takes one to the Guru, imparts knowledge, gives food and protects one from fear – these five are equal to father.

23. The wives of teacher, king and elder brother, the mother-in-law and the mother who gave birth – these five are mothers.

24. Keep a distance of 5 hasta3 (cubits) from a vehicle, ten cubits from a horse and 1000 cubits from an elephant. Keep as much away as possible from an evil person.

25. In childhood, a woman is protected by her father, by her husband in her youth and by her sons in her old age. A woman should never be left alone to fend for herself.

26. The snake and the wicked person are both dangerous. The poison of a snake can be neutralized by mantra or medicine while there is no mantra or medicine that can remove the poison of a wicked person.

27. Longevity, deeds, prosperity, knowledge and death of a person are decided even while he is in the mother‟s womb.

28. Ordinary poison is insignificant when compared to the poison of the sin of usurping the property of a Brahmin (one who is virtuous). Poison kills only one person while the sin of usurping the property of a Brahmin destroys three generations (oneself, one‟s children and grand children).

29. Having two wives in spite of being poor, building a house on a road, doing cultivation in two different places, becoming a witness or bail in a lawsuit are the five self-sought misfortunes.

30. Seeing the elephants, snakes and birds in bondage, the eclipse of the sun and the moon and the poverty of the wise men I conclude that destiny is inevitable.

31. Those who are uneducated do not shine even if they are endowed with beauty and youth and are born in renowned families just like kimsuka (4) flowers which are beautiful but odourless.

32. Those who have one wife, three sons, and two ploughs, six cows and a house in the centre of a country are immensely fortunate.

33. Clothing is the prime requisite for decorations, ghee is the foremost requisite for food, virtue is the foremost requisite for women and knowledge is the chief requisite of scholars.

34. Ant-hill, honey in a honey-comb, moon in bright half of the month, wealth of the king and food received by begging, grow gradually.

35. Truth is my mother, knowledge is my father, righteousness is my brother, compassion is my friend, peace is my wife and patience is my son. These six are my kith and kin.

36. The Sun sets daily taking away a part of one's longevity. Knowing this, one should reflect daily what righteous action one has performed.

37. Speaking sweet words to the wicked is like offering a garland of exquisite flowers into the hands of a monkey.

38. Morning Sun, smoke from funeral pyre, coitus with old woman, muddy water and eating curd-rice at night increase ill health day by day.

39. Setting Sun, smoke from Homa (sacrificial pyre), coitus with young woman, pure water and eating milk rice at night increase longevity day by day.

40. One's wealth and properties remain at one's home, sons and relatives take leave at cremation ground. It is one's good and evil actions that accompany oneself after death.

41. Righteousness prevails and not unrighteousness. Truth prevails and not untruth. Patience prevails and not anger. Gods prevail and not demons.

42. Stocking grains, taking care of calves, doing cultivation oneself, serving one's elders – these five habits foster one's family.

43. Treat the child like a prince till the age of 5, like a servant till the age of 15. When the son reaches the age of 16, treat him like a friend.

44. Even a wise man perishes by teaching a fool, contact with evil woman and by resorting to the company of the wicked.

45. Save wealth for difficult times; how can the wealthy have difficulties? If one squanders wealth, one will eventually lose all the accumulated wealth.

46. One's physical body, wealth and other resources are transitory. Death is always at hand. Knowing this, a wise man should strive to do righteous actions.

47. One who plants a holy fig tree, a neem tree, an Indian fig tree, ten tamarind trees; three trees each of pomegranate, wood-apple and Emblic Myrobalan and five trees each of mango and coconut will not suffer Hell.

48. Will Neem ever acquire sweetness even if it is grown on top of a mountain of molasses and watered thousands of times with milk?

49. One who is beneficial is a kinsman though he is a stranger. One who is harmful is an enemy though he is a kinsman. When one is seriously sick, herbs from distant forest are used as medicine.

50. The knowledge confined to books, wealth that is in the custody of others and a son who has gone to foreign countries are useful in name only.

51. Company of wife is as good as the treatment given by ten physicians. Sun is ten times beneficial than the care given by wife. Mother is ten times beneficial compared to the Sun. Yellow Myrobalan is ten times beneficial than the mother.

52. Even a virtuous person perishes due to association with the wicked just as the swans that gave refuge to the crows perished because of the evil deeds committed by the crows.

53. The characteristics of the wicked persons and phlegm are surprisingly similar. Both of these are agitated by sweetness and are pacified by bitterness. (Phlegm is agitated by sweet food and is pacified by bitter food while the wicked person is agitated by sweet words and is pacified by bitter words).

54. Enmity comes to an end by death. Youth ends with pregnancy. Anger comes to an end by bowing down. Pride comes to an end by begging before others.

55. He, who renovates or helps to regain the glory of fallen family, abandoned well or lake, dethroned king, refugee, cows, temples and wise men, attains fourfold merit.

56. Profession of an artist or writer is the highest. That of cultivation and trade is mediocre, that of a servant is the lowest and that of a porter is lower than the lowest.

57. A bee pursues fragrance. Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth pursues a tactful person, water pursues depth. Fate follows intelligence.

58. The following give better results when they are beaten: the wicked, gold, drum, stubborn horse, unchaste woman, sugar-cane, sesamum and uncultured person.

59. I bow down before these six persons – one who gives pure food, one who performs agnihotra (daily fire ritual) everyday, a knower of Vedanta, one who has seen one thousands full moons, one who fasts every month and a chaste woman.

60. Flees desire wounds, kings desire wealth, the wicked persons desire to quarrel and the wise men desire to have peace.

61. The sun stone shines by the mere presence of the Sun. In the same manner, knowledge shines in a disciple by the mere presence of the teacher.

62. One who does not do any charity is in fact a man of renunciation since he leaves behind all his wealth when he dies and goes to the other world empty-handed. I consider the person who does charity as a miser because when he dies he takes with him the fruits of his charity.

63. He is a wise man who sees the wives of others as his mother, the wealth of others like clod of earth and all beings as his own self.

64. Though the blue water lily, lotus, fish and white water lily are born in water, they have different odours.

65. The wealth that is not used for the gods, wise men, relatives or for oneself is destroyed by water, enemy, king and thieves.

66. One, who decides the course of action after intelligent contemplation when confronted with difficult situations, loss of wealth or life-threatening incidents, laughs at the lord of death.

67. The fruit of giving cloth in charity is attainment of kingdom; that of footwear is attainment of vehicle; that of Tamboolam (5) is enjoyment of pleasure. One gains all the above by giving food to the poor.

68. The virtue of cuckoo is voice; the virtue of women is chastity; virtue of Brahmin is knowledge and that of ascetics is patience.

69. The following three are the characteristics of a wicked person: lotus like face, speech as cool as sandal wood and a heart burning with fire (of evil thoughts).

70. Just as a coconut tree bears the weight of coconuts on its head and gives nectarine water throughout its life in return for a little water that was given to it during the first year, a saintly person never forgets the help that he had received.

71. Saints live to serve others just as a river flows, the trees bear fruits and the plants grow not for themselves but for others.

72. One should receive knowledge from a Brahmin (wise man), food at the hands of mother, betal leaves (tamboolam) from one's wife and bracelet (recognition) from the king.

73. Moon is cool. Sandal wood is cooler than the moon. The words of virtuous persons are cooler than moon and sandalwood.

74. Elephant shines by the rut (6), sky by rain clouds, woman by character, horse by speed, temple by regular festivals, speech by grammatical correctness, rivers by swan couples, an assembly by the presence of
scholars, a family by virtuous son, earth by king and the three worlds by the Sun.

75. One who is jealous, one who speaks untruth, one who is ungrateful and one who carries enmity for a long time – these four are karmachandalas (7)

76. Protect your fame by giving up life. Life is transitory while fame will exist as long as the moon and the stars exist.

77. One who has received knowledge despises the teacher; one who is married, despises the mother; the woman who has given birth to a child, despises the husband; one who has recovered from disease despises the physician.

78. One who wears fragrant flowers on head, keeps the feet always clean, associates with beautiful women, eats food in small quantities, does not sleep on bare ground and does not have union with women on new moon days regains the wealth that was lost previously.

79. The wicked, if they are educated, start arguing unnecessarily; become arrogant if they are rich; if they become powerful, they start tormenting others. At the same time the virtuous persons utilize education, wealth and power for knowledge, charity and protection of others.

80. The following four are the doors to destruction: doing improper actions, opposing groups of people, quarreling with powerful persons and believing in the words of women.

81. One ought to ask the following questions repeatedly before beginning any new venture: What is the ideal time? Who are my friends? What is the ideal place? What are my income and expense? Who am I? What is my strength?

82. One ought to learn one lesson each from lion and crane, four lessons from domestic fowl, five lessons from crow, six lessons from dog and three lessons from donkey.

83. One ought to learn the following virtue from lion: Once a work is begun, one must put maximum effort to complete it whether that work is big or small.

84. A wise man ought to perform his duties knowing the time, place and strength and also having controlled all the senses like a crane.

85. One ought to learn from dog the virtues of getting up early in the morning, fighting, sharing food with near and dear ones and toiling for one's livelihood.

86. One ought to learn from a crow, five virtues of copulating secretly, valour, stocking food, etc. for bad times, impeccability and not believing in anyone.

87. One ought to learn from a dog six virtues: To eat in large quantities when food is available, to be content with even small quantities of food, to have deep sleep, to awaken easily, devotion to master and valour.

88. One ought to learn from a donkey the virtues of carrying load even when one is tired, not caring about heat and cold and always being content.

89. That person who cultivates these twenty virtues, will attain success in all his ventures.

90. Physicians, astrologers and sorcerers received with respect and offered food by everyone while those who have mastered other science do not get even a glass of water.

91. Knowledge is lost by laziness; women are lost when they are in the custody of others; cultivation fails when the quantity of seeds sown is very less; an army without a commander is lost too.

92. Though the Ketaki creeper is infested with snakes; does not bear fruits; is thorny, crooked (winding) and grows in muddy places and is thus not easily accessible, it is liked by all due to the fragrance of its flower. A single virtue nullifies all defects.

93. Fire is the guru of twice-born (those who undertake Vedic studies); Brahmin is the guru of other castes; Husband is the guru of women; A guest is the guru for everyone.

94. Of what use is nobility of family if a person is illiterate? A learned man is respected by Gods too though he does not belong to a noble family.

95. One can acquire knowledge by serving the guru or by offering sufficient wealth in return for the knowledge or by exchanging one branch of knowledge for another. There is no means other than these three to acquire knowledge.

96. Just as a pot is filled continuously falling water drops, knowledge, dharma (virtue) and wealth too increase gradually if one pursues them persistently.

97. One ought to learn both the art of fighting with weapons and knowledge of various arts and sciences. The former is scorned in old age while the latter is always respected. 

98. Knowledge is like Kamadhenu, the wishfulfilling cow. Knowledge protects one like a mother when one is in foreign lands. Therefore, knowledge is considered as 'hidden wealth'.

99. Knowledge without application is poison; Food undigested is poison; Assembly is poison for the poor; Young woman is poison for an old man.

100. One's friend during foreign journey is knowledge; wife is friend to one who is at home; medicine is the friend of those who are sick; fruit of good deeds is the friend of the departed soul.

101. Knowledge is extolled by everyone; knowledge is considered great everywhere; one can attain everything with the help of knowledge; a wise man is respected everywhere.

102. A king can never be considered equal to a wise man. King is respected only in his kingdom whereas the wise man is respected everywhere.

103. The life of one who is ignorant is meaningless like the tail of a dog which is of no use in hiding the secret parts or in chasing away the flies that bite the dog.

104. A student who serves the guru attains knowledge just as one who digs the earth gets water from the bottom of the earth.

105. One ought to make each day fruitful by studying at a verse or a part of it; one must spend time in studies, meditation and in doing one's duty.

106. The wise men spend their time enjoying literary works, reading or listening to scriptures while the fools waste their time in grief, sleep or quarrel.

107. An only son who is educated and virtuous brings joy to the whole family happy just as a single moon brings light at night.

108. Ambrosia should be obtained even from poison; gold must be taken even if it lies in filth; knowledge has to be received even from a person of lower social status; a woman of beauty and character should be accepted even if she is from a fallen family.

109. One ought to give one's daughter in marriage into a noble family; One's son must be given proper education; One's enemy must be made to grieve and guide one's dear ones on the path of righteousness.

110. What is impossible for those who are competent? Does distance matter to those who are industrious? Which is foreign land for the learned persons? Who is a stranger for those who talk sweetly?

111. One who is free from modesty attains success and happiness in following matters: In acquiring wealth, grains and knowledge, while eating food and doing business deals.

112. The following are the qualities of a student: eyesight similar to that of a crow, concentration similar to that of a crane, light sleep similar to that of a dog, small quantity of food and simple cloths.

113. The fruit of acquiring a kingdom is that everyone will obey one‟s commands; the fruit of austerity is Brahmacharya (celibacy and study of Vedas); the fruit of education is knowledge; the fruit of wealth is enjoyment and charity.

114. Anger is like the lord of death; greed is like the river Vaitarani (which is very difficult to cross over); knowledge is like Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow; contentment is like the Nandana garden (which is in Heaven).

115. Virtues adorn beauty; character adorns family; success in work adorns knowledge; enjoyment adorns wealth.

116. Beauty is in vain if one has no virtues; family reputation is of no value for one who has no character; knowledge that doesn't give success is in vain; wealth that is not used for enjoyment is also in vain.

117. Wake from sleep the 7 persons mentioned below: student, servant, traveler, a hungry person, a person struck with fear, a porter and watchman.

She came to know later that the mongoose had in fact saved the child by killing a snake that was about to bite the child. Thus, she had to grieve on account of her thoughtless action.

2 A kalpa is equal to a day of [[Brahma]] the creator. This is equal to 1000 yugas or 432 million human years.

Pairwise Stone spaces are a bitopological version of the [[Stone space]]s.

Pairwise Stone spaces are closely related to [[spectral space]]s.

A '''plot''' is a [[graphical technique]] for representing a [[data set]], usually as a [[Graph of a function|graph]] showing the relationship between two or more variables. The plot can be drawn by hand or by a mechanical or electronic [[plotter]]. Graphs are a visual representation of the relationship between variables, very useful for humans who can quickly derive an understanding which would not come from lists of values. Graphs can also be used to read off the value of an unknown variable plotted as a function of a known one. Graphs of functions are used in [[mathematics]], [[science]]s, [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[finance]], and other areas.

== Overview ==
Plots play an important role in [[statistics]] and [[data analysis]]. The procedures here can broadly be split into two parts: quantitative and graphical. Quantitative techniques are the set of statistical procedures that yield numeric or tabular output. Examples of quantitative techniques include:&lt;ref name="NIST03"&gt;NIST/SEMATECH (2003). [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda15.htm "The Role of Graphics"]. In: ''e-Handbook of Statistical Methods'' 6 January 2003 (Date created).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[hypothesis]] testing
* [[Regression analysis|analysis of variance]]
* point estimates and [[confidence interval]]s
* [[least squares regression]]
These and similar techniques are all valuable and are mainstream in terms of classical analysis. There are also many statistical tools generally referred to as graphical techniques. These include:&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;
* [[scatter plot]]s
* [[spectrum]] plots
* [[histogram]]s
* [[probability plot]]s
* residual plots
* [[box plot]]s, and
* block plots

Graphical procedures such as plots are a short path to gaining insight into a data set in terms of testing assumptions, model selection, model validation, estimator selection, relationship identification, factor effect determination, outlier detection. Statistical graphics give insight into aspects of the underlying structure of the data.&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;

Graphs can also be used to solve some [[mathematical equations]], typically by finding where two plots [[Line-line intersection|intersect]].

== Types of Plots ==
* [[Biplot]] : These are a type of graph used in statistics. A biplot allows information on both samples and variables of a data matrix to be displayed graphically. Samples are displayed as points while variables are displayed either as vectors, linear axes or nonlinear trajectories. In the case of categorical variables, category level points may be used to represent the levels of a categorical variable. A generalised biplot displays information on both continuous and categorical variables.
* [[Bland-Altman plot]] : In analytical chemistry and biostatistics this plot is a method of [[data]] plotting used in analysing the agreement between two different [[assay]]s. It is identical to a [[Tukey mean-difference plot]], which is what it is still known as in other fields, but was popularised in medical statistics by Bland and Altman.&lt;ref name="Altman1983"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altman DG, Bland JM |title=Measurement in medicine: the analysis of method comparison studies |journal=The Statistician |volume=32 |year=1983 |pages=307–317 |doi=10.2307/2987937 |issue=3 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=2987937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bland1986"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bland JM, Altman DG |title=Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement |journal=Lancet |volume=1 | year=1986 |issue=8476 |pages=307–10 |pmid=2868172|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)90837-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bode plot]]s are used in [[control theory]].
* [[Box plot]] : In descriptive statistics, a boxplot, also known as a box-and-whisker diagram or plot, is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their [[five-number summary|five-number summaries]] (the smallest observation, lower quartile (Q1), median (Q2), upper quartile (Q3), and largest observation). A boxplot may also indicate which observations, if any, might be considered outliers.
* [[Carpet plot]] : A two-dimensional plot that illustrates the interaction between two and three independent variables and one to three dependent variables.
* [[Comet plot]] : A two- or three-dimensional animated plot in which the data points are traced on the screen. 
* [[Contour plot]] : A two-dimensional plot which shows the one-dimensional curves, called [[contour line]]s on which the plotted quantity q is a constant. Optionally, the plotted values can be color-coded.
* [[Dalitz plot]] : This a [[scatterplot]] often used in particle physics to represent the relative frequency of various (kinematically distinct) manners in which the products of certain (otherwise similar) three-body decays may move apart

&lt;/gallery&gt;

* [[Funnel plot]] : This is a useful graph designed to check the existence of publication bias in meta-analyses. Funnel plots, introduced by Light and Pillemer in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |author1=R. J. Light |author2=D. B. Pillemer | title = Summing up: The Science of Reviewing Research | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1984 | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed in detail by [[Matthias Egger|Egger]] and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Matthias Egger|M. Egger]], [[George Davey Smith|G. Davey Smith]], M. Schneider &amp; C. Minder | title = Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 315 | issue = 7109 | pages = 629–634|date=September 1997 | pmid = 9310563 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/315/7109/629 | pmc = 2127453 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.315.7109.629}}&lt;/ref&gt; are useful adjuncts to meta-analyses. A funnel plot is a [[scatterplot]] of treatment effect against a measure of study size. It is used primarily as a visual aid to detecting bias or [[Study heterogeneity|systematic heterogeneity]].
* [[Dot plot (statistics)]] : A ''dot chart'' or ''dot plot'' is a [[statistics|statistical]] chart consisting of group of data points plotted on a simple scale. Dot plots are used for [[continuous function|continuous]], [[quantitative data|quantitative]], [[univariate]] data. Data points may be labelled if there are few of them. Dot plots are one of the simplest plots available, and are suitable for small to moderate sized data sets. They are useful for highlighting clusters and gaps, as well as [[outlier]]s.
* [[Forest plot]] : is a graphical display that shows the strength of the evidence in quantitative scientific studies. It was developed for use in medical research as a means of graphically representing a [[meta-analysis]] of the results of [[randomized controlled trials]]. In the last twenty years, similar meta-analytical techniques have been applied in observational studies (e.g. [[environmental epidemiology]]) and forest plots are often used in presenting the results of such studies also.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* [[Galbraith plot]] : In statistics, a Galbraith plot (also known as Galbraith's radial plot or just radial plot), is one way of displaying several estimates of the same quantity that have different [[standard error]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last= Galbraith |first= Rex|year= 1988 |title= Graphical display of estimates having differing standard errors|journal=Technometrics
 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=271–281 |doi= 10.2307/1270081 |publisher= American Society for Quality |jstor= 1270081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to examine heterogeneity in a meta-analysis, as an alternative or supplement to a [[forest plot]].
* [[Heat map]]
* [[Nichols plot]] : This is a graph used in [[signal processing]] in which the [[logarithm]] of the magnitude is plotted against the phase of a [[frequency response]] on orthogonal axes.
* [[Normal probability plot]] : The normal probability plot is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a [[data set]] is approximately [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. The data are plotted against a theoretical normal distribution in such a way that the points should form an approximate straight line. Departures from this straight line indicate departures from normality. The normal probability plot is a special case of the [[probability plot]].
* [[Nyquist plot]] : Plot is used in [[automatic control]] and [[signal processing]] for assessing the stability of a system with [[feedback]]. It is represented by a graph in polar coordinates in which the gain and phase of a frequency response are plotted. The plot of these phasor quantities shows the phase as the angle and the magnitude as the distance from the origin.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* [[Partial regression plot]] : In applied statistics, a partial regression plot attempts to show the effect of adding another variable to the model (given that one or more independent variables are already in the model). Partial regression plots are also referred to as added variable plots, adjusted variable plots, and individual coefficient plots.
* [[Partial residual plot]] : In applied statistics, a partial residual plot is a graphical technique that attempts to show the relationship between a given independent variable and the response variable given that other independent variables are also in the model.
* [[Probability plot]] : The probability plot is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a [[data set]] follows a given distribution such as the [[normal distribution|normal]] or [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]], and for visually estimating the [[location parameter|location]] and [[scale parameter]]s of the chosen distribution. The data are plotted against a theoretical distribution in such a way that the points should form approximately a straight line. Departures from this straight line indicate departures from the specified distribution.
* [[Q-Q plot]] : In statistics, a Q-Q plot (Q stands for [[quantile]]) is a graphical method for diagnosing differences between the [[probability distribution]] of a [[statistical population]] from which a [[random sample]] has been taken and a comparison distribution. An example of the kind of differences that can be tested for is [[normal distribution|non-normality]] of the population distribution.
* [[Recurrence plot]] : In descriptive statistics and chaos theory, a recurrence plot (RP) is a plot showing, for a given moment in time, the times at which a [[phase space]]. In other words, it is a graph of

::&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(i)\approx \vec{x}(j),\,&lt;/math&gt;

:showing &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; on a horizontal axis and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on a vertical axis, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[phase space]] trajectory.
* [[Scatterplot]] : A scatter graph or scatter plot is a type of display using [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] for a set of data. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;Utts, Jessica M. ''Seeing Through Statistics'' 3rd Edition, Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005, pp 166–167. {{isbn|0-534-39402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shmoo plot]] : In electrical engineering, a shmoo plot is a graphical display of the response of a component or system varying over a range of conditions and inputs. Often used to represent the results of the testing of complex electronic systems such as computers, ASICs or microprocessors. The plot usually shows the range of conditions in which the [[device under test]] will operate.
* [[Spaghetti plots]] are a method of viewing data to visualize possible flows through systems.  Flows depicted in this manner appear like noodles, hence the coining of this term.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ev54lAwS2KIC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=spaghetti+diagram+book#v=onepage&amp;q=spaghetti%20diagram%20book&amp;f=false|author=Theodore T. Allen|page=128|publisher=Springer|year=2010|accessdate=2011-02-17|title=Introduction to Engineering Statistics and Lean Sigma: Statistical Quality Control and Design of Experiments and Systems|isbn=978-1-84882-999-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of statistics was first used to track routing through factories.  Visualizing flow in this manner can reduce inefficiency within the flow of a system.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* [[Stemplot]] : A stemplot (or stem-and-leaf plot), in statistics, is a device for presenting quantitative data in a graphical format, similar to a [[histogram]], to assist in visualizing the [[shape]] of a [[probability distribution|distribution]]. They evolved from [[Arthur Bowley]]'s work in the early 1900s, and are useful tools in [[exploratory data analysis]]. Unlike histograms, stemplots retain the original data to at least two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and [[non-parametric statistics]].
* [[Star plot]] : A graphical method of displaying multivariate data. Each star represents a single observation. Typically, star plots are generated in a multi-plot format with many stars on each page and each star representing one observation.
* [[Surface plot]] : In this type of graph, a surface is plotted to fit a set of data triplets (X,Y,Z), where Z if obtained by the function to be plotted Z=f(X,Y). Usually, the set of X and Y values are equally spaced. Optionally, the plotted values can be color-coded.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:MER Star Plot.gif|[[Star plot]]
File:Surface-plot.jpg|[[Surface plot]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* [[Ternary plot]] A ternary plot, ternary graph, triangle plot, simplex plot, or de Finetti diagram is a [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric]] plot on three variables which sum to a constant. It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an [[equilateral]] [[triangle]]. It is used in [[petrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[metallurgy]], and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In [[population genetics]], it is often called a [[de Finetti diagram]].  In [[game theory]], it is often called a ''simplex plot''.
* [[Vector field]] : Vector field plots (or quiver plots) show the direction and the strength of a vector associated with a 2D or 3D points. They are typically used to show the strength of the [[gradient]] over the plane or a surface area. 
* [[Violin plot]] : Violin plots are a method of plotting numeric data. They are similar to [[box plot]]s, except that they also show the [[Probability density function|probability density]] of the data at different values (in the simplest case this could be a [[histogram]]). Typically violin plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots.  Overlaid on this box plot is a [[kernel density estimation]]. Violin plots are available as extensions to a number of software packages, including R through the vioplot library, and Stata through the vioplot add-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hintze Jerry L. |author2=Nelson Ray D. | year = 1998 | title = Violin Plots: A Box Plot-Density Trace Synergism | url = | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 181–84 | doi=10.1080/00031305.1998.10480559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Plots for Specific Quantities ===
* [[Arrhenius plot]] : This plot compares the logarithm of a reaction rate (&lt;math&gt;\ln(k)&lt;/math&gt;, [[ordinate]] axis) plotted against inverse temperature (&lt;math&gt;1/T&lt;/math&gt;, [[abscissa]]). Arrhenius plots are often used to analyze the effect of temperature on the rates of chemical reactions.
* [[Dot plot (bioinformatics)]] : This plot compares two biological sequences and is a graphical method that allows the identification of regions of close similarity between them. It is a kind of [[recurrence plot]].
* [[Lineweaver–Burk plot]] : This plot compares the reciprocals of reaction rate and substrate concentration. It is used to represent and determine [[enzyme kinetics]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Examples ==
Types of graphs and their uses vary very widely. A few typical examples are:
* Simple graph: [[Supply and demand]] curves, simple graphs used in economics to relate supply and demand to price. The graphs can be used together to determine the [[economic equilibrium]] (essentially, to solve an equation).
* Simple graph used for reading values: the bell-shaped [[Normal distribution|normal or Gaussian probability distribution]], from which, for example,  the probability of a man's height being in a specified range can be derived, given data for the adult male population.
* Very complex graph: the [[Psychrometric chart#Psychrometric charts|psychrometric chart]], relating temperature, pressure, humidity, and other quantities.
* Non-rectangular coordinates: the above all use two-dimensional [[rectangular coordinates]]; an example of a graph using [[polar coordinates]], sometimes in three dimensions, is the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[radiation pattern]] chart, which represents the power radiated in all directions by an antenna of specified type.

'''Preconditioning''' occurs when an animal is exposed to a [[stressor]] or [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] in order to prepare it for a later encounter with a similar stressor or stimulus. 

For example, in [[vaccination]]s, a human is exposed to an artificially weakened [[virus]] in order to stimulate the body's [[immune system]] to produce [[antibodies]] that fight the virus. Then, when the live virus is encountered, the body can vigorously defend against it, already having produced the relevant antibodies. See [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]].

The '''protocol relating to the status of refugees''' of 1967 broadens the definition of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] of 1951. The main point of the protocol was to "grant all refugees the same status irrespective of the effective date of the 1st of January 1951."

The protocol was completed on the 31st of January 1967 in [[New York City]]. Switzerland ratified the protocol on the 20th of May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Publications from Switzerland: [https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19670017/201209280000/0.142.301.pdf ''Protokoll über die Rechtsstellung der Flüchtlinge''] (PDF) von 1968, Stand: 28.

'''Religious terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] carried out based on motivations and goals that may have a predominantly religious character or influence.

In the modern age, after the decline of ideas such as the [[divine right of kings]] and with the rise of [[nationalism]], terrorism has more often been based on [[anarchism]], and [[revolutionary]] politics. Since 1980, however, there has been an increase in terrorist activity motivated by [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Bruce|title=The Confluence of International and Domestic Trends in Terrorism|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–15|date=Summer 1997|doi=10.1080/09546559708427399}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=Hoffman1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Bruce|title=Inside Terrorism|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185–99}}

Former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Warren Christopher]] has said that terrorist acts in the name of ''religion and ethnic identity'' have become "one of the most important security challenges we face in the wake of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name=Juerg&gt;{{cite book|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=0-520-24011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}  However, the political scientists [[Robert Pape]] and [[Terry Nardin]],&lt;ref name=Nardin/&gt; the social psychologists M. Brooke Rogers and colleagues,&lt;ref name=RogersEtAl&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = M. Brooke | display-authors = etal   | date = Jun 2007 | title = The Role of Religious Fundamentalism in Terrorist Violence: A Social Psychological Analysis | url = | journal = Int Rev Psychiatry | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 253–62 | doi = 10.1080/09540260701349399 | pmid = 17566903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sociologist and religious studies scholar [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] have all argued that religion should only be considered one incidental factor and that such terrorism is primarily geopolitical.

==Definition==
According to Juergensmeyer, religion and [[violence]] have had a symbiotic relationship since before the [[Crusades]] and even since before the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt; He defines  religious terrorism as consisting of acts that terrify, the definition of which is provided by the witnesses – the ones terrified – and not by the party committing the act; accompanied by either a religious motivation, justification, organization, or world view.&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt;{{rp|4–10}}  Religion is sometimes used in combination with other factors, and sometimes as the primary motivation. Religious terrorism is intimately connected to current forces of [[geopolitics]].

[[Bruce Hoffman]] has characterized modern religious terrorism as having three traits:
* The perpetrators must use religious scriptures to justify or explain their violent acts or to gain recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Bruce Hoffman; "A Conversation with Bruce Hoffman and Jeffrey Goldberg" pp. 29–35 in ''Religion, Culture, And International Conflict: A Conversation'', edited by Michael Cromartie. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7425-4473-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clerical figures must be involved in leadership roles.&lt;ref name=Hoffman1999/&gt;{{rp|90}}
* Perpetrators use [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] images of destruction to justify the acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Arquilla|editor-first=John|editor2-last=Hoffman|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=Jenkins|editor3-first=Brian Michae|editor4-last=Lesser|editor4-first=Ian O.|editor5-last=Ronfeldt|editor5-first=David|editor6-last=Zanini|editor6-first=Michele|title=Countering the New Terrorism|publisher=RAND|year=1999|location=Santa Monica, CA|isbn=0-8330-2667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

Important symbolic acts such as the blood sacrifice link acts of violence to religion and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dingley|first=James|last2=Kirk-Smith|first2=Michael|title=Symbolism and Sacrifice in Terrorism|journal=Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies|volume=13|issue=1|pages=102–28|date=Spring 2002|doi=10.1080/714005406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Suicide terrorism]], [[self-sacrifice]], or [[martyrdom]] has throughout history been organized and perpetrated by groups with both political and religious motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Matovic, Violeta, ''Suicide Bombers: Who's Next'', Belgrade, The National Counter Terrorism Committee, {{ISBN|978-8690830923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian tradition has a long history of heterodoxical and heretical groups which stressed self-immolative acts and scholarship has to some degree linked this to modern political groups such as the [[Irish Republican Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Farrell Moran, "Patrick Pearse and Patriotic Soteriology: The Irish Republican Tradition and the Sanctification of Political Self-Immolation," in ''The Irish Terrorism Experience'', edited by Yonah Alexander and Alan O'Day, Aldershot, Dartmouth Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-1855212107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide terrorism or martyrdom is efficient, inexpensive, easily organized, and extremely difficult to counter, delivering maximum damage for little cost. The shocking nature of a suicide attack also attracts public attention.  Glorifying the culture of martyrdom benefits the terrorist organization and inspires more people to join the group. According to one commentator, retaliation against suicide attacks increases the group's sense of victimization and commitment to adhere to doctrine and policy. This process serves to encourage martyrdom, and so suicide terrorism, self-sacrifice, or martyrdom represent "value for money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madsen|first=Julian|title=Suicide Terrorism: Rationalizing the Irrational|journal=Strategic Insights|volume=3|issue=8|date=August 2004|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/aug/madsenAUG04.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511111831/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/aug/madsenAUG04.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Pape, a political scientist who specializes in suicide terrorism, has made a case for secular motivations and reasons as being the foundations of most suicide attacks, which are often labelled as "religious".&lt;ref name=Pape/&gt;

==Financing==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Terrorism activities worldwide are supported through not only the organized systems that teach holy war as the highest calling, but also through the legal, illegal, and often indirect methods financing these systems; these sometimes use organizations, including [[charities]], as fronts to mobilize or channel sources and funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raphaeli|first=Nimrod|title=Financing of Terrorism: Sources, Methods and Channels|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=15|issue=4|pages=59–82|date=October 2003|doi=10.1080/09546550390449881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charities can involve the provision of [[aid]] to those in need, and [[oblation]]s or charitable offerings are fundamental to nearly all religious systems, with sacrifice as a furtherance of the custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Firth|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Firth|title=Offering and Sacrifice: Problems of Organization|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=93|issue=1|pages=12–24|date=January–June 1963|doi=10.2307/2844331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the concept==
[[Robert Pape]] compiled the first complete database of every documented suicide bombing from 1980–2003. He argues that the news reports about [[suicide attack]]s are profoundly misleading – "There is little connection between [[suicide terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or any one of the world's religions". After studying 315 suicide attacks carried out over the last two decades, he concludes that suicide bombers' actions stem from political conflict, not religion.&lt;ref name=Pape&gt;{{cite book|last=Pape|first=Robert A.|authorlink=Robert Pape|title=[[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]|publisher=Random House|year=2005|location=New York City, NY|isbn=1-4000-6317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael A. Sheehan]] stated in 2000, "A number of terrorist groups have portrayed their causes in religious and cultural terms. This is often a transparent tactic designed to conceal political goals, generate popular support and silence opposition."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sheehan [http://www.brookings.edu/events/2000/0210terrorism.aspx Lecture: "A Foreign Policy Event Terrorism: The Current Threat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102214803/http://www3.brookings.edu/events/2000/0210terrorism.aspx |date=2007-11-02 }}, The Brookings Institution, 10 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Nardin wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A basic problem is whether religious terrorism really differs, in its character and causes, from political terrorism... defenders of religious terrorism typically reason by applying commonly acknowledged moral principles... But the use (or misuse) of moral arguments does not in fact distinguish religious from nonreligious terrorists, for the latter also rely upon such arguments to justify their acts... political terrorism can also be symbolic... alienation and dispossession... are important in other kinds of violence as well. In short, one wonders whether the expression 'religious terrorism' is more than a journalistic convenience".&lt;ref name=Nardin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nardin|first=Terry|title=Review: Terror in the Mind of God|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=63|issue=2|pages=683–84|date=May 2001|jstor=2691794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...religion is not innocent. But it does not ordinarily lead to violence. That happens only with the coalescence of a peculiar set of circumstances – political, social, and ideological – when religion becomes fused with violent expressions of social aspirations, personal pride, and movements for political change."&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
and 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whether or not one uses 'terrorist' to describe violent acts depends on whether one thinks that the acts are warranted. To a large extent the use of the term depends on one's world view: if the world is perceived as peaceful, violent acts appear to be terrorism. If the world is thought to be at war, violent acts may be regarded as legitimate. They may be seen as preemptive strikes, as defensive tactics in an ongoing battles, or as symbols indicating to the world that it is indeed in a state of grave and ultimate conflict."&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Kupelian wrote, "Genocidal madness can't be blamed on a particular philosophy or religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kupelian|first=David|title=How Evil Works: Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces That Are Transforming America|year=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York City, NY|isbn=1-4391-6819-9|page=185|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}}

On July 2, 2013 in [[Lahore]], 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as [[Haraam]] or forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1022298 |title=Fatwa issued against suicide bombings, targeted killings and terrorism |date=2 July 2013 |location=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EEG cap.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Electroencephalography|EEG]] technology has been used for meditation research]]

For the purpose of this article, '''research on [[meditation]]''' concerns research into the psychological and physiological effects of [[meditation]] using the [[scientific method]]. In recent years, these studies have increasingly involved the use of modern scientific techniques and instruments, such as fMRI and EEG which are able to directly observe brain physiology and neural activity in living subjects, either during the act of meditation itself, or before and after a meditation effort, thus allowing linkages to be established between meditative practice and changes in brain structure or function.

Since the 1950s hundreds of studies on [[meditation]] have been conducted, but many of the early studies were flawed and thus yielded unreliable results.&lt;ref name="State of the Research"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, Tjosvold L, Vandermeer B, Liang Y, Bialy L, Hooton N, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Klassen TP | title = Meditation practices for health: state of the research | journal = Evidence Report/Technology Assessment | volume =  | issue = 155 | pages = 1–263 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17764203 | pmc = 4780968 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225175425/http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf | df = dmy-all | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Antoine |last1=Lutz |first2=John D. |last2=Dunne |first3=Richard J. |last3=Davidson | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007 |chapter=Meditation and the Neuroscience of Consciousness: An Introduction |pages=499–552 |editor1-first=Philip David |editor1-last=Zelazo |editor2-first=Morris |editor2-last=Moscovitch |editor3-first=Evan |editor3-last=Thompson |title=The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness |series=Cambridge Handbooks in Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-81678-9 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511816789.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary studies have attempted to address many of these flaws with the hope of guiding current research into a more fruitful path.&lt;ref name="NCCIH 2008"/&gt; In 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins, publishing in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]], identified 47 studies that qualify as well-designed and therefore reliable.

==Weaknesses in historic meditation and mindfulness research==
[[File:Meditation&amp;BP.jpg|thumb|300px|A comparison of the effect of various meditation techniques on systolic [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="State of the Research"/&gt;]]

In June, 2007 the United States [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH) published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of meditation research, conducted by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]] Evidence-based Practice Center. The report reviewed 813 studies involving five broad categories of meditation: [[mantra]] meditation, [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness meditation]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], and [[Qigong]], and included all studies on adults through September 2005, with a particular focus on research pertaining to [[hypertension]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[substance abuse]]. The report concluded, "''Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.''" (p.&amp;nbsp;6) It noted that there is no theoretical explanation of health effects from meditation common to all meditation techniques.&lt;ref name="State of the Research" /&gt;

A version of this report subsequently published in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' stated that "''Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to [[Validity (logic)|validity]] in every major quality domain assessed''". This was the conclusion despite a [[statistically significant]] increase in quality of all reviewed meditation research, in general, over time between 1956 and 2005. Of the 400 clinical studies, 10% were found to be good quality. A call was made for rigorous study of meditation.&lt;ref name="NCCIH 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Barnes V, Carlson LE, Dusek JA, Shannahoff-Khalsa D | title = Clinical trials of meditation practices in health care: characteristics and quality | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 1199–213 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19123875 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2008.0307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors also noted that this finding is not unique to the area of meditation research and that the quality of reporting is a frequent problem in other areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research and related therapy research domains.

Of more than 3,000 scientific studies that were found in a comprehensive search of 17 relevant databases, only about 4% had randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are designed to exclude the placebo effect.&lt;ref name="State of the Research"/&gt;

A 2013 statement from the [[American Heart Association]] evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of TM as a treatment for hypertension as "unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established", and stated: "''Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials...&amp;nbsp;other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brook RD, Appel LJ, Rubenfire M, Ogedegbe G, Bisognano JD, Elliott WJ, Fuchs FD, Hughes JW, Lackland DT, Staffileno BA, Townsend RR, Rajagopalan S | title = Beyond medications and diet: alternative approaches to lowering blood pressure: a scientific statement from the american heart association | journal = Hypertension | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 1360–83 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23608661 | doi = 10.1161/HYP.0b013e318293645f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindfulness scales===
In the relatively new field of western psychological mindfulness, researchers attempt to define and measure the results of mindfulness primarily through controlled, randomised studies of mindfulness intervention on various dependent variables. The participants in mindfulness interventions measure many of the outcomes of such interventions subjectively. For this reason, several mindfulness inventories or scales (a set of questions posed to a subject whose answers output the subject's aggregate answers in the form of a rating or category) have arisen. Twelve such methods are mentioned by the Mindfulness Research Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindfulness Research Guide |url=http://www.mindfulexperience.org/measurement.php |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100616/http://www.mindfulexperience.org/measurement.php |archive-date=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain mechanisms===
In 2011, [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH) released findings from a study in which [[magnetic resonance image]]s were taken of the brains of 16 participants 2 weeks before and after the participants joined the mindfulness meditation (MM) program by researchers from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], Bender Institute of Neuroimaging in Germany, and the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. Researchers concluded that {{quote|..these findings may represent an underlying brain mechanism associated with mindfulness-based improvements in mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Spotlight: Mindfulness Meditation Is Associated With Structural Changes in the Brain |url=http://nccih.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/012311.htm |date= January 30, 2011 |publisher=[[NCCIH]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[analgesic]] effect of MM involves multiple brain mechanisms including the activation of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeidan F, Grant JA, Brown CA, McHaffie JG, Coghill RC | title = Mindfulness meditation-related pain relief: evidence for unique brain mechanisms in the regulation of pain | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 520 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–73 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22487846 | pmc = 3580050 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.03.082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, brief periods of MM training increases the amount of grey matter in the [[hippocampus]] and [[parietal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen MP, Day MA, Miró J | title = Neuromodulatory treatments for chronic pain: efficacy and mechanisms | journal = Nature Reviews.

Participation in MBSR programmes has been found to correlate with decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density,&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Evans KC, Hoge EA, Dusek JA, Morgan L, Pitman RK, Lazar SW | title = Stress reduction correlates with structural changes in the amygdala | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–7 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19776221 | pmc = 2840837 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsp034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus.&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2011a"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Vangel M, Congleton C, Yerramsetti SM, Gard T, Lazar SW | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21071182 | pmc = 3004979 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in the brain===

A meta-analysis by Fox et al. (2014) using results from 21 brain imaging studies found consistent differences in the region of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions associated with body awareness. In terms of effect size the mean effect was rated as moderate. (Cohen's d = 0.46) However the results should be interpreted with caution because [[funnel plot]]s indicate that publication bias is an issue in meditation research.&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

A follow up by Fox et al. (2016) using 78 functional neuro-imaging studies suggests that different meditation styles are reliably associated with different brain activity. Activations in some brain regions are usually accompanied by deactivation in others. This finding suggests that meditation research must put emphasis on comparing practices from the same style of meditation, for example results from studies investigating focused attention methods cannot be compared to results from open monitoring approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Dixon ML, Nijeboer S, Girn M, Floman JL, Lifshitz M, Ellamil M, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Functional neuroanatomy of meditation: A review and meta-analysis of 78 functional neuroimaging investigations | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 65 | pages = 208–28 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27032724 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.03.021 | arxiv = 1603.06342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention and mindfulness===

====Attention networks and mindfulness meditation====
Psychological and Buddhist conceptualisations of mindfulness both highlight awareness and attention training as key components, in which levels of mindfulness can be cultivated with practise of mindfulness meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kabat-Zinn J | year = 2003 | title = Mindfulness‐based interventions in context: past, present, and future | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 144–156 | doi=10.1093/clipsy/bpg016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focused attention meditation and open monitoring meditation are distinct types of mindfulness meditation, and the former relates to directing and maintaining attention on a chosen object (e.g. the breath).&lt;ref name="Lutz2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz A, Slagter HA, Dunne JD, Davidson RJ | title = Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 163–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18329323 | pmc = 2693206 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2008.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Open monitoring meditation does not involve focus on a specific object, and instead awareness is grounded in the perceptual features of one’s environment.

Focused attention meditation is typically practiced first to increase the ability to enhance attentional stability, and awareness of mental states with the goal being to transition to open monitoring meditation practise that emphasizes the ability to monitor moment-by-moment changes in experience, without a focus of attention to maintain. Mindfulness meditation may lead to greater [[cognitive flexibility]] &lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Malinowski2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore A, Malinowski P | title = Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–86 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19181542 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2008.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evidence for improvements in three areas of attention====
''Sustained attention''
* Tasks of sustained attention relate to vigilance and the preparedness that aids completing a particular task goal. Psychological research into the relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sustained attention network have revealed the following:
* Mindfulness meditators have demonstrated superior performance when the stimulus to be detected in a task was unexpected, relative to when it was expected. This suggests that attention resources were more readily available in order to perform well in the task. This was despite not receiving a visual cue to aid performance. (Valentine &amp; Sweet, 1999).
* In a [[Continuous performance task]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Schmertz SK, Anderson PL, Robins DL | year = 2009 | title = The relation between self-report mindfulness and performance on tasks of sustained attention | url = | journal = Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 60–66 | doi=10.1007/s10862-008-9086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association was found between higher dispositional mindfulness and more stable maintenance of sustained attention.
* In an EEG study,&lt;ref&gt;[[Electroencephalography]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attentional blink]] effect was reduced, and [[P3b]] ERP amplitude decreased in a group of participants that completed a mindfulness retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slagter HA, Lutz A, Greischar LL, Francis AD, Nieuwenhuis S, Davis JM, Davidson RJ | title = Mental training affects distribution of limited brain resources | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e138 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17488185 | pmc = 1865565 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of reduced attentional blink effect relates to an increase in detectability of a second target. This may have been due to a greater ability to allocate attentional resources for detecting the second target, reflected in a reduced P3b amplitude.
* A greater degree of attentional resources may also be reflected in faster response times in task performance, as was found for participants with higher levels of mindfulness experience.&lt;ref name="Jha2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jha AP, Krompinger J, Baime MJ | title = Mindfulness training modifies subsystems of attention | journal = Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–19 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17672382 | doi = 10.3758/cabn.7.2.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Selective attention''
* Selective attention as linked with the orientation network, is involved in selecting the relevant stimuli to attend to.
* Performance in the ability to limit attention to potentially sensory inputs (i.e. selective attention) was found to be higher following the completion of an 8-week MBSR course, compared to a one-month retreat and control group (with no mindfulness training).&lt;ref name="Jha2007" /&gt; The ANT task is a general applicable task designed to test the three attention networks, in which participants are required to determine the direction of a central arrow on a computer screen.&lt;ref name="Fan, J. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fan J, McCandliss BD, Sommer T, Raz A, Posner MI | title = Testing the efficiency and independence of attentional networks | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 340–7 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11970796 | doi = 10.1162/089892902317361886 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.590.8796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency in orienting that represent the capacity to selectively attend to stimuli was calculated by examining changes in the reaction time that accompanied cues indicating where the target occurred relative to the aid of no cues.
* Meditation experience was found to correlate negatively with reaction times on an [[Eriksen flanker task]] measuring responses to global and local figures. Similar findings have been observed for correlations between mindfulness experience in an orienting score of response times taken from Attention Network Task performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Hurk PA, Giommi F, Gielen SC, Speckens AE, Barendregt HP | title = Greater efficiency in attentional processing related to mindfulness meditation | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 1168–80 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20509209 | doi = 10.1080/17470210903249365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Executive control attention''
* Executive control attention include functions of inhibiting the conscious processing of distracting information. In the context of mindful meditation, distracting information relates to attention grabbing mental events such as thoughts related to the future or past.&lt;ref name="Lutz2008" /&gt;
* More than one study have reported findings of a reduced [[Stroop effect]] following mindfulness meditation training.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Malinowski2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tang2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan D, Woollacott M | title = Effects of level of meditation experience on attentional focus: is the efficiency of executive or orientation networks improved? | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718648 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2007.7022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stroop effect]] indexes interference created by having words printed in colour that differ to the read semantic meaning e.g. green printed in red. However findings for this task are not consistently found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson ND, Lau MA, Segal ZV, Bishop SR | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness-based stress reduction and attentional control | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 449–463 | doi=10.1002/cpp.544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2011b" /&gt; For instance the MBSR may differ to how mindful one becomes relative to a person who is already high in trait mindfulness.&lt;ref name = "Malinowski_2013" /&gt;
* Using the Attention Network Task (a version of [[Eriksen flanker task]] &lt;ref name="Fan, J. 2002"/&gt;) it was found that error scores that indicate executive control performance were reduced in experienced meditators &lt;ref name="Jha2007" /&gt; and following a brief 5 session mindfulness training program.&lt;ref name="Tang2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang YY, Ma Y, Wang J, Fan Y, Feng S, Lu Q, Yu Q, Sui D, Rothbart MK, Fan M, Posner MI | title = Short-term meditation training improves attention and self-regulation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 43 | pages = 17152–6 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17940025 | pmc = 2040428 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0707678104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..10417152T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A neuroimaging study supports behavioural research findings that higher levels of mindfulness are associated with greater proficiency to inhibit distracting information. As greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was shown for mindfulness meditators than matched controls.
* Following a [[Stroop test]], reduced amplitude of the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P3]] ERP component was found for a meditation group relative to control participants. This was taken to signify that mindfulness meditation improves executive control functions of attention. An increased amplitude in the [[N200 (neuroscience)|N2]] ERP component was also observed in the mindfulness meditation group, thought to reflect more efficient perceptual discrimination in earlier stages of perceptual processing.&lt;ref name="pmid22363278"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore A, Gruber T, Derose J, Malinowski P | title = Regular, brief mindfulness meditation practice improves electrophysiological markers of attentional control | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 18 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22363278 | pmc = 3277272 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion regulation and mindfulness===
Reductions in rumination have been found following Mindfulness meditation practise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar S, Feldman G, Hayes A | year = 2008 | title = Changes in mindfulness and emotion regulation in an exposure-based cognitive therapy for depression | url = | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 734–744 | doi=10.1007/s10608-008-9190-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramel W, Goldin PR, Carmona PE, McQuaid JR | year = 2004 | title = The effects of mindfulness meditation on cognitive processes and affect in patients with past depression | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 433–455 | doi = 10.1023/b:cotr.0000045557.15923.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evidence of mindfulness and emotion regulation outcomes====
Emotional reactivity can be measured and reflected in brain regions related to the production of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ochsner KN, Gross JJ | title = The cognitive control of emotion | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 242–9 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15866151 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2005.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be reflected in tests of attentional performance, indexed in poorer performance in attention related tasks. The regulation of emotional reactivity as initiated by attentional control capacities can be taxing to performance, as attentional resources are limited &lt;ref name="Posner_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Posner MI, Rothbart MK | title = Research on attention networks as a model for the integration of psychological science | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 58 | issue =  | pages = 1–23 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17029565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Prevention of mental disorders|Prevention of mental illness]]===

An 8 week [[mindfulness]] course given to students was found to reduce the number subsequently needing treatment for [[mental illness]] by 60%, although the study was not of large size and commented that the effect could be due to 'non-specific effects', as the control group had received no attention at all, rather than an alternative intervention.&lt;ref name="Galante et al 2017"

===[[Psychological stress|Stress]] reduction===

Research has shown stress reduction benefits from mindfulness.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2018/06000/Common_and_Dissociable_Neural_Activity_After.6.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2018/06/mindfulness-meditation-relaxation-response-have-different-effects-brain-function&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future directions===
A large part of mindfulness research is dependent on technology. As new technology continues to be developed, new imaging techniques will become useful in this field. Real-time fMRI might give immediate feedback and guide participants through the programs. It could also be used to more easily train and evaluate mental states during meditation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang YY, Posner MI | title = Tools of the trade: theory and method in mindfulness neuroscience | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–20 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23081977 | pmc = 3541497 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nss112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new technology in the upcoming years offers many exciting potentials for the continued research.

===Insight (Vipassana) meditation===
[[Vipassana]] meditation is a component of Buddhist philosophy.

A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise, measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none have recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation.&lt;ref name="Manocha_2010" /&gt;

===Kundalini Yoga===
{{Main|Kundalini yoga#Medical research}}
Kundalini Yoga has proved to increase the prevention of cognitive decline and evaluate the response of biomarkers to treatment, thereby shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of the link between Kundalini Yoga and cognitive impairment. For the study, 81 participants aged 55 and older who had subjective memory complaints and met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, indicated by a total score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. The results showed that at 12 weeks, both the yoga group showed significant improvements in recall memory and visual memory and showed significant sustained improvement in memory up to the 24-week follow-up, the yoga group showed significant improvement in verbal fluency and sustained significant improvements in executive functioning at week 24. In addition, the yoga cohort showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms, apathy, and resilience from emotional stress.

==Research on unspecified or multiple types of meditation==

===Brain activity===
{{Main|Brain activity and meditation}}

The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices have been found to be relatively deactivated during meditation (experienced meditators using concentration, lovingkindness and choiceless awareness meditation). In addition experienced meditators were found to have stronger coupling between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices both when meditating and when not meditating.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brewer JA, Worhunsky PD, Gray JR, Tang YY, Weber J, Kober H | title = Meditation experience is associated with differences in default mode network activity and connectivity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 50 | pages = 20254–9 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22114193 | pmc = 3250176 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112029108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10820254B | jstor = 23060108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

A meta analysis found meditation gave some benefits, but no evidence that it was better than other treatments, for mental illness.&lt;ref name="Goyal_2014"/&gt;

===Physical changes in the brain===
Meditation has been shown to change [[grey matter]] concentrations and the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref name="pmid25632405"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurth_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2010"/&gt;

An eight-week [[MBSR]] course induced changes in gray matter concentrations.&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt; Exploratory whole brain analyses identified significant increases in gray matter concentration in the PCC, TPJ, and the cerebellum. These results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.

===Perception===
Studies have shown that meditation has both short-term and long-term effects on various perceptual faculties. In 1984 a study showed that meditators have a significantly lower detection threshold for light stimuli of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown D, Forte M, Dysart M | title = Differences in visual sensitivity among mindfulness meditators and non-meditators | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 727–33 | date = June 1984 | pmid = 6382144 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1984.58.3.727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 a study of the perception of visual illusions by zen masters, novice meditators, and non-meditators showed statistically significant effects found for the [[Poggendorff Illusion]] but not for the [[Müller-Lyer Illusion]]. The zen masters experienced a statistically significant reduction in initial illusion (measured as error in millimeters) and a lower decrement in illusion for subsequent trials.&lt;ref name="perceptualskills"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tloczynski J, Santucci A, Astor-Stetson E | title = Perception of visual illusions by novice and longer-term meditators | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 91 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 1021–6 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11153836 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.91.3.1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tloczynski has described the theory of mechanism behind the changes in perception that accompany mindfulness meditation thus: "''A person who meditates consequently perceives objects more as directly experienced stimuli and less as concepts… With the removal or minimization of cognitive stimuli and generally increasing awareness, meditation can therefore influence both the quality (accuracy) and quantity (detection) of perception.''"&lt;ref name="perceptualskills"/&gt; Brown also points to this as a possible explanation of the phenomenon: "''[the higher rate of detection of single light flashes] involves quieting some of the higher mental processes which normally obstruct the perception of subtle events.''"{{cite quote|date=October 2014}} In other words, the practice may temporarily or permanently alter some of the top-down processing involved in filtering subtle events usually deemed noise by the perceptual filters.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Relaxation response===
[[Herbert Benson]], founder of the Mind-Body Medical Institute, which is affiliated with [[Harvard University]] and several Boston hospitals, reports that meditation induces a host of biochemical and physical changes in the body collectively referred to as the "relaxation response".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benson H | title = The relaxation response: therapeutic effect | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5344 | pages = 1694–5 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9411784 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5344.1693b | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1693B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxation response includes changes in metabolism, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and brain chemistry.

Although the most common modern characterization of Buddhist meditation is a ‘relaxation’ technique, both scientific studies and Buddhist textual sources proves meditation’s arousing or wake-promoting effects.&lt;ref name="Britton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Britton, W, Lindahl, J, Cahn, B, Davis, J, Goldman, R | title = Awakening is not a metaphor: The effects of buddhist meditation practices on basic wakefulness. | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 13071 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–81 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditations aiming at improving meta-cognitive skills and compassion (e.g. loving-kindness meditation) are associated with physiological arousal, compared to breathing meditation.&lt;ref name= "Lumma"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lumma, A, Kok, B, Singer, T | title = Is meditation always relaxing? investigating heart rate, heart rate variability, experienced effort and likeability during training of three types of meditation. | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–45 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.04.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theravada (i.e.Vipassana) styles of meditation induce relaxation responses, while Vajrayana styles of meditation induce arousal responses.&lt;ref name="Amihai"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amihai, I, Maria, K | title = Arousal vs. relaxation: A comparison of the neurophysiological and cognitive correlates of vajrayana and theravada meditative practices. | journal = PLoS One | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short term meditation training enables the voluntary activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) results in epinephrine release.&lt;ref name="Kox"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kox, M, Eijk, L, Zwaag, J, Wildenberg, J, Sweep, F, Hoeven, J, Pickkers, P | title = Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans. | journal = National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 20 | pages = 7379–7384 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1322174111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the SNS is activated, human body is turning into ‘fight or flight’ mode, whereas the PNS is termed the ‘rest and digest’ mode.&lt;ref name="brodal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Per |last=Brodal |title=The Central Nervous System: Structure and Function  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdATFQ0YUrMC&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |edition=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2004 |pages=369–396 |isbn=0-19-516560-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when SNS is activated, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration will be increased, and catecholamines will be produced, while heart rate variability and galvanic skin resistance will be decreased.&lt;ref name="brodal"/&gt; Therefore, Relaxing meditation seems to correspond to PNS dominance, and arousing meditation seems to correspond to SNS dominance.

===Slowing aging===
Aging is a process accompanied by a decrease in brain weight and volume. This phenomenon can be explained by structural changes in the brain, namely, a loss of grey matter. Some studies over the last decade have implicated meditation as a protective factor against normal age-related brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luders E, Cherbuin N, Kurth F | title = Forever Young(er): potential age-defying effects of long-term meditation on gray matter atrophy | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | pages = 1551 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25653628 | pmc = 4300906 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first direct evidence for this link emerged from a study investigating changes in the cortical thickness of meditators. The researchers found that regular meditation practice was able to reduce age-related thinning of the frontal cortex, albeit, these findings were restricted to particular regions of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazar SW, Kerr CE, Wasserman RH, Gray JR, Greve DN, Treadway MT, McGarvey M, Quinn BT, Dusek JA, Benson H, Rauch SL, Moore CI, Fischl B | title = Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | issue = 17 | pages = 1893–7 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16272874 | pmc = 1361002 | doi = 10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study looked to further expand on this finding by including a behavioural component. Consistent with the previous study, meditators did not show the expected negative correlation between grey matter volume and age. In addition, the results for meditators on the behavioural test, measuring attentional performance, were comparable across all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagnoni G, Cekic M | title = Age effects on gray matter volume and attentional performance in Zen meditation | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 28 | issue = 10 | pages = 1623–7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17655980 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that meditation can potentially protect against age-related grey matter loss and age-related cognitive decline. Since then, more research has supported the notion that meditation serves as a neuroprotective factor that slows age-related brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Cherbuin N, Luders E | title = Reduced age-related degeneration of the hippocampal subiculum in long-term meditators | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 232 | issue = 3 | pages = 214–8 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25907419 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, all studies have been cross sectional in design. Furthermore, these results merely describe associations and do not make causal inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luders E | title = Exploring age-related brain degeneration in meditation practitioners | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1307 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–88 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 23924195 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12217 | bibcode = 2014NYASA1307...82L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work using longitudinal and experimental designs may help solidify the causal link between meditation and grey matter loss. Since few studies have investigated this direct link, however insightful they may be, there is not sufficient evidence for a conclusive answer.

Research has also been conducted on the malleable determinants of cellular aging in an effort to understand human longevity. Researchers have stated, "We have reviewed data linking stress arousal and oxidative stress to telomere shortness. Meditative practices appear to improve the endocrine balance toward positive arousal (high DHEA, lower cortisol) and decrease oxidative stress. Thus, meditation practices may promote mitotic cell longevity both through decreasing stress hormones and oxidative stress and increasing hormones that may protect the telomere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Epel E, Daubenmier J, Moskowitz JT, Folkman S, Blackburn E | title = Can meditation slow rate of cellular aging?

===Happiness===

Studies have shown meditators to have higher happiness than control groups, although this may be due to non-specific factors such as meditators having better general self-care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | pmc = 3843423 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.08.040 |title=Meditation and happiness: Mindfulness and self-compassion may mediate the meditation–happiness relationship |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=93 |pages=80–85 |year=2016 |last1=Campos |first1=Daniel |last2=Cebolla |first2=Ausiàs |last3=Quero |first3=Soledad |last4=Bretón-López |first4=Juana |last5=Botella |first5=Cristina |last6=Soler |first6=Joaquim |last7=García-Campayo |first7=Javier |last8=Demarzo |first8=Marcelo |last9=Baños |first9=Rosa María | name-list-format = vanc |hdl=10234/157867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manocha et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="degruyter.com"/&gt;

===Potential adverse effects and limits of meditation===
The following is an official statement from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]-run [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched. People with physical limitations may not be able to participate in certain meditative practices involving physical movement. Individuals with existing mental or physical health conditions should speak with their health care providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make their meditation instructor aware of their condition.''"&lt;ref name="NCAAM overview" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Research methods on the human brain remain primitive==
Although we can now scan the brain, inferring value from blood movements in a human brain remains debatable.

{{quote|''Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of a variety of meditation practices. It has been unclear to what extent these practices share neural correlates. Interstingly, a recent study compared electroencephalogram activity during a focused-attention and open monitoring meditation practice from practitioners of two Buddhist traditions (17). The researchers found that the differences between the two meditation traditions were more pronounced than the differences between the two types of meditation. These data are consistent with our findings that theoretical orientation of how a practice is taught strongly influences neural activity during these practices. However, the study used long-term practitioners from different cultures, which may have confounded the results.''&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2018/06000/Common_and_Dissociable_Neural_Activity_After.6.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto''' was issued in London on 9 July 1955 by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It highlighted the dangers posed by [[nuclear weapons]] and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], who signed it just days before his death on 18 April 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist [[Cyrus S. Eaton]] offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], held in July 1957.

==Background==
{{main|History of nuclear weapons|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
The first detonation of an atomic weapon took place on 16 July 1945 in the desert north of [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]]. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped ''[[Little Boy]]'' on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] and, three days later, ''[[Fat Man]]'' on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. At least 100,000 civilians were killed outright by these two bombings.

On 18 August 1945, the ''Glasgow Forward'' published "The Bomb and Civilisation," the first known recorded comment by Bertrand Russell on atomic weapons, which he began composing the day Nagasaki was bombed. It contained threads that would later appear in the manifesto:

{{Quote|The prospect for the human race is sombre beyond all precedent. Mankind are faced with a clear-cut alternative: either we shall all perish, or we shall have to acquire some slight degree of common sense. A great deal of new political thinking will be necessary if utter disaster is to be averted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/bombCivilization.htm Bertrand Russell, "The Bomb and Civilisation."]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After learning of the bombing of Hiroshima and seeing an impending [[nuclear arms race]], [[Joseph Rotblat]], the only scientist to leave the [[Manhattan Project]] on moral grounds, remarked that he "became worried about the whole future of mankind".

Over the years that followed Russell and Rotblat worked on efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, collaborating with Albert Einstein and other scientists to compose what became known as the '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto'''.

==Press conference, 9 July 1955==
The manifesto was released during a press conference at [[Caxton Hall]], London. Rotblat, who chaired the meeting, describes it as follows:

{{Quote|It was thought that only a few of the Press would turn up and a small room was booked in Caxton Hall for the Press Conference. But it soon became clear that interest was increasing and the next larger room was booked. In the end the largest room was taken and on the day of the Conference this was packed to capacity with representatives of the press, radio and television from all over the world. After reading the Manifesto, Russell answered a barrage of questions from members of the press, some of whom were initially openly hostile to the ideas contained in the Manifesto. Gradually, however, they became convinced by the forcefulness of his arguments, as was evident in the excellent reporting in the Press, which in many cases gave front page coverage.}}

Russell had begun the conference by stating:

{{Quote|I am bringing the warning pronounced by the signatories to the notice of all the powerful Governments of the world in the earnest hope that they may agree to allow their citizens to survive.}}

==Synopsis==
The manifesto called for a conference where scientists would assess the dangers posed to the survival of humanity by [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Emphasis was placed on the meeting being politically neutral. It extended the question of nuclear weapons to all people and governments. One particular phrase is quoted often, including by Rotblat upon receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995:

{{Quote|Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.}}

==The beginnings of the Pugwash Conferences==
The manifesto called for an international conference, and was originally planned by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to be held in [[India]]. This was delayed by the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]]. [[Aristotle Onassis]] offered to finance a meeting in [[Monaco]], but this was rejected. Instead, Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian industrialist who had known Russell since 1938, offered to finance the conference in his hometown of Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto''' became the [[Pugwash Conferences]]' founding charter. The first of the conferences was held in July 1957 in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">From a sociological perspective, [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] is defined as the violation or drift from the accepted [[Norm (social)|social norms]].

'''Secondary deviance''' is a stage in a theory of deviant identity formation.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Edwin. 1967. ''Human Deviance, Social Problems and Social Control''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced by [[Edwin Lemert]] in 1951, [[primary deviance]] is  engaging in the initial act of deviance, he subsequently suggested that secondary deviance is the process of a deviant identity, integrating it into conceptions of self, potentially affecting the individual long term. For example, if a gang engaged in primary deviant behavior such as acts of violence, dishonesty or [[Addiction|drug addiction]], subsequently moved to legally deviant or criminal behavior, such as murder, this would be the stage of secondary deviance.

Primary acts of deviance are common in everyone, however these are rarely thought of as criminal acts. Secondary deviance is much more likely to be considered as criminal in a social context. The act is likely to be labelled as deviant and criminal, which can have the effect of an individual internalizing that label and acting out accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociologyindex.com/deviant-behavior.htm|title=Sociology Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemert made another distinction between primary deviance and secondary deviance. Originally, there may not be a distinguished group of "deviant" people, but instead we all switch in and out of deviant behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Delinquency &amp; Drift|last=Matza|first=David|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1967|isbn=1412821436|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a minority or these individuals starting the rule-breaking acts actually get the attention of others. In that very moment, a person is engaging in secondary deviance and it is said that they start following a more deviant path, or a deviant career - would be a set of roles shaped by the reactions of others in different situations. One's self-identity is vulnerable to all of the social judgement and criticism, and once more we see the continued interplay between the [[Mind, Self and Society|mind, self and society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quarrel Between Invariance and Flux: A Guide for Philosophers and Other Players|last=Margolis|first=Joseph|last2=Catudal|first2=Jacques|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=223–224|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Erving Goffman]] (1961, 1963) showed, when an individual is labelled with a "discrediting" social attribute like shyness can often serve as a permanent mark on one's character.

== Deviancy Process ==
Lemert listed out the process, which he decided, was the way that an individual becomes a secondary deviant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Deviance: Differences, Tradition, and Stigma|last=Franzese|first=Robert J.|publisher=Charles C Thomas|year=2009|isbn=9780398079949|location=|pages=71–72|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Primary Deviation;
# Societal Penalties;
# Further primary deviation;
# Stronger penalties and rejections;
# Further deviation;
# Crisis reached in the tolerance quotient, expressed in formal action by the community stigmatizing the deviant;
# Strengthening of the deviant conduct as a reaction to the stigmatizing and penalties, and;
# Ultimate acceptance of deviant and social status and efforts at adjustment on the basis of the associated role.

== Secondary Deviance in Culture and Society ==

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]] the punitive sanctions tend to be more important. The conditions in [[Penal system of Japan|prison]] are harsh and some of the interrogated offenders have their rights disregarded. However, Japan has decreased their criminal recidivism rate. Criminal [[Recidivism]] is repetition of criminal behavior by an offender previously convicted and punished for an offence. It is also a measure of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs or the deterrent effect of punishment. Explaining recidivism in the U.S, the [[Labeling theory|labeling]] or secondary deviance perspective has some merit to go with it. Individuals in both countries have common point of views that are unique to their own cultures. As part of the [[individualism]] enforced in the United States, individuals are taught to seek self-importance and [[Libertarian personal autonomy|personal autonomy]]. One learns that he or she is not supposed to submit to others but should always try to ascend above and beyond others. The offender surfaces in the weak relationship built between the individual and the society in which it requires them to accept authority. The offender is usually prepared to test their social power and have a negative response in order to prove that they are still more important than society itself. Opposite to the conventional labeling perspective which is said t promote secondary deviance, social reaction actually provides for aggravating secondary deviance. In Japan, an individual appreciates the society in which he was born and raised. That tendency comes from what is learned culturally about integration with the society. The social reaction towards offenders in Japan has slighter recidivist consequences rather than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy of Anomie Theory: Advances in Criminological Theory|last=Adler|first=Freda|last2=Laufer|first2=William S.|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|volume=6|location=|pages=329–347|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociologyindex.com/secondary_deviance.htm|title=Sociology Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphorical symbolism of sexual polarity is deeply intertwined in cultural understandings of [[nature]]. Conceptions of male and female poles are developed through history in relation to each other.&lt;ref name="Jordanova" /&gt;

==Measurement==
Researchers at the University of Connecticut devised a scale of sexual polarity between [[right-wing]] and [[left-wing]] sexual [[ideologies]]. In a study of 140 undergraduates, correlations along this scale were shown between right-wing sexual ideologies and both church attendance and sex-[[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref name="Mosher" /&gt;

==Bacterial conjugation==
Sexual differentiation may be seen between pairs of bacteria cells engaged in [[bacterial conjugation]]. The genetic-element donor may be characterized as having a 'male' sexual polarity and the recipient a 'female' sexual polarity.&lt;ref name="Sermonti"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sermonti|first1=G.|title=Sexual Polarity in Streptomyces coelicolor|journal=Microbiology|date=1 November 1963|volume=33|pages=293–301|doi=10.1099/00221287-33-2-293|url=http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-33-2-293|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Šrogl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Šrogl|first1=M.|title=Intraspecific transformation in Bacillus subtilis|journal=Folia Microbiologica|date=5 March 1965|volume=11|issue=1|pages=39–42|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02877153|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist literature ==
Historical blurring of boundaries between male and female poles has necessitated debates regarding maintenance of [[social order]], particularly during periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Jordanova" /&gt;

[[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'' presents a vision of [[radical feminism]] calling for division of [[culture]] into two modes, Technological and Aesthetic, married by a 'union of opposites'. Chris Middleton argues that this dual organization is intended to reflect and replace the existing sexual polarity of culture.&lt;ref name="Parkin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkin|first1=Frank|title=The Social Analysis of Class Structure|date=1974|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-26501-0|pages=192–193|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=G9SX_h1WGngC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=sexual+polarity&amp;ots=c3CiTOHdU9&amp;sig=q-MzCTrVeDEsUr8aT3B-fNhmJYU#v=onepage&amp;q=polarity&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Alternative Shakespeare'', Cotherine Belsey uses sexual polarity as [[Point of view (philosophy)|lens]] for both interpretation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s comedies and in critique of [[second-wave feminism]].&lt;ref name="Drakakis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drakakis|first1=John|title=Alternative Shakespeares|date=1985|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=0-203-42574-X|pages=192–193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2KBAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suspension''' is either paid or unpaid  time away from the workplace as ordered by the employer in order for a workplace investigation to take place.

== Workplace ==
Suspension is a common practice in the [[Employment|workplace]] for being in violation of an organization's [[policy]], or major breaches of policy. Work suspensions occur when a business manager or supervisor deems an action of an employee, whether intentional or unintentional, to be a violation of policy that should result in a course of punishment, and when the employee's absence during the suspension period does not affect the company. This form of action hurts the employee because s/he will have no hours of work during the suspended period and therefore will not get paid, unless the suspension is with pay, or is challenged and subsequently overturned. Some jobs, which pay on [[salary]], may have paid suspensions, in which the affected worker will be prevented from coming to work but will still receive pay. Generally, suspensions are deemed most effective if the affected worker remains unpaid. Suspensions are usually given after other means of [[counseling statements]] have been exhausted, but some violations may result in immediate suspension. Suspensions are tracked, and any number of them, even one may prevent one from receiving raises, bonuses or promotions, or could cause [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] from the company.

Suspension clauses are common components of [[collective bargaining]] [[Contract|agreements]]. Suspensions may be challenged by employees in [[Trade union|unionized]] organizations through the filing of a [[grievance (labour)|grievance]].

Suspension on full pay can also be used when an employee needs to be removed from the workplace to avoid prejudicing an investigation. This is used not as a punishment, but in the employer's best interest. For example, a [[police officer]] who shoots a person while on duty will be given a suspension with pay during the investigation, not to punish, but to enable the department to carry out its investigation.

== Sport ==
Suspension is a punishment in [[sport]] where players are banned from playing a certain number of future games. These suspensions may be issued for severe infractions of the rules of play (such as [[personal foul (disambiguation)|personal foul]]s), excessive technical, or flagrant fouls for the duration of a season, fights during the course of the game in which the player was a part of the wrongdoing, or misconduct off the field (such as illegal or banned substance use).

Generally, an athlete who is suspended must forfeit his pay during the course of the suspension, and depending on the team's or league's rules, may not be permitted to don his uniform or be present with the team during the course of play, which often includes attending games in the stands as a typical spectator would.

== Academia ==&lt;!-- [[In-school suspension]] redirects to here --&gt;
{{See also|School discipline}}
In academia, suspension (also known as temporary exclusion) is a mandatory leave assigned to a [[student]] as a form of [[punishment]] that can last anywhere from one [[day]] to several [[week]]s, during which time the student is not allowed to attend regular [[school]] lessons.  

===ISS/In-School Suspension===
In-School Suspension (ISS) or On-Campus suspension (OCS), sometimes known as "internal exclusion/isolation", and by some [[Florida]] schools as "School Center for Special Instruction",&lt;ref name="stateimpact.npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first= Sarah|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2012/05/04/floridas-in-school-suspension-policy-keeps-students-out-of-class/|title=In-School Suspension: a Better Alternative or Waste of Time?|publisher=stateimpact.npr.org|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative setting that removes students from the classroom for a period of time, while requiring students to attend school and complete their work. This form of punishment is often chosen because it provides supervision and structure to the students' days, whereas a student who is given an off-campus suspension receives essentially an unscheduled holiday, as off-campus suspension is widely considered to be nothing more than a pleasant reward to most students, instead of the punishment that it is intended to be, and also gives students more of a reason to misbehave on purpose, to those who would prefer to be suspended out of school, rather than being kept in school. Generally, a student assigned to on-campus suspension spends the entire school day in the designated OCS location, completes work submitted in advance by the student's teachers, and is monitored by school staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandi.net/depts/placement_appeal/discipline_policy/suspension.html Suspension Policy :: San Diego Unified School District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503113425/http://www.sandi.net/depts/placement_appeal/discipline_policy/suspension.html |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One variation of in-school suspension requires the student to arrive at school at a designated time on a Saturday to serve out their punishment, rather than miss class time during the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murray.spps.org/iss.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301144623/http://www.murray.spps.org/iss.html |date=March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of punishment is commonly referred to as "Saturday School" or more commonly, "Saturday Detention", but it may go under other names as well. The name "Saturday School" is also used to indicate [[School punishment#Detention|detention]], a less serious punishment. If a student fails to show up at Saturday School, it might result in a more serious punishment being given to the student.

===OSS/Out of School Suspension===
The student's parents or guardians are usually notified as to the reason for and the duration of the suspension. Sometimes students have to complete work during their suspensions for which they will receive no credit (OSS). Also, upon returning to school, it is often mandatory that the student, his/her parents/guardians, and a school administrator have a meeting to discuss and evaluate the matter.  If the suspension is related to the symptoms of a disability or the student is receiving special education or mental health services, students may be required to consult their case manager, counselor, or school psychologist before and/or after the suspension. In some schools, this meeting is prior to the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[[Delran High School]] Student-Parent Handbook 2008–2009, page 10 section C #1.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications to some colleges ask the student whether or not they have ever been suspended. In some places in the [[United States]], a suspension is noted on one's [[transcript (education)|transcript]]. However, other places do not report suspensions or are expressly forbidden from doing so under state law. Students who breach a suspension (attend the school while suspended) may be arrested for, and charged with [[trespassing]]. This could result in an extension of suspension, community service, and sometimes jail time. Students who continue to breach a suspension could be sentenced to [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] and longer, more severe punishments. Students are also not allowed to attend after school activities (such as proms, sporting events, etc.) while suspended from school.

== Roman Catholic canon law ==
In Roman Catholic canon law, the censure of suspension prohibits certain acts by a cleric, whether the acts are of a religious character deriving from his [[Holy Orders|ordination]] ("acts of the power of orders") or are exercises of his power of governance or of rights and functions attached to the office he holds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4X.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1333]&lt;/ref&gt;

This censure is automatically applied to a cleric who uses physical violence against a bishop,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P53.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1370]&lt;/ref&gt; a deacon who attempts to celebrate the sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or a priest who, though not empowered to grant sacramental absolution attempts to do so or who hears sacramental confession,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1378]&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric who celebrates a sacrament through [[simony]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1380]&lt;/ref&gt; and on a person who receives ordination illicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1383]&lt;/ref&gt;

The censure of suspension (along with other punishments) is to be inflicted also on a cleric who openly lives in violation of chastity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P56.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1395]&lt;/ref&gt; and on any priest who "in the act, on the occasion, or under the pretext of confession" solicits a penitent to a sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1387]&lt;/ref&gt; Suspension is incurred automatically by any cleric who falsely denounces a priest of having committed this delict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P55.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1390]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giant Pufferfish skin pattern detail.jpg|thumb|Turing's paper explained how [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]] such as stripes, spots and spirals, like those of the [[giant pufferfish]], may arise naturally.]]

"'''The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis'''" is an article written by the English mathematician [[Alan Turing]] in 1952 describing the way in which [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]] such as stripes, spots and spirals may arise naturally out of a homogeneous, uniform state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = A.

Harrison, Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern, [[Cambridge University Press]] (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction–diffusion systems==
{{main|Reaction–diffusion system}}

[[Reaction–diffusion system]]s have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. Patterns such as fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons are found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. Such patterns have been dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Wooley, T. E., Baker, R. E. [[Philip Maini|Maini, P. K.]], Chapter 34, ''Turing's theory of morphogenesis''. In {{cite book |author-link1 = Jack Copeland|last1 = Copeland | first1=B. Jack | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | last2=Bowen | first2=Jonathan P. | authorlink3=Robin Wilson (mathematician)| last3=Wilson | first3=Robin | | last4=Sprevak | first4=Mark | title=[[The Turing Guide]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2017 | isbn=978-0198747826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--needs updating from modern evo-devo--&gt;
Reaction-diffusion processes form one class of explanation for the [[evolutionary developmental biology|embryonic development]] of animal coats and skin pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meinhardt, H. |title=Models of Biological Pattern Formation |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |date=1982 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=James D. |title=Mathematical Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436 |date=9 March 2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-662-08539-4 |pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems is that although they represent [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]], there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Grindrod, P.

{{cite BAILII|litigants='''The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime v Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co (Europe) Ltd'''|court=UKSC|year=2016|num=18}} is a [[2016 Judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|2016 judgment]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] that provided an interpretation of section 2 to the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]].

==Facts==
The case concerns an incident that took place during the [[2011 England riots]]. On 8 August 2011 a gang broke into a warehouse owned by [[Sony DADC]] in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]]. After stealing goods from the warehouse they proceeded to start a fire that destroyed the warehouse and the goods that remained inside.

The insurers, [[Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group]], made a claim under section 2 of the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] but a dispute arose surrounding the quantification of loss. The [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|MOPC]] argued that compensation should only extend to the physical damage whereas the insurers argued that it should also include [[consequential damages]].

==Judgment==
===High Court===
The High Court held that section 2 only provided for compensation for the physical damage suffered and not any consequential loss of profits or rent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2013/2734.html [2013&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWHC 2734 (Comm)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the High Court and held that section 2 provided a right to compensation for all heads of loss. The [[Master of the Rolls]], [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]] stated:
{{Quote|text=It does not matter whether consequential losses such as loss of profits were recoverable from a trespasser in tort in 1886. In principle, section 2(1) covers all heads of loss compensable under English law for damage to property caused by trespassers in the course of a riot and the heads of compensation recoverable are to be determined with reference to the English law of damages as it develops over time. |source=Paragraph 123, [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/682.html [2014&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Civ 682]}}[[File:Double-deck burning in 2011 england riots.jpg|thumb|alt=A double-decker bus burning on Tottenham High Road during the 2011 England riots|The [[2011 England riots|2011 riots]] caused widespread damage across London.]]

===Supreme Court===
In the lead judgment [[Lord Hodge]] emphasised that the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] must be considered in the context of previous legislative history. Compensation following a riot was first provided for by Parliament in the Riot Act 1714 and although the scope of compensation was not defined; subsequent case law made it clear that "statutory compensation was confined to physical damage to property."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 30, [https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2014-0165-judgment.pdf [2016&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKSC 18]&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis the Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal by the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|MOPC]].

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the [[2011 England riots|2011 riots]] it was felt that the wording of the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] was archaic and therefore created uncertainty as regards interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/pdfs/ukpgaen_20160008_en.pdf Explanatory Notes] to the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/contents/enacted Riot Compensation Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; As such section 10 of the [[Riot Compensation Act 2016]] repealed the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/section/10/enacted Section 10], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/contents/enacted Riot Compensation Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, section 8(2) of the 2016 Act now makes it clear that compensation will not generally extend to [[consequential damages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/section/8/enacted Section 8], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/contents/enacted Riot Compensation Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The law firm that represented the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|MOPC]] in the case stated that "With many claims for consequential loss dependent on the outcome of this case, today's Supreme Court decision will likely save the UK taxpayer upwards of £80m."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36090993 |title=Mayor Boris Johnson wins London riot compensation case |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 April 2016 |website=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=22 April 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1445">'''Tolman's rule''' states that, in a certain chemical reaction, the steps involve exclusively intermediates of 18- and 16 electron configuration.  The rule is an extension of the [[18-electron rule]].  This rule was proposed by American chemist [[Chadwick A. Tolman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=C.A.|title=The 16 and 18 electron rule in Organometallic Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis|journal=Chem. Soc. Rev.|year=1972|pages=337–353|doi=10.1039/CS9720100337}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, Tolman's rule, even for reactions that proceed via 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; steps, is incorrect because many reactions involve configurations of fewer than 16 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Many examples of homogeneous catalysis involving organometallic complexes involve shuttling of complexes between 16 and 18 electron configurations.  16-electron complexes often form adducts with [[Lewis base]]s and, if low-valent, undergo [[oxidative addition]].
:{{math|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I + ''cis''-[Rh(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Rh(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}

Conversely, complexes of 18 electron configuration tend to dissociate ligands or undergo [[reductive elimination]]:
:{{math|[Rh(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  [Rh(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

{{Immanuel Kant}}
'''Transcendental idealism''' is a doctrine founded by German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]] in the 18th century. Kant's doctrine maintains that human experience of things is similar to the way they [[phenomenon|appear to us]]—implying a fundamentally subject-based component, rather than being an activity that directly (and therefore without any obvious causal link) comprehends the things as they are [[thing-in-itself|in themselves]]. The doctrine is most commonly presented as the idea that time and space are just human perceptions; they are not necessarily real concepts, just a medium through which humans internalize the universe.
==Background==
Although it influenced the course of subsequent [[German philosophy]] dramatically, exactly how to interpret this concept was a subject of some debate among 20th century philosophers. Kant first describes it in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and distinguished his view from contemporary views of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[idealism]], but philosophers do not agree how sharply Kant differs from each of these positions.

Transcendental idealism is associated with ''formalistic idealism'' on the basis of passages from Kant's ''[[Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics]]'', although recent research has tended to dispute this identification. Transcendental idealism was also adopted as a label by the subsequent German philosophers [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and in the early 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]] in the novel form of transcendental-phenomenological idealism.

==Kant==
Kant presents an account of how we intuit ({{lang-de|anschauen}}) objects and accounts of space and of time. Before Kant, some thinkers, such as Leibniz, had come to the conclusion that space and time were not things, but only the relations among things. Other thinkers, including Newton, maintained that space and time were real things or substances. Leibniz had arrived at a radically different understanding of the universe and the things found in it. According to his ''[[Monadology]]'', all things that humans ordinarily understand as interactions between and relations among individuals (such as their relative positions in space and time) have their being in the mind of God but not in the Universe where we perceive them to be. In the view of realists, individual things interact by physical connection and the relations among things are mediated by physical processes that connect them to human brains and give humans a determinate chain of action to them and correct knowledge of them. Kant was aware of problems with both of these positions. He had been influenced by the physics of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and understood that there is a physical chain of interactions between things perceived and the one who perceives them.  However, an important function of mind is to structure incoming data and to process it in ways that make it other than a simple mapping of outside data.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Martin, ''Kant's Metaphysics and Theory of Science'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1955), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|If we try to keep within the framework of what can be proved by the Kantian argument, we can say that it is possible to demonstrate the empirical reality of space and time, that is to say, the objective validity of all spatial and temporal properties in mathematics and physics. But this empirical reality involves transcendental ideality; space and time are forms of human intuition, and they can only be proved valid for things as they appear to us and not for things as they are in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Martin, ''Kant's Metaphysics and Theory of Science'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1955), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The salient element here is that space and time, rather than being real ''things-in-themselves'' or empirically mediated appearances ({{lang-de|Erscheinungen}}), are the very forms of intuition ({{lang-de|Anschauung}}) by which we must perceive objects. They are hence neither to be considered properties that we may attribute to objects in perceiving them, nor substantial entities of themselves. They are in that sense subjective, yet necessary, preconditions of any given object insofar as this object is an appearance and not a ''thing-in-itself''. Humans necessarily perceive objects as located in space and in time.  This condition of experience is part of what it means for a human to cognize an object, to perceive and understand it as something both spatial and temporal:  "By ''transcendental idealism'' I mean the doctrine that appearances are to be regarded as being, one and all, representations only, not things in themselves, and that time and space are therefore only sensible forms of our intuition&amp;hellip;"&lt;ref&gt;''Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason'', trans. Norman Kemp Smith (London: Macmillan, 1933), p. 345 (A 369).&lt;/ref&gt; Kant argues for these several claims in the section of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' entitled the "Transcendental Aesthetic".  That section is devoted to inquiry into the [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] conditions of human sensibility, i.e. the faculty by which humans intuit objects.  The following section, the "Transcendental Logic", concerns itself with the manner in which objects are thought.

==Historical parallels==
[[Xenophanes]] of Colophon in 530 BC anticipated Kant's epistemology in his reflections on certainty. "And as for certain truth, no man has seen it, nor will there ever be a man who knows about the gods and about all the things I mention. For if he succeeds to the full in saying what is completely true, he himself is nevertheless unaware of it; and Opinion (seeming) is fixed by fate upon all things."&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Freeman, ''Ancilla to the Presocratic Philosophers'', Xenophanes fragment 34.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Certain interpretations of some of the medieval Buddhists of India, such as [[Dharmakirti]], may reveal them to be transcendental idealists, since they seemed to hold the position of [[mereological nihilism]] but transcendental idealists who held that their minds were distinct from the [[atoms]].  Some Buddhists often attempt to maintain that the minds are equal to the atoms of mereological nihilist reality, but Buddhists seem to have no explanation of how this is the case, and much of the literature on the aforementioned Buddhists involves straightforward discussion of atoms and minds as if they are separate.  This makes their position very similar to transcendental idealism, resembling Kant's philosophy where there are only things-in-themselves (which are very much like [[atomism|philosophical atoms]]), and phenomenal properties.

==Schopenhauer==
Briefly, Schopenhauer described transcendental idealism as a "distinction between the phenomenon and the thing in itself", and a recognition that only the phenomenon is accessible to us because "we know neither ourselves nor things as they are in themselves, but merely as they appear."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. 2, "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real."&lt;/ref&gt; Some of [[Schopenhauer]]'s comments on the definition of the word "transcendental" are as follows: {{Quotation|''Transcendental'' is the philosophy that makes us aware of the fact that the first and essential laws of this world that are presented to us are rooted in our brain and are therefore known ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. It is called ''transcendental'' because it ''goes beyond'' the whole given phantasmagoria to the origin thereof. Therefore, as I have said, only the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and generally the critical (that is to say, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian) philosophy are transcendental. |''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 13}}

Schopenhauer contrasted Kant's transcendental critical philosophy with Leibniz's dogmatic philosophy. {{Quotation|With Kant the ''critical philosophy'' appeared as the opponent of this entire method [of dogmatic philosophy]. It makes its problem just those eternal truths (principle of contradiction, principle of sufficient reason) that serve as the foundation of every such dogmatic structure, investigates their origin, and then finds this to be in man's head. Here they spring from the forms properly belonging to it, which it carries in itself for the purpose of perceiving and apprehending the objective world. Thus here in the brain is the quarry furnishing the material for that proud, dogmatic structure. Now because the critical philosophy, in order to reach this result, had to go ''beyond'' the eternal truths, on which all the previous dogmatism was based, so as to make these truths themselves the subject of investigation, it became ''transcendental'' philosophy. From this it follows also that the objective world as we know it does not belong to the true being of things-in-themselves, but is its mere ''phenomenon'', conditioned by those very forms that lie ''a priori'' in the human intellect (i.e., the brain); hence the world cannot contain anything but phenomena.| ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, Appendix: "[[Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy]]"}}

==P. F. Strawson==
In ''[[The Bounds of Sense]]'', [[P. F. Strawson]] suggests a reading of Kant's first ''Critique'' that, once accepted, forces rejection of most of the original arguments, including transcendental idealism. Strawson contends that, if Kant had followed out the implications of all that he said, he would have seen that there were many self-contradictions implicit in the whole.

Strawson views the analytic argument of the ''transcendental deduction'' as the most valuable idea in the text, and regards transcendental idealism as an unavoidable error in Kant's greatly productive system. In Strawson's traditional reading (also favored in the work of [[Paul Guyer]] and [[Rae Langton]]), the Kantian term [[phenomena]] (literally something that can be seen from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''phainomenon'', "observable") refers to the world of appearances, or the world of "things" sensed. They are tagged as "phenomena" to remind the reader that humans confuse these derivative appearances with whatever may be the forever unavailable "things in themselves" behind our perceptions. The necessary preconditions of experience, the components that humans bring to their apprehending of the world, the forms of perception such as [[space and time]], are what make ''a priori'' judgments possible, but all of this process of comprehending what lies fundamental to human experience fails to bring anyone beyond the inherent limits of human sensibility. Kant's system requires the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]] to prevent a rejection of external reality altogether, and it is this concept (senseless objects of which we can have no real understanding) to which Strawson objects in his book.

==Henry E. Allison==
In ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism'', [[Henry E. Allison]] proposes a reading that opposes Strawson's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, H. E., ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism'' ([[New Haven]]: [[Yale University Press]], 1983); [http://www.morelightinmasonry.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kant/Allison-Kants-Transcendental-Idealism.pdf Revised and Enlarged Edition, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Allison argues that Strawson and others misrepresent Kant by emphasising what has become known as the two-worlds reading (a view developed by [[Paul Guyer]]). This—according to Allison, false—reading of Kant's phenomena/noumena distinction suggests that phenomena and noumena are ontologically distinct from each other. It concludes on that basis that we somehow fall short of knowing the noumena due to the nature of the very means by which we comprehend them. On such a reading, Kant would himself commit the very fallacies he attributes to the [[Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)|transcendental realists]]. On Allison's reading, Kant's view is better characterized as a two-aspect theory, where noumena and phenomena refer to complementary ways of considering an object. It is the dialectic character of knowing, rather than [[epistemology|epistemological]] insufficiency, that Kant wanted most to assert.

==Opposing views: Realism==
Opposing Kantian transcendental idealism is the doctrine of [[philosophical realism]], that is, the proposition that the world is knowable as it really is, without any consideration of the knower's manner of knowing. This has been propounded by philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[George Edward Moore|G. E. Moore]], [[Ralph Barton Perry]], and [[Henry Babcock Veatch]]. Realism claims, contrary to idealism, that perceived objects exist in the way that they appear, in and of themselves, independent of a knowing spectator's mind.

In [[epistemology]], '''transparency''' is a property of epistemic [[State of being|states]] defined as follows: An epistemic state E is "weakly transparent" to a subject S [[if and only if]] when S is in state E, S can know that S is in state E; an epistemic state E is "strongly transparent" to a subject S if and only if when S is in state E, S can know that S is in state E, AND when S is not in state E, S can know S is not in state E.

[[Pain]] is usually considered to be strongly transparent: when someone is in pain, he knows immediately that he is in pain, and if he is not in pain, he will know he is not. Transparency is important in the study of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and [[meta-knowledge]].

It was signed on [[Pheasant Island]], a river island on the border between the two countries which has remained a French-Spanish [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] since the treaty. The kings [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Philip IV of Spain]] were represented by their chief ministers, [[Cardinal Mazarin]] and Don [[Luis Méndez de Haro]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Sahlins1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Sahlins|title=Boundaries: The Making of France and Spain in the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPLEOKM1CI8C&amp;pg=PA25|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91121-5|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

France entered the Thirty Years' War after the [[Spanish Habsburg]] victories in the [[Dutch Revolt]] in the 1620s and at the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]] against [[Sweden]] in 1634. By 1640, France began to interfere in Spanish politics, aiding the [[Reapers' War|revolt in Catalonia]], while Spain responded by aiding the [[Fronde]] revolt in France in 1648. During the negotiations for the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, France gained the [[Sundgau]] and cut off Spanish access to the [[Netherlands]] from [[Austria]], leading to open warfare between the French and Spanish.

After 23 years of war, an Anglo-French alliance was victorious at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of the Dunes]] in June 14, 1658, but the following year the war ground to a halt when the French campaign to take [[Milan]] was defeated. Peace was settled by means of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659.

France gained [[Roussillon]] (including [[Perpignan]]) and the northern half of [[Cerdanya]], [[Montmédy]] and other parts of [[Luxembourg]], [[Artois]] and other towns in [[Flanders]], including Arras, [[Béthune]], [[Gravelines]] and [[Thionville]], and a new border with Spain was fixed at the Pyrenees.&lt;ref name=pyrconditions&gt;{{cite book|last=Maland M.A.|first=David|title=Europe in the Seventeenth Century|publisher=Macmillan|year=1991|edition=Second |pages=227|isbn=0-333-33574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the treaty stipulated only that all "villages" north of the Pyrenees should become part of France. Because it was a villa, the historic town of [[Llívia]], once the capital of Cerdanya, was thus unintentionally exempted from the treaty and became a Spanish exclave as part of the ''[[comarca]]'' of [[Baixa Cerdanya]], in the [[Spanish provinces|Spanish province]] of [[Girona (province)|Girona]]. This border was not properly settled until the [[France–Spain border|Treaty of Bayonne]] was signed in 1856, with its final acts accepted 12 years later. On the western Pyrenees a definite borderline was drawn and decisions made as to the politico-administrative affiliation of bordering areas in the Basque region&amp;mdash;[[Baztan (valley)|Baztan]], [[Aldude]], [[Valcarlos]].

Spain was forced to recognize and confirm all of the French gains at the Peace of Westphalia.&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt;

In exchange for the Spanish territorial losses, the French king pledged to quit his support for [[Portugal]] and renounced to his claim to the [[county of Barcelona]], which the French crown had claimed ever since the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] (also known as Reapers' War).&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt; The Portuguese revolt in 1640, led by the Duke of Braganza, was supported monetarily by Cardinal Richelieu of France. After the Catalan Revolt, France had controlled the [[Principality of Catalonia]] from January 1641, when a combined Catalan and French force defeated the Spanish army at [[Battle of Montjuïc (1641)|Battle of Montjuïc]], until it was defeated by a Spanish army at Barcelona in 1652.&lt;ref name="Pendrillrevolts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pendrill|first=Colin|title=Spain 1474 - 1700|editor=Martin Collier, Erica Lewis |publisher=Heinemann Advanced History, The Triumphs and Tribulations of Empire |year=2002|pages=142–143|isbn=978-0-435-32733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Spanish army reconquered most of Catalonia, the French retained Catalan territory north of the Pyrenees.

The treaty also arranged for a marriage between [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain]], the daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]].&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt; Maria Theresa was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne, in return for a monetary settlement as part of her [[dowry]]. This settlement was never paid, a factor that eventually led to the [[War of Devolution]] in 1668.  At the [[Meeting on the Isle of Pheasants]] in June 1660, the two monarchs and their ministers met, and the princess entered France.

In addition, the English received [[Dunkirk]],&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt; although they elected to sell it to France in 1662.

==Consequences==
The Treaty of the Pyrenees was the last major diplomatic achievement by Cardinal Mazarin. Combined with the [[Peace of Westphalia]], it allowed Louis XIV remarkable stability and diplomatic advantage by means of a weakened [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé]] and a weakened Spanish Crown, along with the agreed dowry, which was an important element in the French king's strategy:
[[Image:Catalonia2.png|200px|thumb|Map of [[Catalonia]], showing the partition of its territory by means of the Treaty of the Pyrenees.]]
All in all, by 1660, when the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish occupation of Poland]] was over, most of the European continent was at peace ([[Portuguese Restoration War]], third stage), and the Bourbons had ended the dominance of the [[Habsburgs]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1979431–432"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

===French annexations===

In the context of the territorial changes involved in the Treaty, France gained some territory, on both its northern and southern borders.

*In the north, France gained [[French Flanders]].
*In the south: 
::# On the east: The northern part of the [[Principality of Catalonia]], including [[Roussillon]], [[Conflent]], [[Vallespir]], [[Capcir]], and [[French Cerdagne]], was transferred to France, i.e. what later came to be known as "[[Northern Catalonia]]".
::# On the west: The parties agree to put together a field group to compromise a borderline on disputed lands along the Basque Pyrenees, involving Sareta&amp;mdash;[[Zugarramurdi]], [[Ainhoa, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Ainhoa]], etc.&amp;mdash; [[Aldude]], and the Spanish wedge of [[Valcarlos]].

{{redirect|Understand}}

'''Understanding''' is a [[psychological]] process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a [[person]], situation, or [[message]] whereby one is able to think about it and use [[concept]]s to deal adequately with that object.
Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bereiter|first=Carl|title=Education and mind in the Knowledge Age|url=http://www.cocon.com/observetory/carlbereiter/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225000806/http://www.cocon.com/observetory/carlbereiter/|archivedate=2006-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding is often, though not always, related to learning concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability to predict the behaviour of an object, animal or system—and therefore may, in some sense, understand it—without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal or system in their culture. They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognised standard concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make [[inference]]s.

==Examples==
# One understands the weather if one is able to [[prediction|predict]] (e.g. if it is very cloudy, it may rain) and/or give an [[explanation]] of some of its features, etc.
# A [[psychiatrist]] understands another person's [[anxiety|anxieties]] if he/she knows that person's anxieties, their causes, and can give useful [[Advice (opinion)|advice]] on how to cope with the anxiety.
# One understands a piece of [[rhetoric|reasoning]] or an [[logical argument|argument]] if one can consciously reproduce the information content conveyed by the message.
# One understands a [[language]] to the extent that one can reproduce the information content conveyed by a broad range of spoken utterances or written messages in that language.

==Shallow and deep==
Someone who has a more sophisticated understanding, more predictively accurate understanding, and/or an understanding that allows them to make explanations that others commonly judge to be better, of something, is said to understand that thing "deeply". Conversely, someone who has a more limited understanding of a thing is said to have a "shallow" understanding. However, the depth of understanding required to usefully participate in an occupation or activity may vary greatly.

For example, consider [[multiplication]] of [[integer]]s. Starting from the most shallow level of understanding, we have (at least) the following possibilities:

# A small child may not understand what multiplication is, but may understand that it is a type of [[mathematics]] that they will learn when they are older at school. This is "understanding of context"; being able to put an as-yet not-understood concept into some kind of context. Even understanding that a concept is not part of one's current knowledge is, in itself, a type of understanding (see the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]], which is about people who do not have a good understanding of what they do not know).
# A slightly older child may understand that multiplication of two integers can be done, at least when the numbers are between 1 and 12, by looking up the two numbers in a [[times table]]. They may also be able to memorise and recall the relevant times table in order to answer a multiplication question such as "2 times 4 is what?". This is a simple form of operational understanding; understanding a question well enough to be able to do the operations necessary to be able to find an answer.
# A yet older child may understand that multiplication of larger numbers can be done using a different method, such as [[long multiplication]], or using a [[calculator]]. This is a more advanced form of operational understanding because it supports answering a wider range of questions of the same type.
# A teenager may understand that multiplication is repeated addition, but not understand the broader implications of this. For example, when their teacher refers to multiplying 6 by 3 as "adding 6 to itself 3 times", they may understand that the teacher is talking about two entirely equivalent things. However, they might not understand how to ''apply'' this knowledge to implement multiplication as an [[algorithm]] on a [[computer]] using only addition and [[loop (computing)|looping]] as basic constructs. This level of understanding is "understanding a definition" (or "understanding the definition" when a concept only has one definition).
# A teenager may also understand the mathematical idea of abstracting over individual whole numbers as variables, and how to efficiently (i.e. not via trial-and-error) solve algebraic equations involving multiplication by such variables, such as &lt;math&gt;2x = 6&lt;/math&gt;. This is "relational understanding"; understanding how multiplication relates to division.
# An [[undergraduate]] studying mathematics may come to learn that "the integers equipped with multiplication" is merely one example of a range of mathematical structures called [[monoid|monoids]], and that theorems about monoids apply equally well to multiplication and other types of monoids.

For the purpose of operating a [[cash register]] at [[McDonald's]], a person does not need a very deep understanding of the multiplication involved in calculating the total price of two [[Big Mac]]s. However, for the purpose of contributing to [[number theory]] research, a person would need to have a relatively deep understanding of multiplication — along with other relevant arithmetical concepts such as division and [[prime number]]s.

== Assessment ==
It is possible for a person, or a piece of "intelligent" software, that in reality only has a shallow understanding of a topic, to appear to have a deeper understanding than they actually do, when the right questions are asked of it. The most obvious way this can happen is by [[memorization]] of correct answers to known questions, but there are other, more subtle ways that a person or computer can (intentionally or otherwise) deceive somebody about their level of understanding, too. This is particularly a risk with [[artificial intelligence]], in which the ability of a piece of artificial intelligence software to very quickly try out millions of possibilities (attempted solutions, theories, etc.) could create a misleading impression of the real depth of its understanding. Supposed AI software could in fact come up with impressive answers to questions that were difficult for unaided humans to answer, without really understanding the concepts ''at all'', simply by dumbly applying rules very quickly. (However, see the [[Chinese room]] argument for a controversial philosophical extension of this argument.)

[[Test (assessment)|Examinations]] are designed to assess students' understanding (and sometimes also other things such as knowledge and writing abilities) without falling prey to these risks. They do this partly by asking multiple different questions about a topic to reduce the risk of [[measurement error]], and partly by forbidding access to reference works and the outside world to reduce the risk of someone else's understanding being passed off as one's own. Because of the faster and more accurate computation and memorization abilities of computers, such tests would arguably often have to be modified if they were to be used to accurately assess the understanding of an artificial intelligence.

Conversely, it is even easier for a person or artificial intelligence to fake a ''shallower'' level of understanding than they actually have; they simply need to respond with the same kind of answers that someone with a more limited understanding, or no understanding, would respond with — such as "I don't know", or obviously wrong answers. This is relevant for judges in [[Turing test]]s; it is unlikely to be effective to simply ask the respondents to mentally calculate the answer to a very difficult arithmetical question, because the computer is likely to simply dumb itself down and pretend not to know the answer.

==As a model==
[[Gregory Chaitin]], a noted computer scientist, propounds a view that comprehension is a kind of [[data compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192140/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Limits of Reason", he argues that ''understanding'' something means being able to figure out a simple set of rules that explains it. For example, we understand why day and night exist because we have a simple [[conceptual model|model]]—the rotation of the earth—that explains a tremendous amount of data—changes in brightness, temperature, and atmospheric composition of the earth. We have compressed a large amount of information by using a simple model that [[prediction|predicts]] it. Similarly, we understand the number [[repeating decimal|0.33333...]] by thinking of it as one-third. The first way of representing the number requires five concepts ("0", "decimal point", "3", "infinity", "infinity of 3"); but the second way can produce all the data of the first representation, but uses only three concepts ("1", "division", "3"). Chaitin argues that comprehension is this ability to compress data.

==Components==
=== Cognition and affect ===
{{Main article | cognition | affect (psychology)}}
Cognition is the process by which [[sense|sensory]] inputs are transformed. Affect refers to the experience of feelings or [[emotion]]s. Cognition and affect constitute understanding.

==Religious perspectives==
In [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], understanding is one of the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].

In [[astrobiology]], the '''Uniformity of Motive''' theory suggests that any civilization in the [[universe]] would go through similar technological steps in their development. This theory supports the idea that at some point in their history, advanced alien civilizations would use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] medium for communications, and thus would emit radio waves that could be detected by projects such as [[SETI]].

The fact that no artificial EM band communications have ever been detected supports the [[Fermi Principle]], which in conjunction with the Uniformity of Motive theory, and [[Occam's razor]] suggests that a civilization that uses this medium is a unique occurrence in Earth's region of the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps the universe.

The '''Visayan leopard cat''' is a [[Sunda leopard cat]] (''Prionailurus javanensis sumatranus'') population in the [[Philippine Islands]] of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]] and [[Panay]].&lt;ref name=CatSG2017&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kitchener, A.

== Taxonomy ==
''Prionailurus bengalensis rabori'' was proposed in 1997 by [[Colin Groves]] on the basis of morphological analysis of a skin and skull. He considered it a [[leopard cat]] [[subspecies]].&lt;ref name="groves97"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Groves, C. P. |year=1997 |title=Leopard-cats, ''Prionailurus bengalensis'' (Carnivora: Felidae) from Indonesia and the Philippines, with the description of two new species |journal=Zeitschrift für Säugetierkunde |volume=62 |pages=330–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of [[phylogeographic]] research show that Sunda leopard cats from Borneo, Sumatra and the Philippine islands are [[Mitochondrial DNA#Female_inheritance|genetically]] very similar. The Sunda leopard cat probably reached the Philippine islands from Borneo after the [[Toba catastrophe theory|eruption of Toba Volcano]] during the [[late Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Patel, R.P., Wutke, S., Lenz, D., Mukherjee, S., Ramakrishnan, U., Veron, G., Fickel, J., Wilting, A. and Förster, D.W.  |year=2017 |title=Genetic structure and phylogeography of the leopard cat (''Prionailurus bengalensis'') inferred from mitochondrial genomes |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=349−360 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has therefore been subsumed to ''P. javanensis sumatranus'' in 2017.&lt;ref name=CatSG2017/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The fur of the Visayan leopard cat is dark ochre to buffy fawn with large and dark spots. Its skull is a little narrower than of Sumatran leopard cat and Bornean leopard cat.&lt;ref name="groves97"/&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Visayan leopard cat occurs on the Philippine islands of Panay and Negros where it inhabits remnant forest fragments. On Cebu, it has also been recorded in [[sugarcane]] farms.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; It is probably [[locally extinct]] or close to extinction on the islands of Cebu and [[Masbate]]. Panay and Negros islands have lost 90–95 % of their natural habitat.&lt;ref name=Lorica2013&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorica, M.R.P. &amp; L.R. Heaney |year=2013 |title=Survival of a native mammalian carnivore, the leopard cat ''Prionailurus bengalensis'' Kerr, 1792 (Carnivora: Felidae), in an agricultural landscape on an oceanic Philippine island |journal=Journal of Threatened Taxa |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=4451–4460}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- == Kitten mortality due to habitat loss ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
It is clear that the Visayan leopard cat mothers frequently and gives birth in sugar cane fields, presumably attracted by dense cover and an ample supply of rats and other agricultural pests. It is not clear whether pregnant cats migrate into the cane fields from neighboring forest patches to give birth, or whether they permanently inhabit agricultural areas. In either case, the harvesting of sugar cane has disastrous consequences for any females rearing litters, which they are then forced to abandon.
Most kittens orphaned in this way die before or shortly after they reach rescue centers, probably from dehydration or other factors relating to their age and the length of time between their capture and arrival at the center, which can be several days. Improved personnel training, access to expert advice, better equipment, better milk substitutes, and imported vaccines all can contribute to improving the kittens' chances of survival.  Rescued kittens almost certainly represent the only captive stock, though even this number of individuals is now putting a severe strain on available resources. --&gt;

'''Waunetta McClellan Dominic''' (23 July 1921 – 21 December 1981) was an [[Odawa]] rights activist who spent her career advocating for the United States government to adhere to its treaty obligations to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s. She was one of the founders of the [[Northern Michigan Ottawa Association]] and her influence was widely recognized, especially after winning a 1971 claim against the government for compensation under 19th century treaties. She was also a proponent of Native American fishing rights being protected. In 1979, she was named by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' as "Michiganian of the Year" and in 1996, she was posthumously inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Waunetta G. McClellan was born on 23 July 1921 in [[Petoskey, Michigan]]{{sfn|Michigan Legislature|1982|p=20}} to Elizabeth "Lizzie" (née Taylor) and Levi P. McClellan.{{sfn|Michigan Legislature|1982|p=20}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1920|p=1B}}{{sfn|Michigan Marriage Records|1915|p=367}} Her great-grandfather was a leader of the [[Grand River Band of Ottawas]].{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1969|p=1}}  She initially attended school in Petoskey and completed her studies at the [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Indian Institute]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. Marrying Robert Dominic in 1940, the couple made their home in [[Detroit]] and [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], before returning to Petoskey in 1944.{{sfn|Michigan Legislature|1982|p=20}}

==Career==
The [[Indian termination policy]] established by the federal government in the 1940s created the [[Indian Claims Commission]] in 1946, as a means of compensating tribes for previous land takings, undervaluations of compensation, and abridgement of rights.{{sfn|Sutton|2014|pp=303–304}} The problem for the Odawa was that the [[Treaty of Detroit (1855)|1855 Treaty of Detroit]] had been interpreted as severing the tribal governments of each of the bands.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=13–14}} To be eligible for filing a claim, they first had to confirm that the bands had "continued to be distinct, self-governing nations".{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=14}} In 1946, the Dominics called for a meeting of local tribes at the local Petoskey grocery store. Only 20 members showed up, making them realize the need to organize. Traveling throughout the state to document descendants of Odawa listed on the Durant Roll (1907–1910), they identified 3,000 American Indians who might be eligible to pursue claims against the U. S. government.{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1969|pp=1, 16}}    
In 1948, Dominic, her father, and her husband founded the [[Northern Michigan Ottawa Association]] (NMOA), with Robert serving as president of the organization and Waunetta serving as secretary.{{sfn|''The Traverse City Record-Eagle''|1968|p=13}} The organization contained eleven bands of northern [[Odawa]] who had been signatories to the [[Treaty of Washington (1836)|1836 Treaty of Washington]] and the subsequently signed 1855 Treaty of Detroit.{{sfn|Cleland|1992|p=271}}{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=14, 18–19}} The following year, they filed a claim under the Claims Commission.{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1969|pp=1, 16}}

Because most of the tribes their organization represented were not reservation tribes, Dominic was concerned about their lack of access to health care. She fought for the right for NMOA members to be treated at the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]'s Kinchloe Indian Clinic. Recognizing how few Michigan Indians had received higher education, she discovered federal programs that could be utilized and worked to assist Indian students in obtaining grants and scholarships.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=127}} Dominic also was a driving force in the Michigan State tuition waiver program for Native American Students.{{sfn|Dominic|2014|p=30}} 

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#F2BDCD|align=right|quote="You can call us unrecognized, but don't call us unorganized, and furthermore, I don't care if you recognize me or not," said Dominic, "Recognize my Rights".|source=—Waunetta Dominic, 1972 speech to the U. S. Congress{{sfn|Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|1996}}{{sfn|VanDeCar|2013|p=3}}}}

In 1959, the government conceded that the bands of Chippewa and Odawa who had signed the treaties had ceded nearly 13,000,000 acres of land and were entitled to a reassessment of whether they were paid a fair value. Because the [[Keweenaw Bay Indian Community]], [[Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|L’Anse Lac Vieux Desert Band of Chippewa]], and the [[Ontonagon Band| Ontonagon Band of Chippewa]] had reorganized under the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], their members were removed as claimants in the suit, which then went to arbitration over the amount of settlement.{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1959|p=29}} Dominic traversed the state examining land records in each county in the state to analyze the variance in payment made to American Indians and the price white settlers sold their lands for historically. She discovered that when the treaties were written in the nineteenth century, Native Americans were paid half of one cent to seventeen cents per acre, when white transactions in the same period were negotiated between ninety-two and ninety-seven cents per acre.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=125}} 

Finally winning a $12.1 million settlement in 1971, which was reduced to $10.3 million because of funds previously paid,{{sfn|''The Holland Evening Sentinel''|1972|p=28}}{{sfn|''The Traverse City Record-Eagle''|1972|p=1}} the Dominic's battle continued.{{sfn|Cleland|1992|p=271}}{{sfn|Dammann|1997}} Having won the judgement, the problem became how it was to be distributed. The Claims Commission recognized the NMOA and allowed it to pursue the case, but the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] refused to allow the association to reorganize under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], claiming that as an association rather than a tribal government, each band would need to seek individual recognition.{{sfn|Fletcher|2012|p=165}}{{sfn|Pflüg|1998|p=116}} The initial bill proposed to direct the distribution was rejected by Dominic, as it did not include either non-reservation tribes people{{sfn|''The Evening News''|1973|p=1}} (at that point the only reservation tribes were the three which had been eliminated from the suit and the [[Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians|Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians]], which had been reorganized in 1972){{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1959|p=29}}{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=18}} nor the [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum requirements]] the tribe members wanted.{{sfn|''The Escanaba Daily Press''|1971|p=14}}{{sfn|''The Ludington Daily News''|1971|p=2}} 

Dominic was the spokesperson for the (NMOA) on fishing rights, often acting as an intermediary between Native and white fisherman.{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}} In the 1975 a lawsuit, ''United States v. Michigan'', was filed concerning those fishing rights and she testified to tribal procedures for issuing licenses and penalties for infractions.{{sfn|Fletcher|2012|p=202}} The 1979 ruling allowed tribes to continue with gill net fishing, though controversy would continue until 1985 over fishing rights.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=128}} In 1976, upon her husband's death, Dominic became president of the NMOA and led the organization until her death.{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}} Throughout the 1970s, she traveled giving assistance to Odawa with their genealogical records to allow them to participate in the claim distribution and fought to secure that $1.8 million of those funds were set aside for tribes which did not gain federal recognition.{{sfn|Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|1996}}{{sfn|''The Ironwood Daily Globe''|1977|p=2}} She was noted as one of the most influential Native Americans in the state, having led the NMOA to become the largest American Indian organization in the state. In 1979, she was honored by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' as "Michiganian of the Year".{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}}

==Death and legacy==
Dominic died on 21 December 1981 in Petoskey at Northern Michigan Hospital.{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}} She was posthumously inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1996.{{sfn|Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|1996}} Eventually all the bands of the NOMA would gain recognition, though three of the bands, the [[Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians]], the [[Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan]] and ironically, her own band, the [[Grand River Band of Ottawas]] are only recognized at the state level.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=14, 18–19}}{{sfn|Michigan Department of Human Services|2014|p=67}} In 1998, the federal government finally agreed to distribute the funds awarded to the Odawa. Having been held in trust since 1971, the final amount of the award was close to $74 million.{{sfn|Dammann|1997}} In 2014, Dominic was again recognized by the Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame, during an exhibit hosted to celebrate six women involved in the struggle for Civil Rights.{{sfn|Dominic|2014|p=1}}
