The '''Atlantic Jewish Council''', founded in 1975, is the Atlantic Canadian local partner of the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], and was previously the Atlantic Canadian office of the Canadian Jewish Congress. According to its mission statement, it is primarily tasked with "Israel advocacy, community relations, fighting [[anti-Semitism]], and promoting [[interfaith dialogue]] and [[multiculturalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theajc.ns.ca/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629030205/http://www.theajc.ns.ca/about.php |archivedate=2010-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Conter is the president of its board of directors, and its executive director is Jon Goldberg. As a result of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]]' reorganization in 2007, the AJC became an individual member rather than an affiliate organization of the CJC; this was further reformed after the establishment of the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], which subsumed the CJC in 2011. The AJC also owns and operates [[Camp Kadimah]].

==Camp Kadimah==
'''Camp Kadimah''', founded in 1943 and affiliated with [[Canadian Young Judaea]], is located on the [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore of Nova Scotia]] in [[Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg County]]. Campers range from 8–16 years of age. Its mission statement, according to its website, is "to build a foundation of Jewish identity and a love of Israel in generations of campers and staff, by providing a safe, caring community in which to foster knowledge, skills and leadership, for the benefit of Atlantic and Canadian Jewish Children." Many of  the campers are from Toronto, Ontario but there remains a large portion of campers from Halifax. Many of the campers also from Israel.

There are 5 sections are the camp. The youngest sections, Gibborim, Goshrim, and Kochot occupied the main side of the bridge. Gibborim, the youngest section, means 'mighty.' Goshrim, for children aged 10-11, means 'bridge builders.' Kochot, the next section means 'power.' Machar, the eldest section as well as the section that occupies the other side of the bridge, means 'tomorrow.' There is also a CIT program that fosters the development of teenagers into adults. The CIT's live on the Machar side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campkadimah.com/About-Us.php&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Kosher]] and nut-free. In 2009, ten teenagers from [[Sderot, Israel]] attended Camp Kadimah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17441&amp;Itemid=86&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp Kadimah is a founding member of the Summer Camp Health Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schicanada.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at advancing the health promotion and prevention of injuries and illnesses at Summer Camps in Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9795">After the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] on the island [[Bali]] in [[Indonesia]] in December, 2007 the participating nations adopted the '''Bali Road Map''' as a two-year process to finalizing a binding agreement in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 in Copenhagen]]. The conference encompassed meetings of several bodies, including the 13th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 13) and the 3rd Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP 3 or CMP 3).

The Bali Road Map includes the Bali Action Plan (BAP) that was adopted by Decision 1/CP.13 of the [[COP-13]]. It also includes the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/4577.php |title=Ad Hoc Working Group, AWG-KP |publisher=Unfccc.int |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-02-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105130859/http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/4577.php| archivedate= 5 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiations and their 2009 deadline, the launch of the Adaptation Fund, the scope and content of the Article 9 review of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], as well as decisions on technology transfer and on reducing emissions from deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_13/items/4049.php |title=United Nations Climate Change Conference, 3–14 December, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, (COP 13 and CMP 3) |publisher=Unfccc.int |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100204002900/http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_13/items/4049.php| archivedate= 4 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bali Action Plan ==

=== Pillars ===
The Conference of Parties decided to launch a comprehensive process to enable the implementation of the Convention through long-term cooperative action, now, up to and beyond 2012, by addressing: (the called pillars or building blocks)
* A shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emission reduction]]s.
* Enhanced national/international action on [[mitigation of climate change]].
* Enhanced action on adaptation.
* Enhanced action on [[technology development]] and transfer to support action on mitigation and adaptation.
* Enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation.

=== Cutting emissions ===
The nations acknowledge that evidence for [[global warming]] is ''unequivocal'', and that humans must reduce emissions to reduce the risks of "severe climate change impacts" and emphasized the urgency to address climate change. There was a strong consensus for updated changes for both developed and developing countries. Although there were not specific numbers agreed upon in order to cut emissions,the decision recognized that there was a need for "deep cuts in global emissions" (plural countries proposed 100% reduction in 2050) and that "developed country emissions must fall 10-40% by 2020".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Pew%20Center_COP%2013%20Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mitigation ===
Enhanced action on mitigation of climate change includes, inter alia:
* [[Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action|Nationally appropriate mitigation commitments]] or actions by all developed countries.
* [[Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action|Nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs)]] by developing countries.
* Cooperative sectorial approaches and sector-specific actions (CSAs).
* Ways to strengthen the catalytic role of the convention.

==== Forests ====
{{See also|REDD-plus}}
The nations pledge "[[policy]] [[wikt:approach|approaches]] and positive incentives" on issues relating to [[reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] ([[REDD]]) in developing countries; and enhancement of [[forest carbon stock]] in developing countries This paragraph is referred to as “REDD-plus”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/redd-an-introduction/ |title=REDD: An introduction |publisher=REDD-Monitor |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2010-02-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100109110739/http://www.redd-monitor.org/redd-an-introduction/| archivedate= 9 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptation ===
The nations opt for enhanced co-operation to "support urgent implementation" of measures to protect poorer countries against climate change, including NAPAs. impacts.

=== Technology ===
In [[technology development]] and [[technology transfer|transfer]], the nations will consider how to facilitate the transfer of clean and renewable energy technologies from industrialised nations to the developing countries.This includes, inter alia:
* Removal of obstacles to, and provision of financial and other incentives for, [[Scalability|scaling up]] the development and transfer of technology to developing country Parties in order to promote access to affordable [[environmentally sound technology|environmentally sound technologies]] (renewable energies, electric vehicles).
* Ways to accelerate the [[wikt:deployment|deployment]], [[wikt:diffussion|diffussion]] and transfer of such technologies.
* Cooperation on research and development of current, new and innovative technology, including [[win-win solution]]s.
* The effectiveness of mechanism and tools for technology cooperation in specific sectors.

=== Finance ===
Provision of financial resources and investment includes:
* Improved access to predictable and sustainable financial resources and the provision of new and additional resources, including [[official funding|official]] and [[concessional funding]] for developing country Parties (dcP).
* [[Positive incentive]]s for dcP for national mitigation strategies and adaptation action.
* Innovative means of funding for dcP that are particularly vulnerable to the [[adverse impacts of climate change]] in meeting the costs of adaptation.
* Incentivisation of adaptation actions on the basis of [[sustainable development]] policies.
* Mobilization of funding and investment, including facilitation of [[climate-friendly investment]] choices.
* Financial and technical support for [[capacity-building]] in the [[assessment of cost]]s of adaptation in developing countries, to aid in determining their financial needs.

== Ad Hoc Working Groups ==

The Conference decided to establish two subsidiary bodies under the Convention to conduct the process, the [[Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action]] (AWG-LCA) and the [[Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol]] (AWG-KP), that were to complete their work in 2009 and present the outcome to the [[COP15]]/MOP 5.

The AWG-LCA and AWG-KP presented draft conclusions to [[COP15|COP15 and CMP5]], which contained many unresolved issues. The working groups were subsequently asked to report to [[COP16|COP16 and CMP6]] in Cancun, Mexico.

== Timescales ==
Four major UNFCCC meetings to implement the Bali Road Map were planned for 2008, with the first to be held in either March or April and the second in June, with the third in either August or September followed by a major meeting in [[Poznań]], Poland in December 2008. The negotiations process was scheduled to conclude at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]] in Copenhagen, Denmark.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1728">A '''Banneret''' was the name of an officer or magistrate of [[Rome]] towards the close of the 14th century. The people of Rome, and throughout the territory of the church, during [[Western Schism|the disputes]] of the [[antipope]]s, had formed a kind of republican government; where the whole power was lodged in the hands of a magistrate called ''Senator'', and twelve heads of quarters called ''Bannerets'', by reason of the banners which each raised in his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation-attribution|

[[File:Italian ice.jpg|thumb|right|A cup of blue raspberry [[Italian ice]] at the [[Taste of Chicago]] festival]]
'''Blue raspberry''' is a common [[flavoring]] for candy, snack foods, syrups, and soft drinks. The flavor ostensibly originates from ''[[Rubus leucodermis]]'', more commonly known as the "whitebark raspberry" or "blue raspberry" for the blue-black color of its fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoplantus.fr/Blue-raspberry-cane-Rubus-Leucodermis |title=Rubus Leucodermis - Exoplantus |publisher=exoplantus.fr (archived August 23, 2011) |date= |accessdate=January 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823090245/http://www.exoplantus.fr/Blue-raspberry-cane-Rubus-Leucodermis |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food products labeled as blue raspberry flavor often contain a bright blue food coloring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natural-food-color.com/News/206/ |title=Natural-Food-Color.com |publisher=Natural-Food-Color.com (archived September 12, 2012) |date= |accessdate=January 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309221725/http://www.natural-food-color.com/News/206/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common being [[Brilliant Blue FCF]], although this coloring is not an accurate rendition of the actual color of the fruit, which has an almost black hue when ripe.  The blue color also helps distinguish raspberry-flavored foods from [[cherry]]- and [[strawberry]]-flavored foods (the former usually being colored [[red]], and the latter also sometimes colored red but often colored [[pink]] if the same product is also available in a cherry flavor).

In [[political economy]] and [[international relations]], '''conditionality''' is the use of conditions attached to the provision of benefits such as a [[loan]], [[debt relief]] or [[bilateral aid]]. These conditions are typically imposed by [[international financial institutions]] or regional organizations and are intended to improve economic conditions within the recipient country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==International financial institutions==
Conditionality is typically employed by the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] or a donor country with respect to loans, debt relief and financial aid. Conditionalities may involve relatively uncontroversial requirements to enhance [[aid effectiveness]], such as anti-[[political corruption|corruption]] measures, but they may involve highly controversial ones, such as [[austerity]] or the [[privatization]] of key [[public services]], which may provoke strong political opposition in the recipient country. These conditionalities are often grouped under the label [[structural adjustment]] as they were prominent in the structural adjustment programs following the debt crisis of the 1980s.

==Ex-ante vs. ex-post==
Much debate in types of conditionality centers around ex-ante versus ex-post conditionality. In ex-post conditionality, the country receiving aid agrees to conditions set by the donor or lender that they will carry out ''after'' they receive the aid. Later follow-ups determine whether they might receive more aid.
Ex-ante conditionality requires a country to meet certain conditions and prove it can maintain them ''before'' it will receive any aid.&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Collins, University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy. Public Policy 201 Lecture on Global Poverty&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the IMF lends funds based on ex-post criteria, which might induce moral hazard behavior by the borrowing country. The moral hazard problem appears when a government behaves in a risky manner in the anticipation that it can turn to the IMF in the case of a crisis. Institutional reforms of the International Monetary Fund, such as the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in 1999, attempt to reduce moral hazard by relying more on pre-set qualification criteria (i.e. ex-ante).&lt;ref&gt;Dreher, A. (2009), [http://www.springerlink.com/content/101318436478w6w1/fulltext.pdf "IMF Conditionality: Theory and Evidence"], Public Choice, 141, 233-267&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Tied' aid==
Other types of conditionality that often occur are aid which is tied to be used in a specific way. For example, many countries tie aid to the purchasing of domestic products, although this practice has drastically decreased over the past 15 years. The [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Report]] in 2005 estimated that only about 8 per cent of bilateral aid is 'tied', down from 27 per cent in 1990. This however varies from country to country with the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway giving 100 per cent of their aid untied, and Canada, Austria and Spain giving less than 60 per cent. &lt;sup&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;

==European Union==
The [[European Union]] also employs conditionality with respect to [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]], with membership conditional on candidate countries meeting the [[Copenhagen criteria]] and adopting the [[acquis communautaire]].

'''Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France''' ('''CRIF''') ({{lang-en|Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions}}) is an umbrella organization of French Jewish organizations.

==Overview==
It is the official French affiliate of the [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organization of Jewish communities, and of the [[European Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/WJC_Affiliates_List.pdf World Jewish Congress - Affiliates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521115143/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/WJC_Affiliates_List.pdf |date=21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It opposes [[antisemitism]] and policies that they perceive to be antisemitic. It generally supports [[Zionism|Zionist]] goals and the state of [[Israel]], although CRIF denounced Israeli [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]]'s 2004 characterization of antisemitism in France and his calls for all French Jews to emigrate to Israel.

On 20 November 2004, it accused the French government of failing to protect citizens from broadcasts by [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Al-Manar|al-Manar TV]], which includes films that CRIF claims are [[antisemitic]] and incite Muslims to attack Jews. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/503916.html (Reuters-Haaretz)] Al-Manar was blocked by the [[Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel|CSA]]. It has opposed the beatification of [[Pius XII]], stating that a majority of independent historians did not agree with the position that Pius worked ceaselessly to save Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/31203 Ejpress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020024156/http://www.ejpress.org/article/31203 |date=20 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And, specially, the competition allowed her to meet Anita Mui. The diva of cantopop would become her mentor, and the career of Denise Ho, with HoCC as her stage name, was launched. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she began her primary school education, at the [[Diocesan Girls' School|Diocesan Girls' Junior School]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

She then began studies at [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (UQAM),&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; in graphic design.&lt;ref name=lapresse/&gt;

==Career==
===1996–1999===
At age 19, Ho enrolled in a song contest in Hong Kong—the 1996 [[New Talent Singing Awards]]&lt;ref name=hkmag102014&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lo, Andrea|date=30 October 2014|title=Denise Ho profile|format=list of self-made statements, sans questions|url=http://hk-magazine.com/city-living/article/denise-ho|accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106152146/http://hk-magazine.com/city-living/article/denise-ho|archive-date=6 November 2014|quote=[Quote:] After I came back to Hong Kong, I joined the New Talent Singing Awards [in 1996].

In the intervening period between the contents win and her first album, Ho toured as a background vocalist with Mui,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and hosted various television programs produced by [[TVB]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===2000–2004===
Ho released her first album "First" in 2001, in her fourth year of the contract with [[Capital Artists]]. Produced by Choy Yat Chi of [[Grasshopper (band)]], this EP, containing her first single "Thousands more of me" ([[千千萬萬個我]]）and "Home of Glory" ([[光榮之家]]），defined with success Ho's style as the rock pop independent female she is up till recent years. She earned the gold award of "Best new singer" of the year in CRHK and also in various awards ceremony. In October of the same year, Capital Artists announced bankruptcy， resulting in the end of Ho's first record label era.

After Capital Artists closed, Ho joined [[EMI]] in 2002. Although she was only with the company for a brief 2-year period, it was during this time that her musical talents flourished. She teamed up with Ying C Foo (英師傅) for her first [[EMI]] label release, [[hocc² (EP)|hocc²]]. The song "Angel Blues" (天使藍), composed by Ho herself, not only reached top spots on music charts, but according to Ho, it is also her "growing up" song.&lt;ref name="hk.myblog.yahoo.com"/&gt;

Another single in the EP, "Rosemary" (露絲瑪莉), written by [[Wyman Wong]], created considerable controversies at the time, as it touched on the topic of lesbianism. This song also marked the beginning of Ho's series of songs containing gay themes.  Following the success of "Rosemary" (露絲瑪莉), Ho continued the story of the two lovers in "Goodbye... Rosemary" (再見…露絲瑪莉) in her first full-length album, [[free love (Album)|free love]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The year 2002 proved to be a successful year for Ho. The two singles "Angel Blues" (天使藍) and "Goodbye... Rosemary" (再見…露絲瑪莉) won multiple music awards in Hong Kong, including CASH Golden Sail Music Awards (CASH金帆音樂獎) – "Best Vocal Performance by a Female Artist" for the song "Angel Blues".  In the same year, Ho won the renowned "Female Singer Bronze Award" in the Commercial Radio Hong Kong Annual Awards (叱吒樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 2003, Ho did a "Music is Live" concert with [[Andy Hui]], who is also an apprentice of [[Anita Mui]]. Their performance won praise from the critics, and Ho proved to the audience her abilities to perform live as a musician. Later that year, Ho released her second full-length album [[Dress Me Up! (Album)|Dress Me Up!]].  She was the credited as the producer of the album, indicating that Ho has finally gained full control over her music. In September 2003, Ho's longtime mentor, [[Anita Mui]] announced she was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]]. Shortly after the announcement, [[Anita Mui|Anita]] lost her battle against cervical cancer and died on 30 December 2003. Between 2003 and 2004, Ho took on the role of hosting [[TVB]]'s weekly live music show, [[Jade Solid Gold]]. In 2004, she appeared in [[Sammi Cheng]]'s 2004 "Sammi vs. Sammi" concert as a cross-dressing cigarette-smoking admirer of Sammi Cheng. Ho's critically acclaimed performance in the short musical segment not only brought attention to the role she played, but also further established herself as a tremendous live performer. In September 2004, Ho signed a contract with [[East Asia Music]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===2005–2009===
The album [[艷光四射 (album)|''Glam'']], which pays tribute to the superstars of the 80's, was released in January 2005. It also marked the start of a close collaboration between Ho and the [[Green Mountain Orchestra]] band. She was named the [[Orbis International|Orbis]] Student Ambassador 2005, and visited Hainan in July. In September 2005, Ho performed in the musical ''[[Butterfly Lovers]]'' (梁祝下世傳奇) as the leading actress, producer and musical director. Her album of the same name gave her three Number 1 singles – "Becoming a Butterfly" (化蝶), "Lawrence and Lewis" (勞斯．萊斯) and "Coffee in a Soda Bottle" (汽水樽裡的咖啡), which are all based on the story of the ''[[Butterfly Lovers]]'', with possible homosexual themes. These singles helped her to receive the "Female Singer Silver Award" at the [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] Annual Awards 2005 (叱吒樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮).

Ho held her first [[Hong Kong Coliseum]] concert "[[Live in Unity|Live in Unity 2006]]" on 26–28 October 2006. The concert was a great success and was positively received by the public. She decided to stage a second concert, "[[Live in Unity|Live in Unity 2007]]", on 19–20 January 2007 following the original concert's success. Her single, [[We Stand As One]], named after the slogan for the "[[Live in Unity]]" concerts, was released on 11 January 2007. Recordings of the concert were later released in February 2007. She went on a worldwide tour, performing in [[Toronto]], Canada and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The significant public attention and positive reception to her music helped her garner the "Female Singer Gold Award" at the [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] Annual Awards 2006 (叱吒樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮). She sang the [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]] version of [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]'s song "[[Secret (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Secret]]", known as "Wounded City Secret" (傷城秘密), for the 2006 movie ''[[Confession of Pain]]''. She continued as the Orbis Student Ambassdor 2006 and visited Vietnam, and later started her own charitable fund. In 2008, a new album [[Ten Days in the Madhouse (Album)|''Ten Days in the Madhouse'']] was released. She produced this album from the viewpoint of society's outcasts and to raise awareness of mental health issues. She encouraged people to understand and find out more about people with mental illnesses and those who formerly suffered from mental illnesses, and care about their needs and situations. Ho encouraged communication between them and the public, ultimately, to achieve social harmony. "Ten Days in the Madhouse" was Ho's most ambitious project yet with the release of a documentary by Hong Kong director [[Yan Yan Mak]] (Butterfly) and an exhibition for charity, Ho showed that a multimedia project by a musician can be about something more important than clothing tie-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesasia.com/us/ten-days-in-the-madhouse-cd-dvd-limited-boxset/1013750663-0-0-0-en/info.html|title=Professional Review of "Ten Days in the Madhouse (CD+DVD) (Limited Boxset)"|date=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, she followed up her plan from the previous year and organised a free concert (a rarity in Hong Kong) called "Happiness is Free" in the outdoor courtyard in [[Diocesan Boys' School]].  She managed to book the place because her father was a teacher there. In June, she began shooting a new TVB sitcom titled ''[[O.L. Supreme]]'' with [[Liza Wang]]. In July, she released her new song "The Old Testament" (舊約) and announced that she would hold her "SUPERGOO" themed concerts would be held from 9–12 October that year. Following the concerts, Ho took on a role in the new stage comedy "Man and Woman, War and Peace" (男人與女人之戰爭與和平) directed by Edward Lam. The stage comedy was presented on 13–16 November at Kwai Tsing Theatre in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldt.org.hk|title=Edward Lam Dance Theatre profile|date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–2015===
In 2010, Ho appeared in the film ''[[Life Without Principle (film)|Life Without Principle]]'' directed by [[Johnnie To]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;''Life Without Principle'' was chosen as Hong Kong's entry as best foreign-language film in the 85th Academy Awards. See {{cite journal|author=Chu, Karen|date=21 September 2012|title='Life Without Principle' Chosen as Hong Kong's Foreign Oscar Entry|journal=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/life-principle-chosen-as-hong-372933|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, her first Mandarin album ''Nameless Poem'' (無名．詩) was released in Taiwan and Hong Kong,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and she held "Homecoming" concerts in Hong Kong in December 2010. In 2011, Ho received her first nomination for a Golden Melody Award, as Best Mandarin Female Singer, at the 22nd Annual ceremony for those awards.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2012, she was nominated for a Golden Horse Award for Best Actress, for her performance in the movie ''Life Without Principle'', which was won by Taiwan's [[Gwei Lun-mei]] at that 49th Annual ceremony. In 2013, Ho continued the tour of her play, ''Awakening'', in Singapore and in many cities in China. She released her second Mandarin album, Coexistence, whose theme is embracing and supporting others despite differences. Ho received her second nomination for a Golden Melody Popular Music Award, as Best Mandarin Female Singer, at the 25th Annual ceremony in 2015.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===2015–present===

==Activism==
When asked about the origins of her "passion for freedom of expression," Ho replied to reporter Frédéric Lelièvre of ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' that it was probably from her being an adolescent in Montreal at the time of the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].&lt;ref name=lapresse/&gt;

===LGBT issues===
Ho proudly announced herself as "[[Tongzhi (term)|tongzhi]]" (Cantonese:tongzi), a Chinese slang term for gay, at age 35, the fourth annual [[Hong Kong Pride Parade]] on 10 November 2012.&lt;ref name="gaystarnews.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yiu, Derek|date=10 November 2012|title=Pop star Denise Ho Comes Out at Hong Kong Pride|journal=Gay Star News|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/pop-star-denise-ho-comes-out-hong-kong-pride101112|accessdate=15 December 2016|quote=[Quote:] Cantopop singer Denise Ho 'proudly' calls herself 'tongzhi', a Chinese slang for gay people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GatesHP121110&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gates, Sara|date=13 November 2012|title=Queer Voices: Denise Ho, Cantonese Pop Star, Comes Out During Hong Kong’s Gay Pride Parade|journal=[[The Huffington Post]]|format=article and video|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/13/denise-ho-singer-gay-coming-out-hong-kong_n_2122773.html|accessdate=15 December 2016|quote=[Quote:] But during Hong Kong's fourth annual LGBT Pride Parade this weekend, the singer officially came out, calling herself "tongzhi," a Chinese slang word for gay./"As a celebrity, I think I have an obligation, a duty to stand forward for the sake of love and equality", the 35-year-old singer told the crowd, according to Shanghaiist./The announcement is particularly significant since Ho is the first mainstream female singer in Hong Kong to come out of the closet, according to several Hong Kong media outlets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Gates of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reports the various Hong Kong media outlets had indicated that Ho was the first "mainstream female singer in Hong Kong to come out of the closet."&lt;ref name=GatesHP121110/&gt; Since then, Ho has been involved in the Big Love Alliance (大愛同盟), a civil rights group striving equal rights for the LGBT community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1125817/singers-lawmakers-launch-big-love-gay-rights-campaign|title=Singers, lawmakers launch 'Big Love' gay rights campaign|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became a columnist for ''[[Apple Daily]]'' in 2014 {{relevance inline|date=December 2016}} and was recognised for her activism for [[LGBT rights in Hong Kong]].{{clarify|date=December 2016}}{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;!--Citations to check for support of "on stage at the "Dare to Love" event" and other appearing details:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=|work=The Huffington Post|title=WATCH: Hong Kong Pop Star Comes Out|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/entertainment/20121110/51137661|title=【阿詩出櫃】何韻詩：我係同志}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzK5_eyCAh8|title=何韻詩出櫃宣言|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fridae.asia/newsfeatures/2012/11/12/12051.pop-singer-denise-ho-comes-out-as-gay-at-hong-kong-pride-parade|title=Pop singer Denise Ho comes out as gay at Hong Kong pride parade|publisher=Gay News Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Ho faced a visa refusal by Malaysia on February 2018, which forced her to cancel the concert on April, allegedly related to her stance on LGBT and her LGBT identity.

===Pro-democracy activism===
[[File:Denise Ho Wan Si (cropped).JPG|thumb|Denise Ho speaking during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].]]
Ho supported the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], and a protester herself. On the subject, she stated, "I saw the students rushing in, then the tear gas... There was no option but to stand up. [...] My favourite thing about Hong Kong is this moment in time – but it's also my least favorite. The most beautiful and the ugliest sides of Hong Kong are both happening right here. The Hong Kong spirit of helping each other out is something that was lost for a long time. But that's making a return. I don't like the greed, the selfishness, and the indifference some people feel towards what's happening in society."&lt;ref name=hkmag102014/&gt;

On 5 June 2016, French cosmetics brand [[Lancôme]] cancelled a promotional concert by Denise Ho that was scheduled to be held on 19 June in [[Sheung Wan]].&lt;ref name="scraps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeung|first1=Raymond|title=Lancome scraps Hong Kong concert with Denise Ho: online backlash over move to distance itself from pro-democracy star|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1966367/lancome-scraps-hong-kong-concert-denise-ho-online-backlash|work=South China Morning Post|date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was taken in response to a boycott campaign launched by the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]]-controlled ''[[Global Times]]'', which denigrated her for supposedly supporting [[Hong Kong independence|Hong Kong]] and [[Tibet independence]].&lt;ref name="scraps"/&gt;

Lancôme added, in a Facebook post, that Ho is not a spokesperson for the brand.&lt;ref name="cancels"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lancome cancels concert after Chinese online backlash|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36457450|publisher=BBC News|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibet allegation appeared to have stemmed from Ho's May 2016 meeting with the [[Dalai Lama]]. The cancellation drew a heavy backlash in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="scraps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cancels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denise Ho controversy: protesters march despite Lancome closing Hong Kong stores|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1969055/denise-ho-controversy-protesters-march-despite-lancome|work=South China Morning Post|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho says that citizens' wish for self-rule ought not to be considered a crime.&lt;ref name=lapresse/&gt;

Shortly after the Lancôme incident, Ho announced a crowd-sponsorship campaign named "Togetherly Exclusive Sponsorship" for her Hong Kong Coliseum concert "Dear Friend,", (which was planned to be held in October of the same year), in response to being avoided by corporates.&lt;ref name="crowdfunds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cantopop star Denise Ho successfully crowdfunds upcoming concert following mainland backlash|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/14/cantopop-star-denise-ho-successfully-crowdfunds-upcoming-concert-following-mainland-backlash/|publisher=HKFP|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign amazingly drew in near to 300 individual and business sponsors priced at $15k HKD each, which headlined newspapers and generated overall support within the general public. The 4 showings of the concert, a total of 50000 tickets, sold out within two hours.&lt;ref name="soldout"&gt;{{cite news|title=Denise Ho Plays to Full House at Hong Kong Coliseum|url=https://www.theepochtimes.com/denise-ho-plays-to-full-house-at-hong-kong-coliseum_2176763.html|publisher=Epoch Times|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 she was chosen as one of [[100 Women (BBC)|BBC's 100 Women]]&lt;ref name=list2016&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38012048 BBC's 100 Women], BBC.com; retrieved 24 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
Discrimination against [[Chinese Indonesians|people of Chinese descent in Indonesia]] has been carried out by governments in Indonesia since the time of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. Serious violence against Chinese people has occurred at irregular intervals since 1740, when the soldiers of the Dutch East India Company killed up to 10,000 people of Chinese descent during the ''[[1740 Batavia massacre|Chinezenmoord]]''. The worst outbreaks took place in 1945-49 during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] against Dutch rule. There were significant outbreaks in the early 1960s. Violence against Chinese also took place in 1965 after the failed coup attempt during [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|anti-communist purges]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UFNKQcvGNSAC&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coppel 2008], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;, but the number of Chinese victims in these events is often exaggerated; the main target of the killings were [[Native Indonesians|Native Indonesian]] communists. In 1998, many Chinese businesses were burned down, while dozens of women raped during the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|May riots]].

== Forms ==

=== Violence ===

Violence against Chinese Indonesians is generally limited to attacks on property, including factories and shops.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=241}} However, killings and assaults have happened, including in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] in 1740, [[Tangerang]] in 1946, during the period after the [[30 September Movement]] of 1965, and during the May 1998 riots.{{sfn|Tan|2008|pp=239–248}}

Some observers suggest that Chinese Indonesians have become "the typical [[scapegoat]]" in situations where widespread discontent and social unrest becomes violent. The scapegoating has become more pronounced during the period since Indonesia’s independence.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=239}}

=== Language ===

Terms considered disparaging against Chinese Indonesians have entered common [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] usage, at both the regional and national levels. The term ''Cina'', the use of which was mandated in 1967 instead of the then-commonly used ''Tionghoa'', was perceived as having similar negative connotations to ''Inlander'' for Native Indonesians.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=986–987}} The term ''Tionghoa'' began to be used again after the beginning of Reformation, but by then ''Cina'' was not considered negative by the younger generation of Chinese Indonesians.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=2}}

In different regions different terms have come into use that reflect common stereotypes. The following examples are from [[Surakarta]].{{sfn|Kinasih|2007|p=111}}

=== Legislation ===

After the end of Company rule and the introduction of metropolitan [[Dutch East Indies|colonial rule]] in 1815, [[legislation on Chinese Indonesians|legislation]] was introduced specifically against Chinese Indonesians. One of the first was in 1816 and required ethnic Chinese to carry a special pass at all times.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=12}}

During the Sukarno regime in 1958, all Chinese Indonesians were required to state their intent to stay Indonesian citizens {{efn|name=A}} and in 1959 Chinese who were not citizens were forbidden from doing business outside of urban areas.{{efn|name=B}}{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=811–815}} The discrimination continued into the New Order. Chinese Indonesians were urged to choose [[Indonesian name|Indonesian-sounding names]],{{efn|name=C}}{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=987}} forbidden to practice their traditions publicly,{{efn|name=D}}{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=230}} and required to obtain extra proof of citizenship.{{efn|name=D}}{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=1028}} In total, forty five directly or indirectly discriminatory laws were passed during the New Order.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=247}} Although the majority of this legislation was rescinded during the presidencies of [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] and [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]],{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=1090–1091}} instances of enforcement continued.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=179}}

== History ==

=== Background ===

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Chinese zeilschepen Yonken Sin Tong Heng (links) en Tek Hwa Seng bij Poeloe Samboe TMnr 10010680.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junk]]s ''Sin Tong Heng'' and ''Tek Hwa Seng'' in the [[Singapore Strait]], {{circa}} 1936]]

Based on Chinese artifacts found in Indonesia, China is thought to have had trading relations with the [[Indonesian archipelago]] since the first century B.C.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=20}} However, the first recorded movement of people from China into the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] was the arrival of [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] forces under [[Kublai Khan]] that culminated in the [[Mongol invasion of Java]] in 1293. The Mongols introduced Chinese technology to the island, particularly [[shipbuilding]] and [[Ancient Chinese coinage]]. Their intervention also hastened the decline of the classical kingdoms and precipitated the rise of the [[Majapahit]] empire.{{sfn|Reid|2001|p=17}}

Later, [[Chinese Muslim]] traders from the eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and [[Malaysia]] in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner [[Zheng He]], who led [[Treasure voyages|several expeditions to southeastern Asia]] between 1405 and 1430.{{sfn|Ma|2005|p=115}} These traders settled along the northern coast of [[Java]], but there is no further documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. Scholars believe that the Chinese Muslims became absorbed into the majority Muslim population,{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=795}} until no Chinese communities remained when the Dutch arrived.{{sfn|Reid|2001|p=33}} Trade from China was re-established when it legalised private trade in 1567 and began licensing 50 [[Junk (ship)|junks]] a year. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in ports throughout the archipelago, including the pepper port of [[Banten]].{{sfn|Reid|1999|p=52}}

=== Colonial era ===

[[File:Tableau de la Partie de Batavia, ou s'est fait proprement le terrible Massacre des Chinois, le 9 Octob.jpeg|thumb|Chinese-owned houses were burned, while bodies were dumped into rivers and canals]]

By 1740, there were over 2,500 Chinese-owned houses within the [[Jakarta|Batavia]] city walls, with another 15,000 individuals living outside of the city limits.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=109}} Due to Chinese support of [[Native Indonesian]] campaigns against the Dutch, on 25 July 1740 the Dutch passed a resolution to "kill or disappear" Chinese who did not have a pass ({{lang-nl|permissiebriefje}}) and were unemployed;{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=112}} in practice this included traders and businessmen unwilling to be [[blackmail]]ed. Those so rounded up were put on ships to [[Ceylon]]. Other Chinese homes were subject to random searches, often accompanied by assault and robbery.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=113}}

Rumours soon spread that those sent to Ceylon were being killed, and the Chinese armed themselves. As the situation became tenser, Governor General [[Adriaan Valckenier]] held an emergency plenary session. On 7 October 1740, a group of hundreds of Chinese Indonesians attacked a Dutch stronghold in [[Tanah Abang]], killing 50. In response, a troop of 1,800 Company soldiers led by [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff]], together with militia ({{lang-nl|schutterij}}) and conscripts ({{lang-nl|pennist}}), began an [[1740 Batavia massacre|ethnic cleansing]] campaign.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=113}} They were later joined by Native Indonesians, fed by rumours of Chinese plans for rape and mass murder.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=114}} For two weeks, the troops burned Chinese-owned houses and stores, killing ethnic Chinese and dumping their bodies in the [[Ciliwung River]].{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=117–118}} Eventually an estimated 10,000 were killed, including 500 prisoners and hospital patients.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=119}} The surviving Chinese Indonesians in Batavia were moved to an area outside of the wall, in what is now [[Glodok]].{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=121}} This was later applied to other cities, where [[Chinatown]]s ({{lang-id|Pecinan}}) were built to segregate the Chinese and other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=14}} The event triggered a [[Java War (1741—1743)|two-year war]], in which Chinese and Javanese soldiers fought side by side.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=119}}

When the VOC was nationalised on 31 December 1799, the freedoms the Chinese experienced under the corporation were taken away by the Dutch government.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=11}} An 1816 regulation introduced a requirement for the indigenous population and Chinese travelling within the territory to obtain a travel permit. Those who did not carry a permit risked being arrested by security officers. The Governor-General also introduced a resolution in 1825 which forbade "foreign Asians" from living within the same neighbourhood as the native population.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=12}}

During the [[Java War]], thousands of Chinese Indonesians were killed by Prince [[Diponegoro]]'s forces during raids on the southern coast of Java. Survivors fled to the northern coast or to Dutch settlements for protection. Setiono cites the Chinese's status as tax collectors and loan providers as a cause, as well as Diponegoro's belief that the Chinese brought bad luck upon his campaign.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=173–181}}

In 1848, the Dutch colonial government enacted the legislation sorting all inhabitants of the archipelago into two groups, based on whether or not they practised Christianity. This was later amended in 1855, combining Native Indonesian, Chinese, [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]], and [[Indian Indonesian|Indian]] Christians with non-Christians. However, in practice the "foreign Orientals", were subject to separate regulations.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=15}}

}}

By 1912, the Dutch government had abandoned the policy of segregation. During the same period, the [[Xinhai Revolution]] awakened Chinese nationalism in the ethnic Chinese, while [[Sarekat Islam]] worked to awaken Indonesian nationalism in the Native Indonesian populace.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=6}} Tensions between Sarekat Islam and the ethnic Chinese led to racially charged riots in [[Surakarta]] (1912), [[Tangerang]] (1913), and [[Kudus Regency|Kudus]] (31 October 1918). Of these riots, the largest was in Kudus, where a group of rioters burned and looted forty houses and numerous [[Chinese temple]]s. At least 16 were killed in the riots.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=383–387}}

=== Japanese occupation and National Revolution (1942–1949) ===

After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupied Indonesia]] in 1942, at least 542 ethnic Chinese from Java and [[Madura]] were arrested and detained in the Cimahi concentration camp; this group included leaders, spouses of Europeans, and Chinese who were legally considered Europeans. Chinese organisations were disbanded and banned. Not long afterwards, ethnic Chinese were required to register themselves and pledge their allegiance to the Japanese army. Despite Japanese attempts to quell dissent,{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=530–531}} there were several underground resistance movements led by ethnic Chinese.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=534–535}}

This was followed by the [[Pontianak affair]] in October 1943. Over 1,500 people were arrested or killed by the Japanese occupying forces in an attempt to prevent a multi-ethnic rebellion. Ethnic Chinese were the largest single group targeted, with 854 killed in the affair.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=7}}

From 30 May to 4 June 1946, attacks from Indonesian independence fighters killed 653 Chinese Indonesians. Roughly a thousand Chinese Indonesian-owned homes were burned; [[Mely G. Tan]] notes this as the worst of the violence targeted at Chinese Indonesians during the war.{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=792}} More cases were reported in [[Karawaci, Tangerang|Karawaci]], [[Bayur]], and [[Bagansiapiapi]].{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=586–592}}

=== Old Order (1949–1965) ===

[[File:Presiden Sukarno.jpg|thumb|upright|Sukarno's government enacted legislation limiting Chinese Indonesians' trading rights]]

In 1955, [[Zhou Enlai]] declared that Chinese citizenship was ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. This led to a treaty between China and Indonesia regarding the legal status of Chinese Indonesians, which formed the basis for the Citizenship Law of 1958.{{sfn|Effendi|Prasetyadji|2008|pp=14–15}} This law required all Chinese Indonesians to choose between Chinese and Indonesian citizenship, making a statement at the nearest district court.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=751}} Approximately 390,000 ethnic Chinese rejected Chinese citizenship.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=9}}

In May 1959, the Sukarno government passed legislation revoking the trading rights of foreign nationals in rural areas; this was based on two previous, lower-level legislations.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=11}} Due to uncertainty relating to the legal status of the ethnic Chinese, they were included as well.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=811–815}} This led to the exodus of between 102,000{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=12}} and 136,000 Chinese Indonesians,{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=815}} who left for China on ships sent by the Chinese government.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=28}}

Between 1963 and early 1965, the situation for Chinese Indonesians generally became more stable. Numerous Chinese-language schools were opened and a Chinese-language press flourished. However, there were still minor attacks on Chinese Indonesians in [[Cirebon]], [[Sukabumi]], and [[Bandung]] in 1963.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=13}}

=== New Order (1965–1998) ===
During the riots following the abortive [[30 September Movement]] coup, Chinese Indonesians were sometimes targeted. Because most violence was against members and associates of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]], to which very few Chinese belonged, it is likely that much of this violence was opportunistic, rather than due to suspected ties to the Communist Party. Property was targeted by rioters, and some Chinese Indonesians were killed but there is no evidence to support the claim sometimes circulating on the internet that hundreds of thousands of Chinese Indonesians were killed. The best estimate is that thousands of Chinese Indonesians were killed (out of a total death toll of 500,000), with documented massacres taking place in [[Makassar]] and [[Medan]] and on the island of [[Lombok]].{{sfn|Tan|2008|pp=240–242}}{{sfn|Cribb|2009}} In [[West Kalimantan]], approximately eighteen months after the worst of the killings in Java, indigenous pagan [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] expelled 45,000 ethnic Chinese from rural areas, killing up to 5,000.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21"&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese refused to fight back, since they considered themselves "a guest on other people's land" with the intention of trading only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrdM8X7CBTAC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=In+1967,+Dayaks+had+expelled+Chinese+from+the+interior+of+West+Kalimantan.+In+this+Chinese+ethnic+cleansing,+Dayaks+were+coopted+by+the+military+who+wanted+to+remove+those+Chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201967%2C%20Dayaks%20had%20expelled%20Chinese%20from%20the%20interior%20of%20West%20Kalimantan.%20In%20this%20Chinese%20ethnic%20cleansing%2C%20Dayaks%20were%20coopted%20by%20the%20military%20who%20wanted%20to%20remove%20those%20Chinese&amp;f=false|title=Anomie and violence: non-truth and reconciliation in Indonesian peacebuilding|author=John Braithwaite|edition=|volume=|series= |year=2010 |location= |publisher=ANU E Press|language= |isbn=978-1-921666-22-3|page=294 |accessdate=15 Dec 2011|quote=In 1967, Dayaks had expelled Chinese from the interior of West Kalimantan. In this Chinese ethnic cleansing, Dayaks were coopted by the military who wanted to remove Chinese from the interior who they believed were supporting communists. The most certain way to accomplish this was to drive all Chinese out of the interior of West Kalimantan. An estimated 2,000–5,000 people were massacred (Davidson 2002:158) and probably a greater number died from the conditions in overcrowded refugee camps, including 1,500 Chinese children aged between one and eight who died of starvation in [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] camps (p. 173). The Chinese retreated to major towns. The Chinese in West Kalimantan rarely resisted (though they had in nineteenth century conflict with the Dutch and in 1914). Instead, they fled. One old Chinese man who fled to Pontianak in 1967 said that the Chinese did not even consider or discuss striking back at Dayaks as an option. This was because they were imbued with a philosophy of being a guest on other people's land to become a great trading diaspora.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=In+October+1967,+the+military,+with+the+help+of+the+former+Dayak+Governor+Oevaang+Oeray+and+his+Lasykar+Pangsuma+(Pangsuma+Militia)+instigated+and+facilitated+a+Dayak-led+slaughter+of+ethnic+Chinese.+Over+the+next+three+months#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20October%201967%2C%20the%20military%2C%20with%20the%20help%20of%20the%20former%20Dayak%20Governor%20Oevaang%20Oeray%20and%20his%20Lasykar%20Pangsuma%20(Pangsuma%20Militia)%20instigated%20and%20facilitated%20a%20Dayak-led%20slaughter%20of%20ethnic%20Chinese.%20Over%20the%20next%20three%20months&amp;f=false|title=Conflict, violence, and displacement in indonesia|author=Eva-Lotta E.

During the same period, numerous discriminative laws were passed. In April 1966, all Chinese schools (at the time numbering 629) were closed.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=979}} On 8 May 1966, Territorial Military Commander of [[Aceh]] [[Ishak Djarsa]] declared that all ethnic Chinese had to leave Aceh prior to 17 August 1966; this was followed by a similar decree by the [[North Sumatra]] government.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=981–982}} In 1967, the usage of the term ''[[Shina (word)|Cina]]'', considered disparaging, became mandated for all official communications.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=986–987}}

On 5 August 1973, a riot in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]], caused by three Chinese Indonesian teenagers beating another driver to death after a minor traffic accident, led to the looting and destruction of more than 1,500 Chinese Indonesian-owned shops and houses. The riots were not stopped by the local military; and nineteen soldiers were arrested for participating in the riots. The riots were later blamed on an underground section of the PKI.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=1023–1024}}

On 15 January 1974, student demonstrations against corruption, foreign investment, and [[Aspri|President Suharto's clique of personal assistants]] were diverted by suspected Special Forces [[agent provocateur|provocateurs]] into a full riot.,{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=1026}}{{sfn|Schwarz|2000|p=34}} and later an anti-Chinese Indonesian [[pogrom]]. Stores in [[Glodok]], owned by ethnic Chinese, were looted and burned; the largest of these was the Senen shopping complex. The security forces did almost nothing to stop the looting.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=1027}} The demonstrations and their aftermath came to be known as the [[Malari incident]].{{sfn|Schwarz|2000|p=34}}

[[File:Surat Bukti Kewarganegaraan Indonesia from 1973, obverse.jpg|thumb|An early SBKRI]]
In 1978, the government began requiring a [[Proof of Citizenship of the Republic of Indonesia|Letter of Proof of Citizenship of the Republic of Indonesia]] ({{lang-id|Surat Bukti Kewarganegaraan Republik Indonesia}}, or SBKRI). Although the SBKRI was legally required for all citizens of foreign descent, in practice it was generally applied to the Chinese. This led to difficulties for Chinese Indonesians when enrolling in state universities, applying to be civil servants, or joining the military or police.{{sfn|Effendi|Prasetyadji|2008|pp=50–51}}

Suharto's economic programs continued to work, with Indonesia experiencing an economic boom with its Gross Domestic Product growing at a rate of 8 percent in 1996, led by the manufacturing sector.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=39}} However, the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian Financial Crisis]] caused the [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] to collapse and economic growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Unable to stabilise the economy, the government sought assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=79}} With rising unemployment and inflated food prices, the public lost confidence in the government's ability to turn the economy around.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=80}} By the beginning of May 1998, students had been demonstrating in campuses throughout [[Medan]] for nearly two months. The growing number of demonstrators was coupled with increasing calls from the public for overall reforms.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=115}}

On 4 May, more than 500 protestors from the [[State University of Medan|State Institute of Teacher Training and Education]] (''{{lang|id|Institut Keguruan dan Ilmu Pendidikan Negeri}}'', IKIP Negeri) were barricaded and allegedly had [[Molotov cocktail]]s thrown at them. Eventually, police reportedly stopped a group of students and assaulted them.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=115}} Word of this attack spread through several witnesses, and a large group later attacked and destroyed a traffic police post. When more officers arrived to confront the group, the station was attacked. Not long after, shops owned by [[Chinese Indonesians]] were looted, while they reportedly left those marked with the words "''{{lang|id|milik pribumi}}''" (owned by the indigenous ''[[pribumi]]'') in graffiti alone. When the [[Mobile Brigade (Indonesia)|Mobile Brigade]] arrived in the afternoon, the crowd was dispersed with tear gas. As businesses in Medan closed on the following day, thousands of people attacked markets throughout the city and its surrounding districts. Police and anti-riot soldiers fired [[rubber bullet]]s at the crowd to disperse them but were unsuccessful. When the violence ended two days later, six people had died and one hundred were injured.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=116}}

On 12 May, less than a week after the violence in Medan subsided, the police [[Trisakti shootings|shot four protesting students]]. Mass violence began almost simultaneously throughout Jakarta the following day. Mobs also attacked [[Glodok]] in the northwestern part of the city, where the commercial area of Jakarta's Chinatown was badly damaged. Some store owners reportedly paid local thugs to protect them from the violence because security forces were largely absent.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=123}} This violence spread to numerous cities throughout Indonesia on 14 and 15 May, including [[Surabaya]],{{sfn|Wijayanta|1998|p=18–22}} [[Palembang]], [[Surakarta]],{{sfn|Kompas|1998-05-15}} and [[Boyolali]].{{sfn|Kompas|1998-05-16}} After the riots, there were dozens of documented accounts of ethnic Chinese women being raped;{{sfn|BBC|1998-06-23}} the total number of mass gang-rapes may have reached 468, with 168 victims in Jakarta alone.{{sfn|Daihani|Purnomo|2001}} However, most of the people who died in the riots were the Javanese Indonesian looters who targeted the Chinese shops, not the Chinese themselves, since the looters were burnt to death in a massive fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000920073842/http://www.serve.com/inside/digest/dig86.htm | title=Inside Indonesia - Digest 86 - Towards a mapping of 'at risk' groups in Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.ohiou.edu/indopubs/1998/05/31/0029.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia-pacific-solidarity.net/southeastasia/indonesia/netnews/1998/and20_v2.htm "Over 1,000 killed in Indonesia riots: rights body Reuters - June 3, 1998 Jim Della-Giacoma, Jakarta", "The May riots DIGEST No.61 - May 29, 1998"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCsgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Constitutional Change and Democracy in Indonesia| isbn=9781107355248| last1=Horowitz| first1=Donald L.| date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohio.edu/cas/classics/faculty/upload/Indonesia-A-Violent-Culture.pdf Collins 2002], p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents caused [[Resignation of Suharto|President Suharto to resign]] and [[B.

After the fall of Suharto, numerous discriminative laws were recalled and others promoting unity were passed. President Habibie passed legislation requiring the elimination of the terms pribumi and non-pribumi (native Indonesian and non-native) in 1998. In 2000, the next president, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], recalled the legislation forbidding the practice of Chinese culture and use of [[Mandarin Chinese]] in public. In 2002, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] declared [[Chinese New Year]] a [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]]. However, some discriminative legislation still remains.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|pp=1088–1099}}

Chinese Indonesians have been "embraced" by the government, with numerous mixed-ethnic cultural presentations and media activity.{{sfn|Tan|2008|pp=230–231}} By 2004, there were three Chinese Indonesian members of the [[Peoples Representative Council]], as well as one cabinet member.{{sfn|Tan|2008|pp=20–21}} However, discrimination and prejudice have continued and risen. On 15 March 2016, for instance, Indonesian Army General Surya Prabowo commented that the incumbent governor of Jakarta, [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], should "know his place lest the Indonesian Chinese face the consequences of his action". This controversial comment was considered to hearken back to previous violence against the Indonesian Chinese.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|title=Sustaining anti-Chinese sentiment in Jakarta |date=18 March 2016 |url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2016/03/18/sustaining-anti-chinese-sentiment-in-jakarta/ |publisher=Australia National University |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The use of Chinese Indonesians as scapegoats is partly caused by their lack of political power and government protection.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=977}} The New Order policy of assimilation has also been seen as a factor; the need to assimilate the ethnic Chinese "indicated that Chinese cultural elements are unacceptable".{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}}

Discrimination, distrust, and violence against Chinese Indonesians is caused in part by a perception that they are still loyal to China, and only see Indonesia as a place to live and work. They are also seen as being "exclusive", unwilling to mingle with other ethnic groups, as well as discriminating against native Indonesians in their business relations.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=217}}

== Effects ==

During the Old and New Orders, Chinese Indonesians generally complied with legal restrictions as best they could. However, the May 1998 riots caused a change in attitude, including greater political activity and assertiveness.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=218}} Additionally, the discrimination led to an ethnic identity crisis, with Chinese Indonesians with strong Chinese ties feeling unaccepted by the Indonesian populace, and those with strong Indonesian ties wanting equal rights.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=29}}

Sociologist [[Mely G. Tan]] notes that presently many Chinese Indonesian families have prepared escape plans in case of further riots and find themselves unable to trust ethnic Indonesians. She also notes that younger Chinese Indonesians are increasingly impatient with the inability of the government and military to prevent inter-ethnic violence.{{sfn|Tan|2008|pp=229–230}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5452">{{distinguish|The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The '''Durban Declaration''' is a statement signed by over 5,000 physicians and scientists in the year 2000, affirming that [[HIV]] is the cause of [[AIDS]]. The declaration was drafted in response to [[HIV/AIDS denialism]], and particularly to address [[South Africa]]n president [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s support for AIDS denialists.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/07/01/hiv.aids/index.html | title = International scientists, doctors reaffirm HIV causes AIDS | publisher = [[CNN]] | last = Aiken | first = Jonathan | date = 2000-07-01 | accessdate = 2008-10-14 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written several weeks prior to the 2000 [[International AIDS Conference]], held in [[Durban|Durban, South Africa]] from July 9–14, 2000, and was published in the [[medical journal]] ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to coincide with the Durban conference. The declaration called the evidence that HIV causes AIDS "clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous".&lt;ref name=DDeclaration&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=The Durban Declaration |journal=Nature |volume=406 |issue=6791 |pages=15–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10894520|doi=10.1038/35017662| url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6791/full/406015a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each person who signed the document was required to have a [[Ph.D.]] or [[M.D.]]-equivalent degree. To avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, scientists "working for commercial companies were asked not to sign." The signatories included eleven [[Nobel prize]] winners.&lt;ref name=DDeclaration/&gt;

== Reaction ==
[[Michael Specter]], writing in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', called the Durban Declaration "one of the saddest documents in modern scientific history," reflecting concern that Mbeki's embrace of AIDS denialism was a disastrous response to [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa's AIDS epidemic]].&lt;ref name="specter"&gt;{{cite news | last = Specter | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Specter | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/12/070312fa_fact_specter | title = The Denialists | publisher = ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' | date = 2007-03-12 | accessdate = 2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mbeki's government reportedly pressured South African scientists not to sign the document,&lt;ref name="bmj"/&gt; and initially dismissed the Durban declaration. Health minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]] called it "elitist",&lt;ref name="specter"/&gt; while Mbeki's spokesperson said it belonged in a "dustbin".&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sidley P |title=Mbeki dismisses "Durban declaration" |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |volume=321 |issue=7253 |pages=67 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10884240 |pmc=1127750 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7253.67/a|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10884240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several AIDS denialists criticized the Declaration in a letter to the editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', casting the issue as an abridgement of their rights to [[free speech]] and an intolerance of "alternative" viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stewart GT |title=The Durban Declaration is not accepted by all |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6802 |pages=286 |date=September 2000 |pmid=11014164 |doi= 10.1038/35030200|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, ''Nature'' later published a letter detailing inaccurate claims made by AIDS denialists in their attacks on the Declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delaney M |title=Why are AIDS dissidents still making 15-year-old, long-refuted claims? |journal=Nature |volume=408 |issue=6810 |pages=287 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11099014 |doi=10.1038/35042743 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second satirical letter from two AIDS researchers, stating: "We are staunch believers in the right to free speech, but is ''Nature'' the appropriate place to militate in favour of the pre-[[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] model of the universe or the existence of phlogiston?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wain-Hobson S, Weiss RA |title=If free speech costs lives that's a high price to pay |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6806 |pages=834 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057643 |doi=10.1038/35038262 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, independent estimates by public health experts attributed over 300,000 preventable South African AIDS deaths and nearly 200,000 new HIV infections to government policies based on the AIDS denialist assertions criticised by the Durban Declaration.&lt;ref name=chigwedere&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Seage GR, Gruskin S, Lee TH, Essex M |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes |volume= 49|issue= 4|pages= 410|date=October 2008 |pmid=19186354 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818a6cd5 |laysummary=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NattrassAA&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nattrass N |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=African Affairs |volume=107 |issue=427 |pages=157–76 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adm087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''election official''', '''election officer''', '''election judge''', '''election clerk''', or '''poll worker''' is an official responsible for the proper and orderly voting at [[polling station]]s. Depending on the country or jurisdiction, election officials may be identified as members of a [[political party]] or non-partisan. They are generally volunteers or paid a small stipend for their work. Each polling station is staffed with multiple officials. The duties include signing in registered voters, explaining voting procedure and use of voting equipment, providing [[ballot]]s, and monitoring the conduct of the election. In US states with [[Election Day voter registration]], they also register unregistered voters on election day. In most other countries, however, voters do not need to register, all citizens being automatically included in the lists of eligible voters.  Depending on the jurisdiction, election officials are chosen by a [[board of elections]], county official (such as the [[county clerk]] or [[auditor|county auditor]]), city or township official (such as a [[city clerk]]), the federal state, or a national committee.  

In California, poll workers can be any citizen who requests the job at least two months prior to an election. Inspectors and site supervisors receive a minimum of two training classes, and clerks are required to attend a training class within two weeks of the election, with additional certification classes for any machine or technological devices to be used. These classes cover a wide range of topics, including opening and closing of the polls, which color pen to use on which paper, dealing with irate voters, and the rare times when a voter can be challenged.

In 41 of the 50 United States, high school students can serve as [[student election judges]]. Each state has its own set of requirements for students to serve as poll workers, but generally, students must be in good academic standing at their school and meet the particular age or grade conditions.

'''End-to-end auditable''' or '''end-to-end voter verifiable''' ('''E2E''') systems are voting systems with stringent integrity properties and strong [[tamper resistance]]. E2E systems often employ [[cryptography|cryptographic methods]] to craft receipts that allow voters to verify that their votes were counted as cast, without revealing which candidates were voted for. As such, these systems are sometimes referred to as '''receipt-based''' systems.{{Citation needed|reason=There is no evidence to suggest such systems are called 'receipt-based'|date=November 2018}}

[[Electronic voting]] systems arrive at their final vote totals by a series of steps: 
# each voter has an original intent,
# voters express their intent on ballots (whether transient, as on the display of a [[DRE voting machine]], or durable, as in systems with [[Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail|voter verifiable paper trails]]),
# the ballots are interpreted, to generate electronic cast vote records,
# cast vote records are tallied, generating totals
# where counting is conducted locally, for example, at the precinct or county level, the results from each local level are combined to produce the final tally.

Classical approaches to election integrity tended to focus on mechanisms that operated at each step on the chain from voter intent to final total.  Voting is an example of a distributed system, and in general, distributed system designers have long known that such local focus may miss some vulnerabilities while over-protecting others.{{Citation needed|reason=There is no evidence to suggest 'local focus' might miss vulnerabilities|date=April 2017}}   The alternative is to use [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end]] measures that are designed to guard the integrity of the entire chain.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Saltzer, D. P. Reed and D. D Clark, End-to-End Arguments in System Design, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=357402 ACM Trans. on Computer Systems (TOCS)], Vol 2, No. 4, Nov. 1984, pages 277-288&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of current [[optical scan]] voting systems to meet
reasonable end-to-end standards was pointed out in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Jones, End-to-End Standards for Accuracy in Paper-Based Systems, [https://web.archive.org/web/20020606233416/http://www.vote.caltech.edu/west02/presentations.html Workshop on Election Standards and Technology] ([http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/west02/ alternate source]), Jan 31, 2002, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comprehensive coverage of election integrity frequently involves multiple stages.  Voters are expected to verify that they have marked their ballots as intended, we use recounts or audits to protect the step from marked ballots to ballot-box totals, and we use publication of all subtotals to allow public verification that the overall totals correctly sum the local totals.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Jones, Perspectives on Electronic Voting, [http://www.ifes.org/publication/6535478b9b3c7bda289626a871bb821a/IFES%20From%20Power%20Outages_GEO%20Conf%20Paper_cv.pdf From Power Outages to Paper Trails] ([http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/IFES2007.pdf alternate source]), IFES, Washington DC, 2007; pages 32-46, see particularly Figure 4, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

While measures such as [[Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail|voter verified paper audit trails]] and manual recounts increase the effectiveness of our defenses, they offer only weak protection of the integrity of the physical or electronic ballot boxes.  Ballots could be removed, replaced, or could have marks added to them (''i.e.,''to fill in [[undervote]]d contests with votes for a desired candidate or to [[overvote]] and [[Spoilt vote|spoil]] votes for undesired candidates).  This shortcoming motivated the development of the end-to-end auditable voting systems discussed here, sometimes referred to as ''E2E voting systems''.  These attempt to cover the entire path from voter attempt to election totals with just two measures:
* Individual verifiability, by which any voter may check that his or her ballot is correctly included in the electronic ballot box, and
* Universal verifiability, by which anyone may determine that all of the ballots in the box have been correctly counted.

Because of the importance of the right to a [[secret ballot]], some E2E voting schemes also attempt to meet a third requirement, usually referred to as ''receipt freeness'':
*No voter can demonstrate how he or she voted to any third party.

A researcher has argued that end-to-end auditability and receipt-freeness should be considered to be orthogonal properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/E2E2009.pdf Some Problems with End-to-End Voting], position paper presented at the [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/e2evoting/program_E2E.html End-to-End Voting Systems Workshop], Oct. 13-14, 2009, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have shown that these properties can co-exist,&lt;ref&gt;B Smyth, S. Frink and M. R. Clarkson, Election Verifiability: Cryptographic Definitions and an Analysis of Helios and JCJ, [https://hdl.handle.net/1813/40575 Cornell's digital repository], Feb. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and these  properties are combined in the 2005 [[Voluntary Voting System Guidelines]] promulgated by the [[Election Assistance Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eac.gov/voting%20systems/docs/vvsgvolumei.pdf/attachment_download/file/ 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines], [[Election Assistance Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is also predominant in the academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Clark, Aleks Essex, and Carlisle Adams.

To address [[ballot stuffing]], the following measure can be adopted:

* Eligibility verifiability, by which anyone may determine that all counted ballots were cast by registered voters.

Alternatively, assertions regarding ballot stuffing can be externally verified by comparing the number of votes cast with the number of registered voters who voted, and by auditing other aspects of the registration and ballot delivery system.

Support for E2E auditability, based on prior experience using it with in-person elections, is also seen as a requirement for remote voting over the [[Internet]] by many experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usvotefoundation.org/E2E-VIV | title=The Future of Voting: End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting - Specification and Feasibility Study - E2E-VIV Project | work=U.S. Vote Foundation | date=2015 | accessdate=2016-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed E2E Systems==
In 2004, [[David Chaum]] proposed a solution that allows a voter to verify that the vote is cast appropriately and that the vote is accurately counted using [[visual cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When the layers are stacked, they show the human-readable vote. However, each transparency is [[encrypt]]ed with a form of [[visual cryptography]] so that it alone does not reveal any information unless it is decrypted.  The voter selects one layer to destroy at the poll. The DRE retains an electronic copy of the other layer and gives the physical copy as a receipt to allow the voter to confirm that the electronic ballot was not later changed.  The system guards against changes to the voter's ballot and uses a [[mix-net]] decryption&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1005140.1005155 Reusable anonymous return channels]&lt;/ref&gt; procedure to ensure that each vote is accurately counted. Sastry, Karloff and Wagner pointed out that there are issues with both of the Chaum and VoteHere cryptographic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Karlof, Naveen Sastry, and David Wagner. [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~nks/papers/cryptovoting-usenix05.pdf Cryptographic Voting Protocols: A Systems perspective]. Proceedings of the Fourteenth USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2005), August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaum's team subsequently developed [[Punchscan]], which has stronger security properties and uses simpler paper ballots.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Cherry, [http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/print/4817 Making every e-vote count], [[IEEE Spectrum]], Jan 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper ballots are voted on and then a privacy-preserving portion of the ballot is scanned by an optical scanner.

The [[Prêt à Voter]] system, invented by Peter Ryan, uses a shuffled candidate order and a traditional [[mix network]]. As in Punchscan, the votes are made on paper ballots and a portion of the ballot is scanned.

The [[Scratch and Vote]] system, invented by [[Ben Adida]], uses a scratch-off surface to hide cryptographic information that can be used to verify the correct printing of the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ben.adida.net/research/ Scratch &amp; Vote: Self-Contained Paper-Based Cryptographic Voting (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ThreeBallot]] voting protocol, invented by [[Ron Rivest]], was designed to provide some of the benefits of a cryptographic voting system without using cryptography. It can in principle be implemented on paper although the presented version requires an electronic verifier.

The [[Scantegrity]] and [[Scantegrity II]] systems provide E2E properties, however instead of being a replacement of the entire voting system, as is the case in all the preceding examples, it works as an add-on for existing optical scan voting systems. Scantegrity II  employs [[invisible ink]] and was developed by a team that included Chaum, Rivest, and Ryan.  

The STAR-vote system under development for [[Travis County, Texas]] is another way to combine an E2E system with conventionally auditable paper ballots, produced in this case by a [[ballot marking device]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2014/07/09/travis-county-forges-new-territory-voting-machines/|title=Travis County Forges New Territory in Creating Voting Machine|last=Okun|first=Eli|date=2014-07-09|website=The Texas Tribune|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">'''Formative contexts''' are the institutional and imaginative arrangements that shape a society's conflicts and resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. 1990. "Programmatic Thought and the Critique of the Social Disciplines." In Critique and Construction, ed. M Perry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[Social structure|structures]] that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the [[liberal democracy|Western democracies]], for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York|pages=58–59, 69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Also referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist [[Roberto Unger]]. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book ''False Necessity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of [[false necessity]], which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]] claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.&lt;ref&gt;For good overviews of Unger's thought see Collins, Hugh. “Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement,” Journal of Law and Society 14 (1987), Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
While a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of [[social actions]] and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The '''subjective criteria''' considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The '''objective criteria''' is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts—if it alters the social divisions—then it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = Social Theory, Its Situation and Its Task | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1987 | page=63| isbn = 978-0-521-32974-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=61–66| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western democracies==
The formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=69–82| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''work-organization complex''' makes a distinction in work between task definers and task executers, with the material rewards concentrated in the task defining jobs.
*The '''private-rights complex''' understands the rights of the individual vis-a-vis other individuals and the state. This structure is central to the allocation and control of capital, ensuring all forms of capital distribution and entitlement.
*The '''government-organization complex''' is the institutional arrangement to protect the individual from the state, and to prevent those in power from changing the formative context. It establishes a link between safeguards of freedom and the dispersion of powers, e.g. partisan rivalries fail to extend to debates over the fundamental institutions that affect social interactions.
*The '''occupational-structure complex''' is a social division of labor characterized by a lack of caste or religious division. It is based on material reward and task defining jobs receiving the highest pay.

==Influences in other fields==
The thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the [[Social Study of Information Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the field of [[Information systems]] [[Claudio Ciborra]] and Giovan Lanzara define the term "formative context" as the "set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

'''Francisco de Carvajal''' (1464 &amp;ndash; 10 April 1548) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[military officer]], [[conquistador]], and [[explorer]] remembered as ''"the [[demon]] of the [[Andes]]"'' due to his brutality and uncanny military skill in the [[Peru]]vian civil wars of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Precott, p. 1217, notes, "With a character so extraordinary, with powers prolonged so far beyond the usual term of humanity, and passions so fierce in one tottering on the verge of the grave, it was not surprising that many fabulous stories should be eagerly circulating respecting him, and that Carvajal should be clothed with mysterious terrors as a sort of supernatural being,&amp;mdash;the demon of the Andes!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Carvajal's career as a soldier in Europe spanned forty years and a half-dozen wars. Fighting in Spain's [[Spanish Army|Imperial armies]]&amp;mdash;the famous ''[[tercios]]''&amp;mdash;he served under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V's]] principal commanders in the [[Italian Wars]]: [[Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto|Pedro Navarro]], [[Fabrizio Colonna]], and the illustrious ''Gran Capitán'', [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]]. He took part in the memorable Spanish victory at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525 and acquired a small fortune when the Imperial armies [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] two years later.

In the 1540s, the [[octogenarian]] Carvajal travelled to the [[Spanish West Indies]] and from there accepted a [[Commissioned officer|military commission]] with the [[Pizarro brothers]] in Peru, eventually backing [[Gonzalo Pizarro]]'s unsuccessful rebellion against the officials of the [[Spanish Crown]]. Carvajal proved a tireless soldier and successful strategist. He was ultimately captured in battle by royalist forces on April 9, 1548 and executed at the age of 84.

==Life and military career==
Born ''Francisco López Gascón'' in [[Rágama|Rágama de Arévalo]], [[Salamanca Province|Salamanca]], Carvajal was admitted to the [[University of Salamanca]] only to return home in disgrace after a series of public scandals. Disinherited, Carvajal enlisted in the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] infantry bound for [[Italian Wars|Italy]] to fight in [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V's]] wars. He was present as an ''[[Alférez (rank)|alférez]]'' when the mutinous Imperial army stormed Rome in 1527. However, instead competing in the violent plunder for gold and valuables, Carvajal seized legal documents belonging to a ranking Roman [[notary]] and ransomed them for a small fortune.

Carvajal later used these funds to journey to [[Mexico]] as an aide to its first Spanish viceroy, [[Antonio de Mendoza]]. In 1535, he was dispatched to [[Peru]] to the relief of newly founded [[Lima]], then under siege by an Inca army. Carvajal led reinforcements to Governor [[Francisco Pizarro]] and thereafter played a key role in reestablishing Pizarro's rule against the rival faction of conquistadors led by [[Diego de Almagro II|Almagro the Younger]]. He continued to lead his [[cavalry]] from the front ranks despite his [[Ageing|age]] and [[obesity]] and became something of a local legend for his composure in battle. At [[Battle of Chupas|Chupas]], seeing the [[Tercio|Imperial Spanish infantry]] giving way before a hail of fire from Almagro's massed cannons and [[harquebus]]iers, Carvajal is said to have ridden to the front of the line and, casting his helmet and [[cuirass]] to the ground, exclaimed,&lt;ref&gt;Palma, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{cquote|For shame, Spaniards; do you give way now? I am twice as good a mark for the enemy as any of you!"&lt;ref name = "chupas"&gt;Prescott, p. 1113, describes the action: "He sprang boldly forward through blinding volumes of smoke and a tempest of musket balls, and, supported by the bravest of his troops, overpowered the gunners, and made himself master of their pieces."&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Inspired by their corpulent commander, Carvajal's men advanced on the enemy guns and carried Almagro's troops before them.&lt;ref name = "chupas"/&gt;

===Campaign of 1546===
{{quotation|As a military man, Carvajal ranks high among the soldiers of the [[New World]]. He was strict, even severe, in enforcing discipline, so that he was little loved by his followers [...] ; but in the shifts and turns of [[guerrilla warfare]] he was unrivalled. Prompt, active, and persevering, he was insensible to danger or fatigue. [...] He knew familiarly every mountain pass, and, such were the sagacity and resources displayed in his [[flying column|roving expeditions]], that he was vulgarly believed to be attended by a ''[[Familiar spirit|familiar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, p. 1217&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When the [[Spanish Crown|royal authority]] moved against Pizarro in 1546, Carvajal, unable to quit the country due to the [[embargo]] on shipping, took command again in the field as Pizarro's [[lieutenant]], or ''[[Maestro de Campo]]'' of Nueva Castilla's armies. In the campaign of 1546 Carvajal violently put down the royalist forces in the south of the colony, marching and countermarching from [[Quito]] to [[San Miguel Province|San Miguel]], from Lima to [[Guamanga]] and back to Lima, from [[Lucanas Province|Lucanas]] to [[Cuzco]], from [[El Collao Province|Collao]] to [[Arequipa]] and from  Arequipa to [[Charcas Province|Charcas]].

==Execution==
Carvajal was sentenced to death by the royalists after being wounded and captured at the [[Battle of Jaquijahuana]]. American historian [[William H. Prescott]] collected a number of details about the execution, claiming that Carvajal was not gravely troubled by the sentence, remarking simply, "basta matar": "They can only kill me."&lt;ref name="execution"&gt;Prescott, p. 1214-1215&lt;/ref&gt; He refused [[Confession (religion)|confession]] offered by the priests and did not accept his [[last rites]], asking:
{{cquote|But of what use would that be? I have nothing that lies heavy on my conscience, unless it be, indeed, the debt of half a [[Spanish real|real]] to a shopkeeper in [[Seville]], which I forgot to pay before leaving the country.&lt;ref name="execution"/&gt;}}
According to Prescott, Carvajal did admit guests throughout his last day but treated his interlocutors to his usual cutting sarcasm. When a former enemy, once vanquished in battle by Carvajal, came to offer his services to the condemned rebel, Carvajal rebuked him caustically:
{{cquote|And what service can you do me? Can you set me free? If you cannot do that, you can do nothing. If I spared your life, as you say, it was probably because I did not think it worthwhile to take it.&lt;ref name="execution"/&gt;}}
Carvajal's only complaint emerged when his executioners arrived to carry him to the place of execution. Upon being bound and forced into a narrow basket, Carvajal exclaimed, "''¡Niño en cuna y viejo en cuna!''"&amp;mdash;"Cradles for infants and now cradles for old men as well!"&lt;ref name="execution"/&gt; Carvajal's severed head was exhibited on a pike next to Pizarro's at the gates of Lima.

Carvajal remains a folkloric character in Peru: One legend made him the illegitimate son of the Spanish-[[Italians|Italian]] tyrant [[Cesare Borgia]]; [[Ricardo Palma]] pointed out in the ''[[Tradiciones peruanas]]'' that Carvajal was in fact Borgia's senior by 10 years, their only parentage, he added, being "that of cruelty."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22964">The aim of Free Prior Informed consent (FPIC), is to establish bottom up participation and consultation of an Indigenous Population prior to the beginning of a development on ancestral land or using resources within the Indigenous Population's territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenza B.

To protect Indigenous peoples rights, international human rights law has created process and standards to safeguard their way of life and to encourage participation in the decision making process. One of these methods is the process of FPIC.
There is criticism that many international conventions and [[treaties]] only require [[Public consultation|consultation]] and not [[consent]], which is a much higher threshold. Without the requirement for consent Indigenous People are not able to veto government projects and developments in their area which directly affects their lives and cultures. FPIC allows Indigenous Peoples to have the right to [[self-determination]] and [[self-governance]] in national and local government decision making process over projects that concern their lives and resources.

Examples include [[natural resource management]], [[economic development]], uses of [[traditional knowledge]], [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|genetic resources]], [[health care]], and [[education]].

== Interpretation ==

=== Definition ===

The [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (UNPFII) [https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/] has defined the concept of Free Prior Informed Consent as the following:
*Firstly 'Free' simply means that there is no manipulation or coercion of the Indigenous People and that the process is self-directed by those affected by the project. 
*Secondly ‘Prior’ implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance of any activates being either commenced or authorised, and time for the consultation process to occur must be guaranteed by the relative agents. 
*'Informed'  suggests that the relevant Indigenous people receive satisfactory information on the key points of the project  such as the nature, size, pace, reversibility, the scope of the project, the reason for it, and its duration. This is the more difficult term of the four, as different groups may find certain information more relevant. The Indigenous People should also have access to the primary reports on the economic, environmental cultural impact that the project will have. The language used must be able to be understood by the IPs.
*Finally 'consent' means a process in which participation and consultation are the central pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Barelli “ Free Prior and informed consent in the aftermath of the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples:  Developments and Challenges ahead” (2012) 16  The International Journal of Human Rights  1 at 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===

The UNPFII requires that Indigenous People should be consulted in a way which is appropriate for their customs. This means that not every member will have to agree. This has been criticised by some [women's rights] groups. The Indigenous People will determine who is to be consulted and must effectively communicate this with the Government and Developers. It is the duty of the state to make sure that FPIC has been carried out, if it has not then it is their issue to redress, not the company or the people wishing to carry out the project.&lt;ref&gt;Parshuram Tamang, "An Overview of the Principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent and Indigenous Peoples in International and Domestic Law and Practices", (2005) United Nations Workshop on Free Prior informed Consent&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Labour Organization]] [http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm] requires that consultation takes place in a climate of mutual trust and circumstances are considered appropriate if they create favourable conditions for reaching agreement and consent.
In a pilot study by the UN-Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation [[UN-REDD]] [http://www.un-redd.org/AboutUN-REDDProgramme/tabid/102613/Default.aspx] of FPIC application in [[Vietnam]] the following steps were required;
 (1) preparation, (2) Consultation with local officials (3) Recruitment of Local Facilitators (4) Training of the local facilitators, (5) awareness raising (6) Village Meeting (7) recording the decision (8) Reporting to UN-REDD Vietnam  (9) Verification and evaluation. The majority of issues with this policy was the recruitment of the Local Facilitators, while they were able to discuss the process in a language that Indigenous Peoples understood there was mistrust towards them and a fear that they had been bribed.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Jokela “Adapting Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)  Local Contexts in REDD+: Lessons from three Experiments in Vietnam” (2015) Forests at 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== International development ==

The principle of FPIC within [[international development]] is most clearly stated in the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (UNDRIP). Article 10 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP"&gt;{{cite report |title= United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|URL=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf |publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; "  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Articles 11, 19, 28, and 29 of the declaration also explicitly use the term.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP" /&gt; It is further established in [[international conventions]], notably the [[ILO Convention 169]] on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. Countries including [[Peru]], [[Australia]], and the [[Philippines]] have included FPIC in their [[national law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= FPIC and the extractive industries |url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/16530IIED.pdf |publisher=Institute for Environment and Development |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International law ==

The role of indigenous peoples' FPIC in decisions about [[infrastructure]] or [[extractive industries]] developed on their [[ancestral domain]] is an issue within [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Tara |date=2011 |title= The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law |journal = Journal of International Human Rights | volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=54–84 |url= http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njihr/vol10/iss2/2 |access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects lacking FPIC are called [[development aggression]] by indigenous peoples. The issue of indigenous peoples' lack of access to [[accountability]] and [[Dispute mechanism|grievance mechanisms]] to address [[human rights]] violations has been formally raised with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Asian Indigenous peoples have urged the UN to address this before the [[economic integration]] of [[ASEAN]] in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Human Rights Council 24th Regular Session: Statement of the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP) by Joan Carling, Secretary General |url= http://iva.aippnet.org/human-rights-council-24th-regular-session-statement-of-the-asia-indigenous-peoples-pact-aipp-delievered-by-joan-carling-secretary-general/ |date= September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the human rights records of [[member states]] such as [[Human rights in Burma|Myanmar]] and [[Human rights in laos|Laos]], which are among the world's most repressive societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= Worst of the Worst 2012: The World's Most Repressive Societies |url= http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/worst-worst-2012-worlds-most-repressive-societies |publisher= Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===International Labour Organization===

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)  [&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;]  has been working with indigenous people since the 1920s, it currently has 187 member states, including [[New Zealand]]. [[ILO Convention 169]] (the Convention) [&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C169&lt;/ref&gt;]  on Indigenous and tribal peoples is an international treaty adopted by the ILO in 1989. The Convention aims to overcome discriminatory practices affecting Indigenous People and enable them in the decision making process. The fundamental foundations of the Convention are participation and consultation. The requirement for consultation falls upon the Government of the state and not on private persons or companies, this may be delegated but ultimately the responsibility rests on the government.&lt;ref&gt;ILO, 'Understanding the Indigenous and Tribal People Convention, 1989 (No. 169)" (2013)  http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_205225.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The need for consultation of IPs is written throughout the Convention a number of times and is referred to in : Articles 6, 7, 16 and 22.  Article 6(1)  states that governments should: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;

'' “Consult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly" '''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 6 (2) states that this consultation will be carried out in good faith and in a form that is appropriate to the circumstances.  The aim of this consultation process is to achieve an agreement or consent to the purposed development.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6(2) ILO, Indigenous and Tribal peoples Convention No.169&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Convention does not allow Indigenous People to veto any developments; the condition is for mere consultation not consent. The supervisor bodies of the ILO have stated that the consultation process cannot only be information sharing that there must be a chance for the Indigenous People to influence the decision making process. If consent is not achieved the nation-state must still respect other areas of the convention that include the Indigenous peoples right to their lands. Such as Article 16 (2) requires that free informed consent must be given where is the relocation of people.&lt;ref&gt;Article 16 (2) ILO Indigenous and Tribal peoples Convention No.169&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty is legally binding on all states that ratify it, if a state chooses to ratify they may need to adjust domestic legislation. In nations such as NZ domestic legislation such as the [[Resource Management Act 1991]] refers to the need to consider in developments [[Māori people|Maori]] relationship with land and water sites.&lt;ref&gt;s7 Resource Management Act 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This spiritual and practical connection that Maori have to the land has been considered in a number cases before the court including the supreme court case of ''Paki v Attorney General''.&lt;ref&gt;Paki v Attorney General [2014] NZSC 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===

The United Nations describes FPIC both directly and indirectly in numerous conventions and treaties. One of the most direct is located in the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (UNDRIP)[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf], Article 19 states: 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' "States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous Peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.&lt;ref&gt;Article 19, United Nations, Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples , (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 	
Article 32 of UNDRIP requires that consultation is carried out with Indigenous Peoples before states can undertake projects that will affect Indigenous People Rights to land, territory and resources &lt;ref&gt;Article 32 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&lt;/ref&gt; The above Articles only requires Consultation, however Article 10 requires that there is informed '''consent''' before the relocation Indigenous Peoples from their land.&lt;ref&gt;Article 19 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows Indigenous People the right to decide where they live and gives them the power stop any development which they disagree with.

 
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR)[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/] is the most universally accepted standard of Human Rights. It does not directly mention FPIC but it does express the importance of Self- determination of all Peoples in Article 1. Article 7 declares that all are equal before the law, this means that one person has no more right to another in a nation, this is further endorsed by Article 17 which states that every person has the right to own property and that he shall not be arbitrary deprived of his property.&lt;ref&gt;Article 7, 10 and 17, United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;  The right for Self-determination is further protected in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), in Article 1 of both Documents. This includes economic self-determination, which for many IP is the control of their natural resources. 
 
The ICCPR in Article 27 states that minorities shall not be denied access to their culture, in the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) in General Comment 23, have found this meaning to include the right of Indigenous People to their land and resources. The HRC has interpreted this to mean that states have a positive duty to engage with IP prior to any development or granting of resource concession in IP lands.&lt;ref&gt;Tara Ward, "The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law" (2011) 10 Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights at 7&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the supervisory body of the ICESCR, has even stated in their general comment No.23 that if Indigenous People's land has been taken without informed prior consent then they have the right to restitution or the return of their land or resources. This comes from their interpretation of Article 15 of the ICESCR [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx]. Article 15 protects Indigenous People's right to participate in their cultural life. The Comment by the CESCR is important as it goes beyond mere consultation.  The need for FPIC has also been called upon by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/] which requires that no state shall make a decision concerning the rights of IPs without their consent. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx] encourages Indigenous Peoples participation in decision making. However these are not legally binding decisions, only recommendations &lt;ref&gt;Tara Ward, "The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law" (2011) 10 Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights at 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===

The [[World Bank]] [http://www.worldbank.org/] was one of the first multilateral financial institutions to create guidelines to protect the rights of Indigenous People's in the 1980s, when it recognized that development negatively impacted the lives and cultures of Indigenous People. Its first policy was in 1987. It was designed by Bank staff without consultation of Indigenous People and was a statement on the need to protect Indigenous People's.  Then in 1991 the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 document acknowledged the need for participation of Indigenous People in the consultation process.

The subsequent World Bank Policy on indigenous peoples was released in 2005, OP 4.10 [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTOPMANUAL/0,,contentMDK:20553653~menuPK:64701637~pagePK:64709096~piPK:64709108~theSitePK:502184,00.html] focused on the reduction of poverty. In doing so the bank identified the intrinsic link that Indigenous People have with the land and the need for a consultation process which fully respects the human rights, human dignity, economics and culture of the people involved. The Bank stated that it will not lend money to a state or company unless there has been Free Prior Informed Consultation with the local Indigenous Population and that there is broad community support for the development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, Operational Policy 4.10 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics have questioned why the term "consultation" has been used as opposed to consent. Stating that it means IP are not able to decline a project if they do not agree with it. Furthermore, "community" is an ambiguous term.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Barelli “ Free Prior and informed consent in the aftermath of the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples:  Developments and Challenges ahead” (2012) 16  The International Journal of Human Rights  1 at 5&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2016 the World Bank adopted its new Environmental and Social Standards, including Environmental and Social Standard 7 (ESS7) on Indigenous Peoples/Sub-Saharan African Historically Underserved Traditional Local Communities (IPs), which requires Free Prior Informed Consent if the project will:
* have adverse impacts on land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; 
* cause relocation of IPs from land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; or
* have significant impacts on IPs cultural heritage that is material to the identity and/or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual aspects of the affected IPs’ lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental and Social Framework, ESS7, para 24|url=https://consultations.worldbank.org/Data/hub/files/consultation-template/review-and-update-world-bank-safeguard-policies/en/materials/the_esf_clean_final_for_public_disclosure_post_board_august_4.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change negotiations ==
During the [[UNFCCC]] [[climate change]] negotiations on [[reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+), it was noted that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had adopted UNDRIP, meaning that the Declaration and its FPIC provision applied to the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1], Appendix I, paragraph 2, sub (C)&lt;/ref&gt; This reference was made in the context of a so-called safeguard for REDD+, specifically the instruction to have "respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities" when undertaking REDD+ activities.

Following this, FPIC has been widely applied for demonstration projects on REDD+, particularly after the [[United Nations REDD Programme]] published a report on its efforts to develop a methodology for FPIC for REDD+ in the case of its country program in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnam-redd.org/Web/Default.aspx?tab=download&amp;zoneid=152&amp;subzone=156&amp;child=185&amp;lang=en-US Vietnam REDD+ website, library page on FPIC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= Free, Prior, and Informed Consent in REDD+ |url= http://www.recoftc.org/site/uploads/content/pdf/FPICinREDDManual_127.pdf |date= February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2013, the global United Nations REDD Programme issued guidelines for the application of FPIC, including an analysis of [[jurisprudence]] on FPIC in various contexts, that are mandatory for all UN-REDD country programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=8717&amp;Itemid=53 UN-REDD Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolivia==
[[Bolivia]] ratified ILO Convention 169 and in 2007 it also formally incorporated UNDRIP into its municipal law. In 2009 the nation also included the duty to consult Indigenous People's in its constitution, this is however a much less radical version of the draft, which required that consent be given for the exploration of all resource activities.  These legal requirements are very significant in a nation that has a wealth of natural resources and a large Indigenous Population. The risk of giving Indigenous People this type of power to veto government projects  is an increase social conflict in certain regions. This was seen with the conflict surrounding the Isiboro Se´cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS). A road was planned through the Park, coca growers were in favour of the project as it would expand their business. The Indigenous Population however opposed the idea, saying that consent should be needed for mega development in Indigenous Peoples territories. The result was large protests in La Paz.  The fear was of damage to the vital river system, [[illegal logging]] and altering habitats of endangered  animals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Friedman-Rudovsky, 'In Bolivia, A Battle Over
A Highway and a Way of Life' (2012) Environment 360 http://e360.yale.edu/feature/in_bolivia_a_battle_over_a_highway_and_a_way_of_life/2566/&lt;/ref&gt;  The state engaged in consultation with the Indigenous Peoples, but this amplified  the problem,  with activists critiquing the governments lack of legal framework to protect Indigenous People. The government claimed that the expectations of the Indigenous People were unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenza B. Fontana and Jean Grugel, “The Politics of Indigenous Participation Through ‘‘Free Prior Informed Consent”: Reflections from the Bolivian Case” (2016) 77 World Development 249-261 at 253&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fundação Nacional do Índio''' ({{IPA-pt|fũdɐˈsɐ̃w nɐsjoˈnaw ðu ˈĩdʒu}}, ''National Indian Foundation'') or '''FUNAI''' is a [[Brazil]]ian governmental protection agency for [[indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indian]] interests and their culture.

== Original founding as Indian Protection Service ==
In 1910, the Indian Protection Service (Serviço de Proteção ao Índio), or the SPI, was founded under the lead of Brazilian Marshal [[Cândido Rondon|Candido Rondon]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=155927|title=Land Rights and the Manipulation of Identity: Official Indian Policy in Brazil on JSTOR|last=|first=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rondon created the foundation's motto: "Die if necessary, but never kill." Drawing from his [[Positivism]], Rondon led the SPI with the belief that the native Indians should be allowed to develop at their own pace. With state assistance and protection, Indians would eventually integrate into modern society.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What Future for the Amerindians of South America? Minority Rights Group Report 15|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED085162.pdf|journal=Minority Rights Group|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPI then began its mission to "pacify" Indian communities by setting up posts in their territories to foster communication and protection.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Efforts were initially met by opposition and hostility from Indian groups; there were reports of SPI agents being attacked and shot by arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Social Integrations of Indigenous Populations in Brazil|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/intlr85&amp;div=51&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|journal=International Labour Review|volume=85.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, following the death of Rondon, the SPI's officials became corrupt. In 1967 the officials were accused of sexual perversion, abuse, and the massacre of entire tribes by introducing diseases and pesticides, leading to an international outcry for the disbandment of SPI.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BSbgFG4ekIsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=corruption+OR+scandal+OR+founder+OR+purpose+%22Indian+Protection+Service%22&amp;ots=UBhIkvzcas&amp;sig=eQMLI3REBW-bp6-RYiafE4jHHQI#v=onepage&amp;q=corruption%20OR%20scandal%20OR%20founder%20OR%20purpose%20%22Indian%20Protection%20Service%22&amp;f=false|title=The Politics of Anthropology: From Colonialism and Sexism Toward a View from Below|last=Huizer|first=Gerrit|last2=Mannheim|first2=Bruce|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110806458|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this disbandment, FUNAI was created to take over SPI's responsibilities and remedy the damages caused by corruption.

==Early years==
FUNAI was created by Law No. 5,371, under jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Justice (Brazil)|Ministry of Justice]] and headquartered in [[Brasília|Brasilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.funai.gov.br/index.php/quem-somos|title=QUEM SOMOS|website=www.funai.gov.br|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 1973, Law No. 6001 officially placed Indians under the protection of FUNAI through the Indian Statute.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=155927|title=Land Rights and the Manipulation of Identity: Official Indian Policy in Brazil on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Statute, while aiming to demarcate all Indian lands by 1978, also had the main goal to integrate Indians into society as soon as possible, so that the Amazon and its people could start contributing economically to Brazilian society.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Indians in Brazil: Is Genocide Inevitable?|journal=Native Americas|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protection from a government agency is important for Indian populations, but this also means that FUNAI, as a part of the government, has authority to act contrary to the welfare of the Indians.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=William|title=Megadevelopment, Environmentalism, and Resistance: The Institutional Context of Kayapó Indigenous Politics in Central Brazil|url=http://sfaajournals.net/doi/pdf/10.17730/humo.53.3.6262063561l036hk|journal=Human Organization|volume=53|issue=3|pages=220–232|doi=10.17730/humo.53.3.6262063561l036hk}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the Indian Statute permitted mining on indigenous lands; a decree in 1983 restricted mining to minerals necessary only for national defense and security, but still allowed private companies to have licenses and use indigenous labor if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3339531|title=The Politics of Indigenous Land Rights in Brazil on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=762266|title=Development, Conservation, and Indigenous Rights in Brazil on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the early 1970s, FUNAI president General Jerônimo Bandeira de Mello approved the plan for a [[Trans-Amazonian Highway|trans-Amazonian highway]] that would run through Brazil's Amazon to Peru's frontier.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This highway granted access to the previously inaccessible interior of the Amazon, allowing government and private agencies to use it for their advantage. The highway led to the relocation and extermination of many indigenous tribes by the government and other private agencies, and logging along the highway directly led to deforestation along the affected parts of the Amazon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartzman|first=Stephan|last2=Boas|first2=André Villas|last3=Ono|first3=Katia Yukari|last4=Fonseca|first4=Marisa Gesteira|last5=Doblas|first5=Juan|last6=Zimmerman|first6=Barbara|last7=Junqueira|first7=Paulo|last8=Jerozolimski|first8=Adriano|last9=Salazar|first9=Marcelo|date=2013-06-05|title=The natural and social history of the indigenous lands and protected areas corridor of the Xingu River basin|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1619/20120164|journal=Phil.

Possuelo and other sertanistas were disturbed by the amount of indigenous deaths their contact caused, and met in 1987 to try to stop it. Possuelo's efforts greatly influenced FUNAI's change in policy from "pacification" and integration to preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3130-sydney-possuelo-experiences-of-contact|title=Uncontacted tribes: Contact, respect and isolation|last=International|first=Survival|website=www.survivalinternational.org|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contact with isolated tribes ==
The Central Department for Isolated Indians and Recently Contacted Indians is a division within FUNAI to handle dealings with isolated indigenous tribes. Article 231 of the 1988 Constitution expresses indigenous peoples' rights to preserve their culture, traditions, and customs; since contact with mainstream society could jeopardize isolated tribes' culture, FUNAI undertakes efforts to maintain these tribes' isolation.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.funai.gov.br/index.php/nossas-acoes/povos-indigenas-isolados-e-de-recente-contato|title=Povos Indígenas Isolados e de Recente Contato|website=www.funai.gov.br|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGIIRC division is responsible for protecting areas with known isolated tribes from outside contact, since outside contact could spread disease within indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guilherme|first=Alexandre|date=2015-10-02|title=Indigenous Education in Brazil: The Issue of Contacted and Noncontacted Native Indians|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15595692.2015.1050488|journal=Diaspora, Indigenous, and Minority Education|volume=9|issue=4|pages=205–220|doi=10.1080/15595692.2015.1050488|issn=1559-5692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department is present in 12 regions of Brazil's Amazon region, and almost all of Brazil's known uncontacted tribes reside within already demarcated lands.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; FUNAI has records of about 107 isolated Indians' presence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Legislation and demarcation efforts ==
The [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1988]] recognized Indians' rights to practice their customs without pressure to assimilate or integrate into mainstream Brazilian society. Article 231 also defines Indians' rights to their lands, and outlines FUNAI's responsibility to [[demarcation problem|demarcate]] those lands. The article also provides that mining and other energy resources on indigenous lands is only allowed with the approval of Congress, and after taking into account the Indigenous populations' input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/c/direitos/constituicoes/introducao|title=Rights &gt; Constitution &gt; Constitutional rights of the indigenous peoples|website=pib.socioambiental.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution set a goal of demarcating indigenous lands in five years, but by 1993 only 291 of 559 [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] were demarcated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stocks|first=Anthony|date=2005-01-01|title=TOO MUCH FOR TOO FEW: Problems of Indigenous Land Rights in Latin America|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.143844|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=34|issue=1|pages=85–104|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.143844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Decree 22 outlined five steps FUNAI must follow to demarcate indigenous lands:
# FUNAI's president is responsible for establishing an anthropological team to identify the lands to be demarcated.
# The team must then prepare a report of their findings.
# The team must publish the report to the ''[[Diário Oficial da União|Diário Oficial da Uniao]]'' and submit it to the [[Ministry of Justice (Brazil)|Minister of Justice]], who will review the report and issue an Administrative Decree outlining the area's boundaries.
# The FUNAI is responsible for physically demarcating the lands, checking with the Minister of Justice and the President for continuous approval.
# Finally FUNAI registers the property with the Federal Property Departement.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Sara Gavney|last2=Lemos|first2=Maria Carmen|date=1999-05-01|title=Indigenous Policy in Brazil: The Development of Decree 1775 and the Proposed Raposa/Serra do Sol Reserve, Roraima, Brazil|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/13670|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|pages=444–463|doi=10.1353/hrq.1999.0026|issn=1085-794X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996, Brazil's [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|President Cardoso]] passed [[Decree 1775]], which effectively revoked Decree 22 and expanded the ways that commercial interests could contest the demarcation of lands. Individuals or companies were allowed from the beginning of the demarcation process until 90 days after FUNAI issued their report to submit an appeal showing that the contested lands do not meet the qualifications of indigenous lands as stated in the constitution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The government claimed that allowing people to contest indigenous lands during the demarcation process would prevent any future challenges of completed lands on the basis of unconstitutionality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hhrj12&amp;div=6&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Rights and Status of Indigenous Peoples: A Global Comparative and International Legal Analysis  12 Harvard Human Rights Journal 1999|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree was widely contested as a violation of indigenous rights, earning the nickname of the "Genocide Decree," due to the power it gave to commercial interests to exploit Indian lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Samara|year=2003|title=Colonialism Continues: A Comparative Analysis of the United States and Brazil's Exploitation of Indigenous Peoples' Forest Resources|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umialr53&amp;div=35&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|journal=Vermont Law Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1996, FUNAI had received over 500 appeals for over 40 indigenous territories that were in the process of being demarcated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/brazil-eng/chaper%206%20.htm|title=Brazil 1997 - Chapter VI|website=www.cidh.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; FUNAI followed procedure and submitted its official opinion to the Ministry of Justice, rejecting the appeals that were brought against the indigenous lands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Justice [[Nelson Jobim]] sided with FUNAI on all except eight territories, ordering further investigation.

One of these territories was the [[Raposa Serra do Sol|Raposa/Serra do Sol]] region in the northern state of [[Roraima]], home to the Macuxi, [[Wapixana]]s, Ingaricós, [[Taurepang]]s and [[Patamona]]s peoples. FUNAI identified almost 1.8 million hectares of these lands to be demarcated in 1977, but opposition from farmers and mining companies in the region prevented completion of its demarcation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chernela|first=Janet|year=2001|title=FRACTURED LANDS: The Politics of Conservation in North-Central Brazil|url=http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/1528/Chernela2001Entrecaminos.doc.txt?sequence=5|journal=Entrecaminos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Latin American Affairs|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Decree 1775, the claims against the Raposa/Serra do Sol regions were backed by the Roraima state government, which supported breaking up the area into smaller settlements.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Despite FUNAI's recommendations to demarcate the entire indigenous region, commercial and state pressure led Justice Nelson Jobim to order the reduction of land under Decree 1775.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; FUNAI, along with other indigenous rights organizations like the Indigenous Council of Roraima (CIR), Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB), and Council for the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples and Organizations in Brazil (CAPOIB) worked together in opposition to this decision.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chernela|first=Janet|year=2006|title=Lex Talionis: Recent Advances and Retreats in Indigenous Rights in Brazil|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/8506114/JLAAChernela06.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1479328360&amp;Signature=x1uqcZCaAi8EadEssWJXxPoZ03U%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DLex_Talionis_Recent_Advances_and_Retreat.pdf|journal=Actualidades|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was finally recognized as an indigenous territory in 2005.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017}}

On December 28, 2009, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|President Luís Inácio (Lula) da Silva]] signed Presidential Decree 7056, also known as the "FUNAI Statute".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guzman|first=Tracy|year=2012|title=Writing Indigenous Activism in Brazil: Belo Monte and the Acampamento Indígena Revolucionário|url=|journal=A Contracorriente|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree restructured FUNAI, effectively closing hundreds of indigenous posts and regional FUNAI offices.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cimi.org.br/site/pt-br/?system=news&amp;action=read&amp;id=4391|title=CIMI - Conselho Indigenista Missionário|last=WV|website=www.cimi.org.br|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government never consulted with indigenous populations, even though under Convention 169 of the [[International Labour Organization]], the government is required to discuss legal changes that would affect indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This led to hundreds of indigenous people, deeming themselves the Revolutionary Indigenous Camp, to protest outside the Ministry of Justice building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Native and National in Brazil: Indigeneity After Independence|last=Guzman|first=Tracy|publisher=UNC Press Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters called for the resignation of FUNAI president Márcio Augusto Freitas de Meira and the revocation of Decree 7056.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6785">The '''Global Risks Report''' is an annual study published by the [[World Economic Forum]] ahead of the Forum’s Annual Meeting in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]]. Based on the work of the Global Risk Network, the report describes changes occurring in the global risks landscape from year to year and identifies [[global catastrophic risks]]. The report also explores the interconnectedness of risks, and considers how the strategies for the mitigation of global risks might be structured. 

Sources for the report include an assessment by several major insurance and reinsurance companies and focus workshops, interviews and a survey of internationally recognised experts. The report is intended to raise awareness about the need for a multi-[[stakeholder approach]] to the mitigation of global risk. 

== By year ==
{{Update section|date=January 2017}}
'''&lt;big&gt;2018&lt;/big&gt;'''

The [http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2018/ Global Risks report 2018] highlights four concerns: (1) persistent inequality and unfairness, (2) domestic and international political tensions, (3) environmental dangers and (4) cyber vulnerabilities. One recurring theme is humanity's inadequate competence in dealing with complex systems and the danger of complacency.

=== 2009 ===
The Global Risks report 2009 identifies deteriorating fiscal positions, a hard landing in China, a collapse in asset prices, gaps in global governance and issues relating to natural resources and climate as the pivotal risks facing the world this year. While Global Risks 2008 highlighted food security, systemic financial risk and supply chain risk as areas of focus for the short term, Global Risks 2009 focuses on the impact of the financial crisis on levels of economic risk and its implications for other risk areas. The 2009 report stresses the importance of considering the long-term implications of many of the decisions taken today in response to immediate financial and economic challenges. The report also explores how the lack of effective global governance was a factor in the financial crisis and could potentially exacerbate a number of other global risks if not properly addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7824708.stm ''China slowdown 'big global risk' ''], BBC News, 13 January 2009, retrieved on 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-PresidentPostcards/idUSTRE50C23520090113 ''World faces risks from climate change to China slump''], Reuters, 13 January 2009, retrieved on 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-01-13-wef-warns-govt-bailouts-could-backfire ''World WEF warns govt bailouts could backfire''], Agence France Presse in Mail &amp; Guardian, 13 January 2009, retrieved on 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/wires/ap/business/2009/01/13/D95MAA9O0_eu_world_forum_global_risks/index.html ''Study sees risk of $1 trillion asset collapse''], Associated Press in Salon.com, 13 January 2009, retrieved on 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/4227442/World-Economic-Forum-highlights-Chinese-slump-as-biggest-risk-to-global-economy.html ''World Economic Forum highlights Chinese slump as biggest risk to global economy''], The Daily Telegraph, 13 January 2009, retrieved on 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123186003900377447 ''China Growth Slump Poses Global Risk, Report Says''], Wall Street Journal, 13 January 2009, retrieved on 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global risk ==
The particularity of this Global Risks report is that it considers risks that are global in their nature and impact, such that they would have a widespread impact should they play out. The criteria for what constitutes a global risk have been set as follows:

* '''Global scope''': To be considered global, a risk should have the potential to affect (including both primary and secondary impact) at least three world regions in at least two different continents. While these risks may have regional or even local origin, their impact can potentially be felt globally.
* '''Cross-industry relevance''': The risk has to affect three or more industries (including both primary and secondary impact).
* '''Uncertainty''': There is uncertainty about how the risk manifests itself within ten years combined with uncertainty about the magnitude of its impact (assessed in terms of likelihood and severity). 
* '''Economic impact''': The risk has the potential to cause economic damage of at 10 billion US$ or more; and/or Public Impact: The risk has the potential to cause major human suffering and to trigger considerable public pressure and global policy responses. 
* '''Multi-stakeholder approach''': The risk’s complexity both in terms of its effects and its drivers as well as its inter-linkages with other risks require a multi-stakeholder approach for its mitigation.

== The Global Risk Network ==
{{Update section|date=January 2017}}
The Global Risk Network was established in 2004 and tracks the evolution of a set of risks in five areas over a ten year time frame. The five areas are: Economics, Geopolitics, Environment, Society, Technology. In 2009 the set of risks totalled 36, up from 31 in the 2008 taxonomy. Each year the risk set is assessed using quantitative and qualitative means in terms of likelihood and severity to come up with a 'Risk Landscape' of risks to watch in the short to medium term. These include high likelihood and high severity risks, but also low likelihood and high severity risks that constitute 'outliers' whose impact would be significant in the unlikely event they would occur.
The Global Risk Network also publishes a selection of regional and topical reports each year. Its latest publications include: India@Risk 2008, Europe@Risk 2008, Global Growth@Risk 2008, and Africa@Risk 2008.

'''''God and the State''''' (called by its author '''''The Historical Sophisms of the Doctrinaire School of Communism''''') is an [[unfinished creative work|unfinished manuscript]] by the [[Russia]]n [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]], published posthumously in [[1882]]. The work criticises [[Christianity]] and the then-burgeoning [[technocracy]] movement from a [[materialism|materialist]], anarchist and [[individualism|individualist]] perspective. Early editions contained rewrites by [[Carlo Cafiero]] and [[Élisée Reclus]] in order to make the work more poetic in the translated [[French language|French]] and due to misreadings, but later translations have attempted to remain more faithful to the original text. It has gone on to become Bakunin's most widely read and praised work.

==Composition==
''God and the State'' was written in February and March 1871. It was originally written as Part II of a greater work that was going to be called ''The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leier|first=Mark|year=2006|pp=306|title=[[Bakunin: The Creative Passion]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-58322-894-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part I was to deal with the background of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and a general history of European resistance to [[imperialism]]. ''God and the State'', like most of Bakunin's work, is unfinished and disjointed. When Bakunin was criticized on this he said, "My life is a fragment." ''God and the State'' is indeed a fragment; the book has paragraphs that drop out and pick up in mid-sentence, footnotes that are four or five paragraphs long, and the book itself stops abruptly in mid-sentence.

== Discovery and publication history ==

''God and the State'' was discovered by [[Carlo Cafiero]] and [[Élisée Reclus]], two prominent anarchists at the time, and close friends of Bakunin around the time of his death. The two looked tirelessly for the missing parts of the book, but had no success. They translated the book into French and distributed it as a pamphlet in [[Geneva]] in 1882. Cafiero and Reclus titled the book ''Dieu et l'état'' (God and the State) although Bakunin originally titled the book ''The Historical Sophisms of the Doctrinaire School of [[Communism]]''. The book's original title was not discovered in Bakunin's diary until after Cafiero and Reclus's deaths.

In 1883, the American anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]] translated the book into English and distributed it in pamphlet form throughout Boston. He ran into many problems, however, because when Cafiero and Reclus translated the original manuscript into French, they sometimes changed words around to give the French a more literary quality, and often misread Bakunin's handwriting.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
The first number of ''[[The Anarchist]]'' published in 1885 in London by [[Henry Seymour (secularist)|Henry Seymour]] held an announcement of a translation into English by [[Marie Le Compte]].{{sfn|On Picket Duty 1885|p=47}}
The International Publishing Company announced that the profits would go to the Red Cross of the Russian Revolutionary Party.{{sfn|An English anarchist|1885|p=10}}

A correct French translation was released in 1908, and a new English edition was released in London in 1910. In 1916, the Lithuanian-born anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] released a re-print of the 1910 London edition for the radical journal ''Mother Earth''. Since ''God and the State's'' first publication it has been one of Bakunin's greatest known works. It has been translated into many languages including English, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Polish, Greek, Czech, Georgian Romanian, Turkish and Yiddish.

The '''Green Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Verde}}), often shortened to '''The Greens''' ({{lang|ro|Verzii}}) is a Romanian political party centred on [[green politics]]. It is a member of the [[European Green Party]].

==Policies==

Despite its support for environmental causes, such as reforestation and reductions in carbon emissions, the Green Party also advocates some free-market policies, such as the [[privatisation]] of state-owned enterprises. It supports an extension in individual rights as well as greater [[separation of church and state]], including a gradual removal of all state funding for religious institutions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Like the vast majority of Romanian political parties, it is supportive of [[European integration]]. It is the Romanian party that is most supportive of [[LGBT rights in Romania|LGBT rights]], supporting same-sex marriage and civil partnerships, as well as measures to reduce homophobia in schools and society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://remuscernea.ro/2010/05/partidul-verde-din-romania-va-participa-la-marsul-diversitatii-din-cadrul-gayfest/|title=Partidul Verde din România va participa la Marşul Diversităţii din cadrul GayFest - Remus Cernea|work=remuscernea.ro|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green libertarianism''' (also known as '''eco-libertarianism''') is a hybrid [[political philosophy]] that has developed in the [[United States]]. Based upon a mixture of political [[Third party (politics)|third party]] values, such as the environmental and economic platform from the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] and the [[civil liberties]] platform of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], the green libertarian philosophy attempts to consolidate [[progressivism|progressive]] or [[agrarianism|agrarian]] values with [[libertarianism]]. While green libertarians have tended to associate with the Green Party, the movement has grown to encompass [[economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who advocate [[free market]]s and commonly identify with contemporary [[Libertarianism in the United States|American libertarianism]].

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Left-libertarianism|Left-libertarian]] political philosophy, like that of the greens, is historically rooted in the [[individualist anarchism|individualist]] and [[social anarchism|social schools]] of anarchism. [[anarchist communism|Anarcho-communist]] theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian prince and leading opponent of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[social Darwinism]], developed a theory of how "mutual aid" is the real basis for social organization in his ''Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Lee Alan | last=Dugatkin | title=The Prince of Evolution: Peter Kropotkin's Adventures in Science and Politics | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-prince-of-evolution-peter-kropotkin/ | website=[[Scientific American]] | date={{Date|2011-09-13}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-05}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhonian]] [[Mutualism (movement)|mutualism]]). [[Murray Bookchin]] and the Institute for Social Ecology sought to further elaborate these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Murray | last=Bookchin | title=Deep Ecology, Anarcho-Syndicalism and the Future of Anarchist Thought | url=http://www.social-ecology.org/1992/07/deep-ecology-anarcho-syndicalism-and-the-future-of-anarchist-thought/ | publisher=[[Institute for Social Ecology]] | date={{Date|1992-07-11}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-05}}  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin was one of the main influences behind the formation of the [[German Green Party]], the first green party to win seats in state and national parliaments.

Some more moderate, green libertarians are both [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[grassroots democracy|democratic]]. [[New England Transcendentalism]] (especially [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Bronson Alcott]]) and [[German Romanticism]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] and other "[[anarcho-primitivism|back to nature]]" movements combined with anti-war, anti-industrialism, civil liberties and decentralization movements are all part of this tradition. The modern Green Party of the United States seeks to apply these ideas to a more pragmatic system of democratic governance as opposed to contemporary [[anarcho-capitalism|right]] or [[left anarchism]].

== Natural capitalism ==
[[Sustainability]] advocates [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]] posited in their book ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'' (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  The 2006 book ''[[Green to Gold (book)|Green to Gold]]'', written by environmental scholars [[Daniel C. Esty]] and Andrew S. Winston, provided ideas on how companies can apply the principles of green libertarianism.&lt;ref name=alter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gadfly.igc.org/papers/liberty.htm |title=With Liberty for Some |author=Ernest Partridge |accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] is especially important to understanding the organic view{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} of society and how most human institutions, including law and the economy, are "the result of human action but not of human design".{{Clarify|date=December 2016}} In his last major work, ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'', Hayek differentiates between endogenous orders or self-organizing systems and exogenous orders imposed from without.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}}

Hayek argues&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; that free and [[sustainable]] societies and economies which support them should follow general guidelines, such as "[[Seven generation sustainability|7th Generation Principle]]" rather than specific economic laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/warrior/content/timeline/opendoor/roleOfChief.html|title=Eli Parker: The Role of Chief|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS Online|publisher=|access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balance of ecology and economics ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2013|discuss=Talk:Green libertarianism#Balance of ecology and economics}}
A fundamental concern among green libertarians is the health of global [[ecology]] and [[carrying capacity]] in view of [[Adaptation to global warming|climate adaptation]]. The green libertarian philosophy recognizes that ecology and [[economics]] are inseparable. It seeks a system of effective [[environmental law]] that is compatible with civil liberties and [[market economy]].

Green libertarians believe there should be a clear distinction between [[science]] and [[political ideology]]. For example, a green libertarian might be concerned by the phrases such as "wealth redistribution" and "reducing poverty" in the [[Stern Review]] and in some [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] documents and statements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Among green libertarians, the preservation of civil and economic [[Individualism|individual freedom]] may take precedence over long-term climate concerns because ultimately humans are part of nature. They believe that natural ecologies, like the free markets, are dynamic and self-adjusting systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Limited government ===
As part of the libertarian tradition, green libertarians maintain that the government itself is responsible for most environmental degradation, either directly or by encouraging and protecting politically powerful corporations and other organized interests which degrade, pollute and deplete the natural environment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The government should be thus held accountable to all the same environmental regulations they place on businesses. One problem is that while private corporations or individuals can be sued under the common law for damaging the environment, the government protects itself from the same suits, therefore green libertarians call for the abolition of [[sovereign immunity]]. Increasingly, federal and state law is being amended by lobbyists for those who pollute or extract resources from public lands or waterways so that such actions can no longer be challenged in the courts.

The green libertarian philosophy supports [[constitutional liberalism|constitutionally]] [[limited government]], [[grassroots democracy]] and [[decentralization|decentralized]] [[minarchism]]. Although many in the movement oppose [[business#Government regulation|government regulation]] of business, believing it to be generally counterproductive, they contend that different legal and economic principles such as [[environmental full-cost accounting|full-cost accounting]] or "internalizing externalities" – rather than government regulations – would be more effective at remedying problems such as [[pollution]]. A central tenet of a [[free-market environmentalism|libertarian environmentalist]] stance is that corporate [[Externality|externalities]] are not priced into the market correctly, creating [[market distortion]]s in the valuation and price of goods, healthy living and the value of the environment. [[Greenhouse gases]] should be taxed directly according to a formula which calculates the negative costs to the global environment of burning more non-renewable [[fossil fuels]]. This approach, it is argued, also has the advantage of providing the correct [[price signal]]s to utilities and other energy consumers so that they can rapidly convert to more environmentally friendly technologies. The [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] advocates this kind of [[market economy|market-based]] environmental protection strategy.

'''Human rights in Israel''' refers to the [[human rights]] record of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] as evaluated by [[intergovernmental organization]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and human rights activists, often in the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the wider [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and [[Israeli politics|Israel internal politics]].

Israel is a [[Multi-party system|multiparty]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]]. It was described in its [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as a "Jewish state"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/israel.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Declaration of Israel's Independence 1948 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the legal definition "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" was adopted in 1985. In addition to its Jewish majority, Israel is home to religious and ethnic minorities, some of whom report discrimination. In the [[Palestinian territories]], successive [[Israeli government]]s have been subject to international [[Criticism of Israel|criticism]] from other countries as well as international human rights groups. One of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]], intended to form the basis of a future constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gavison|first=Ruth|year=1985|title=The Controversy over Israel’s Bill of Rights|url=|journal=Israel Yearbook of Human Rights|volume=15|pages=113–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (Israel)|Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty]], is a major tool for safeguarding human rights and civil liberties in the State of Israel.

According to the 2015 US Department of State's [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]], Israel faces significant human rights problems regarding institutional discrimination of [[Arab citizens of Israel]] (many of whom self-identify as Palestinian), Ethiopian Israelis and women, and the treatment of refugees and irregular migrants. Other human rights problems include institutional discrimination against non-Orthodox Jews and intermarried families, and labor rights abuses against foreign workers.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite criticism of its human rights record, Israel is seen as being more politically free and democratic than neighboring countries in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

The Council of the [[League of Nations]] adopted a resolution on 4 September 1931 regarding the general conditions required before the mandate regime could be brought to an end. The new government was to provide an oral or written declaration acknowledging acceptance of an obligation to constitutionally guarantee the equal rights of ethnic and religious [[Minority group|minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Luther Harris Evans, "The General Principles Governing the Termination of a Mandate, The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Oct., 1932), pp. 735–758, American Society of International Law&lt;/ref&gt; That resolution followed a longstanding precedent of [[international law]] in cases where the [[Great power|Great Powers]] had assisted in the restoration of sovereignty over a territory.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Krasner, Sovereignty, Princeton University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-691-00711-X}}, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;  The UN resolution on "The Future Government of Palestine" contained both a plan of partition and a [[Minority Treaties|Minority Protection Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;
The UN Secretariat reported that the General Assembly established a formal minority rights protection system as an integral part of UN GAR 181(II), 29 November 1947; the 'Plan for the Future Government of Palestine'. Resolution 181(II) was adopted in the second session of the General Assembly. It was cataloged during a review of Minority Rights Treaties conducted in 1950: see Chapter III, A.1. of the UN Document [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/GL9/006/98/PDF/GL900698.pdf E/CN.4/367] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018060847/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/GL9/006/98/PDF/GL900698.pdf |date=18 October 2013 }}, 7 April 1950.&lt;br&gt;UN GAR 181(II) is also listed in the Table of Treaties, on Page xxxviii, of Self-determination and National Minorities, Oxford Monographs in International Law, Thomas D. Musgrave, Oxford University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-19-829898-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It placed minority, women's, and religious rights under the protection of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. The plan provided specific guarantees of fundamental human rights. The new states were to supply a declaration, which according to precedent was tantamount to a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;See International Human Rights in Context, Henry J. Steiner, Philip Alston, Ryan Goodman, Oxford University Press US, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-927942-X}}, page 100&lt;/ref&gt;
The resolution stated that "the stipulations contained in the declarations are recognized as fundamental laws of State, and no law, regulation or official action shall conflict or interfere with these stipulations, nor shall any law, regulation or official action prevail over them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, November 29, 1947, C.

During the hearings on Israel's application for membership in the United Nations, Abba Eban said that the rights stipulated in UN resolution 181(II) had been constitutionally embodied as the fundamental law of the state of Israel as required by the resolution. The instruments that he cited during the hearings were the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, and various cables and letters of confirmation addressed to the Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cattan, The Palestine Question, Saqi Books, 2000, {{ISBN|0-86356-932-3}}, pages 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verbatim record, FIFTY-FIRST MEETING, HELD AT LAKE SUCCESS, NEW YORK, ON MONDAY, 9 May 1949 : AD HOC POLITICAL COMMITTEE, GENERAL ASSEMBLY, 3RD SESSION, A/AC.24/SR.51, 1 January 1949. See [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/NL4/900/16/PDF/NL490016.pdf A/818 ''Application of Israel for admission to membership in the United Nations (conclusion)''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018072812/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/NL4/900/16/PDF/NL490016.pdf |date=18 October 2013 }}, p.346-&lt;/ref&gt;
Eban's explanations and Israel's undertakings were noted in the text of General Assembly Resolution 273 (III) Admission of Israel to membership in the United Nations, 11 May 1949.

The [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] proclaimed, on 14 May 1948, that "the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country" was recognized in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of 2 November 1917, and re-affirmed in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate]] of the [[League of Nations]] which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the [[Jew|Jewish people]] and "[[Land of Israel|Eretz-Israel]] [Land of Israel] and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home." It also declared that the state "will be open for [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the [[Prophet#Prophets in Jewish thought|prophets of Israel]]; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought|conscience]], language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Israel#I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some British academics argue that Israel has not fulfilled its obligation to constitutionally protect minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;Guy S. Goodwin-Gill, and Stefan Talmon, eds., The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999) page 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.P. O'Connell author "The Law of State Succession", Volume V of the Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law, 1956, Hersh Lauterpacht editor, pages 10–11, and 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Schmidt, "Foundations of Civil and Political Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories", GRIN Verlag, 2008, {{ISBN|3-638-94450-6}}, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallison's testimony during the Senate hearings on "[https://www.loc.gov/law/find/hearings/pdf/00139297647.pdfThe Colonization Of The West Bank Territories By Israel]", page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Israel was admitted to the United Nations in accordance with General Assembly resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from the Yearbook of the International Law Commission]: 1950, vol. II, Law of Treaties, [http://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_19_treaties.pdf UN Document: A/CN.4/19], page 21, paragraphs 21–23,&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israeli Supreme Court]] has ruled that the Declaration of Independence is not a constitution and cannot be used to invalidate laws and regulations that contradict it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Proclamation of Independence|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/megilat_eng.htm|publisher=Israeli Knesset|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (Israel)|Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty]], states that fundamental human rights in Israel shall be upheld in the spirit of the principles set forth in the Declaration, but it specifically exempted legislation that was already in force. Israeli legal scholars say that the wording of the law was adopted to avoid the difficulty of giving priority to equality, which was not expressly entrenched. The result is that the principle of equality can be reversed by ordinary legislation, and furthermore will not override statutory or judge-made laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dinstein|first=Yoram|title=Israel Yearbook on Human Rights, Volume 25, Volume 1995|year=1996|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-0258-2|pages=210–212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nFuStivk_NYC&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ilan|first=Shahar|title=MKs debate protection of 'equality' in future constitution|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/mks-debate-protection-of-equality-in-future-constitution-1.234565|publisher=''Haaretz''|accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli citizens and human rights organizations have criticized the Israeli government for assailing [[civil society]] organizations and [[human rights activists]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], 16 Jan. 2011, "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/16/thousands-israelis-rally-rights-organisations| Thousands of Israelis Rally in Defence of Human and Civil Rights: Tel Aviv Sees Largest Demonstration in Years as People Protest against Parliamentary Investigation into Funding of Rights Groups]"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[The Nation]], 26, Feb. 2016, "[https://www.thenation.com/article/israel-unleashes-onslaught-on-human-rights-ngos-artists-and-writers/ Israel Unleashes an Onslaught on Human-Rights NGOs, Artists, and Writers: The new wave of McCarthyite smears and repressive laws is unprecedented]"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], 12 Apr. 2016, [https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/israeli-government-must-cease-intimidation-of-human-rights-defenders-protect-them-from-attacks/ Israeli Government Must Cease Intimidation of Human Rights Defenders, Protect Them from Attacks]"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[New Israel Fund]], 28 Jan. 2016, "[https://www.nif.org/news-media/out-loud/we-refuse-to-back-down/ We Refuse to Back Down]"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI), Israel's oldest and largest civil liberties organization, a series of Israeli government efforts in recent years have attacked Israeli [[civil society]] and the [[Supreme Court of Israel]]. A December 2017 ACRI report presents what it views as examples of persistent Israeli government attack against Israeli democracy, human rights, the right to protest, respect for the underlying value of equality, and the liberties of political, social and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Association for Civil Rights in Israel, "[https://www.acri.org.il/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/December-Overview-of-Anti-Democratic-Legislation-2017.pdf Overview of Anti-Democratic Legislation Advanced by the 20th Knesset]," (ACRI report published December 2017) retrieved 9 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; This trend in Israel has been called "constitutional retrogression" by some legal analysts.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Maryland School of Law]], ''Maryland Law Review'', [http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3778&amp;context=mlr| A Jewish and (Declining) Democratic State?

===Elections, political parties, and representation===
{{Main|Elections in Israel|Women's suffrage|Universal suffrage|Right of foreigners to vote}}
According to the 2015 [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] report on Israel, "The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government in free and fair periodic elections based on universal and equal suffrage, and citizens exercised this ability." Elections held in March 2015 were considered free and fair by observers. A change in the electoral threshold was criticized as limiting representation of small parties, particularly affecting the Arab minority. This resulted in the four Arab-majority parties uniting into one faction, the Joint List, which won 13 seats and became the third-largest faction in the Knesset. Most Palestinians in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] live under Israeli occupation and are not Israeli citizens. They are not allowed to vote in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheizaf |first=Noam |date=30 October 2012 |title=Who gets to vote in Israel's democracy? |url=https://972mag.com/who-gets-to-vote-in-israels-democracy/58756/ |access-date= 23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women faced significant cultural barriers in political parties representing conservative religious movements and, to a lesser degree, the Arab minority. In the 2015 election, the 120-member Knesset had 29 female members and 15 Arab members. Three women were appointed to the cabinet, and for the first time an Arab Israeli chaired a permanent committee.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

===Freedom of religion===
{{Main|Religion in Israel|Freedom of religion by country}}
[[File:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Western Wall]], [[Jerusalem]]]]
Although Israel describes itself as a Jewish state, all religious groups have freedom to practice and maintain communal institutions in Israel.  According to the 2009 US Department of State report on Israel and the occupied territories, "The Israeli Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty provides for freedom of worship and the Government generally respected this right in practice." The report added that "Government policy continued to support the generally free practice of religion, although governmental and legal discrimination against non-Jews and non-Orthodox streams of Judaism continued" and "Many Jewish citizens objected to exclusive Orthodox control over fundamental aspects of their personal lives." The report stated that approximately 310,000 citizens who immigrated to Israel under the [[Law of Return]] are not considered Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate and therefore cannot be married or divorced, or buried in Jewish state cemeteries within the country.&lt;ref name = "USDS2009"&gt;{{cite web

According to a 2009 report from the US Department of State's [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]], Israel falls short of being a tolerant or pluralistic society. According to the report, Israel discriminates against Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, Reform Jews, Christians, women and Bedouins. All 137 official holy sites recognized by Israel are Jewish, ignoring and neglecting Christian and Muslim sites.&lt;ref name="HaaretzTolerance"/&gt;

===Marriage laws===
{{Main|Marriage in Israel}}

A couple wishing to marry can do so through a religious ceremony, if [[Jewish view of marriage|Jewish]], [[Islamic view of marriage|Muslim]], [[Christian view of marriage|Christian]], or other. Non-religious couples, since 2014, can have a kind of [[civil marriage]] in Israel, and get through [[New Family Organization]] a [[Relationships Card]] that changes their status to a couple, and entitles them with all of the rights that come from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/97DAEDE3-9271-40E7-ADF9-4C91058FAF75/42863/7326.pdf רשומות הכנסת, קובץ התקנות, 7326, הודעת ברית הזוגיות לחסרי דת (אגרות), התשע"ד-2014. עמוד 486.]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news1.co.il/uploadFiles/543728053569794.pdf |format=PDF |title=משפחה חדשה |publisher=News1.co.il |accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mako.co.il/pride-news/local/Article-bf5f377c4709a41006.htm |title=לראשונה: תעודת הזוגיות של "משפחה חדשה" הוכרה כנישואים |publisher=Mako.co.il |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common-law marriage]] gives couples the same rights as married couples enjoy. Israeli citizens may also travel abroad for a civil marriage, which is then binding under Israeli law.

During the [[Second Intifada|Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in 2003, the Knesset made a temporary amendment to the [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]] which prohibited Palestinians married to Israelis from gaining Israeli citizenship or residency. Critics argue that the law is racist because it is targeted at Israeli Arabs who are far more likely to have Palestinian spouses than other Israelis; defenders say the law is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the Jewish character of Israel.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=721352006 |title=Arab spouses face Israeli legal purge |author=Ben Lynfield |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |location=Edinburgh |date=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/01/MN110656.DTL |title=Israeli marriage law blocks citizenship for Palestinians |date=1 August 2003 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |first=New |last=York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination unanimously approved a resolution saying that the Israeli law violated an international human rights treaty against racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3152651.stm |title=UN blasts Israeli marriage law |publisher=BBC News |date=15 August 2003 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, [[Yaakov Levy]], said the resolution was "highly politicized", citing the committee's failure to grant Israel's request to present evidence of the "legislation's compliance with existing international law and practice", examples of "numerous concrete instances [in which the] granting of a legal status to Palestinian spouses of Israeli residents [was] abused by Palestinian residents of the territories for [[suicide terrorism]]", and also ignoring the fact that at the time of the UN resolution the matter was under review by the [[Israeli judicial system|Israeli High Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/cf0add5629254eb085256e1a005a49f8!OpenDocument A/58/18 of 22 August 2003]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122090420/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/cf0add5629254eb085256e1a005a49f8%21OpenDocument |date=22 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Israeli Supreme Court decision on this matter, Deputy Chief Justice Mishael Cheshin argued that, "Israeli citizens [do not] enjoy a constitutional right to bring a foreign national into Israel... and it is the right – moreover, it is the duty – of the state, of any state, to protect its residents from those wishing to harm them. And it derives from this that the state is entitled to prevent the immigration of enemy nationals into it – even if they are spouses of Israeli citizens – while it is waging an armed conflict with that same enemy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero060106.html|title=Israel’s "Demographic Demon" in Court|publisher=Middle East Report Online|date=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judiciary system and criminal justice===
{{Main|Israeli judicial system|List of national legal systems|Universal jurisdiction}}
Israeli law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary. The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel notes that the courts sometimes ruled against the executive branch, including in some security cases. Human Rights Groups believe these requirements are generally respected. The system is [[adversarial]] and cases are decided by [[professional judges]]. Indigent defendants receive mandatory representation. Some areas of the country fall under the separate judicial jurisdiction of military courts. These courts are believed to be in alignment with Israel's other criminal courts on matters pertaining to civilians. Convictions in these courts cannot be based on confession alone.&lt;ref name = "USDS2005" /&gt;

US Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan said, in 1987, that despite the difficulties in safeguarding civil liberties during times of security crises, "it may well be Israel, not the United States, that provides the best hope for building a jurisprudence that can protect civil liberties against the demands of national security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Brennan-Praises-Israel-s-Protection-Of-Civil-Liberties/id-8fcbe8ab5d1f07121fc5dec8ad1032be|title=Brennan Praises Israel's Protection Of Civil Liberties|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital punishment===
{{see also|Capital punishment in Israel|Use of capital punishment by country}}
Israeli law currently allows for the death penalty for serious crimes committed during wartime, but it has been abolished during peacetime. Current crimes during wartime include genocide, crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The only person to have ever been executed after conviction in an Israeli civilian court was the Nazi war-criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]].

===Rights of prisoners===
{{Wikisource|Jerusalem 1500}}

{{Wikisource|Jerusalem A-19}}
{{see also|Israel Prison Service|Life imprisonment in Israel|List of countries by incarceration rate}}
Regarding the conditions of imprisonment of prisoners, including [[Palestinian prisoners of Israel|security prisoners]] (the Israel Prison Service term for Palestinian prisoners), Israel is committed to two international treaties:&lt;ref name="knesset.gov.il"&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m03319.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504160748/https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m03319.pdf|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] – adopted in 1966, took effect in 1976 and was ratified in 1992.
* [[Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] – took effect in 1987 and was ratified in 1991.

In 1978, two [[telegraphy|cable]] messages, Jerusalem 1500 and Jerusalem 3239, sent from the [[Consulate General of the United States, Jerusalem|US Consulate General]] in [[Jerusalem]] to the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] in Washington, D.C., described abusive methods allegedly used by Israeli authorities to interrogate [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] detainees in Jerusalem and the [[West Bank]]. [[Alexandra Uteev Johnson|Alexandra U. Johnson]], the consular officer who wrote the cables, was terminated from the [[United States Foreign Service]] later that year; the cables became the focus of controversy when their contents became public in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. Reid and Edward Cody, "U.S. Reports Indicate Israeli Abuse of Palestinians," ''The Washington Post'', 7 February 1979, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  A third report, Jerusalem A-19, sent as an [[airgram]] message from the Consulate General in Jerusalem to the Department of State in October 1978, described the military trial of two young American citizens who reported that Israeli authorities used physical coercion to obtain confessions from them.  The report concluded that Israeli authorities were aware that "physical coercion and mistreatment" probably had been used to obtain the confessions.&lt;ref&gt;See full text of Jerusalem A-19 on Wikisource at [[s:Jerusalem A-19]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 [[Landau Commission]], headed by then-Supreme Court Justice [[Moshe Landau]], was appointed to examine the interrogation methods of the [[Shin Bet|Israel Security Agency]] (ISA) and said that "the exertion of a moderate degree of physical pressure cannot be avoided". Nevertheless, the commission condemned a 1982 internal memo that instructed interrogators on the kind of lies they should tell in court when denying they'd used physical force to obtain confessions. It condemned the perjury involved but advised against prosecution of those who'd carried it out. The second part of the Landau report remains secret, it is believed to contain guidelines for permissible interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Torture/Background.asp |title=Landau Commission examined interrogation methods |publisher=Btselem.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landau Commission resulted in hundreds of petitions by detained Palestinians complaining that force had been used against them during ISA interrogations. In isolated cases, interim orders were issued temporarily prohibiting the ISA from using all or some of the methods, but in September 1999 the High Court refused to rule whether they are legal under Israeli and international law.

In 1991, Israel ratified the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, a measure which states (Article 7) "no one shall be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". Critics say Israel is also in breach of section 2(2) of the Convention against torture which stipulates that, "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture."

In 1994, a State Comptroller's Report (partly released in summary form in February 2000) found that ISA interrogation methods contravened the law, the Landau Commission guidelines, and the internal guidelines formulated by the service itself.

In July 2002, ''[[Haaretz]]'' quoted a senior ISA official saying that, since the High Court's decision, 90 Palestinians had been defined as "ticking bombs" and "extraordinary interrogation methods," i.e. torture, was used against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/english/torture/ |title=Ha’aretz quoted a senior GSS official |publisher=Btselem.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Israeli interrogators have admitted that the ISA "uses every manipulation possible, up to shaking and beating." Dozens of affidavits from Palestinians also confirm that torture is still part of Israeli interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;Amoral America By Robert Fearn p.472&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture is reported by [[B'Tselem]] as having been carried out against individuals not suspected of crime, including religious sages, sheiks and religious leaders, persons active in charitable organizations, and Islamic students. Others to be tortured include brothers and other relatives of persons listed as "wanted" and any Palestinians in the engineering profession. In some cases, wives of the detained have been arrested and mistreated to further pressure their husbands. ISA agents have sometimes tortured Palestinians in order to recruit them as collaborators.&lt;ref name="btselem.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/torture/background|title=Background of the High Court of Justice's Decision|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B'Tselem estimates that the ISA annually interrogates between 1,000 and 1,500 Palestinians and uses methods constituting torture against some 85 percent of them, at least 850 persons a year.&lt;ref name="btselem.org"/&gt;

According to a 2011 report by two Israeli human rights organisations, the Public Committee Against Torture (PCAT) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Israeli doctors fail to report suspected torture and conceal related information, allowing Israeli Security Agency interrogators to use torture against Palestinian detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/03/israeli-doctors-report-torture-palestinian|title=Israeli doctors 'failing to report torture of Palestinian detainees'|author=Harriet Sherwood|work=the Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, a law authorized force-feeding of hunger-striking prisoners. However, the Israel Medical Association declared the legislation unethical and urged doctors to refuse to implement it.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

====Education programs====
Prisoners are allowed to take online courses from the [[Open University of Israel]], and to complete academic degrees. This is not a [[vested right]] but a benefit, contingent on good behavior, with prison authorities paying their university tuition. The courses are in the fields of: humanities, sociology, economics, management, psychology and political-science.&lt;ref name="knesset.gov.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3756751,00.html |title=100 Palestinian prisoners complete academic studies in jail - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is to give the prisoners the tools to deal with life outside, so that upon release from prison they will have the appropriate education to help them obtain jobs, and prevent them from returning to a life of crime.

====Political prisoners====
{{main|Palestinian prisoners in Israel}}
In 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Israel held thousands of Palestinians as political prisoners, and called on Israel to release them. Ban said the release of political prisoners would "serve as a significant confidence-building measure" and boost prospects of peace in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37698&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1|title=United Nations News Centre|date=7 March 2011|work=UN News Service Section|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has called on Israel to release political prisoners, saying "all political prisoners held without charge or trial should be tried in fair trials or immediately released".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=13419 |title=Press Releases |publisher= |accessdate=6 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603062041/http://amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=13419 |archivedate=3 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dugard]] has compared Israeli imprisonment of Palestinians to policies of Apartheid-era South Africa, saying "Apartheid's security police practiced torture on a large scale. So do the Israeli security forces. There were many political prisoners on Robben Island but there are more Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/11/201111395153781378.html|title=Apartheid and the occupation of Palestine|author=John Dugard|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Administrative detention=====
{{main|Administrative detention}}
[[Administrative detention]] is a procedure under which prisoners are held without charge or trial. The sentences are authorized by an administrative order from the Israeli Ministry of Defence or Israeli military commanders. [[Amnesty International]] believes that the practice breaches Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]  which "makes clear that no-one should be subjected to arbitrary detention and that deprivation of liberty must be based on grounds and procedures established by law". Amnesty International is also concerned that [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]] are being "held solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=====Education programs in prison for Security Imprisonments=====
In 2009, there were 250 Palestinian prisoners studying at Israel's Open University.&lt;ref name="Ynetnews.com"/&gt; In June 2011, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, in response to a halt in the peace talks, that Palestinian prisoners would no longer be granted the right to pursue academic degrees in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/netanyahu-israel-to-toughen-conditions-of-palestinian-prisoners-1.369269 |title=Netanyahu: Israel to toughen conditions of Palestinian prisoners |author=Barak Ravid |date=23 June 2011 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, three prisoners appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israeli Supreme Court]], which rejected their appeal. In their ruling, the judges stated that the right to free university education does not apply to those convicted of terror offenses. The ruling did, however, call on prison authorities to be "considerate" in deciding the cases of prisoners already in the midst of academic programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/163549#.UQ35UqXs6zo |title=Court: End of Free College for Terrorists - Defense/Security - News |publisher=Israel National News |date=2012-12-25 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of speech and the media===
{{See also|Freedom of speech|Freedom of speech by country|Blasphemy law|Censorship by country|Internet censorship and surveillance by country|Media of Israel|Censorship in Israel}}

[[File:Israeli Press 1949.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A cross-section of Israel's local newspapers in 1949.]]

According to the 2005 US Department of State report on Israel, "[t]he law provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally respected these rights in practice subject to restrictions concerning security issues." The law provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.&lt;ref name = "USDS2005"/&gt;

Some government officials and others have been critical of the [[freedom of speech]] rights afforded to [[Israeli settlers]] during their forced evacuation from the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]]. This led to the criticism that "the authorities took disproportional steps, unjustifiably infringing on the right to political expression and protest."&lt;ref name=acri&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Israel, policies of its government are subjected to criticism by its press as well as a variety of political, human rights and [[watchdog group]]s,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which include [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI), [[B'Tselem]], [[Machsom Watch]], [[Women in Black]] and [[Women for Israel's Tomorrow]]. According to the press freedom organization [[Reporters Without Borders]], "The Israeli media were once again in 2005 the only ones in the region that had genuine freedom to speak out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010, human rights groups operating in Israel complained of a hostile environment in the country, and said they were coming under attack for [[Criticism of Israel|criticising Israeli policies]]. The groups say that some Israeli leaders see human rights criticism as a threat to Israel's legitimacy, especially following war crimes allegations against the Israeli military over the [[Gaza War (2008–09)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/world/middleeast/06israel.html?_r=2&amp;ref=middleeast | work=The New York Times | first=Isabel | last=Kershner | title=Israeli Rights Groups View Themselves as Under Siege | date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Israel ranked 93rd in the [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]], down from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Israel slipped to 112 out of 179 countries in the press Freedom Index. Reporters without borders explained the change was due to Israeli actions in [[Operation Pillar of Defense]] during which it said "Israel Defense Forces intentionally attacked journalists and buildings where media connected to Hamas had premises". The organization also criticized arrests of Palestinian journalists and military censorship.&lt;ref name=NTHz&gt;{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Nati|title=Israel falls near bottom of press freedom rankings|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-falls-near-bottom-of-press-freedom-rankings.premium-1.500640|accessdate=2 February 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] ranked Israel as having a "Partly Free" media climate in 2009.

In 2003, [[Israel's film board]] banned the commercial screening of a film about the 2002 [[Battle of Jenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/transcripts/2003/jan/030101.gradstein.html |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=1 January 2003 |title=Israel Bans Film about Jenin Refugee Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, ''[[Jenin, Jenin]]'', was a collection of interviews with residents of the [[Jenin]] [[refugee camp]] filmed in April 2002, a week after the battle. [[Mohammad Bakri]], an Israeli Arab, directed the film. The film was banned due to its allegations of [[war crimes]] committed by [[Israeli forces]], which the board deemed false and hurtful to the soldiers' families. Following legal proceedings, a petition was filed to the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Supreme Court of Israel]], which unanimously overturned the board's decision, and allowed the movie to be shown in cinemas "for the public to decide", while noting that the movie was "full of lies", was not a documentary, and was made "without good faith", falsely portraying the Israeli soldiers as "the worst of war crime perpetrators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3262325.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=11 November 2003 |title=Israel court lifts Jenin film ban | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/court-jenin-jenin-untruthful-but-does-not-slander-soldiers-1.248801|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|title=Court: 'Jenin, Jenin' untruthful, but does not slander soldiers|date=June 30, 2008|accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the Israeli parliament endorsed a right-wing proposal to investigate some of Israel's best-known human rights organisations for "delegitimising" its military. The investigations would entail inquiries into the funding of several human rights groups that have criticised Israeli policies. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel described the decision as a "severe blow" to Israeli democracy, and critics labeled the policy as "[[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]]".&lt;ref name="IndependentMcCarthyism"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli-parliament-backs-mccarthyite-investigation-into-human-rights-groups-2177179.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Donald | last=MacIntyre | title=Israeli parliament backs 'McCarthyite' investigation into human rights groups | date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld major provisions of a law imposing consequences on those who call for boycotting Israel and occupied territories. The ruling sparked debate, with some protesting it ends freedom of speech while others say it affirms Israel's stand on "the destructive nature of the BDS" ([[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement). Israeli human rights groups had petitioned against the law, saying it infringes on freedom of speech. Supporters of the law say it prohibits "discrimination based on geography."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-rejects-appeal-against-anti-boycott-law/ High Court rejects appeal against anti-boycott law] The Times of Israel, 16 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "To exclude calls for a boycott from the category of free speech is incorrect," said Rabbi David Rosenn, [[New Israel Fund]]'s (NIF) executive vice president. "There is not a separate category for speech that is political. The most important speech is political, and people should have the ability to express their opinions without fear of government sanctions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/israel-news/bds-roiling-israel-us-college-campuses BDS Roiling Israel, U.S. College Campuses] The Jewish Week, 22 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The law empowers police to limit incitement to violence or [[hate speech]] and criminalizes calling persons "Nazis" or "fascists". The Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance prohibits expressing support for an organization deemed to be illegal or terrorist in nature.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{See also|Women's suffrage|Women's rights|Category:Women's rights in Israel|Category:Women's rights in the Middle East|Category:Middle Eastern women in politics}}
Israel is committed to the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] international treaty in regard to women's rights.

[[Women in Israel]] have been guaranteed gender equality since the establishment of the state in 1948. This has enabled
women to actively participate in Israeli life. The [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] states: "The State of Israel [...] will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex."

In 1969, Israel elected [[Golda Meir]] as prime minister and became the fourth country to have a woman holding such an office. In 2010, women's parliamentary representation in Israel was 18 percent, which is above the Arab world's average of 6 percent, equal to that of the US Congress, and far below the Scandinavian countries' 40-percent average.

The Israeli parliament, [[The Knesset]], has established The Committee on the Status of Women to address women's rights. The stated objectives of this committee are to prevent discrimination, combat violence against women, and promote equality in politics, lifecycle events and education. In 1998, the Knesset passed a law for "Prevention of [[Sexual Harassment]]".

With that said, the laws of the [[Status quo (Israel)|Status quo]] left the matters of marriage and managing the holy places to the officially recognized religious institutions. A 2009 report of the US Department of State mentions the problems of civil marriage, ''[[Agunah|agunot]]'' ('chained' women unable to divorce without their husband's permission), and mixed-gender prayer services at the Western Wall.&lt;ref name="USDS2009"/&gt;

Women's rights are promoted through "Bringing Women to the Fore: The Feminist Partnership", coordinated through the [[Jewish Women's Collaborative International Fund]]. The seven partnering organizations in Israel are [[Adva Center]], [[Women's Spirit]], Itach-Maaki: Women Lawyers for Social Justice, Mahut Center, The Israel Women's Network (IWN), Economic Empowerment for Women (EEW) and Achoti (Sister) for Women in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwcif.org/current-grant.html ''Current Grants.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508042928/http://www.jwcif.org/current-grant.html |date=8 May 2014 }} Jewish Women's Collaborative International Fund.

===Arab women in Israel===

Arab-Israeli women actively participate in government and public life. [[Hussniya Jabara]] was the first Israeli-Arab woman to serve in the Knesset.

&lt;/ref&gt; Israel also grants a [[common-law marriage]] status for same-sex domestic partners. The [[sodomy law]] inherited from the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] was repealed in 1988, though there was an explicit instruction issued in 1953 by the [[Attorney General of Israel]] ordering the police to refrain from enforcing this law, so long as no other offenses were involved. A national gay rights law bans some [[anti-gay discrimination]], including in employment; some exemptions are made for religious organizations. In the past, [[military service of homosexuals]] was subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions were lifted in 1993, allowing homosexuals to serve [[Coming out|openly]] in all units of the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actwin.com/eatonohio/gay/world.htm |title=Homosexual rights around the world |work=Gay Rights Info |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210062004/http://www.actwin.com/eatonohio/gay/world.htm |archivedate=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Ministry of Health issued a directive stating that sex-reassignment surgery was included among subsidized health services provided to citizens. Despite this, in May ''Haaretz'' reported that a health maintenance organization refused to pay for two sex-change surgeries, resulting in significant expenses by the patients. A national LGBTI task force found that 80 percent of transgender persons, 50 percent of lesbians and 20 percent of gay men were discriminated against when seeking employment.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

==Ethnic minorities, anti-discrimination and immigration laws==
{{See also|Racism in Israel|Minority rights|Human rights in the Middle East|Immigration law|List of countries by discrimination and violence against minorities|Category:Anti-discrimination law in Israel}}

Israel is committed to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] treaties in regard to social and cultural rights for minorities.

Ethnic and religious minorities have full voting rights in Israel and are entitled to government benefits under various laws. Israel's [[Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, 1988|Employment Law (1988)]] prohibits discrimination – in hiring, working conditions, promotion, professional training or studies, discharge or severance pay, and benefits and payments provided for employees in connection with their retirement from employment – due to race, religion, nationality, and land of origin, among other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/gems/eeo/law/israel/el.htm |title=Gender and employment [Areas of work&amp;#93; |publisher=Ilo.org |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427190455/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/gems/eeo/law/israel/el.htm |archivedate=27 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights group B'Tselem has claimed that [[Demographic history of Jerusalem|Arabs in Jerusalem]] are denied residency rights, leading to a housing shortage in the Arab areas of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/5937/format/html/displaystory.html

[[Human Rights Watch]] has charged that cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents' military service discriminate against Arab children: "The cuts will also affect the children of Jewish ultra-orthodox parents who do not serve in the military, but they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinian Arab children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/06/07/isrlpa4026.htm Israel: Cuts in Child Allowance Discriminate Against Palestinian Arab], [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2004 US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done "little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens."&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm |title=Israel and the occupied territories |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |work=2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |publisher=US Department of State |date=28 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of subsequent years also identified discrimination against Arab citizens as a problem area for Israel, but did not repeat the assertion that Israel had done little to reduce discrimination.&lt;ref name="USDS2005" /&gt;

The 2004 US State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"/&gt; notes that:
*The [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF) controls 12.5 percent of public land but its statutes prohibit the sale or lease of land to non-Jews. In October, civil rights groups petitioned the High Court of Justice claiming that a bid announcement by the Israel Land Administration (ILA) involving JNF land was discriminatory in that it banned Arabs from bidding. In January 2005, the attorney general ruled that "the government cannot discriminate against Israeli Arabs in marketing and allocating lands it manages," including those of the JNF.&lt;ref name="USDS2005"/&gt;
*Israeli-Arab advocacy groups claim that the government is more restrictive in issuing building permits for Arab communities and challenge the policy of demolishing illegal buildings in the Arab sector, limiting the community's growth.
*"In June, the Supreme Court ruled that omitting Arab towns from specific government social and economic plans is discriminatory. This judgment builds on previous assessments of disadvantages suffered by Arab Israelis."
*The 1996 Master Plan for the Northern Areas of Israel was challenged as discriminatory. Its priorities included "increasing the Galilee's Jewish population and blocking the territorial contiguity of Arab towns."
*Exempt from mandatory [[military service]], most Israeli Arabs thus had less access than other citizens to social and economic benefits for which military service was a prerequisite or an advantage, such as housing, new-household [[subsidy|subsidies]], and employment, especially government or security-related industrial employment. The Ivri Committee on National Service has issued official recommendations to the Government that Israel Arabs be afforded an opportunity to perform national service.
*"According to a 2003 [[University of Haifa|Haifa University]] study, a tendency existed to impose heavier prison terms to Arab citizens than to Jewish citizens. Human rights advocates claimed that Arab citizens were more likely to be convicted of murder and to have been denied bail."
*The [[Or Commission]] report on the police killing of Israeli-Arab demonstrators found "primarily neglectful and discriminatory" government management of the Arab sector, with unfair allocation or resources resulting in "serious distress" by the community. Evidence of distress included poverty, unemployment, land shortage, educational problems, and defective infrastructure.

The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel wrote: "[T]he government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas, including... institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens."&lt;ref name = "USDS2005" /&gt;

In a report submitted to the United Nations, [[Bedouin]] claimed that they face discrimination and are not treated as equal citizens in Israel and that Bedouin towns are not provided the same level of services or land of Jewish towns of the same size, and they are not given fair access to water. The city of [[Be'er Sheva]] refused to recognize a Bedouin holy site, despite a High Court recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/734096.html Bedouin ask UN to help fight systemic discrimination in Israel].

*"According to a 2005 study at Hebrew University, three times more money was invested in education of Jewish children as in Arab children."

In September 2010, the Israeli government endorsed an amendment to the country's citizenship laws. The draft law obliges that any person applying for an Israeli citizenship to pledge an [[oath of allegiance]] to "Israel as a [[Jewish and democratic state]]". The amendment has been strongly criticized by Israeli Arabs as well as by Israeli left-wing movements including [[Kadima]] opposition party chief [[Tzipi Livni]]. Israeli educational psychologist Prof. Gavriel Solomon said that the loyalty oath resembles [[Nuremberg Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-academic-loyalty-oath-resembles-racist-laws-of-1935-1.318275|title=Israeli academic: Loyalty oath resembles racist laws of 1935|date=10 October 2010|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the amendment state that non-Jews who become citizens need to fully appreciate that the "State of Israel is the national expression of the self-determination of the Jewish people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=190897|title=Identifying with Israel’s national character|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel prohibits its citizens from visiting enemy nations without permission, a travel restriction which, in 2015, included Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. The [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah Legal Center]] claims this disproportionately discriminates against Arab-Israeli citizens, and that authorities did not detain Jewish Israelis upon return from trips to unauthorized countries as they did with Arab Israelis. The Israel Airports Authority has also been criticised for racial profiling of Arab citizens.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;  The [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah Legal Center]] maintains a list of more than 50 laws it claims discriminate against Arab citizens. In 2015, there was racial profiling of Arab citizens by security services and other citizens, as well as revenge attacks against Arabs.&lt;ref name = "USDS2016" /&gt;

Since 2003, an estimated 70,000 [[Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel|illegal immigrants]] from various African countries have crossed into Israel.&lt;ref name="ARDC"&gt;African Refugee Development Center. Accessed: 11.11.11, [http://www.ardc-israel.org/en/about/refugees/ African Refugee Development Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206094843/http://www.ardc-israel.org/en/about/refugees/ |date=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 600 [[Sudanese refugees in Israel|refugees]] from the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]] have been granted temporary resident status to be renewed every year, though not official refugee status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.org.il/pdf/refugees0209en.pdf |title=ACRI.org.il |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2,000 refugees from the conflict between [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]] have been granted temporary resident status on humanitarian grounds, though Israel prefers not to recognize them as refugees.

In a 2012 news story, ''Reuters'' reported, "Israel may jail illegal immigrants for up to three years under a law put into effect on Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said, a measure aimed at stemming the flow of Africans entering Israel across the porous desert border with Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFBRE8520DX20120603 |title=Israel to jail illegal migrants for up to 3 years |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior Minister [[Eli Yishai]] said, "Why should we provide them with jobs? I'm sick of the bleeding hearts, including politicians. Jobs would settle them here, they'll make babies, and that offer will only result in hundreds of thousands more coming over here."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/20/israel-netanyahu-african-immigrants-jewish Israel PM: illegal African immigrants threaten identity of Jewish state]". ''The Guardian.'' 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liel Leibovitz]] in ''Tablet Magazine'' wrote: "If Israel honored the 1951 Refugee Convention it itself signed, it would not deny asylum to the 19,000 African refugees, mostly from Sudan and Congo, fleeing genocide and persecution, making the Jewish state the least inclined country in the Western world to aid those fleeing genocide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/41820/strangers-in-a-strange-land Strangers in a Strange Land] Tablet Magazine, 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 2014 Prevention of Infiltration Law, all irregular border-crossers are defined as "infiltrators" and may be detained at Saharonim Prison for three months "for the purpose of identification" and then 12 months at the remote Holhot facility. The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants reported that authorities have returned more than half of Holot detainees to Saharonim for up to several months for various rule infractions. In a series of rulings, the Supreme Court rejected that migrants could be held indefinitely and ordered the release of 1,178 Eritrean and Sudanese migrants held for more than a year without charges. The government barred these asylum-seekers from Tel Aviv or Eilat, where they would have had supportive communities and access to social services.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

According to the 2015 US Department of State's Country Report on Human Rights Practices, since 2011 the environment for refugees in Israel has deteriorated "due to adoption of policies and legislation aimed at deterring future asylum seekers by making life difficult for those already in the country. These actions further curtailed the rights of the population and encouraged the departure of those already in the country." The government would make it difficult to apply for refugee status while held in detention for a year, and once released would require applicants to provide justification for not applying earlier. Asylum seekers are called "infiltrators" by the government and media, who associate them with increases in crime, disease, and vagrancy.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

Israel's Pupils' Rights Law of 2000 prohibits discrimination of students for sectarian reasons in admission to or expulsion from an educational institution, in establishment of separate educational curricula or holding of separate classes in the same educational institution, and in rights and obligations of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/Zchuyot/ChukimVeamanot/Chukim/PupilsRightsLaw |title=חוק זכויות התלמיד באנגלית – Pupils’ Rights Law |publisher=Cms.education.gov.il |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This law has been enforced by the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Supreme Court of Israel]], prompting protests from Orthodox families who objected to sending their children to integrated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127911465|title=Israeli Ultra-Orthodox Jews Protest School Ruling|date=17 June 2010|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2009 study published in [[Megamot]] by Sorel Cahan of [[Hebrew University]]'s School of Education demonstrated that the Israeli Education Ministry's budget for special assistance to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds severely discriminated against Arabs. It also showed that the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This was the result of the allocation method used – assistance funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems, according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the largest proportion of such students in the Arab system, they received less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said that it had already decided to discontinue this allotment method in favor of a uniform index method, without first dividing the funds between the school systems.&lt;ref name="Haaretz 2009"&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1106955.html Haaretz.

Ministry data on what percentage of high school students pass their matriculation exams, broken down by town, showed that most Arab towns were the lowest ranked – an exception was Arab [[Fureidis]] which had the third-highest pass rate (75.86 percent) in Israel.&lt;ref name="Haaretz 2009"/&gt;

==Migrant workers==
{{See also|Migrant worker}}
In 2010, the US Department of State issued a report which stated that  "the Government of Israel does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do so." It noted that Israel continued law enforcement actions against human trafficking, and established a shelter for labor traffic victims. However, the government did not identify the victims, and law enforcement and protection efforts diminished since transferring anti-trafficking duties from Immigration police to the Ministry of Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/142983.pdf |format=PDF |title=Gabon |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 US Department of State report stated that some foreign workers experienced conditions of forced labour, including "the unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on freedom of movement, limited ability to change or otherwise choose employers, nonpayment of wages, exceedingly long working hours, threats, sexual assault, and physical intimidation." The most vulnerable were foreign agricultural workers, construction workers, and nursing care workers (particularly women).&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

==People with disabilities==
{{See also|Disability|Accessibility|Inclusion (disability rights)|Developmental disability|Disability and poverty}}
Israel is committed to the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] international treaty in regard to people with disabilities rights.

Israel enacted an Equal Rights for People with Disabilities Law in 1998.  Nevertheless, the US Department of State report on Israel stated that "de facto discrimination against persons with disabilities" exists in Israel.&lt;ref name = "USDS2005" /&gt; In 2014, there were approximately 1.6 million people with disabilities residing in Israel. Approximately 878,000 were between the ages of 20 to 64 and 488,000 were over the age of 64. A survey by the Dialog Institute showed that a significant portion of the Israeli population has difficulty accepting people with disabilities as neighbors, co-workers or classmates. 40% of those surveyed said they would "be bothered" if their children were in school with a disabled child, and almost a third of respondents said they would "be bothered" living in the same neighborhood as disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Survey-40-percent-of-Israeli-public-would-not-want-their-children-to-study-with-disabled-child-386737 Survey 40 percent of Israeli public would not want their children to study with disabled child] The Jerusalem Post, 1 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel more than 144,000 people with disabilities rely solely on government allowances as their only means of support. According to [[Arie Zudkevitch]] and fellow members of the [[Israeli Organization of the Disabled]]: "The amount of money that we get cannot fulfill even the basic needs of people without special needs." In Tel Aviv, more than 10,000 people marched in solidarity with the disabled, demanding increased compensation and recognition from the Israeli Government.&lt;ref name=disab&gt;{{cite web

Beginning in 2014, employers of more than 100 persons were required to have 3 percent of their workforce be persons with disabilities, though enforcement of this quota was limited. Disabled persons have lower rates of employment, and often work part-time for low wages. The advocacy organization Bizchut stated that Arab citizens with disabilities were employed at half the rate of Jews with disabilities, and that shortages of funding for Arab municipalities adversely affected the disabled of these communities.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

Israel has been criticized in the 1990s for its policies and its weak enforcement of laws on [[human trafficking]]. Women from the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]] were brought into the country by criminal elements for [[forced labor]] in the [[sex industry]]. In 1998, the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' estimated that pimps engaging in this activity derived on average US$50,000–100,000 per prostitute, resulting in a countrywide industry of nearly $450,000,000 annually.&lt;ref name=exploitBook&gt;''Israel Trafficking, Factbook on Global Sexual Exploitation.

In October 2006, the [[Knesset]] passed a new law outlawing human trade with sentences for human trade offenses of up to 16 years, and 20 years when the victim is a minor. The law also addresses forced labor, [[slavery]], [[organ theft]], and prostitution.

The 2005 annual report of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) found that "accelerated [[privatization]]" is damaging human rights. According to the report, "State economic policy, including cutting stipends, reducing housing assistance, and constantly declining state participation in health-care and education costs, are forcing more elderly, children and whole families into poverty and despair. The increasing damage to citizens' rights to earn a dignified living – both due to low wages and the lack of enforcement of labor laws – is particularly prominent."&lt;ref name=acri /&gt;

Abdallah Abu Rahmah was arrested by the Israeli army in 2009 for participating in demonstrations which take place weekly in the West Bank. On 25 August 2010, the Israeli military court found Abu Rahmah guilty of two anti-free speech articles in military legislation: "incitement, and organizing and participating in illegal demonstrations." [[European Union]] High Representative [[Catherine Ashton]] condemned the verdict, stating, "The EU considers Abdallah Abu Rahmah to be a human rights defender committed to non-violent protest against the route of the Israeli separation barrier through his West Bank village of Bil'in."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-dana/criminalizing-peaceful-pr_b_693657.html "Criminalizing Peaceful Protest: Israel Jails Another Palestinian Gandhi"] by Joseph Dana, Writer, Academic in Jewish History. 25 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli treatment of non-Israelis in territories occupied by Israel, for the past forty years, has been compared to South Africa's treatment of non-whites during the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]] – by various parties including the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3260201,00.html |title=South African union joins boycott of Israel |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Carter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service |first=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=799476&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1 |title=Jimmy Carter: Israel's 'apartheid' policies worse than South Africa's |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2 April 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], and Israel Attorney-General [[Michael Ben-Yair]].&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=136433 "Passionately desiring to keep the occupied territories, we developed two judicial systems: one – progressive, liberal – in Israel; and the other – cruel, injurious – in the occupied territories. In effect, we established an apartheid regime in the occupied territories"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, South Africa's Human Sciences Research Council released a 300-page study that concluded that Israel practiced colonialism and apartheid in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Human Sciences Research Council |url=http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Media_Release-378.phtml |title=SA academic study finds that Israel is practicing apartheid and colonialism in the Occupied Palestinian Territories |publisher=Hsrc.ac.za |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726165646/http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Media_Release-378.phtml |archive-date=26 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} The report: https://web.archive.org/web/20090622083122/http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Document-3227.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The term apartheid in the context of the West Bank is used in relation to certain Israeli policies in force in the area. These include segregated roads and settlements, and [[Palestinian freedom of movement|restrictions placed on movements of Palestinians]] but not Israelis – in the form of checkpoints and segmentation of the West Bank. The comparison also extends to access to natural resources such as water and access to the judicial system.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/11/04apartheid |title=Israel: an apartheid state? – Le Monde diplomatique – English edition |publisher=Mondediplo.com |date=10 November 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASSESSMENT OF RESTRICTIONS ON PALESTINIAN WATER SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, Sector Note April 2009, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReport18Apr2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/2674/pid/897 |title=Palestinian Realities |publisher=Thejerusalemfund.org |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716065041/http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/2674/pid/897 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who criticize the analogy argue that Israeli policies have little or no comparison to apartheid South Africa, and that the motivation and historical context of Israel's policies are different. It is argued that Israel itself is a democratic and pluralist state, while the West Bank and Gaza are not part of sovereign Israel and cannot be compared to the internal policies of apartheid South Africa.

===Israeli West Bank barrier===

[[File:West Bank Fence South Hebron.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Israeli West Bank barrier]]

The center of much controversy, the Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier, consisting mainly of fences and trenches, built by the Israeli Government. It is located partly within the West Bank, and partly along the border between the West Bank and Israel proper. The barrier's stated purpose is "to keep the terrorists out and thereby save the lives of Israel's citizens, Jews and Arabs alike."&lt;ref name=fence1&gt;{{cite web

In 2003, the barrier was condemned by a [[UN Resolution]] "overwhelmingly" passed by [[UN General Assembly]] which also called for all construction to halt.&lt;ref name=fence2&gt;{{cite news

Echoing this sentiment, [[Amnesty International]] issued a statement in 2005, saying: "Israel built a fence/wall through the West Bank, confining Palestinians in isolated enclaves cut off from their land and essential services in nearby towns and villages."&lt;ref name=aiIDF&gt;{{cite web

A UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier "replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and Jerusalem governorates where the Barrier is under construction." The report notes that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also notes that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/ochaHU0805_En.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181017/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/ochaHU0805_En.pdf|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Amnesty International accused the IDF of war crimes, including "unlawful killings; extensive and wanton of destruction of property; obstruction of medical assistance and targeting of medical personnel; torture; and the use of Palestinians as human shields." They accuse the Israeli army of "reckless shooting" and "excessive use of force" against militants that endangers the lives of civilians. They claim Israeli soldiers are rarely punished for human rights violations, and investigations of crimes are not carried out.&lt;ref name=aiIDF /&gt;
In 2014, Amnesty released a report with similar findings, criticizing Israel for excessive and reckless use of force for which Israeli soldiers are not held accountable. Amnesty said characteristics of the violence suggested it was employed as a matter of policy, and that there was evidence some killings amounted to war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Gal Luft{{who|date=March 2018}}, Palestinian militants utilize a tactic of blending among civilian populations which exacerbates civilian casualties in Israeli attacks. According to Luft, biased media coverage of [[Operation Defensive Shield]] encouraged militants to use civilians and refugees as "human shields" because they were not held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to the 2010 US State Department Human Rights Report, in 2010, the Military Investigative Police launched 147 investigations with regard to cases of death, violence, and property damage against residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In these cases the military advocate general filed 10 indictments against 12 soldiers suspected of committing criminal offenses against Palestinians. There were three convictions of four soldiers, no acquittals, closure of three cases by the military advocate general, and seven cases pending as of year's end.&lt;ref name="USDS2010"/&gt;

====Accusations of using human shields====
{{Main|Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority#Exposure of civilian targets to military action|Hamas#Children and women as human shields}}

In 2013, a report by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child concluded that Israeli forces had used Palestinian children as [[human shield]]s in 14 cases between 2010 and 2013. According to the report, almost everyone who had used children as human shields had remained unpunished.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/us-palestinian-israel-children-idUSBRE95J0FR20130620|title=Palestinian children tortured, used as shields by Israel: U.N.|work=Reuters|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDF acknowledged using the "Neighbor Procedure" or the "Early Warning Procedure", in which the IDF would encourage a Palestinian acquaintance of a wanted man to try and convince them to surrender. This practice was criticized by some as using human shields, an allegation the IDF denied, saying that it never forced people into carrying out the "Neighbor Procedure"; and that Palestinians volunteered to prevent excess loss of life.

The Israeli group [[B'Tselem]] also made the comparison, saying that "for a long period of time following the outbreak of the second intifada Operation Defensive Shield, in April 2002, the IDF systematically used Palestinian civilians as human shields, forcing them to carry out military actions which threatened their lives".&lt;ref name="B'Tselem"&gt;[[B'Tselem]], "[http://www.btselem.org/english/Human_Shields/20060720_Human_Shields_in_Beit_Hanun.asp 20 July 2006: Israeli Soldiers use civilians as Human Shields in Beit Hanun]", July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Neighbor Procedure was outlawed by the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Supreme Court of Israel]] in 2005 but some groups say the IDF continues to use it, although they say the number of instances has dropped sharply.&lt;ref name="B'Tselem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/11/world/main2674604.shtml Israel Probes "Human Shield" Allegations]", [[CBS News]], 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, human rights activists from [[Rabbis for Human Rights]] reported that Israeli soldiers used 13-year-old Muhammed Badwan as a human shield during a demonstration in the West Bank village of Biddu,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Cynthia. [http://www.talktalk.co.uk/news/world/reuters/2004/04/22/activistssayisraelheldboyashumanshield.html Activists say Israel held boy as human shield] Reuters, 22 April 2004.

A picture of Badwan tied to the jeep was published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. On 1 July 2009, Amnesty International stated that Israeli troops forced Palestinians to stay in one room of their home while turning the rest of the house into a base and sniper position, "effectively using the families, both adults and children, as human shields and putting them at risk," the group said. "Intentionally using civilians to shield a military objective, often referred to as using 'human shields' is a war crime," Amnesty said.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 1 July 2009, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jc0DHbDsRG83m4stW9JdpHz3hxSw Amnesty accuses Israel of using human shields in Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; Such actions are condemned by human rights groups as violations of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name=bsele&gt;{{cite web

====Targeted killing====
{{See also|Targeted Killing in International Law|Targeted killings by Israel Defense Forces|List of Israeli assassinations}}
Israel has a policy of [[targeted killing]]s against those it considers proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of terrorism in the very near future or to be linked with several acts of terrorism. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Israel issued its judgment in ''The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v. The Government of Israel''. The case addressed the issue of whether the state acts illegally in its policy of targeted killings. The court considered that the legal context is a conflict "of an international character (international armed conflict). Therefore, the law that applies to the armed conflict between Israel and the terrorist organizations is the international law of armed conflicts." The court decided that "members of the terrorist organizations are not combatants [...] They do not fulfill the conditions for combatants under international law" and that "they do not comply with the international laws of war." They concluded that "members of terrorist organizations have the status of civilians" but that "the protection accorded by international law to civilians does not apply at the time during which civilians take direct part in hostilities." They ruled that they could not determine whether targeted killings are always legal or always illegal, but the legality must be established on a case by case basis. Their ruling stated "it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is prohibited according to customary international law, just as it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is permissible according to customary international law. The law of targeted killing is determined in the customary international law, and the legality of each individual such act must be determined in light of it." The judgment included guidelines for permissible and impermissible actions involving targeted killings and provided the conditions for investigating the criminality of some of the actions.&lt;ref name="HCJ76902-sum"&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/english/Legal_Documents/HCJ_769_02_20061214_Targeted_killing_Ruling_Summary_Eng.doc HCJ 769/02 ''The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Israeli army maintains that it pursues such military operations to prevent imminent attacks when it has no discernible means of making an arrest or foiling such attacks by other methods. Some commentators{{Who|date=October 2009}} claim that this practice is in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ([[s:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 28|Part 3, Article 1, Section 28]]) which reads: "The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations."

For example, in July 2002 the Israeli Defense Forces carried out an air strike targeting [[Salah Shahade]], the commander of [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], the military wing of [[Hamas]], in a densely populated residential area of Gaza City.  The night-time bombing resulted in the deaths of 15 persons, nine of whom were children, and the injury of 150 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 1 March 2009, ''[[The Independent]]'' obtained an account which, for the first time, details service in one of the Israeli military's assassination squads. A former IDF soldier of an assassination squad described his role in a botched ambush that killed two Palestinian bystanders and two militants. According to the interviewer "the source cannot be identified by name, not least because by finally deciding to talk about what happened, he could theoretically be charged abroad for his direct role in an assassination of the sort most Western countries regard as a grave breach of international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-death-squads-a-soldiers-story-1634774.html |title=The Independent.

====Blockades====
{{See also|Israeli disengagement from Gaza|International aid to Palestinians}}
According to Amnesty International: "Military checkpoints and blockades around Palestinian towns and villages hindered or prevented access to work, education and medical facilities and other crucial services. Restrictions on the movement of Palestinians remained the key cause of high rates of unemployment and poverty. More than half of the Palestinian population lived below the poverty line, with increasing numbers suffering from malnutrition and other health problems."&lt;ref name=aiIDF /&gt;

Israel maintains that the majority of checkpoints and [[blockade]]s were erected following the [[Second Intifada|Al-Aqsa Intifada]] (October 2000) as security measures against terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2009 Gaza War===
{{See also|Gaza War (2008–09)|United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict}}

The UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict published a 575-page report on 15 September 2009, stating it had found that war crimes were committed by both sides involved in the Gaza War.&lt;ref name=ungazareport&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32057&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1 UN mission finds evidence of war crimes by both sides in Gaza conflict] United Nations News Centre, 15 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report condemns [[Israel|Israel's]] actions during the conflict for "the application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations". It came to the conclusion "that there was strong evidence to establish that numerous serious violations of international law, both humanitarian law and human rights law, were committed by Israel during the military operations in Gaza".&lt;ref name=ungazareport/&gt; The report claims that Israel made disproportionate or excessive use of [[white phosphorus]]. Israel has also come under fire from other fact-finding missions over the use of white phosphorus – an incendiary weapon which is deemed illegal to use against civilians (forbidden by the [[Geneva Conventions]]) or in civilian areas by [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] – and [[depleted uranium]] during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Melman|first=Yossi|title=UN to probe claim Israel used depleted uranium bombs in Gaza|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/un-to-probe-claim-israel-used-depleted-uranium-bombs-in-gaza-1.268599|work=22 Jan 2009 Edition|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Independent Fact Finding Committee on Gaza: No Safe Place |url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/picture_gallery/reportfullFINAL.pdf |publisher=League of Arab States |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013190358/http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/picture_gallery/reportfullFINAL.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN report also condemned the use of indiscriminate rocket attacks by [[Hamas|Palestinian militants]] which targeted known civilian areas within Israel, stating that "[t]here's no question that the firing of [[rocket]]s and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] [by armed groups from Gaza] was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians and damage to civilian structures. The mission found that these actions also amount to serious war crimes and also possibly crimes against humanity".&lt;ref name=ungazareport/&gt;

According to the 2010 US Department of State's Human Rights Report, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Military Advocate General Mandelblit investigated all allegations relating to the 2008–09 Operation Cast Lead military incursion into the Gaza Strip, examining over 150 incidents, including those contained in the UN Human Rights Council's 2009 Goldstone report. In January and July, Mandelblit released updates on the majority of investigations, which included details of indictments against several soldiers for manslaughter, improper use of civilians in wartime, and misconduct. {{as of|2010|July|post=,}} the military advocate general launched 47 military police criminal investigations into IDF conduct during Operation Cast Lead and completed a significant number of them. On 1&amp;nbsp;August, the IDF issued a new order appointing humanitarian affairs officers to each battalion to provide further protections for civilian populations during wartime planning and combat operations.&lt;ref name="USDS2010"/&gt;

[[Ben-Dror Yemini]] wrote in his book ''The Industry of Lies'' that the Arab–Israeli conflict has become the center of a major deception. According to Yemini, lies about Israel in media and academia have been presented as truths; deeply rooted in the global consciousness, this has caused Israel to be seen as a monster, similar to perceptions of Jews in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/571/620.html|title=- / -    nrg - ...The trap of|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azMrwwQdXT8|title=Ben-Dror Yemini - "The Industry of Lies", an interview|date=15 September 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freedom House]] has claimed the United Nations has a history of negative focus on Israel that is disproportional in respect to other members, including the actions and statements of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) and its predecessor, the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/06/Elections-for-UN-Human-Rights-Council-Underscore-the-Need-for-Reform|title=Elections for U.N. Human Rights Council Underscore the Need for Reform|author=Brett Schaefer|publisher=heritage.org|quote=In addition, the council has held 10 special sessions since 2006 that focused on country situations, and a majority of the sessions focused on condemning Israel. The most recent of these special sessions was held in 2009—after the U.S. became a member—to discuss the U.N. Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (the Goldstone Report), which has been criticized as "deeply flawed" and biased against Israel by the Obama Administration. The council adopted the Goldstone Report in a resolution that condemned Israel in detail but failed to mention Hamas's indiscriminate firing of rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian settlements, even though the Goldstone Report stated that they "constitute war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity."|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=6 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808160649/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/06/Elections-for-UN-Human-Rights-Council-Underscore-the-Need-for-Reform|archivedate=8 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hillel Neuer]] of [[UN Watch]] has described the actions of the UN Commission on Human Rights as a "campaign to demonize Israel".&lt;ref name="jcpaNeuer"/&gt; Neuer has stated that an example of bias is that in 2005, the Commission adopted four resolutions against Israel, equaling the combined total of resolutions against all other states in the world. [[Belarus]], Cuba, [[Myanmar]], and [[North Korea]] were the subject of one resolution each.&lt;ref name="jcpaNeuer"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Neuer | first = Hillel C. |date=January 2006 | title = The Struggle against Anti-Israel Bias at the UN Commission on Human Rights | journal = Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism | volume = | issue = 40 | pages = | doi = | id = | url = http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-040-neuer.htm | accessdate = 2006-07-30 | quotes = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, according to UN Watch, in 2004–2005, the [[UN General Assembly]] passed nineteen resolutions concerning Israel, while not passing any resolution concerning [[Sudan]], which at the time was facing [[War in Darfur|a genocide]] in the [[Darfur]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b.1359197/k.6748/UN_Israel__AntiSemitism.htm |title=UN, Israel &amp; Anti-Semitism |accessdate=2006-08-02 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=UN Watch |pages= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808193140/http://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b.1359197/k.6748/UN_Israel__AntiSemitism.htm |archivedate=8 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] voted to replace UNCHR with the UN Human Rights Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4810538.stm|publisher=BBC|date=15 March 2006|title=UN creates new human rights body | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Richard Goldstone]] publicly regretted appointing the UN Human Rights Council to investigate for the [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|Goldstone Report]], saying that their "history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted."&lt;ref name="Goldstone"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html | title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes | publisher=The Washington Post | date=1 April 2011 | accessdate=16 May 2011 | author=[[Richard Goldstone]] | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, [[Kofi Annan]], former UN Secretary-General, accused the members of the Human Rights Council at that time of "double standard", and of holding Israel to a standard of behaviour that they are unwilling to apply to other states, to Israel's adversaries, or to themselves. He said that the repeated resolutions and conferences of the General Assembly that condemn Israel's behaviour just strengthen the belief in Israel, and among many of its supporters, that the UN is too one-sided.&lt;ref name="unwatch.org"/&gt;

In April 2012, the UN released an official statement in which Israel was listed as a country that is restricting the activities of human rights organisations. Israel, the only democratic country to be named on the list, was included because of a bill approved by the Ministerial Committee on Legislation that would restrict foreign governmental funding of Israeli non-profit groups. The bill was frozen by the Prime Minister and never reached the Knesset, but the statement said: "In Israel, the recently adopted Foreign Funding Law could have a major impact on human rights organizations".&lt;ref name=Hz&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=Israel joins UN list of states limiting human rights organizations|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-joins-un-list-of-states-limiting-human-rights-organizations-1.427184|accessdate=2012-04-30|newspaper=Haaretz|date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit in Jerusalem in 2013, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] confirmed that there was a biased attitude towards the Israeli people and Israeli government, stressing that it was "an unfortunate situation". He added that Israel has been criticized and sometimes discriminated against because of the [[Mideast conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4418776,00.html|title=UN chief admits bias against Israel|work=ynet|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Falk]], who was the UNHRC's special investigator of "Israel's violations of the bases and principles of international law", has been criticised by UN Watch for "pro-Hamas appeasement", anti-Western invective, support for [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11 conspiracy theorists]] and demonization of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/560324B97B8CAC8785257B7400566A86 Written statement* submitted by United Nations Watch, a non-governmental organization in special consultative status] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426014540/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/560324B97B8CAC8785257B7400566A86 |date=26 April 2015 }}, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2014/09/02/ex-un-investigator-richard-falk-lashes-out-at-un-watch-for/ Ex-UN investigator Richard Falk lashes out at UN Watch for, UN Watch]/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Prosor]], Israel's representative to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the [[State of Palestine|Question of Palestine]], November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice when it comes to the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of [[Radical Islam]], and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never about the establishment of a [[State of Palestine|Palestinian state]] but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1--Os_apR0|title=Amb.

[[Amnesty International]] (AI) has been accused by the [[American Jewish Congress]] and [[NGO Monitor]] of having a double standard with its assessment of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3604542,00.html|title=Amnesty’s obsession with Israel|work=ynet|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/getting_human_rights_wrong|title=NGO Monitor resources|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], an American legal scholar and columnist for the ''Huffington Post'', has attacked Amnesty International's perceived bias against Israel, claiming that AI absolves Palestinian men of responsibility for domestic violence and places the blame on Israel instead&lt;ref name="Dersh"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/the-newest-abuse-excuse-f_b_7584.html| title = The Newest Abuse Excuse for Violence Against Women| accessdate = 2006-07-27| last = Dershowitz| first = Alan| authorlink = Alan Dershowitz| date =19 September 2005| work =| publisher = The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it illegitimately characterises legal acts of Israeli self-defence as war-crimes.&lt;ref name="Dersh2"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/amnesty-internationals-bi_b_28257.html| title = Amnesty International's Biased Definition of War Crimes: Whatever Israel Does to Defend Its Citizens| accessdate = 2012-01-26| last = Dershowitz| first = Alan| authorlink = Alan Dershowitz| date =29 August 2006| work =| publisher = The Huffington Post| location = New York, NY, US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz has joined NGO Monitor's calls for an independent evaluation of anti-Israeli bias within the organisation.&lt;ref name="Dersh3"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=186776

In 2004, [[NGO Monitor]], a pro-Israel organization, released a study comparing Amnesty International's response to the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|twenty years of ethnic, religious and racial violence in Sudan]] – in which (at that time) 2,000,000 people were killed and 4,000,000 people displaced – to their treatment of Israel. When NGO Monitor focused on 2001, they found that Amnesty International issued seven reports on Sudan, as opposed to 39 reports on Israel.&lt;ref name="NGOM2004"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2003, they claimed the imbalance in issued reports to be 52 reports on Sudan and 192 reports on Israel, which they call "lack of balance and objectivity and apparent political bias [which] is entirely inconsistent with AI's official stated mission." They further called attention to the difference in both scale and intensity: "While ignoring the large-scale and systematic bombing and destruction of Sudanese villages, AI issued numerous condemnations of the razing of Palestinian houses, most of which were used as sniper nests or belonged to terrorists. Although failing to decry the slaughter of thousands of civilians by Sudanese government and allied troops, AI managed to criticize Israel's 'assassinations' of active terrorist leaders."&lt;ref name = "NGOM2004" /&gt;

==Government attitude toward NGOs and activists==

According to the US State Department's 2015 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, Israeli officials were generally cooperative with the United Nations and human rights groups and invited the testimony of human rights NGOs at Knesset hearings. These groups can directly petition the Israeli Supreme Court on government policies and individual cases.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

Israeli and Palestinian NGOs critical of the government's human rights policies claim the government sought to pressure them for receiving foreign funding.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt; These investigations into funding have been labeled by critics as "McCarthyist".&lt;ref name="IndependentMcCarthyism"/&gt; In July 2015, in a series of private meetings, Deputy Foreign Minister [[Tzipi Hotovely]] accused European governments of funding Israeli and Palestinian NGOs which sought to "delegitimize Israel under the guise of human rights", naming [[B'Tselem]], [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], and the [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah Legal Center]]. Hotovely threatened that her government would restrict or tax foreign funding of Israeli NGOs if this continued.

The participation of [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel|ACRI]] and B'Tselem in the national service volunteer program was terminated by the civil service in 2015, following government allegations that they engaged in defamation and incitement against Israeli soldiers.

The Ministry of the Interior has refused to renew work permits as well as blocking entry to Israel by foreigners suspected of supporting the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign against Israel, a policy which applies also to activists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-expels-human-rights-watch-omar-shakir-boycott-activist-a8342761.html Israel expels Human Rights Watch representative accused of supporting boycott], 9 May 2018, Independent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-bars-entry-of-dublin-s-mayor-over-bds-ties-1.5990796 Israel Wanted to Bar Entry to Dublin's Lord Mayor Over BDS Ties – but Got His Name Wrong], Haaretz, 10 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-two-leading-u-s-human-rights-activists-deported-from-israel-1.6052515 Two Leading U.S. Human Rights Activists Refused Entry to Israel, One for BDS Ties], Haaretz, 3 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The government continues a partial suspension of its coordination with [[UNESCO]] (the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), in effect since 2013. In 2015, Israel blocked the UNHRC's [[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]] (investigator) from gaining access to the West Bank.&lt;ref name="USDS2016"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Humani generis unitas''''' (Latin; English translation: '''On the Unity of the Human Race''') was a draft for an [[encyclical]] planned by [[Pope Pius XI]] before his death on February 10, 1939. The draft text condemned [[antisemitism]], [[racism]] and the [[persecution of Jews]]. Because it was never issued, it is sometimes referred to as "The Hidden Encyclical" or "The Lost Encyclical." ''Humani generis unitas'' was written by three Jesuits under the leadership of [[John LaFarge, Jr.|John LaFarge]]. The draft text remained secret until published in 1995 in France (by Passelecq and Suchecky under the title ''L’Encyclique Cachée de Pie XI'') and in 1997 in English as ''The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI.''

==History==
In June 1938, Pius XI assigned [[United States|American]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[John LaFarge, Jr.|John LaFarge]] to prepare a draft of ''Humani generis unitas''. Jesuit [[Superior-General of the Society of Jesus|Superior-General]] [[Wlodimir Ledóchowski]] assigned two other Jesuits, Gustav Gundlach and Gustave Desbuquois, to assist LaFarge.&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;Richard G. Bailey. August 2001. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_200108/ai_n8969487 The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI]." ''Canadian Journal of History''.&lt;/ref&gt; Working in Paris,&lt;ref name="johnston"/&gt; they produced a draft of approximately 100 pages.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;The Holocaust Chronicle. 2002. "[http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/112.html 1937: Quiet before the Storm]." p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Jesuit translated the draft into Latin and presented it to Ledóchowski.&lt;ref name="coppa"/&gt; The draft was delivered to the Vatican in September 1938.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt;

Some secondary sources, including [[Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant|Cardinal Tisserant]],&lt;ref&gt;Passelecq and Suchecky, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the draft was on Pius XI's desk when he died of a heart attack on February 10, 1939.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Pius XI's successor, [[Pope Pius XII]], did not promulgate the draft as an encyclical. Critics of Pius XII (notably [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] in his controversial work ''[[Hitler's Pope]]'') cited this decision as evidence of his alleged silence toward anti-Semitism and [[The Holocaust]].

[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/13/europe/EU_GEN_Vatican_Secret_Archives.php "Newly opened files helping historians to understand priorities of future wartime pope, Pius XII."] ''Associated Press''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The first 70 paragraphs, probably authored by Gundlach, are a critique of [[modernism (Roman Catholicism)|theological modernism]], unorthodox re-interpretation of [[Sacred Scripture]], [[nationalism]], and [[racism]]; the remaining 108, likely authored by all three Jesuits, contextualized the first part of the text with the social role of Catholic educational institutions and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt;

Although the draft clearly condemned racism and anti-Semitism,  the document is deeply grounded in [[anti-Judaism|anti-''Judaism'']].&lt;ref name="johnston"/&gt; The draft criticizes the majority of post-Messianic Jews for not acknowledging [[Jesus Christ]] as the true [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism ===
''Humani generis unitas'' clearly condemns [[racism in the United States|American racial segregation and racism]] and [[Nazi propaganda|Nazi German anti-Semitism]], though without explicitly naming these countries.  [[Racism]] is a denial of the unity of human society,&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt; a denial of the human [[personality]],&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 113 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; and a denial of the true values of religion &lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 116 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no relation between race and religion,&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 120&lt;/ref&gt; because racism is destructive to any society.&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 123&lt;/ref&gt; Racism is destructive not only for social relations within a society but also for [[international relations]] and relations between different races.&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Judaic context ===
The draft condemns  the persecution of Jews. “These persecutions have been censured by the Holy See on more than one occasion, but especially when they have worn the mantle of Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 131&lt;/ref&gt; But the text hedges with an anti-Judaic theme. “This  unjust and pitiless campaign against the Jews has at least this advantage”, according to the draft, "because  the true nature, the authentic basis of the social separation of the Jews from the rest of humanity … is religious in character. …Essentially, the so-called Jewish question … is a question of religion and, since the coming of Christ, a question of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 133&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclical blames the Jews of the time of Christ for having brought their own Messiah Jesus Christ to death: "The very act by which the Jewish people put to death their Savior and King was, in the strong language of Saint Paul, the salvation of the world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The draft continues by accusing Jews of blind materialism.

* ''Blinded by a vision of material domination and gain, the Israelites lost what they themselves had sought. A few chosen souls, among whom were the disciples and followers of Our Lord, the early Jewish Christians, and, through the centuries, a few members of the Jewish people, were an exception to this general rule. By their acceptance of Christ's teaching and their incorporation into His Church, they shared in the inheritance of His glory, but they remained and still remain an exception. "What Israel was seeking after, that it has not obtained; but the chosen have obtained it, and the rest have been blinded" (Romans 11:7).'' &lt;ref&gt;Saint Paul adds: "But by their offense," that is, through the Jews' rejection of the Messiah, "salvation has come to the Gentiles" (Romans 11:11).''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 136&lt;/ref&gt;  The text argues that
* ''By a mysterious Providence of God, this unhappy people, destroyers of their own nation, whose misguided leaders had called down upon their own heads a Divine malediction, doomed, as it were, to perpetually wander over the face of the earth, were nonetheless never allowed to perish, but have been preserved through the ages into our own time. No natural reason appears to be forthcoming to explain this age-long persistence, this indestructible coherence of the Jewish people.''&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis unitas'', paragraph 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction of Pope Pius XII ==
According to the authors, Pius XII was not aware of the text before the death of his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Father Maher to Father La Farge, March 16, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; He chose not to publish it. However, his first encyclical ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' (''On the Supreme Pontificate'', October 12, 1939), published after the beginning of [[World War II]], has an echo of the previous title in its title: '''On the Unity of Human Society''' and uses many of the arguments of the text, avoiding most of the negative characterization of the Jewish people and rabbinic religion contained in the text of the draft.

''Summi Pontificatus'' sees [[Christianity]] as universalized and opposed to every form of racial hostility and every claim of racial superiority.  There are no real racial differences: the human race forms a unity, because "one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth".

* ''What a wonderful vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in the unity of its origin in God... in the unity of its nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual soul; in the unity of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use to sustain and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural end: God himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means for attaining this end... in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ for all''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pius XII, ''Enc. Summi Pontificatus'', paragraph 3&lt;/ref&gt;

This  divine law of [[solidarity]] and [[charity (virtue)|charity]] assures that all men are truly brethren,  without excluding the rich variety of persons, cultures, and societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Founded in 1967, '''Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción''' (IBA) is a community development corporation whose goal is to make sure the residents of Villa Victoria in [[South End, Boston]] keep long term control over their housing and neighborhood. They offer many programs for community development and organization, such as art, culture, and human services for the neighborhood. They hope to empower the growing [[Latino]] community in Boston's South End, most notably the Villa Victoria section.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m111find.htm|title = Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion|last = Bradley|first = Phil|date = 1967–2004|work = Records|accessdate = 16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== History ==
IBA began in [[South End, Boston]] as a [[grassroots]] movement to fight the Boston Redevelopment Authority's urban renewal plan. In 1968, a year after forming the IBA, they had established their own housing plan given to the Boston Housing Authority and renamed themselves the "Emergency Tenants Council." A year later, they were given the rights to develop on the parcel of land that is now Villa Victoria, and changed their name to "Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción", or "Puerto Rican Tenants in Action".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was considered a large accomplishment in terms of affordable housing, community organizing, and civil rights as they gave birth to a new community of not only Puerto Rican tenants, but [[Latinos]] of all cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iba-etc.org/about.html|title = Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion|date = |accessdate = 16 October 2014|website = Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion|publisher = |last = De Jesus|first = Bienvenido}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The goal of IBA is to empower to the residents of the neighborhood through arts, education, workforce development, and [[affordable housing]] communities that are vibrant and brightly colored to liven up the neighborhood. IBA aims to preserve safe and culturally diverse housing communities so the members are able to reach their full social, economic, or political potential.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to achieve these goals, the group lives by a few different rules. They look for community involvement and direct representation, great leadership and planning, reinforcement of cultural pride, and effective organization around community needs. IBA uses these guidelines to go about their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/74959/08723706.pdf?sequence=1|title = A Revolving Loan Fund for Minority Business Development: Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion|last = Hoskins|first = Victorio|date = June 1981|journal =pg. 2 |accessdate = 16 October 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Villa Victoria ==

Thought to be one of the major accomplishments in Boston's urban housing developments, Villa Victoria, or Victory Village, is located in Boston's growing South End neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is a housing community that contains 435 low income housing units, as well as various commercial and community spaces such as restaurants, community centers, markets, and retail stores. The development was done by 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.commonwealthmagazine.org/Voices/Considered-Opinion/2005/Winter/Bostons-Villa-Victoria-shows-that-civic-participation-is-hard-to-sustain-in-the-best-of-circumstances.aspx |author=Mario Luis Small |work=CommonWealth Magazine |title=Boston's Villa Victoria shows that civic participation is hard to sustain in the best of circumstances |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in four different phases; Victoria Apartments, Viviendas Apartments, South End Apartments, and Casas Borinquen Apartments. The properties in Villa Victoria have been renovated in the past ten years using funds from the [[Low-Income Housing Tax Credit]] program and the [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Mark Up To Market program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.etcdevelopmentcorp.org/portfolio/villa-victoria|title = ETC Development Corporation|date = |accessdate = 16 October 2014|website = ETC Development Corp.|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6027">The '''internal affairs''' refers to a division of a [[law enforcement agency]] that investigates incidents and possible suspicions of [[crime|law-breaking]] and professional [[misconduct]] attributed to officers on the force. It is thus a mechanism of limited [[self-governance]], "a police force policing itself". In different systems, internal affairs can go by other names such as Internal Investigations Division (usually referred to as IID), professional standards, [[inspector general|inspectorate general]], [[Office of Professional Responsibility]], Internal Review Board, or similar.
[[File:Emblem of the Spanish National Police Corps Internal Affairs Unit.svg|thumb|Emblem of the Internal Affairs Unit, [[National Police Corps]] (Spain)]]
Due to the sensitive nature of this responsibility, in many departments, officers employed in an internal affairs unit are not in a [[detective]] command but report directly to the agency's chief, or to a board of civilian police commissioners.

Internal affairs investigators are bound by stringent rules when conducting their investigations. In California, the Peace Officers Bill of Rights (POBR) is a mandated set of rules found in the Government Code.&lt;ref name="POBR"&gt;Text of "[http://porac.org/peace-officers-bill-of-rights/ Peace Officers Bill of Rights]" - [http://www.porac.org/ Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The internal affairs function is not an enforcement function, but rather a policing function that works to report only.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kelly, S.F. (2003). Internal Affairs. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, 72(7), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of internal affairs is very broad and unique to each police department.&lt;ref&gt;Hein, J. (2013). ''Inside internal affairs: An in depth look at the people, process, &amp; politics.'' Flushing, NY: Looseleaf Law Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sole purpose to having an internal affairs unit is to investigate and find the truth to what occurred when an officer is accused of misconduct. An investigation can also give insight on a policy itself that may have issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Investigations==
The circumstances of the complaint determines who will be investigating the complaint. The investigation of police officer(s) misconduct can be conducted by the internal affairs unit, executive police officer, or any other outside agency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the [[Salt Lake City Police Department]], the Civilian Review Board will also investigate the complaint, but they will do so independently.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When the investigation begins, everything is documented and all employees, complainants, and witnesses are interviewed. Any physical evidence is analyzed and past behaviors of the officer in question are reviewed. Dispatch tapes, police reports, tickets, audio, and videotapes are all reviewed if available.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Courtney, K.M. (1996). Internal affairs in the small agency. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin., 65(9), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Many controversies arise because an officer investigating police misconduct may show favoritism and/or hold grudges particularly when a single officer is conducting the investigation. Some departments hire uninvolved officers or include another department or a special unit to conduct the investigation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Small agencies ===
Larger agencies have the resources to have separate units for internal affairs, but smaller agencies - which do not have the luxury - are more common, with 87% of police departments in the United States employing 25 or fewer sworn officers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Smaller agencies that do not have sufficient resources may have the executive officer, the accused's supervisor, or another police department conduct an investigation. The state police may also be asked to investigate criminal behavior, but they do not deal in minor misconduct or rule violation cases. However, allowing another department to investigate can result in lower morale among the officers because it can appear as an admission that the department cannot handle their own affairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Civilian review board ==
Several police departments in the USA have been compelled to institute citizen review or investigation of police misconduct complaints in response to community perception that internal affairs investigations are biased in favor of police officers. 

For example, [[San Francisco]], California, has its Office of Citizen Complaints, created by voter initiative in 1983, in which citizens who have never been members of the San Francisco Police Department investigate complaints of police misconduct filed against members of the San Francisco Police Department.  [[Washington, DC]], has a similar office, created in 1999, known as the Office of Police Complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://policecomplaints.dc.gov D.C. Office of Police Complaints]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of [[Utah]], the Internal Affairs Division must properly file a complaint before the committee can officially investigate. Complaints involving police misuse of force will be brought to the Civilian Review Board, but citizens can request the committee to investigate any other issues of misconduct.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kunz, C. "Management Services Bureau". ''SLCgov.com.'' Salt Lake City Police Department. Retrieved 13 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrikes''' were a series of [[air-to-ground]] attacks conducted by a team of two [[United States Army|U.S.]] [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64 Apache]] helicopters in [[Al-Amin al-Thaniyah]], [[New Baghdad]] during the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] which followed the [[Iraq War]]. On April 5, 2010, the attacks received worldwide coverage and controversy following the release of 39 minutes of gunsight footage by [[Internet leak|leaks]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. The footage was portrayed as [[classified information|classified]],&lt;ref name=Reuters6Apr2010&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/06/us-iraq-usa-journalists-idUSTRE6344FW20100406 Leaked U.S. video shows deaths of Reuters' Iraqi staffers]. Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt; but its confessed leaker, U.S. Army soldier [[Chelsea Manning]], testified in 2013 that the video was not classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sparrowmedia.net/bradley-manning-providence-inquiry/|title=Notes from the Courtroom: Alexa O'Brien's Transcript of Pfc. Manning's Providence Inquiry|last=O'Brien|first=Alexa|date=February 28, 2013|website=sparrowmedia.net|publisher=The Sparrow Project|access-date=March 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The video, which WikiLeaks titled '''''Collateral Murder''''', showed that the crew encountered a firefight and laughed at some of the casualties. An anonymous U.S. military official confirmed the authenticity of the footage,&lt;ref name="Reuters: leaked video" /&gt; which provoked global discussion on the legality and morality of the attacks.

In the first strike, the crews of two Apaches directed [[M230 Chain Gun|30&amp;nbsp;mm cannon]] fire at a group of ten Iraqi men, including some armed men, standing where insurgents earlier that day had shot at an American [[Humvee]] with small arms fire. Among the group were two Iraqi [[war correspondent]]s working for Reuters, [[Saeed Chmagh]] and [[Namir Noor-Eldeen]]. Seven men (including Noor-Eldeen) were killed during this first strike, and Saeed Chmagh was injured.

The second strike, also using 30&amp;nbsp;mm rounds, was directed at a van whose driver, Saleh Matasher Tomal, appeared to happen to drive by and who proceeded to help the wounded Chmagh. However, in the long version of the video this van was targeted prior to the first engagement by one Apache (Crazyhorse 1/8) as it traveled south toward the Reuters employees who were, simultaneously, targeted by the other Apache (Crazyhorse 1/9) as they walked north on the same road toward the van. Minutes after the first engagement ended the van returned traveling in an opposite direction (north) once again on this same road. Two men assisting in the rescue effort were from a group of five standing at an intersection – seen in the upper right corner of the video when the Reuters employees arrive in the courtyard – reported to Apaches as being a second position combatants were using to attack the Humvee. Both of these men, Chmagh and Tomal, were killed in the second strike, and two of Tomal's children were badly wounded.

In a third strike, Apache pilots watched people run into a building and engaged that building with several [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missiles.

According to Tom Raju, a reporter at CNN, "the soldiers of Bravo Company, 2–16 Infantry had been under fire all morning from rocket-propelled grenades and small arms on the first day of Operation Ilaaj in Baghdad".&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt; [[Al Jazeera]] stated that the Army had received "reports of small arms fire", but were unable to positively identify the gunmen. Apache helicopters were called in by a soldier in the Humvee (Hotel 2–6) under attack from the same position used by Namir Noor-Eldeen to photograph the vehicle.&lt;ref name="collateral-aljazeera"/&gt; According to a military review, soldiers in that company "had been under sporadic small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire since" the operation—described as "clearing their sector and looking for weapons caches"—began.&lt;ref name="politifact.com"/&gt;

The Air Weapons Team (AWT) of two Apache AH-64s from the 1st Cavalry Division had been requested by the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment]] (2–16), 4th Brigade Combat Team, [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich, before July 12 to support Operation Ilaaj. Tasked to conduct escort, armed reconnaissance patrols, and counter-IED and counter-mortar operations, the two helicopters left [[Camp Taji]] at 9:24&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;!-- , and were active over Baghdad from 9.30am to 1.30pm. --&gt; They arrived on station in New Baghdad at 9:53&amp;nbsp;a.m., where sporadic attacks on coalition forces continued.&lt;ref name="supporting-documents"/&gt;

=== Attack on personnel ===
In the video on the morning of July 12, 2007, the crews of two [[United States Army]] [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopters observe a gathering of men near a section of Baghdad in the path of advancing U.S. ground troops, some armed with [[AKM]]s and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]s.&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt; The crew estimates the group is twenty men.&lt;ref name=transcript&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike_transcript |title=July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike transcript – Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the group are two journalists working for [[Reuters]], [[Namir Noor-Eldeen]] and [[Saeed Chmagh]].&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen-seattle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgreal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sengupta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcelroy" /&gt; (While the two are carrying media cards, a military officer claimed they were not wearing distinctive clothing identifying themselves as such.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/04/military-releases-report-on-2007-apache-attack-and-questions-linger |title=U.S. Military Releases Redacted Records on 2007 Apache Attack, Questions Linger &amp;#124; Danger Room |publisher=Wired.com |date= April 7, 2010|accessdate=May 19, 2011 |first=Nathan |last=Hodge}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crew member requests authorization to engage after seeing five or six of the men, moving in the direction of U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt; A long shadow cast on the ground by a telephoto lens on Noor-Eldeen's camera is misidentified by the pilot as an additional RPG aimed at him and a U.S. Army Humvee directly below his aircraft. One second later he screams, "He's got an RPG!"  Noor-Eldeen fails to photograph the Apache but three pictures of the U.S. Humvee appear on his camera's memory card when it was recovered by U.S. soldiers. The men become obscured behind a building as the Apache moves around the group.&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt; Expecting an immediate attack on the U.S. soldiers, both helicopters strafe a group of ten men with [[M230 Chain Gun|30 mm rounds]] once they became visible again.&lt;ref name="Reuters: leaked video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnndeaths" /&gt; Seven men are killed, including Noor-Eldeen, and three others wounded, including Chmagh.&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgreal" /&gt; Once the group is eliminated, the Apache pilots direct the ground troops to move up to the position of the attack to clear the area.

=== Attack on a van ===
As the ground troops advanced, a wounded Chmagh was seen crawling and attempting to stand.&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgreal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; As the U.S. soldiers moved towards the site of the attack, a van stopped near Chmagh. The van had no visible markings to suggest it was an ambulance or a protected vehicle.&lt;ref name="fishel"/&gt;  The Apache crew alerted the ground troops of the van and requested permission to engage the vehicle before the ground troops arrived. The Apache crew saw unarmed&lt;ref name="mcgreal"/&gt; men exit the vehicle and move to Chmagh.&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgreal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; The Apache crew requested permission to engage, stating it "looks like [the men] possibly, picking up bodies and weapons" from the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|title = Collateral Murder|medium = Internet video|publisher = WikiLeaks|location = Iraq|date=July 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated their request to shoot,&lt;ref name=Reuters6Apr2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/apr/07/wikileaks-collateral-murder-iraq-video Grim truths of Wikileaks Iraq video | Douglas Haddow | Comment is free | guardian.co.uk].

The Apache crew then alerted the ground troops that they believed that they could see an injured child moving around inside the destroyed van. On the video, it is then seen that Army soldiers establish a perimeter around the site and extract the children from the burning van.

=== Attack on a building ===
The ground troops that secured the site of the first two strikes then receive small arms fire from nearby buildings.

There is a period of 20 minutes not included on the leaked tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/keeper-of-secrets-20100521-w230.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Keeper of secrets | first=Nikki | last=Barrowclough | date=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the internal legal review, the helicopters engaged a group of armed insurgents, and that some were seen entering a nearby building.&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt;

As the tape resumes, two men, one holding an AK-47, are seen walking. They split up and the footage follows one who appears to be armed.&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Useofforce" /&gt; He walks into a building which has been identified as the source of fire at U.S. ground troops. They request permission to fire a missile at the building, describing it as "abandoned" or "under construction". The ground controller responds, "If you've [positively identified] the individuals in the building with weapons, go ahead and engage the building". As the pilot positions the helicopter to attack the building, two unarmed men walk towards, and perhaps into, the building. As the gunner fires the first missile, another man is seen walking along the street in front of the building. The missile hits the building, and the man is caught in the explosion. The crew then reposition the helicopter and fire two more missiles into the upper floors of the building&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Collateral Murder Op Ed |url=http://www.rethink-dispatches.com/essays/collateral-murder-op-ed/ |publisher=[[Dispatches (magazine)|Dispatches]] |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks said in the preface to one of their videos of the incident that "some of the men appear to have been armed [although] the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed" in the introductory text of the shorter video.&lt;ref name=PolitiFact/&gt; [[Julian Assange]] said "permission to engage was given before the word 'RPG' was ever used".&lt;ref name=PolitiFact/&gt; Politifact states: "When Assange points out in the context of justifying the title "Collateral Murder" that the word "RPG" was not used until after permission to engage was given, he leaves the impression that the soldiers were given the okay to open fire on a group of unarmed men, or men believed to be unarmed. But the video and accompanying audio make clear that the soldiers in the helicopter said they spotted "weapons" among those in the group—later allegedly identified by an internal army investigator as an AK-47, RPG rounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/12/robert-gates/gates-said-leaked-military-video-shooting-iraq-doe |title=Gates said leaked military video of shooting in Iraq doesn't show the broader picture of Americans being fired upon |publisher=PolitiFact |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two RPG launchers, one of which was loaded.&lt;ref name="legal-review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politifact20100410"/&gt; Assange later acknowledged "Based upon visual evidence, I suspect there probably were AKs and an RPG, but I'm not sure that means anything".&lt;ref name="fishel"/&gt; Assange stated that initial attempts to evacuate the wounded children to a nearby U.S. military hospital were blocked by U.S. military command.&lt;ref name="Collateral Murder" /&gt; The legal review carried out by the U.S. Army states that the two children were evacuated to the 28th [[Combat Support Hospital]] via [[Forward Operating Base Loyalty]], then transferred to an Iraqi medical facility the next day.&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt;

[[Fox News]] said that of the attack "WikiLeaks appears to have done selective editing that tells only half the story. For instance, the Web site takes special care to slow down the video and identify the two photographers and the cameras they are carrying. ... The Web site does not slow down the video to show that at least one man in that group was carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, a clearly visible weapon that runs nearly two-thirds the length of his body. WikiLeaks also does not point out that at least one man was carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. He is seen swinging the weapon below his waist while standing next to the man holding the RPG."&lt;ref name="fishel"/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' stated "It is unclear if some of the men are armed but Noor-Eldeen can be seen with a camera".&lt;ref name="mcgreal" /&gt; [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[Salon.com]]'' said that "the vast majority of the men were clearly unarmed".&lt;ref name=notaberration&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/04/05/iraq_49/ |title=WikiLeaks releases video of slaughter in Iraq |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |date=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald called the second airstrike a "plainly unjustified killing of a group of unarmed men carrying away an unarmed, seriously wounded man to safety".&lt;ref name=notaberration/&gt; ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper said the group was displaying "no obvious hostile action".&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt;

In ''[[The Independent]]'' on April 8, 2010, human rights activist [[Joan Smith (writer)|Joan Smith]] asserts that the engagements were like a game to the helicopter crew. She writes that the co-pilot urged a dying, unarmed journalist to pick up a weapon as he tried to crawl to safety; and claims that the footage shows "the Apache crew opening fire on civilians".&lt;ref name="Independent08Apr10"&gt;{{cite news|title = Joan Smith: Now we see what war does to those who wage it|work = The Independent|first = Joan | last = Smith|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/joan-smith/joan-smith-now-we-see-what-war-does-to-those-who-wage-it-1938495.html|date = April 8, 2010|accessdate = April 8, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the crew were informed that a child had been injured by their attack, one initially responded, "Ah damn. Oh well", and a minute later continued, "Well, it's their fault for bringing kids into a battle".&lt;ref name="Independent08Apr10" /&gt; Smith describes this reaction as inhuman. She draws parallels with soldiers who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in earlier wars. She continues, "the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inflicting huge psychological damage on combatants".&lt;ref name="Independent08Apr10" /&gt; In refusing to recognize this, the US military fails both its own soldiers and their victims.&lt;ref name="Independent08Apr10" /&gt; She concludes that command structures need to be in place to identify "combatants with serious psychological problems".&lt;ref name="Independent08Apr10" /&gt;

On ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Josh Stieber, a conscientious objector who was at the time assigned to Bravo Company 2–16, said that although it's natural to "judge or criticize the soldiers", in fact "this is how [they] were trained to act". He said that the debate should be re-framed, that it is more appropriate to ask "questions of the larger system" that teaches "doing these things is in the best interests of my own country".&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"&gt;{{cite web|title = 'This Is How These Soldiers Were Trained to Act' – Veteran of Military Unit Involved in 2007 Baghdad Helicopter Shooting Says Incident Is Part of Much Larger Problem|url = http://www.democracynow.org/2010/4/12/this_is_how_these_soldiers_were|date = April 8, 2010|accessdate = April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview on the  ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]'', Stieber said that the attack "exposes so clearly the fallacy of using war as a tool of foreign policy or as a way to supposedly spread 'freedom and democracy' around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US soldier on Baghdad airstrike: "Not out of the ordinary in Iraq"|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/04/stie-a23.html|work=World Socialist Web SIte|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethan McCord, a soldier who arrived on the scene after the attack, stated in an interview for the ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'':

{{quote|From being in the perspective of the Apache helicopter crew, I can see where a group of men gathering, when there's a firefight just a few blocks away, which I was involved in, and they’re carrying weapons, one of which is an RPG. ... Their overall mission that day was to protect us, to provide support for us, so I can see where the initial attack on the group of men was warranted. However, personally I don't feel that the attack on the van was warranted. I think that the people could have been deterred from doing what they were doing in the van by simply firing a few warning shots versus completely obliterating the van and its occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sSuEf4BAVk |title= 2 soldiers in 'Collateral Murder' video apologize.

On June 7, 2010, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that [[Kristinn Hrafnsson]], an investigative reporter who worked on the Collateral Murder video and has since become a spokesman for WikiLeaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/meet-the-new-public-face-of-wikileaks-kristinn-hrafnsson/?boxes=techchannellighttop |title=Meet The New Public Face Of WikiLeaks: Kristinn Hrafnsson – Forbes |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 22, 2013 |first=Andy |last=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have found the owner of the building who said that three families had been living in there and seven residents had died, including his wife and daughter.&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Useofforce" /&gt; The report stated that the helicopter crew did not know how many people were in the building when they destroyed it with missiles, and that "there is evidence that unarmed people have both entered and are nearby".&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Useofforce" /&gt; It concludes that an investigating officer would want to know how the armed men were identified as combatants from the earlier engagement; would question the nature of the collateral-damage estimate carried out by the crew before the missiles were launched; and would wish to determine whether a missile attack was a proportionate response to the threat.

A Pentagon spokesman insisted the video did not contradict the official finding that the helicopters' crew acted within the rules of engagement and said that the inquiry backed the assessment that the group of men were carrying a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/7560561/Calls-for-inquiry-into-Apache-attack-on-Iraqi-civilians.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Damien | last=McElroy | title=Calls for inquiry into Apache attack on Iraqi civilians | date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2007–2009 coverage ==
On the day of the attack the U.S. military reported that the two journalists were killed along with nine insurgents, and that the helicopter engagement was related to a U.S. troop raid force that had been attacked by small-arms fire and RPGs.&lt;ref name="NYT20070713" /&gt; U.S. forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Scott Bleichwehl later stated: "There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force".&lt;ref name="NYT20070713" /&gt;

''The Washington Post'' reported it was unclear whether the journalists were killed by U.S. fire or by shooting from the targeted Iraqis. Captain James Hall stated they couldn't drive in [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|Bradleys]] in fear of running over bodies. Major Brent Cummings claimed they took great pains to prevent the loss of innocent civilian lives.&lt;ref name="WP20070713"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/12/AR2007071202357.html|title=U.S., Shiite Fighters Clash in Baghdad|publisher=The Washington Post|date=July 13, 2007 | first1=Joshua | last1=Partlow | first2=David | last2=Finkel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters reported that it could locate no witnesses who had seen gunmen in the immediate area. Reuters also stated that local police described the attack as "random American bombardment".&lt;ref name="Yates" /&gt; Reuters subsequently asked the U.S. military to probe the deaths. They asked for an explanation of the confiscation of the journalists' two cameras, access to the on-board footage and voice communications from the helicopters involved, and access to the reports of the units involved in the incident, particularly logs of weapons taken from the scene.&lt;ref name=Yates/&gt;

On July 25, 2007, during an off-the-record briefing in Baghdad by the U.S. military, two Reuters editors were shown "less than three minutes of video from the Apache’s gun camera, up to the exact moment it opened fire the first time." The editors asked to see the remaining footage so Reuters could check whether it had been edited or manipulated. They were denied at the briefing and told seek access under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/witness-yates-injury/|title=Return to Ward 17: Making peace with lost comrades|last=Yates|first=Dean|website=Reuters|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, Reuters requested a copy of the full video under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters: leaked video" /&gt; The Pentagon blocked that request&lt;ref name="mcgreal" /&gt; despite several follow-up requests by Reuters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a personal statement during her court-martial, Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning stated that the military did have access to this information, and that it was actively examining it, yet it denied access partially on the basis that the information might no longer exist.&lt;ref name="BM001"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/01/bradley-manning-wikileaks-statement-full-text|title=Bradley Manning's statements during his trial|date=March 1, 2013|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal legal review by staff at [[Forward Operating Base Loyalty]] in Iraq during July 2007 stated that the helicopters had attacked a number of armed insurgents within the [[rules of engagement]], and that in an apparent case of [[civilian casualties]] two reporters working for Reuters had also been killed. The review would not be released in full until 2010, after the video of the incident had been released by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="NYT20100505_Bumiller" /&gt;

''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter [[David Finkel]], who at the time was embedded with Bravo Company 2–16 Infantry, later covered the incidents of the day in his book, ''[[The Good Soldiers]]''.&lt;ref name="DavidFinkel20100406" /&gt; At a February 2013 pretrial hearing, Manning stated that Finkel "was quoting, I feel in verbatim, the audio communications of the aerial weapons team crew". She said, however, that she was "aghast" at Finkel's portrayal of the incident. "Reading his account," she explained, "one would believe the engagement was somehow justified as 'payback' for an earlier attack that led to the death of a soldier."&lt;ref name="BM001" /&gt;

== Coverage from 2010 ==

=== Leaked video footage ===
Early in 2010, the internet whistleblower site WikiLeaks made a public request for assistance in decrypting a video it described as "US bomb strikes on civilians", specifically requesting access to [[supercomputer]] time.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt; The site stated on its [[Twitter]] account on January 8, 2010, that it had a copy of gunsight footage of the incidents.&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks-Twitter-Announcement" /&gt; The footage was released during an April 5 press conference at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]], and subsequently under a designated website titled "Collateral Murder". WikiLeaks stated that the footage shows the "murder of Iraqi civilians and two Reuters journalists".&lt;ref name="airstrike-aljazeera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="airstrike-bbc" /&gt;
WikiLeaks identified the leak's source as "a number of military whistleblowers".&lt;ref name="Collateral Murder" /&gt; Speaking to [[Reuters]] on condition of anonymity, a U.S. Defense official confirmed the authenticity of the leaked audio and video.&lt;ref name="Reuters: leaked video" /&gt;  The military reported that it could not find its copy of the video.&lt;ref name="militarycopy-aljazeera"/&gt;

WikiLeaks released a 39-minute version, which shows all three incidents, and a 17-minute version, which shows only the first two incidents.  Highlighted in the 17-minute version of the video are Noor-Eldeen with a camera and Chmagh talking on his mobile phone.&lt;ref name="mcgreal" /&gt; Both videos depict the attack on the van, van driver, and two other men, and the aftermath when the two seriously injured children were evacuated by U.S. ground forces who arrived on the scene.&lt;ref name="Collateral Murder" /&gt; The longer video shows the third attack, in which Hellfire missiles were fired into a building.&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Useofforce" /&gt;

==== WikiLeaks' rationale for their title of the footage ====
In an [[Al Jazeera English]] interview on April 19, 2010, WikiLeaks' Julian Assange explained why WikiLeaks titled the video "Collateral Murder":
{{quote|And you can see that they also deliberately target Saaed, a wounded man there on the ground, despite their earlier belief that they didn't have the rules of engagement—that the rules of engagement did not permit them to kill Saeed when he was wounded. When he is rescued, suddenly that belief changed. You can see in this particular image he is lying on the ground and the people in the van have been separated, but they still deliberately target him. This is why we called it ''Collateral Murder''. In the first example maybe it's collateral exaggeration or incompetence when they strafe the initial gathering, this is recklessness bordering on murder, but you couldn't say for sure that was murder. But this particular event—this is clearly murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2010/04/20104159123873370.html |title=Collateral Murder?

Regarding the title, [[Toby Harnden]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote: "Oddly enough, it was [[Stephen Colbert]], ostensibly a comedian, who skewered him":

{{quote|The army described this as a group that gave resistance at the time, that doesn't seem to be happening. But there are armed men in the group, they did find a rocket propelled grenade among the group, the Reuters photographers who were regrettably killed, were not identified ... You have edited this tape, and you have given it a title called 'collateral murder'. That's not leaking, that's a pure editorial.}}

According to Harnden "Assange admitted that he was seeking to manipulate and create 'maximum political impact'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7959227/Julian-Assanges-arrest-warrant-a-diversion-from-the-truth.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Toby | last=Harnden | title=Julian Assange's arrest warrant: a diversion from the truth? | date=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/158852/stephen-colbert-vs-glenn-greenwald-and-julian-assange |title=One Year Ago Tonight: Stephen Colbert vs. Julian Assange |publisher=The Nation |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/stehen-colbert-vs-glenn-g_b_828079.html |title=Greg Mitchell: Stephen Colbert Interviews Glenn Greenwald—and Julian Assange |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= April 12, 2011|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270712/april-12-2010/julian-assange |title=Julian Assange – The Colbert Report – 4/12/10 – Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/colbert-grills-wikileaks-founder-on-his-manipulation-of-the-public |title=Colbert Interviews Wikileaks &amp;#124; Reuters Video &amp;#124; Julian Assange |publisher=Mediaite |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dan Kennedy wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Even the comedian Stephen Colbert, in an interview with Assange, dropped his rightwing-blowhard persona momentarily to make a serious point, calling the edited version '[[emotional manipulation]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jul/27/why-wikileaks-turned-to-press | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dan | last=Kennedy | title=Why WikiLeaks turned to the press | date=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Keller]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "But in its zeal to make the video a work of antiwar propaganda, WikiLeaks also released a version that didn't call attention to an Iraqi who was toting a rocket-propelled grenade and packaged the manipulated version under the tendentious rubric ''Collateral Murder''."&lt;ref name="totalfatalities" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that "Critics contend that the shorter video was misleading because it did not make clear that the attacks took place amid clashes in the neighborhood and that one of the men was carrying a rocket-propelled grenade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/07wikileaks.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Noam | last1=Cohen | first2=Brian | last2=Stelter | title=Airstrike Video Brings Attention to WikiLeaks Site | date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reactions to the video footage ====
Captain Jack Hanzlik, a spokesman for [[U.S. Central Command]] stated that the airstrike video "gives you a limited perspective, [it] only tells you a portion of the activity that was happening that day. Just from watching that video, people cannot understand the complex battles that occurred. You are seeing only a very narrow picture of the events." Hanzlik said images gathered during a military investigation of the incident show multiple weapons around the dead bodies in the courtyard, including at least three RPGs. "Our forces were engaged in combat all that day with individuals that fit the description of the men in that video. Their age, their weapons, and the fact that they were within the distance of the forces that had been engaged made it apparent these guys were potentially a threat."&lt;ref name="fishel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nydaily20100407"/&gt; Also, WikiLeaks  "does not point out that at least one man was carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. He is seen swinging the weapon below his waist while standing next to the man holding the RPG". The Wikileaks edited video did not add arrows pointing to these men, nor did they label them, as was done with the men carrying cameras. WikiLeaks did, in fact, state "some of the men appear to have been armed [although] the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed" in the introductory text of the shorter video.&lt;ref name="PolitiFact"/&gt; In an interview with [[Fox News]] Assange acknowledged that "it's likely some of the individuals seen in the video were carrying weapons". He explained, "based upon visual evidence I suspect there probably were AKs and an RPG, but I'm not sure that means anything. ... Nearly every Iraqi household has a rifle or an AK. Those guys could have just been protecting their area". Fox News later stated that "although it could be argued AK-47 rifles are common household items, RPGs are not". A draft version of the video WikiLeaks produced made reference to the AK-47s and RPGs, but WikiLeaks said that ultimately they became unsure about the RPG, believing the long object could have been a camera tripod, so they decided not to point it out in the released version.&lt;ref name="fishel" /&gt;

U.S. Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] criticized WikiLeaks for releasing the video without providing any context. "These people can put out anything they want, and they're never held accountable for it. There's no before and there's no after". Gates remarked that the video provides the public a view of warfare "as seen through a soda straw".&lt;ref name="hudson20100623"/&gt; Gates stated: "They're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you—you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations."&lt;ref name="politifact.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters:Gates" /&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised its release, calling it "a striking artifact—an unmediated representation of the ambiguities and cruelties of modern warfare".&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Nosecrets"/&gt; Julian Assange said "it's ludicrous to allege that we have taken anything out of context in this video".&lt;ref name="fishel" /&gt;

[[Gabriel Schoenfeld]], Senior Fellow at the [[Hudson Institute]], said of the airstrike:.

{{quote|It is precisely the presence of weapons, including RPGs, that goes a long distance toward explaining why cameramen for Reuters—pointing television cameras around corners in a battle zone—were readily mistaken by our gunships for insurgents. The video makes plain that in this incident, as in almost all military encounters in both Iraq and Afghanistan, our soldiers are up against forces that do not wear uniforms—a violation of international law precisely because it places innocent civilians in jeopardy.
Responsibility for civilian deaths in such encounters rests with those who violate the rules of war. The Wikileaks videos also do not reveal the hundreds upon hundreds of cases in which American forces refrain from attacking targets precisely because civilians are in harm's way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=7096 |title=Hudson Institute &gt; Warfare Through 'a Soda Straw' |publisher=Hudson.org |date=June 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Daniel Ellsberg]], a former United States military analyst who was known for having leaked the [[Pentagon Papers]] to the media, said of the airstrike:

{{quote|It would be interesting to have someone speculate or tell us exactly what context would lead to justifying the killing that we see on the screen. As the killing goes on, you obviously would see the killing of men who are lying on the ground in an operation where ground troops are approaching and perfectly capable of taking those people captive, but meanwhile you're murdering before the troops arrive. That's a violation of the laws of war and of course what the mainstream media have omitted from their stories is this context.&lt;ref name=truthordare/&gt;}}

=== Subsequent mainstream media coverage ===
Publicity of the incident ballooned following the release of the footage. The event was covered by [[Al Jazeera English]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]]&lt;ref name="RT-TheAlyonaShow" /&gt; and [[Reuters]],&lt;ref name="Reuters: leaked video" /&gt; and was also followed by organizations including ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref name="airstrike-washington-post" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="NYT20100505_Bumiller" /&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'',&lt;ref name="Murphy-CS-20100405" /&gt; the [[BBC]],&lt;ref name="airstrike-bbc" /&gt; and [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="cnndeaths" /&gt;

Assange stated that some of the press had not reported on the third airstrike, in which three Hellfire missiles were fired onto an apartment complex, which only appears in the longer unedited version of the two videos.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;

In an interview on [[National Public Radio|NPR]] on April 6, the day after the ''Collateral Murder'' video release, [[David Finkel]] pointed out that the Reuters reporters were not embedded with anyone, but working independently. He also gave his view of the context of the killings:

{{quote|the Reuters guys walked into the hottest spot of a very hot morning. There had been running gun battles. There had been a lot of [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], grenade fire and so on, and they were doing what journalists do. They heard about something, they came to it and they just wanted—from everything I've learned since, they were just there to get that side of the story.&lt;ref name="NPR20100406-DavidFinkel" /&gt;}}

Finkel had reported the day in his book, ''[[The Good Soldiers]]'',&lt;ref name="DavidFinkel20100406" /&gt; including conversations which closely matched the subsequently leaked video footage. On the same day as the NPR interview, Finkel was asked how he had gotten a chance to see the unedited video and whether WikiLeaks had shown it to him. He responded, "I hadn't heard of WikiLeaks before yesterday. I based the account in my book on multiple sources, all unclassified".&lt;ref name=finkel20100406&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
WikiLeaks co-founder [[Julian Assange]] said that Finkel had seen the video and that at least one individual at the offices of the ''Washington Post'' had a copy of the video for at least a year, prior to its release by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=truthordare&gt;{{cite web

The ''Washington Post'' has denied having any copy of the unedited video prior to WikiLeaks release of their edited version, and Finkel (who was on book leave from the ''Washington Post'' at the time) has said that he has never made any statement about his sources for the story, except that it was "sourced ... from unclassified information and my presence in the area that day".&lt;ref name=thekicker20100607&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interviews with Ethan McCord ====
Ethan McCord, the soldier seen in the video carrying the injured boy, recalled in an interview on ''The Marc Steiner Show'' that on arrival at the scene, "The first thing I did was run up to the van". After attending the girl's wounds and handing her to a medic, McCord was ordered to take position on the roof but he returned to the van to find the boy moving his hand. "I grabbed him and ran to the Bradley myself". McCord states he was yelled at for not "pulling security". "The first thing I thought of ... was my children at home". He later sought help for psychological trauma, but was ridiculed by his NCO and told that if he were to go to the mental health officer, "there would be repercussions".&lt;ref name="MarcSteiner20100313-2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two members of the company in the WikiLeaks video speak out |url =http://www.steinershow.org/radio/the-marc-steiner-show/april-13-2010-segment-2 |publisher=The Marc Steiner Show |date=April 13, 2010|accessdate = April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCord discussed his experience in the battle in an interview with the ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]'' on April 28, 2010, stating, "What happened then was not an isolated incident. Stuff like that happens on a daily basis in Iraq."&lt;ref name=wsws1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/apr2010/emcc-a28.shtml |title=US soldier in WikiLeaks massacre video: 'I relive this every day' |date=April 28, 2010 |work=World Socialist Web Site |publisher=The International Committee of the Fourth International |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCord also recalled being ordered to "kill every motherfucker on the street" in the event of an attack on their convoy. Describing doubts over his initial enthusiasm in Iraq, McCord said that "I didn’t understand why people were throwing rocks at us, why I was being shot at and why we're being blown up, when I have it in my head that I was here to help these people. ... The first real serious doubt, where I could no longer justify to myself being in Iraq or serving in the Army, was on that day in July 2007."&lt;ref name=wsws1 /&gt; In this interview, McCord reports that repercussions for seeking mental health help could include being labeled as a "[[malingerer]]", a crime under U.S. military law.&lt;ref name=wsws1 /&gt;

McCord requested mental health assistance following his experiences in July 12, but was told by his superior officers to "get the sand out of [his] vagina" and to "suck it up and be a soldier".&lt;ref name=mcCord&gt;{{cite news|last=Tony Jones|title=Former US soldier speaks (interview transcript)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2886439.htm|accessdate=March 8, 2011|newspaper=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', McCord stated that he supported Wikileaks in releasing the video, with some qualifications: "When it was first released I don't think it was done in the best manner that it could have been. They were stating that these people had no weapons whatsoever, that they were just carrying cameras. In the video, you can clearly see that they did have weapons ... to the trained eye." McCord added, "I don't say that Wikileaks did a bad thing, because they didn't. ... I think it is good that they're putting this stuff out there. I don't think that people really want to see this, though, because this is war. ... It's very disturbing."&lt;ref name="WiredOnMcCord2010"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kim Zetter |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/04/2007-iraq-apache-attack-as-seen-from-the-ground/ |title=U.S. Soldier on 2007 Apache Attack: What I Saw |date=April 20, 2010 |publisher=Wired |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Spione]] made a short [[documentary film]] about the airstrikes called ''[[Incident in New Baghdad]]'', featuring a first-person account from Ethan McCord. It was nominated as a Documentary Short Subject for the [[84th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=8 Doc Shorts on Oscars 2011 Shortlist|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20111013a.html|publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=October 14, 2011|location=Beverly Hills, California|date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]], McCord stated that he became suicidal after the incident, and attempted suicide on two occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/collateral-video-murder-mccord-414/ |title=Surviving 'Collateral Murder': Soldier relives infamous WikiLeaks video – RT USA |publisher=Rt.com |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, a 22-year-old American Army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley Manning), was arrested after telling hacker [[Adrian Lamo]] she had leaked the airstrike video, along with a video of [[Granai massacre|another airstrike]] and around 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=BBCManning&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10254072.stm|title=US intelligence analyst arrested over security leaks|date=June 7, 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired /&gt; The Internet chats between Manning and Lamo were revealed to the public by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/manning-lamo-logs/ |title=Manning-Lamo Chat Logs Revealed |last=Hansen |first=Evan |date=July 13, 2011 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66KJxiFaJ?url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/manning-lamo-logs/ |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks said they were unable to confirm whether or not Manning was the source of the video, stating "we never collect personal information on our sources", but saying that "if [Manning is the] whistleblower then, without doubt, he's a national hero"&lt;ref name="NYDNBM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/06/07/2010-06-7_spc_bradley_manning_allegedly_arrested_for_leaking_collateral_murder_helicopter_.html|title=Report: Soldier arrested for allegedly leaking 'Collateral Murder' helicopter video to WikiLeaks|last=Sheridan|first=Michael|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "we have taken steps to arrange for his protection and legal defence".&lt;ref name=BBCManning/&gt;

== Legality of the attacks ==
In an June 7, 2010, article in ''The New Yorker'', Raffi Khatchadourian addressed several issues involved in determining the legality of the attacks, including "proportionality", "positive identification" ("reasonable certainty" that the target has hostile intent), and "the treatment of casualties during an ongoing military operation".&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Rules"/&gt; 

Mark Taylor, an international law expert and a director at the [[Fafo Foundation|Fafo Institute for International Studies]] in Norway, told Al Jazeera "there's a case to be made that a war crime may have been committed." He added, "I think what this video shows is really a case that challenges whether the laws of war are strict enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/04/20104782857326667.html|title=Iraq outrage over US killing video|date=April 7, 2010|website=aljazeera.com|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=March 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article at [[Gawker]] stated that Reuters reporter Luke Baker had written an article claiming that the airstrikes may have been war crimes, but Reuters refused to run the story. Reuters responded, "It is absolutely untrue that this story was spiked. It was sent back for more reporting in an effort to incorporate a wider range of experts. The story was then overtaken by a more updated one out of Washington that incorporated reporting from the original piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exclusive: Reuters Chief Spikes Story on Killing of His Own Staffers In Baghdad |url=http://gawker.com/5512623/reuters-chief-shoots-down-story-on-killing-of-his-own-staffers-in-baghdad |publisher=Gawker |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411213043/http://gawker.com/5512623/reuters-chief-shoots-down-story-on-killing-of-his-own-staffers-in-baghdad |archivedate=April 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military legal review ===
On April 5, 2010, the same day as the release of the video footage by WikiLeaks, the United States Central Command, which oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, released a collection of documents including two investigative reports.&lt;ref name="NYT20100505_Bumiller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="supporting-documents" /&gt; Pentagon officials told the Reuters news agency that U.S. military lawyers were reviewing the video and could reopen an investigation into the incident,&lt;ref name="militarycopy-aljazeera"/&gt; but a spokesperson later said that there were no plans to reopen the investigation.&lt;ref name="airstrikeinvestigation-bbc"/&gt;

The report states that at least two members of the group which were first fired on were armed, that two RPGs and one [[AKM]] or [[AK-47]] rifle could be seen in the helicopter video, and that these weapons were picked up by the follow-up U.S. ground troops. The report concludes that the Reuters employees were in the company of armed insurgents. It also states that "The cameras could easily be mistaken for slung AK-47 or AKM rifles, especially since neither cameraman is wearing anything that identifies him as media or press".&lt;ref name="cohen-cnn" /&gt; The report recommends encouraging journalists in Iraq to wear special vests to identify themselves, and to keep the U.S. military updated about their whereabouts.  It claimed reporters' "furtive attempts to photograph the Coalition Ground Forces made them appear as hostile combatants".&lt;ref name="wired1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired20100704Hodge"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nathan Hodge |title=U.S. Military Releases Redacted Records on 2007 Apache Attack, Questions Linger |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/04/military-releases-report-on-2007-apache-attack-and-questions-linger/ |publisher=Wired |date=July 4, 2010 | accessdate=February 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Attack on personnel and a van per U.S. Army report account =====
According to the U.S. Army investigation report released by the [[United States Central Command]], the engagement started at 10:20 Iraqi local time and ended at 10:41. A unit from Bravo Company 2–16 was within 100 meters of the individuals that were fired upon with 30mm AH-64 Apache cannons. The company was charged with clearing their sector of any small armed forces, and had been under fire from small arms and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s (RPGs). The company was supported by two Apache helicopters from the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]'s [[1st Air Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (United States)|Aviation Brigade]], callsigns "Crazyhorse 1/8" and "Crazyhorse 1/9". Two men were identified by Crazyhorse 1/8 as carrying an RPG launcher and an [[AKM-7.62 rifle|AKM]] or [[AK-47]]. When the cameraman on the ground aimed his camera in the direction of Bravo Company 2–16, a pilot remarked "He's getting ready to fire". An Apache maneuvered around a building to get a clear field of fire and shot all nine men, killing eight. A passing van then stopped and attempted to load a wounded man. After getting permission to fire, the Apache crew fired on the van. When Bravo Company arrived at the scene, they reported finding two RPGs and an AK-47 or AKM. They also found two [[Canon EOS]] digital cameras with telephoto lenses. Two children were found in the van, a four-year-old girl with gunshot wounds and embedded windscreen glass wounds and an eight-year-old boy with multiple wounds, including brain damage arising from shrapnel damage to his right [[temporal lobe]]. Both children were said to have been evacuated to the [[28th Combat Support Hospital]] via [[Forward Operating Base]] [[Forward Operating Base Loyalty|Loyalty]], then transferred to an Iraqi medical facility the next day.&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt; This account of first bringing the wounded children to the Combat Support Hospital appears to be contradicted by orders by radio that form part of the video record, which forbids it and orders that the children be handed over to local police.&lt;!-- US SOLDIER 3: Negative on evac of the two civilian kids to Rusty. They’re going to have the IPs link up with us over here. Break. IPs will take them up to a local hospital.

While the Air Weapons Team was providing support at the first engagement area they were informed by ground troops that they were receiving small arms fire from the south/southwest. The crew for Crazyhorse 1/8 then located multiple individuals with weapons about 400 meters east of coalition forces and was given clearance to engage the targets. However, the co-pilot/gunner then observed a child and some other non-combatants in the vicinity of the individuals and decided to hold off on the engagement until the non-combatants were clear. After the non-combatants were clear Crazyhorse 1/8 engaged the targets. The crew for Crazyhorse 1/9 could not engage due to target obfuscation from buildings and dust.&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt;

The team observed several individuals from this group, some possibly wounded, run into a large multistory building. The co-pilot/gunner for Crazyhorse 1/9 spotted three individuals near this building get into a red SUV and drive away to the west. For about 5 to 10 minutes the team diverted its attention to this vehicle. However, according to the co-pilot for Crazyhorse 1/8 they failed to positively identify the occupants as combatants and returned to the previous engagement area.&lt;ref name="legal-review" /&gt;

===== Attack on building per U.S. Army report account =====
The events between the attack on the van and the attack on the building (approximately 30 minutes) were not captured on the leaked video footage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collateralmurder.com/en/timeline.html CollateralMurder's Timeline of attack]: relevantly, '06:49:09 Video cuts; 07:20:42 [video resumes]'&lt;/ref&gt; The military did not include the attack on the building in their report.&lt;ref name=NewYorker-Useofforce/&gt;

===== Julian Assange's comments regarding U.S. Army report =====
Assange responded to the investigation report released by the Army in an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', stating that "the tone and language is all about trying to find an excuse for the activity. ... It's very clear that that is the approach, to try and find any mechanism to excuse the behavior, and that is what ended up happening".&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;

== Awards ==
In May 2011 the Barcelona Human Rights Film Festival awarded the investigative film ''Collateral murder, Hellfire'', done by Kristinn Hrafnsson, Wikileaks spokesperson, and Ingi Ingason, with the award for International Journalism and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks-press.org/ingi-inganson-ragnar-and-kristinn-hrafnsson-awarded-first-barcelona-human-rights-film-festival-award/ |title=Ingi Ingason Ragnar and Kristinn Hrafnsson awarded International Journalism and Human Rights Award at Barcelona Human Rights Film Festival |publisher=Wikileaks-press.org |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30925">The term "Literati purges" is a translation of Korean term ''''sahwa'''' (사화 士禍) by Edward W. Wagner, Harvard professor of Korean history.  Sahwa literally means "[[seonbi]]'s calamity" and refers to a series of political purges in late 15th and 16th century, in which [[Sarim]] scholars suffered persecution at the hands of their political rivals.

The politics during Middle Joseon Dynasty were primarily marked by a power struggle between the two aristocratic [[yangban]] factions - the entrenched Hungu power elites and the upstart [[Sarim]] scholars called [[seonbi]], who belonged to [[neo-Confucian]] school of [[Kim Jong-jik]] and other thinkers. The Sarim scholars generally shunned the royal court and studied neo-Confucianism in rural provinces especially after [[King Sejo]]'s [[Six martyred ministers|usurpation of throne in 1455]], but they began to enter politics during the reign of [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]].  They primarily occupied key positions in so-called "[[Three Offices]]" (삼사), collective name for Office of Inspector General (whose main role was to impeach government officials for corrupt or improper actions), Office of Censors (whose function to criticize the improper actions and policies of the king and ministers), and Hongmoongwan (library and advisory council that taught the king history and Confucian teachings).  They were also well represented in Spring Autumn Office, where government records were kept and historiographers worked.  From these organs that were designed to check the power of the king and central government, the Sarim scholars challenged the entrenched Hungu faction, who held key positions in [[State Council of Joseon|State Council]] and [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] that carried out state affairs, by impeaching them for corruption or impropriety.  The subsequent conflict between two factions resulted in four bloody purges between 1498 and 1545.

==First Literati Purge of 1498==
The first and second literati purges took place during the reign of [[Yeonsangun]], successor to Seongjong. The First Literati Purge of 1498, also called Muo Sahwa (무오사화, 戊午士禍), began as a personal grudge of Yi Guk-don against Kim Il-son, who once impeached him.  Both were assigned to compile records related to King Seongjong's reign for [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], and  [[Kim Il-son]], a disciple of [[Kim Jong-jik]], included the latter's writing that was critical of King Sejo's usurpation in the compilation.  (Kim Jong-jik wrote a lamentation of [[Xiang Yu]]'s murder of [[Emperor Yi of Chu]] in early Chinese history after he heard of [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]]'s death at the order of King Sejo.)  When Yi Guk-don, Kim Il-son's superior, found this out, he sensed a chance of revenge.  Kim Il-son and other followers of Kim Jong-jik were accused of treason by the Hungu faction, many of whom originally gained power from their support of Sejo. Because Yeonsangun's lineage came from Sejo, Sarim faction's view of Sejo's usurpation was considered to be treasonable.  Yeonsangun - who disliked academia and was notorious for turning the [[Seonggyungwan]], royal study hall, into his personal brothel - found an opportunity to purge the Sarim scholars and weaken Three Offices.  Kim Il-son and two others were "drawn and quartered" (each limb was pulled apart by ox) while three were beheaded. Kim Jong-jik's remains were excavated and then beheaded, and at least 18 others were exiled.  Yeonsangun ordered the entire court officials to watch Kim's execution and even ordered that those who did not attend or turned face away be reported so that they might be punished.

==Second Literati Purge of 1504==
The Second Literati Purge of 1504, or Kapcha Sahwa (갑자사화, 甲子士禍), followed when Yeonsangun eventually discovered that his real mother was not Queen Jung-hyeon but Consort Yoon, who was executed in 1482 for poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines out of jealousy and making a scratch mark on Seongjong's face.  When later Yeonsangun was told of details of his mother's death and was presented with a piece of clothing stained with blood vomited by her upon poisoning, he killed two of Seongjong's concubines who were responsible and then ordered the execution of officials who supported Consort Yoon's death.  This event struck both the Hungu and the remnants of Sarim factions indiscriminately, including the instigators of the first purge.  At least 36 officials were executed (by drinking poison) and remains of eight deceased officials were mutilated.  The actual death toll was much greater because the victims' families and relatives were punished as well - male members being killed and the female members enslaved.  In the end, 239 officials were affected by the event with execution, exile, or dismissal. Yeonsangun was eventually deposed by the remaining Hungu officials, and his half-brother [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]] became the eleventh king of Joseon in 1506.

==Third Literati Purge of 1519==
[[File:jo gwang-jo.jpg|thumb|[[Jo Gwang-jo]]]]
The Third Literati Purge of 1519, also called Kimyo Sahwa or Gimyo Sahwa (기묘사화, 己卯士禍), is one of the most discussed literati purges in Joseon Dynasty because the [[Sarim]] faction held political power and was in the process of carrying out significant reforms at the time of their purge.

Jungjong worked to remove excesses of Yeonsangun and return to [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]]'s era, but his royal authority was limited due to powerful presence of coup leaders who put him on the throne.  Only when the three main leaders of coup died of old age and natural causes eight years later, Jungjong began to assert his authority and look for ways to restrain Hungu faction's power.  He soon found an answer in [[Jo Gwang-jo]], a young and energetic leader of the Sarim faction, who soon became Jungjong's most trusted official. He enjoyed such a complete confidence of Jungjong that Jungjong abandoned a planned war at the sole opposition by Jo. With Jungjong's support, Jo rose to become an Inspector General only four years after entering politics in a series of unprecedented promotions and brought in many like-minded, young Sarim scholars from rural provinces to Jungjong's court. Under his leadership, the Sarim faction pushed forth a series of reforms as they established local self-government system called [[Hyang'yak]], pursued land reforms to distribute land more equally and limit amount of land owned by the rich, promulgated Confucian beliefs widely among the public with vernacular translations, and sought to reduce the number of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://blog.chosun.com/blog.log.view.screen?blogId=42403&amp;menuId=155593&amp;listType=3&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;curPage=5&amp;logId=1920111] Yi Duk Il, "Seonbi Image Demanded by 21st Century," (in Korean)&lt;/ref&gt; Jo believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. (For instance, he met a nameless butcher/tanner of lowest class and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a government official.)  According to [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.jsp] Annals of Joseon Dynasty, October, 1520&lt;/ref&gt; no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace or local provinces during this time because of strict enforcement by Inspector General's Office.  He was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, "Our master is coming," according to famous Korean philosopher [[Yi I]].

However, these radical reforms generated fierce hostility and resistance of the Hungu faction. Jo also made many political enemies by impeaching many of the so-called heroes of 1506 coup.  Especially when Jo argued that many of the alleged contributors to 1506 coup did not actually contribute to the coup and revoked their special privileges (including tax exemptions and huge stipends), the Hungu faction began to plot Jo's downfall. In early 1519, there was a plot by some Hungu officials to assassinate Sarim officials, which was discovered in time.

==="Jo Will Become King"===
Jo's uncompromising character and his frequent remonstrations to Jungjong to support his radical programs also began to irritate the king.  Furthermore, Consort Gyeong of Park clan and Consort Hui of Hong clan (Hungu faction leader Hong Kyung-ju's daughter) sought to estrange Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo by often questioning Jo's loyalty and claiming that popular support was shifting to Jo. At the behest of Hong Kyung-ju, Minister of Rites Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, and other Hungu leaders, they told Jungjong that people were saying that it was actually Jo Gwang-jo who ruled the country and that people wanted to make him their king. Even if Jo was not disloyal, he would not be able to stop his supporters from doing so, they said.

According to [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], Nam Gon now set out to slander Jo and wrote a phrase "Ju cho will become the king" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王)" with honey or sugary water on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars left behind such phrase on leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, September 21, 1568&lt;/ref&gt; When two [[Hanja]] (Chinese) characters "ju"(走) and "cho"(肖) are put together, they form a new Hanja character "jo"(趙), which happens to be Jo Gwang-jo's family name. Consort Hong or Consort Park showed the leaf to Jungjong and claimed that this was the heaven's warning that Jo would take the throne himself after eliminating Hungu faction. Jungjong, who himself rose to the throne through a coup d'état, began to distrust Jo Gwang-jo.  [It should be noted that when [[Goryeo]] dynasty fell and was replaced by [[Joseon]] dynasty, there was popular saying "Son of wood will gain the country" (목자득국 木子得國). When two Hanja characters meaning wood(木) and son(子) are combined, they form a new character "yi"(李), which happens to be the family name of [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], who deposed the last king of Goryeo and founded Joseon dynasty.  These phrases helped Yi Seong-gye win popular support for the new dynasty as heaven's will.]

Now feeling certain that Jungjong was sufficiently estranged from Jo, Hong Kyung-ju secretly entered the palace to warn King Jungjong that the court was filled with Jo's supporters and that no one could dare oppose him openly. When Jo petitioned Jungjong to revoke special privileges of people who falsely contributed to 1506 coup, Jungjong's suspicion was further heightened.  Jungjong dispatched a secret letter to Hong Kyung-ju, expressing his fear that Jo Gwang-jo would next go on to question legitimacy of the coup and then turn against him.&lt;ref name="Annals, April 13, 1520"&gt;Annals, April 13, 1520&lt;/ref&gt; Jungjong instructed Hungu leaders to kill Jo Gwang-jo and then inform him. On November 15, 1519, Hungu leaders entered the palace secretly at night to bypass Royal Secretariat and present to the king written charges against Jo: he and his supporters deceived the king and put the state in disorder by forming a clique and abusing their positions to promote their supporters while excluding their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 15, 1519&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector Jo Gwang-jo, Justice Minister Kim Jung, and six others were immediately arrested, and they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial or even investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, December 21, 1544&lt;/ref&gt; The whole event had appearance of coup d'état except that it was sanctioned by the king.

==="What Is Their Crime?"===
They would have been immediately killed except that War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who arrested Sarim officials, entreated that ministers should be consulted for such decision. The cabinet meeting on the following day regarding Jo's fate is described in detail in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].  Most officials expressed their shock at Jo Gwang-jo's arrest and Jungjong's intention to execute him.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  They entreated that he may have been extreme in his youthful zeal to improve the country but could not possibly have private agenda. [[Yeonguijeong|Chief State Councillor]] Jeong Gwang-pil, who often clashed with Jo and was even approached by Nam Gon for support,&lt;ref&gt;Annals, January 16, 1535, No.4&lt;/ref&gt; entreated in tears: "I have frequently witnessed horrid calamities during the reign of deposed king ([[Yeonsangun]]), but how could I imagine to see such thing again even after meeting the wise king?"&lt;ref name="Annals, April 13, 1520"/&gt; Chief Council and Six Ministries jointly entreated that punishing Jo and others on such charge without evidence would be a blot on the king's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.20&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen younger officials requested to the king to imprison them with Jo Gwang-jo.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Hong Sook, who became Justice Minister overnight and interrogated Jo, reported to the king that he was "deeply moved" by Jo's loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.12&lt;/ref&gt;

New Inspector General Yu Eun protested in even stronger terms: "If Jo Gwang-jo is guilty of crime, he should be punished in open and just manner ... Instead, Your Majesty is handing out such punishment after secret words by two people in the middle of night... What is so difficult about punishing few [[seonbi]]s with authority of king that Your Majesty should do so secretly by sending a secret message?... If there is a crime, it should be dealt with clearly and justly, but Your Majesty appeared to trust and be friendly with your subjects on the outside while thinking of eliminating them in mind."&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 18, 1519&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, 150 [[Seonggyungwan]] students stormed the palace to protest Jo's arrest and filled the palace with shouts of entreaties,&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.13&lt;/ref&gt;  and later 240 students petitioned to claim Jo's innocence and requested to be imprisoned together.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 17, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  Such outpouring in Jo's support may have increased Jungjong's suspicion and anger.  Later Chief State Councillor Jeong, Deputy State Councillor Ahn Dang and even War Minister Yi Jang-gon were removed from office for opposing Jo's execution.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000370918], Reformer Jo Kwang-jo (in Korean)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purge of Sarim Scholars===
Jo Gwang-jo was completely caught off guard by the turn of the event.  The Sarim faction had scored its biggest victory just four days earlier when Jungjong granted their petition to revoke special status for 70 Hungu officials. He continued to believe that Jungjong was misled by wicked Hungu ministers and was confident that he could persuade the king of his loyalty once he could face him in the interrogation.  He wrote to Jungjong of his fear of this incident becoming a bloody purge and entreated that he would not regret dying ten thousand times if only he could be granted an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1915, No.11&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he would never have a chance to see Jungjong again.  Amid petitions for leniency, Jungjong commuted the death sentence to exile, and Jo Gwang-jo was exiled to Neung-ju. But less than a month later, Jungjong fired many ministers who entreated on Jo's behalf and reinstated Jo's death sentence by poison.  Before drinking poison, Jo wrote a [[death poem]] declaring his loyalty and bowed four times toward the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, December 16, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  Later when there was a severe drought in the country, people believed that it was heaven's punishment for killing an innocent [[seonbi]].

Kim Jung and three others were executed as well in 1520, and dozens of Sarim scholars were exiled. Many others left the central government in protest and retreated to rural provinces. In 1521, Ahn Dang's son allegedly plotted to assassinate Nam Gon and Shim Jung, for which a dozen people including Ahn Dang were executed. In all, 225 officials were affected by the purge. Most of Jo's reforms were rescinded with his fall. 
In the end, Jungjong abruptly abandoned his reformist agenda because he either lost confidence in Jo Gwango-jo's programs or feared that he would become too powerful in the future. While Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo shared the reformist agenda, Jungjong was also chiefly interested in solidifying royal authority whereas the latter was more concerned with neo-Confucian ideology, in which the king must be governed and restricted by teachings of [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]].

The Third Literati Purge of 1519 was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to fulfill ideal neo-Confucian society by later generations because Joseon politics soon degenerated into power struggle among in-laws and relatives of the royal family.  Later its victims, called Gimyo [[Sarim]] or "Wise men of Gimyo," were venerated as Confucian martyrs while instigators became symbols of wickedness for many generations (For instance, fermented fish of lowest quality is still called ''Gonjangyi'', combined word from Nam Gon and Shim Jung's given names).  Nam Gon, one of main instigators who fabricated the conspiracy, regretted his role in the purge late in his life and willed that all his writings be burnt.  No writing of his remains except for one short poem although he was a famous writer.

==Fourth Literati Purge of 1545==
When Jungjong died in 1544 and the crown prince [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]] became the twelfth king, Sarim's hopes proved to be true.  He appointed [[Yi Eonjeok]] and other famous Sarim scholars to high positions and rehabilitated Jo Gwang-jo and other purge victims.  Unfortunately for the Sarim faction, Injong's reign was also to be the shortest of Joseon kings. When Injong died eight months later and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]] became the thirteenth king of Joseon at the age of twelve, his mother [[Queen Munjeong]] became the regent and her brother Yoon Won Hyung wielded enormous power.  (Many in the Sarim faction believed that Injong was poisoned by Queen Munjeong, but there is no evidence that this was the case.)  Lesser Yoon faction was not persecuted by Greater Yoon faction during Injong's reign, but Injong dismissed Yoon Won-hyung and Yoon Won-ro from their positions after they were impeached by the Greater Yoon faction. Now that he was reinstated, Yoon Wong-hyung accused Yoon Im and his supporters of plotting to put another prince instead of Myeongjong on the throne after Injong's death.  This ploy at first backfired and led to his exile, but continued accusations and rumors of Yoon Im's treason led to the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, in which the prince, Yoon Im, and nine of his supporters including Sarim scholars were executed.  After this initial purge, Yoon Won-hyung continued to purge his rivals and Sarim scholars over next five years until the total death toll surpassed one hundred and many others including [[Yi Eonjeok]] were exiled.  Yoon Won-hyung even killed his older brother Yoon Won-ro in the ensuing power struggle. After Queen Munjeong's death in 1565, Myeongjong exiled Yoon Won-hyung, who died or committed suicide the same year, and attempted to govern well by recruiting talented people but died two years later.  Along with Kim Anro, Yoon Won-hyung is considered one of the worst politicians of Joseon dynasty.

===Power Struggle of In-laws===
Unlike other literati purges, the Fourth Literati Purge pf 1545, or Ulsa Sahwa (을사사화, 乙巳士禍), was largely a result of power struggle between relatives of the competing princes.  After Jo Gwang-jo's fall, Nam Gon and Shim Jung's faction and Kim Anro's faction vied for power after Kim Anro's son married Jungjong's eldest daughter. Kim Anro was exiled by Nam Gon and Shim Jung for abusing power, but he returned from exile after Nam Gon's death and successfully drove out Shim Jung, who was accused of accepting bribes from Consort Park to help her put her son on the throne instead of crown prince. Later he framed Shim Jung and Consort Park on the charge of cursing the crown prince (A dead rat whose mouth, eyes, and ears were burnt with hot iron to make it look like a pig was discovered hanging from a tree in the crown prince's palace on his birthday. There also phrases cursing the crown prince, whose [[Chinese zodiac]] sign was [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]. Consort Park was suspected for she was already known to be plotting to put her son on the throne instead.  It was later found out to be Kim Anro's doing after his fall.)  Consort Park, her son Prince Buksong, and Shim Jung were executed. Kim Anro now unleashed the reign of terror against his political enemies in the name of protecting the crown prince. He even attempted to depose [[Queen Munjeong]], who gave birth to a son who was later to become [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]], but this led to his downfall and execution in 1537.

After Kim Anro's fall, the crown prince [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]]'s maternal uncle Yoon Im and Queen Munjeong's brothers Yoon Won-ro and Yoon Won-hyung filled the power vacuum. (Yoon Im and Yoon Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yoon Im's great-grandfather was older brother of Yoon Brothers' great-great-grandfather.)  Many officials gathered around the two centers of power and developed into separate political factions. Yoon Im's faction became known as ‘Greater Yoon’ and the Yoon brothers' faction as ‘Lesser Yoon.’  By then, Jungjong promoted Sarim scholars again by recalling them from exile and reappointing to court positions to restrain Hungu faction's power.  Many Sarim scholars joined the Greater Yoon since they had great hopes for the crown prince, who studied under Jo Gwang-jo and [[Yi Hwang]] and was greatly anticipated to become a benevolent ruler.

==Aftermath==
These four purges decimated the Sarim faction and again drove them to the rural villages, where they built schools (called [[seowon]]).  [[Yi Hwang]], for example, left politics in the aftermath of the Fourth Literati Purge and did not return to the court despite repeated summons by Myeongjong. Other famous philosophers Jo Shik, [[Seo Gyeong-deok]], and Seoung Soo-chim also turned away from politics after Jo Gwang-jo's death. Jo Shik turned down his appointment by writing to Myeongjong: "Under Your Majesty's reign, state of affairs has already gone awry and the foundation of the country has already collapsed.  Heaven's will has already left as did the support of people... The Queen Regent is thoughtful, but she is merely a widow deep inside palace, and Your Majesty is young and thus merely a lonely heir to the late king.  Therefore, how would one handle thousands of natural disasters and billion pieces of people's heart?"&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 19, 1555&lt;/ref&gt; (In [[Joseon Dynasty]], natural disasters were thought to occur due to king's fault.)

However, the Sarim continued to thrive in rural provinces through its [[seowon]]s and [[Hyang'yak]] system.  By the reign of [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]], successor to Myeongjong, the Sarim faction gained the control of the central government and dominated Joseon politics ever since.

==Modern reinterpretation==
The above account of literati purges is based on widely accepted traditional understanding of the subject, which largely stems from the Sarim faction's point of view.  The [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]] and much of what we know about these events were largely written by Sarim scholars even before they emerged as the eventual victor.  Some historians have tried to reinterpret the literati purges as a result of struggle between the Joseon kings who wanted to establish absolute monarchy and the arisocrats who claimed that the true loyalty to king was to guide him to become a benevolent Confucian philosopher-king by pointing out his mistakes if necessary.  The Sarim scholars tended to occupy key positions in [[Three Offices]], which put them in conflict with the king and high-ranking ministers.  In this view, the distinction between Sarim and Hungu factions are thought to be largely artificial, and division within aristocracy was largely along the family connections rather than philosophical differences.

==Other Purges==
Following the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, there were a series of other similar purges out of political struggle between different factions, but they are not called "literati purges," or ''sahwa'' (사화) in Korean, which specifically refers to persecution of Sarim scholars by the Hungu faction in late 15th and early 16th century.  The later purges are instead called with various names such as ''oksa'' (meaning treason case), ''muok''(false treason case), ''hwanguk'' (change of power), and ''bakhae'' (persecution, especially of those Catholic faith in the 19th century).   One notable example of the later purges is [[Treason Case of 1589]], or Gichuk Oksa, which is sometimes called the fifth literati purge even though both the instigators and victims were of Sarim faction.  In these later purges, the victimized faction would call the event "literati purge (sahwa)" to signify their innocence and the rival faction's wrongs.

*Oksa (Treason Case)
**Shinsa Muok (신사무옥) or False Treason Case of 1521 - Three years after the Third Literati Purge of 1519, Jo Gwang-jo's supporters were accused of plotting to assassinate Nam Gon and Shim Jeong and were executed. It is more often considered a part of Third Literati Purge (Jungjong).
**Gichuk Oksa (기축옥사) or [[Treason Case of 1589]] - the bloodiest purge in Joseon history, in which the Western faction purged the rival Eastern faction. 1,000 people were executed or exiled (Seonjo).
**Gyechuk Oksa (계축옥사) or Treason Case of 1613 - After [[Gwanghaegun]] rose to the throne, Greater Northern faction accused Lesser Northern faction of plotting to dethrone Gwanghaegun and make his half-brother the king.  (The excesses of Greater Northern faction led to the coup d'état in which the Westerners and Southerners placed [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] on the throne.)
**Shinyim Oksa (신임옥사) or Treason Cases of 1721 and 1722 - Leaders of Noron faction (split from Western faction) who supported Yeonyingun (later [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]]) advocated regency of Yeoningun in place of sickly [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|Gyeongjong]].  They were accused of disloyalty, and four of them were executed in 1721.  In 1722, Soron and Namin factions accused Noron faction of plotting to kill Gyeongjong, and eight leaders who had again advocated Yeonyingun's regency were executed.
**Eulhae Oksa (을해옥사) or Treason Case of 1755 - After Yeonyingun rose to the throne and became Yeongjo, Soron faction was driven out of power in reaction to Shinyim Oksa.  Five Soron members were accused of treason and were executed.
*Hwanguk (Turn of state) - Purges in [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]]'s reign is called hwanguk, meaning sudden change of government.  They marked the reemergence of earlier purges after a century of peaceful rivalry between Southern and Western factions.
**Gyeonshin Hwanguk (경신환국) or Turn of 1680 - Two leaders of Southern faction was accused of plotting to dethrone Sukjong by the Western faction (Sukjong).
**Gisa Hwanguk (기사환국) or Turn of 1689 - The Western faction fell out of power after opposing the naming of crown prince. [[Song Siyeol]] and others were executed. (Sukjong)
**Gaapsul Hwanguk (갑술환국) or Turn of 1694 - The Southern faction's attempt to purge Western faction on charge of plotting to reinstate deposed Queen Inhyeon backfires.  The Southern faction would never recover from this purge politically.  However, the Westerners already split into Noron and Soron factions. (Sukjong)
**Shinchuk Hwanguk (신축환국) or Turn of 1721 - Noron faction loses power in the aftermath of Shinyim Oksa. (Gyeongjong)
**Eulsa Hwanguk (을사환국) or Turn of 1725 - Yeongjo becomes the king, and Noron faction regains power.
**Jeongmi Hwanguk (정미환국) or Turn of 1727 - Yeongjo replaces hardliners with moderates from both Noron and Soron faction.
*Bakhae (Persecution) - They were also called ''Saok''(사옥), meaning "Heresy Case".
**Sinhae Bakhae (신해박해) or Persecution of 1781 - First persecution of Catholicism in Korea.  Noron's Byeokpa faction advocated persecution while Shipa faction opposed it.  Two Catholics were executed, but persecution was limited after [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] adopted Shipa faction's policy.
**[[Catholic Persecution of 1801|Shinyu Bakhae]] (신유박해) or Persecution of 1801 - After Jeongjo's death, [[Queen Jeongsun]] and conservative Byoekpa faction reversed many of Jeongjo's reforms and carried out the worst persecution of the Joseon Catholics, which was also aimed at the purge of liberal Shipa and Southern factions, some of whose leaders including [[Jeong Yak-yong]] were Catholics or had Catholic relatives.  300 people were executed, and Jeong Yak-yong was exiled. ([[Sunjo of Joseon|Sunjo]])
**Gihae Bakhae (기해박해) or Persecution of 1839 - There was no persecution while Shipa was in power, but Byeoka regained power and resumed the persecution of Catholics by executing 119 people. ([[Heonjong of Joseon|Heonjong]])

==Depictions in Korean mass media==
The Korean literati purges are frequently depicted in Korean television dramas and movies.  In [[Dae Jang Geum]], main protagonist Jang Guem's father is a victim of the second literati purge.  Jang Geum herself and her mentor Lady Han are framed in connection with the third literati purge while the male protagonist Min Jung Ho is portrayed as a follower of Jo Gwang-jo. In television drama [[Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin]] (2004-5), [[Yi Sun-shin]]'s grandfather is depicted as a victim of third literati purge and Yi's father is arrested while paying respect to Jo Gwang-jo's spirit at Jo's abandoned house.  the second literati purge is dramatized through the movie, "The Treacherous" (2015). The third and fourth literati purges also constitute main plot lines of the 2001 television drama "[[Ladies of the Palace]]".  The first and second literati purges are depicted in television dramas "[[King and Queen (TV series)|King and Queen]]" (1998–2000) "[[The King and I (TV series)|The King and I]]" (2007–2008), "[[Queen Insoo]] " (2011) " and 2005 film [[The King and the Clown]].

'''[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]])''' persons in the '''[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]''' may face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Same-sex sexual activity is legal.

==Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity==
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Age of consent is equal, regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="ILGA"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Sponsored Homophobia 2016: A world survey of sexual orientation laws: criminalisation, protection and recognition|url=http://ilga.org/downloads/02_ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2016_ENG_WEB_150516.pdf|work=[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]]|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual acts have never been explicitly outlawed in the country's history. Before the foundation of the state in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was ruled by the European colonial power Belgium. In Belgium, homosexual acts were decriminalized in 1794.

Although same-sex sexual activity is legal, the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2010 Human Rights Report found that "individuals engaging in public displays of homosexuality were subject to prosecution under public decency provisions in the penal code and articles in the 2006 law on sexual violence."&lt;ref name="DRC"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160453.pdf DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
There is no legal recognition of same-sex unions. The first paragraph of article 40, in the current [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese constitution]], states that "Every individual has the right to marry the person of their choice, of the opposite sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.presidentrdc.cd/constitution.html Constitution de la République Démocratique du Congo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812032926/http://www.presidentrdc.cd/constitution.html |date=12 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination protections==
There is no anti-discrimination law protecting [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="DRC"/&gt;

==Living conditions==

The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2010 Human Rights Report found that "homosexuality remained a cultural taboo, and while harassment by state security forces continued, there were no reports during the year of police harassing gays and lesbians or perpetrating or condoning violence against them."&lt;ref name="DRC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2752">The '''''loi Carrez''''', or Carrez law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexinter.net/lois/loi_du_18_decembre_1996_(loi_carrez).htm Loi n°96-1107 du 18 décembre 1996] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[French law]] enacted on 18 December 1996 which obliges the vendor of a [[real property|property]] [[lot (real estate)|lot]] (or fraction of a lot) in a [[condominium]] to specifically mention the surface area in all documents relating to the property sold. It is named after its author [[Gilles Carrez]], the then [[Rally for the Republic|RPR]] member of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] for the [[Val-de-Marne's 5th constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gillescarrez.fr/quest-ce-que-la-loi-carrez/ "La Loi Carrez"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810232650/http://www.gillescarrez.fr/quest-ce-que-la-loi-carrez/ |date=2011-08-10 }}, Gilles Carrez's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not apply to sales of property not yet constructed, which comes under the building code,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexinter.net/patrimoine/chapitre_i_vente_d'immeubles_a_construire.htm article R 261-13 of the Building Code] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor to construction land.

== Calculation of floor area ==

The effective usable surface area, known as the "''superficie Carrez''", is the total enclosed floor area of an apartment or other construction discounting walls, partitions, staircases and stairwells, piping and electricity conduits and ducting, window and door [[embrasure]]s. Parts of the enclosed area which are of less than {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} in height are also excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexinter.net/JPTXT/loi_carrez.htm Amendment to the loi Carrez by Article 4-1 of the decree of 23 mai 1997] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lots, or fractions of lots of surface areas of less than {{convert|8|m2|ft2}} are also excluded from the  calculation of habitable surface area.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4-2 of the decree of 23 mai 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, maid's rooms (''chambre de bonne'') would fall into this category.

Cellars, garages, parking places, and other  storage facilities sold as separate lots are also excluded.

== Redress ==

* If the floor area is not indicated in the legal sale contract of the property,  the buyer may [[void (law)|void]] the contract within one month of signing the contract.
* If the floor area is overstated by more than 5% in the sale contract, the buyer has the right, within one year, to demand a price reduction in proportion to the extent of overstatement.
* If the floor area is understated, the seller has no recourse.&lt;ref&gt;Article 46 of the law n° 65-557 of 10 July 1965, as modified by the loi Carrez&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melvin Lawrence Ember''' (January 13, 1933 – September 27, 2009) was an [[Americans|American]] cultural anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher with wide-ranging interests who combined an active research career with writing for nonprofessionals.

== Biography ==
Drawn to anthropology after reading the works of [[Margaret Mead]], he attended [[Columbia University]] at the young age of 16 where he was further inspired by [[Elman Service]] and [[Morton Fried]] in the anthropology department (B.A. 1953).  He then went on to [[Yale University]] to study for his Ph.D. in anthropology (received 1958), primarily under the mentorship of [[George Peter Murdock]].

After a year’s postdoctoral work at Yale, Ember spent four years at the Laboratory of Socio-Environmental Studies at the [[National Institute of Health]] (1959–62). He was professor at [[Antioch College]] (1963–67) and [[Hunter College]] (1967–87). He also chaired the department of anthropology at Hunter College of the [[City University of New York]] (1967–73). Here he succeeded in expanding the department significantly, attracting young scholars from major institutions.  He also served as executive officer of the City University of New York graduate program in anthropology from 1973 to 1975.

He was president of the [[Society for Cross-Cultural Research]] in 1981–82 and in 1982 took over the editorship of [[Cross-Cultural Research]], a position he held until the time of his death. He moved to the New Haven area in 1987 to become president of the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), an institution at Yale whose mission is to foster the comparative study of culture. Under his leadership, he helped revitalize the institution, moving its databases into the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Otterbein, "Melvin Lawrence Ember (1933–2009)", ''American Anthropologist'', Volume 112, Issue 4, pp. 697–700, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/hraf/mel_personal.htm HRAF information on Melvin Ember.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== Fieldwork ===
In contrast to most cultural anthropologists at the time, who conducted their fieldwork in a single community, Ember's fieldwork in American Samoa was explicitly comparative, using community variation to test theories about culture change.  He chose three communities differing in distance from the commercial center to evaluate how commercial involvement affected political change.

His assessment of Samoan kinship was subsequently challenged by [[Derek Freeman]], long before the now-famous [[Mead–Freeman controversy]] about Samoa. Because Ember knew, from his cross-community comparisons, that there was substantial variation within American Samoa, he questioned how Freeman, working in a very different time and in Western Samoa, could doubt Mead’s veracity.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Ember, "Evidence and Science in Ethnography: Reflections on the Freeman-Mead Controversy", ''American Anthropologist'', Volume 87, pp. 906-910, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Institute of Mental Health ===
At the National Institute of Mental Health Embler worked on the universality of the familial incest taboo. Since all societies prohibit familial incest, he decided to focus on cross-cultural variation in [[cousin marriage]] to try to understand why some societies allowed close cousin marriages while others forbade it.

After evaluating the various explanatory hypotheses of the time, his own empirical research confirmed that much of the variation in cousin marriage could best be explained as an adaptation to the harmful effects of inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Ember, "On the Origin and Extension of the Incest Taboo," ''Behavior Science Research'', Volume 10, pp. 249-81, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cross-cultural work ===
As a professor at [[Antioch College]] and [[Hunter College]] Ember continued his cross-cultural work on aspects of kinship and social organization, picking up first on topics that Murdock was unable to explain, such as variation in post-marital residence and unilineal descent.  Traditional theories had focused on economic factors, such as which gender contributed most to the economy, but finding these explanations lacking in predictive value, Ember began to explore other possibilities, particularly the effects of warfare in the social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Ember and Carol R. Ember, ''Marriage, Family, and Kinship'' (New Haven: HRAF Press, 1983), {{ISBN|978-0875361147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because warfare seemed so central in explaining various aspects of social organization, he then turned to research that tested ideas about why societies varied in type and frequency of violence, looking at variation in warfare frequency, homicide, and corporal punishment of children in the anthropological record.&lt;ref&gt;Carol R. Ember and Melvin Ember, "Resource Unpredictability, Mistrust, and War: A Cross-Cultural Study," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' Volume 36, pp. 242-262, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that laws about human nature should hold true among technological complex as well as simpler societies, he persuaded political scientist [[Bruce Russett]] to join him and his wife [[Carol R. Ember]] in a project to test the theory that “democracies do not fight each other”.&lt;ref&gt;Carol R. Ember, Melvin Ember and Bruce Russett, "Peace Between Participatory Polities: A Cross-Cultural Test of the 'Democracies Rarely Fight Each Other' Hypothesis", ''World Politics'', Volume 44, Issue 4, pp. 573-599, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concepts of democracy and international war had to be transformed to fit the anthropological record, the results of their collaborative research were consistent with many studies conducted by political scientists. Ember later worked with cross-cultural psychologists to explore the relationships between aggression and war.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall H. Segall, Carol R. Ember, and Melvin Ember, "Aggression, Crime, and Warfare," in ''Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology, Vol. 3: Social Behavior and Applications, Second Edition'', J. W. Berry, M. H. Segall, and C. Kagitcibasi, eds, pp. 213-254 (Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997), {{ISBN|978-0205160761}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interdisciplinary research ===
Branching out into diverse and interdisciplinary research areas was not unusual for Ember. Indeed, he published scholarly articles in archaeology, linguistics, biological anthropology, and even ethology.  He fervently believed that the work of different anthropologists in far-flung places and across time could be used to test theories about why cultures varied or were similar and he devoted most of his research career to systematically testing explanations, rather than just expounding them.

His passion for systematic comparative research on challenging questions in all areas of anthropology influenced a generation of younger scholars through his direction of the first Summer Institute for Cross-Cultural Research in 1964, his active participation in NSF-funded Summer Institutes in Comparative Research between 1991 and 1999, and through the series of publications in comparative methods that resulted from these Institutes.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Peregrine, "The Continuing Legacy of Melvin Ember (1933–2009)", ''Cross-Cultural Research'', Volume 45, Issue 1, pp. 3-10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publications ===
Ember is widely known as the co-author of two major textbooks, ''Anthropology'' (with Carol R. Ember and [[Peter N. Peregrine]], Prentice-Hall), and ''Cultural Anthropology'' (with Carol R. Ember, Prentice-Hall), first published in 1973 and now in their 13th edition (2011). He was also editor or co-editor of eight encyclopedias.

'''MinID''' is an [[:wikt:electronic|electronic]] login system used to secure a range of [[internet]] services in the [[Norway|Norwegian]] public sector. The communication done with MinID is encrypted to secure information from unauthorized usage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.difi.no/elektronisk-id/minid/security-and-privacy&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone registered in the [[Norwegian Population Register]] over the age of 13 years can create a public ID with MinID.

As of April 2010, more than 2 million people living in [[Norway]] had created user accounts with MinID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minid.difi.no/minid/minid.php?lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201174956/http://minid.difi.no/minid/minid.php?lang=en |archivedate=2009-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a public ID, PIN-codes from the Norwegian Tax Administration are needed.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of MinID is to communicate an electronic identity, so that users are authorized to use electronic services, in a secure way. MinID has a user database where social security numbers and PIN-codes are saved. MinID can be used to access more than 50 online services from various Norwegian public agencies, including the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration]], the Directorate of Taxes and the [[Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund|State Educational Loan]].

== Controller ==

The Agency for Public Management and e-Government (Difi) is the controller of the personal data handled by MinID. The Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (Norwegian: Direktoratet for forvaltning og informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologi) or Difi is a government agency subordinate to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Government Administration and Reform]]. It is responsible for help the public sector achieve quality, efficiency, user friendliness, openness and participation, as well as helping the public sector be organized and led in a good way with good intersectoral cooperation.

== User profile ==

Users of MinID have a user profile that contains their [[mobile phone]] number and/or [[e-mail]] address. This data is used to administrate MinID use. The e-mail address is needed in order to send the user a temporary password if he or she forgets the password. The phone number is needed in order to send an SMS-code at log in or a temporary password if the user forgets the password.

== Transparency, correction and deletion ==

According to the law users can claim full access of the handling of their own personal data. Users also have the right to information about how this data are handled and saved, and how they can correct or delete inaccurate data. Users can at any time choose to delete themselves as a user of MinID. The user profile will then be deleted from the MinID user database.

== Extradition to others ==

MinID passes on the user's social security number and chosen language to the public services he or she logs on to, so that the user can go to other public services without a new login.

The [[President of India]] is the ceremonial [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces of the country. The Ministry of Defence provides policy framework and resources to the armed forces to discharge their responsibility in the context of the defence of the country. The [[Indian Armed Forces]] (including [[Indian Army]], [[Indian Air Force]], [[Indian Navy]]) and [[Indian Coast Guard]] under the Ministry of Defences are primarily responsible for ensuring the territorial integrity of the nation.

At present, the undergoing new creation of [[Indian National Defence University|National Defence University]], for training of military officials and concerned civilian officials, will be administered and overseen by Ministry of Defence. The ministry organises and runs [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day celebrations]] and [[Delhi Republic Day parade|parade]] every year in January, hosting a [[Republic Day (India)#Republic Day parade chief guest|chief guest]].

==History==
===Origin===
A military department was created by the supreme government of the [[British East India Company]] at [[Kolkata]] in the year 1776.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its main function was to co-ordinate and record orders, relating to the army, issued by various departments of the government of the East India Company. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the Public Department and maintained a list of army personnel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Charter Act 1833]] the Secretariat of the Government of the East India Company was reorganised into four departments, each headed by a secretary to the Government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The armies in the presidencies of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] and [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] functioned as the respective [[presidency armies]] until April 1895, when the presidency armies were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands: [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] (including the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|North West Frontier]]), [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] (including [[Burma]]), [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] and [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] (including [[Sindh|Sind]], [[Quetta]] and [[Aden]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The supreme authority over the Indian Army was vested in the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General-in-Council]], subject to the control of [[the Crown]], which was exercised by the [[Secretary of State for India]]. Two members in the Council were responsible for military affairs. One was the Military Member, who supervised all administrative and financial matters. The other was the commander-in-chief who was responsible for all operational matters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Military Department was abolished in March 1906 and was replaced by two separate departments; the Army Department and the Military Supply Department. In April 1909 the Military Supply Department was abolished and its functions were taken over by the Army Department. The Army Department was redesignated as the Defence Department in January 1938. The Department of Defence became the Ministry of Defence under a cabinet minister in August 1947.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The functions of MoD which in 1947 was mainly logistic support to the armed forces, has undergone far reaching changes. In November 1962, following the 1962 war, a Department of Defence Production was set-up to deal with research, development and production of defence equipment. In November 1965, the Department of Defence Supplies was created for planning and execution of schemes for import substitution of requirements for defence purposes. These two Departments were later merged to form the Department of Defence Production and Supplies.

In 1980, the Department of Defence Research and Development was created. In January 2004, the Department of Defence Production and Supplies was renamed the Department of Defence Production. A Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister was appointed to advise on scientific aspects of military equipment and the research and design of defence forces equipment. The [[Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare|Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare]] was created in 2004.

The '''National Forum''' ({{lang-ka|ეროვნული ფორუმი}}, ''erovnuli p'orumi'') is a political party in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] established on December 15, 2006 by the former diplomat [[Kakha Shartava]]. He is the son of [[Zhiuli Shartava]], a Georgian politician in [[Abkhazia]], killed by the Abkhaz militias during the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|secessionist war]] in the region in 1993. Several veteran politicians such as [[Revaz Shavishvili]], [[Irakli Melashvili]] and [[Gubaz Sanikidze]] also joined the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14304 New Opposition Party Established.] ''Civil Georgia''. December 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
Party political council of the organizational members are: Kakhaber Shartava, Gubaz Sanikidze, Revaz Shavishvili, Irakli Melashvili, Nodar Javakhishvili and Irakli Gobejishvili. A leading Party member was economic expert Niko Orvelashvili  who died on 15 January 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
The party advocates a [[parliamentary republic]] as a form of government in Georgia. Unlike most other Georgian political parties, it does not support Georgia’s aspiration to join [[NATO]], and argues Georgia should be a "neutral country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=3358 Tbilisi Sees Russia's Hands behind Anti-NATO Campaign in Georgia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174358/http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=3358 |date=2011-07-22 }} ''The Georgian Times''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23292">[[Image:New Windsor Cantonment.jpg|thumb|right|The reconstructed Temple at the [[New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site]], where the critical meeting took place on March 15, 1783]]
The '''Newburgh Conspiracy''' was what appeared to be a planned [[military coup]] by the [[Continental Army]] in March 1783, when the [[American Revolutionary War]] was at its end.  The conspiracy may have been instigated by members in the [[Congress of the Confederation]], who circulated an anonymous letter in the army camp at [[Newburgh, New York]] on March 10, 1783.  Soldiers were unhappy that they had not been paid for some time and unfunded [[pensions]] that had been promised. The letter suggested that they should take unspecified action against Congress to resolve the issue.  The letter was said to have been written by Major [[John Armstrong, Jr.|John Armstrong]], aide to General [[Horatio Gates]], although the authorship of its text and underlying ideas is a subject of historical debate.

Commander-in-Chief [[George Washington]] stopped any serious talk of rebellion when he successfully appealed on March 15 in an emotional address to his officers asking them to support the supremacy of Congress.  Not long afterward, Congress approved a compromise agreement it had previously rejected: it funded some of the pay arrears, and granted soldiers five years of full pay instead of a lifetime pension of [[half pay]].

The motivations of numerous actors in these events are the subject of debate.  Some historians allege that serious consideration was given within the army to some sort of ''[[coup d'état]]'', while others dispute the notion.  The exact motivations of congressmen involved in communications with army officers implicated in the events are similarly debated.

==Background==
After the British loss at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, the [[American Revolutionary War]] died down in North America, and peace talks began between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and American diplomats.  The American [[Continental Army]], based at [[Newburgh, New York]], monitored British-occupied [[New York City]].  With the end of the war and dissolution of the Continental Army approaching, soldiers who had long been unpaid feared that the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] would not meet previous promises concerning back pay and pensions.

[[Image:AlexanderMcdougall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General [[Alexander McDougall]]]]
Congress had in 1780 promised Continental officers a lifetime pension of half their pay when they were discharged.&lt;ref name=Kohn189&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 189&lt;/ref&gt;  Financier [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] had in early 1782 stopped army pay as a cost-saving measure, arguing that when the war finally ended the arrears would be made up.&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye, p 288&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout 1782 these issues were a regular topic of debate in Congress and in the army camp at Newburgh, and numerous memos and petitions by individual soldiers had failed to significantly affect Congressional debate on the subject.&lt;ref name=Kohn190&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 190&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of officers organized under the leadership of General [[Henry Knox]] and drafted a memorandum to Congress.  Signed by enough general officers that it could not be readily dismissed as the work of a few malcontents,&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye, pp 332–333&lt;/ref&gt; the memo was delivered to Congress by a delegation consisting of General [[Alexander McDougall]] and Colonels [[John Brooks (governor)|John Brooks]] and [[Matthias Ogden]] in late December 1782. It expressed unhappiness over pay that was months in arrears, and concern over the possibility that the half pay pension would not be forthcoming.  In the memo they offered to accept a lump sum payment instead of the lifetime half pay pension.  It also contained the vague threat that "any further experiments on their [the army's] patience may have fatal effects."&lt;ref name=Kohn189/&gt;  The seriousness of the situation was also communicated to Congress by [[United States Secretary at War|Secretary at War]] [[Benjamin Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=Kohn190/&gt;

==Actions of Congress==
Congress was politically divided on the subject of finance.  The treasury was empty, and Congress lacked the power to compel the states to provide the necessary funds for meeting its obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp 250–252, 262&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]] to allow Congress to impose an [[import tariff]] known as an "impost" was decisively defeated by the states in November 1782,&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 191&lt;/ref&gt; and some states had enacted legislation forbidding their representatives from supporting any sort of lifetime pension.&lt;ref name=Kohn195&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 195&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the "nationalist" faction in Congress who had supported the tax proposal (including Robert Morris, [[Gouverneur Morris]], [[James Madison]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]]) believed that the army funding issues could be used as a lever to gain for Congress the ability to raise its own revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', pp 191–193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RobertAndGouverneurMorris.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gouverneur Morris]] (left) and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] (right), portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1783]]
The army delegation first met with Robert Morris and other nationalists.  The politicians convinced McDougall that it was imperative for the army to remain cooperative while they sought funding.  The hope they expressed was to tie the army's demands to those of the government's other creditors to force opposing Congressmen to act.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 192&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6 Congress established a committee to address the army's memo.  It first met with Robert Morris, who stated that there were no funds to meet the army's demands, and that loans for government operations would require evidence of a revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', pp 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;  When it met with McDougall on January 13, the general painted a stark picture of the discontent at Newburgh;  Colonel Brooks opined that "a disappointment might throw [the army] into blind extremities."&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 194&lt;/ref&gt;  When Congress met on January 22 to debate the committee's report, Robert Morris shocked the body by tendering his resignation, heightening tension.&lt;ref name=Kohn195/&gt;  The Congressional leadership immediately moved to keep Morris's resignation secret.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate on a funding scheme turned in part on the issue of the pension.  Twice the nationalists urged the body to adopt a commuted pension scheme (one that would end after a fixed time, rather than lifetime), but it was rejected both times.  After the second rejection on February 4, a plot to further raise tensions began to take shape.  Four days later, Colonel Brooks was dispatched back to Newburgh with instructions to gain the army leadership's agreement with the proposed nationalist plan.  The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes.  On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym ''[[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|  Brutus]]'') to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid.  He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should "not lose a moment preparing for events."&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 196&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use the specter of a recalcitrant army's refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists.  The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington's leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General [[Horatio Gates]], a longtime Washington rival.  These officers, Kohn believes, could be used by the nationalists to stage something that resembled a coup if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', pp 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gilbert Stuart, Govenor John Brooks, c. 1820, HAA.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Colonel [[John Brooks (governor)|John Brooks]], 1820 portrait by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]
The arrival on February 13 of rumors that a preliminary peace agreement had been reached in [[Paris]] heightened the sense of urgency among the nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 201&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander Hamilton wrote a letter to General Washington the same day, essentially warning him of the possibility of impending unrest among the ranks, and urging him to "''take the direction''" of the army's anger.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 202&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington responded that he sympathized both with the plight of his officers and men and with those in Congress, but that he would not use the army to threaten the civil government.  Washington believed such a course of action would violate the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] for which they had all been fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p 266&lt;/ref&gt;  It was unclear to the Congressional nationalists whether Knox, who had been a regular supporter of army protests to Congress, would play a role in any sort of staged action.  In letters written February 21, Knox unambiguously indicated he would play no such part, expressing the hope that the army's force would only be used against "the Enemies of the liberties in America."&lt;ref name=Kohn203&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 203&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25 and 26 there was a flurry of activity in Philadelphia, which may have been occasioned by the arrival of Knox's letters.  The nationalists had had little success in advancing their program through Congress, and continued to use rhetoric repeating concerns over the army's stability.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 204&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 8 Pennsylvania Colonel [[Walter Stewart (general)|Walter Stewart]] arrived at Newburgh.&lt;ref name=Kohn206/&gt;  Stewart was known to Robert Morris; the two had previous dealings when Stewart proposed coordinating activities of private creditors of the government,&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye, p 302&lt;/ref&gt; and he was aware of the poor state of affairs in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p 267&lt;/ref&gt;  His movement to Newburgh had been ordered by Washington (he was returning to duty after recovering from an illness) and would not necessarily draw notice.  Although his movements at camp are not known in detail, it appears likely that he met with General Gates not long after his arrival.  Within hours rumors began flying around the Newburgh camp that the army would refuse to disband until its demands were met.&lt;ref name=Kohn206&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call for meeting==
On the morning of March 10 an unsigned letter began circulating in the army camp.  Later acknowledged to be written by Major [[John Armstrong, Jr.]], aide to General Gates, the letter decried the army's condition and the lack of Congressional support, and called upon the army to send Congress an ultimatum.  Published at the same time was an anonymous call for a meeting of all field officers for 11 a.m. the next day.&lt;ref name=Kohn206/&gt;

[[File:Newburgh Address.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Newburgh Address.]] 
Washington reacted with dispatch.  On the morning of the 11th in his general orders he objected to the "disorderly" and "irregular" nature of the anonymously called meeting, and announced that there would be a meeting of officers on the 15th instead.  This meeting, he said, would be presided over by the senior officer present, and Washington requested a report of the meeting, implying that he would not attend.  On the morning of the 12th a second unsigned letter appeared, claiming Washington's agreement to a meeting as an endorsement of the conspirators' position.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 208&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington, who had initially thought the first letter to be the work of individuals outside the camp (specifically citing Gouverneur Morris as a likely candidate), was compelled to admit this unlikely given the speed at which the second letter appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Skeen and Kohn, pp 286–287&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 15 meeting was held in the "New Building" or "Temple", a 40 by 70 foot (12 by 21 m) building at [[New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site|the camp]].&lt;!--{fact}--&gt;  After Gates opened the meeting, Washington entered the building to everyone's surprise.  He asked to speak to the officers, and the stunned Gates relinquished the floor.  Washington could tell by the faces of his officers, who had not been paid for quite some time, that they were quite angry and did not show the respect or deference as they had toward Washington in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington then gave a short but impassioned speech, now known as the [[wikisource:Newburgh address|Newburgh Address]], counseling patience.  His message was that they should oppose anyone "who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood."&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, ch 35 at note 56&lt;/ref&gt;  He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers.  He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: "Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p 271&lt;/ref&gt;  This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years.  Many of those present were moved to tears,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=John Rhodehamel |title=The American Revolution: Writings from the War of Independence |quote=There was something so natural, so unaffected, in this appeal, as rendered it superior to the most studied oratory; it forced its way to the heart, and you might see sensibility moisten every eye. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter.  He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty.  Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution.  Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed "unshaken confidence" in Congress, and "disdain" and "abhorrence" for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week.&lt;ref name=Kohn211&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 211&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters.&lt;ref name=Kohn211/&gt;  The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel [[Timothy Pickering]], who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.&lt;ref name="Fleming, p 272"&gt;Fleming, p 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
General Washington had sent copies of the anonymous addresses to Congress.  This "alarming intelligence" (as James Madison termed it) arrived while Congress was debating the pension issues.&lt;ref name="Fleming, p 272"/&gt;  Nationalist leaders orchestrated the creation of a committee to respond to the news, which was deliberately populated with members opposed to any sort of pension payment.  The pressure worked on Connecticut representative [[Eliphalet Dyer]], one of the committee members, and he proposed approval of a lump sum payment on March 20.  The final agreement was for a five years' full pay instead of the lifetime half pay pension scheme originally promised.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;  They received government bonds which at the time were highly speculative, but were in fact redeemed 100 cents on the dollar (i.e., at full value) by the new government in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword'', p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John Armstrong Jr Rembrandt Peale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Armstrong, Jr.|John Armstrong]], the author of the Newburgh letters]]
The soldiers continued to grumble, with the unrest spreading to the noncommissioned officers (sergeants and corporals). Riots occurred and mutiny threatened.  Washington rejected suggestions that the army stay in operation until the states found the money for the pay. On April 19, 1783, his General Orders of the day announced the end of hostilities against Great Britain.  Congress thereafter ordered him to disband the army, since everyone agreed that a large army of 10,000 men was no longer needed, and the men were eager to go home. Congress gave each soldier three months pay, but since they had no funds Robert Morris issued $800,000 in personal notes to the soldiers.  Many soldiers sold these notes to speculators, some even before they left camp, in order to be able to make their way home.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p 288&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next several months, much of the Continental Army was furloughed, although many of the rank and file realized it was effectively a disbandment. The army was formally disbanded in November 1783, leaving only a small force at West Point and several scattered frontier outposts.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Jensen, ''The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation 1781–1789'' (1950) pp 54–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Discontent related to pay had resurfaced in Philadelphia in June 1783.  Due in part to a critical miscommunication, troops in eastern Pennsylvania were led to believe that they would be discharged even before Morris' promissory notes would be distributed, and they [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|marched to the city in protest]].  Pennsylvania President [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] refused to call out the militia (reasoning they might actually support the mutineers), and Congress decided to relocate to [[Princeton, New Jersey]].  There is circumstantial evidence that several participants in the Newburgh affair (notably Walter Stewart, John Armstrong, and Gouverneur Morris) may have played a role in this uprising as well.

The main long-term result of the Newburgh affair was a strong reaffirmation of the principle of civilian control of the military, and banishing any possibility of a coup as outside the realm of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]].  It also validated Washington's stature as a leading proponent of civilian control.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword'' pp 34–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical analysis==
Historian Richard Kohn writes that a number of key details about the individuals and their motivations are not known, and probably never will be.  For example, it is unclear exactly how much Colonels Brooks and Stewart, the principal messengers in the affair, knew.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Inside History'', p 220&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of the Gates group has been the subject of some debate: Kohn argues that they were intent on organizing some form of direct action (although he disclaims the idea that this would necessarily take the form of a traditional ''[[coup d'état]]''), while historian Paul David Nelson claims Kohn's thesis is circumstantial and poorly supported by primary materials.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Kohn, pp 145–150&lt;/ref&gt; A letter written by General Gates in June 1783 illustrates the disagreement: in the letter Gates writes that the purpose of the events was to pressure Congress.  Kohn argues that Gates is writing after the fact to cover his tracks, while Nelson claims Gates is giving a candid account of the affair.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Kohn, pp 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian C. Edward Skeen writes that Kohn's case is weak because it relies heavily on interpretation of written statements and is not well supported by the actions of the alleged conspirators.  He notes, for example, that there is ample evidence suggesting mutinous sentiments were not obviously circulating in the Newburgh camp between the arrivals of Brooks and Stewart;&lt;ref&gt;Skeen and Kohn, p 279&lt;/ref&gt;  Kohn counters that the relative quiet in camp masked significant undercurrents of unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Skeen and Kohn, p 292&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cobb (Massachusetts)|David Cobb]], who served on Washington's staff during the affair, wrote in 1825, "I have ever considered that the United States are indebted for their republican form of government solely to the firm and determined republicanism of George Washington at this time."&lt;ref name=Skeen288&gt;Skeen and Kohn, p 288&lt;/ref&gt;  Skeen notes that the event has served to significantly burnish Washington's reputation.&lt;ref name=Skeen288/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27126">'''Peace psychology''' is a subfield of [[psychology]] and [[peace research]] that deals with the psychological aspects of [[peace]], [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], [[violence]], and [[war]]. Peace psychology can be characterized by four interconnected pillars: (1) research, (2) education, (3) practice, and (4) advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.peacepsych.org/peace-resources.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The first pillar, research, is documented most extensively in this article.

Peace psychological activities are based on psychological models (theories) and methods; they are usually normatively bound in their means and objectives by working towards the ideal of sustainable peace using (as far as possible) non-violent means. Violence and peace are usually defined in terms of [[Johan Galtung|Johan Galtung's]] extended conceptualization of peace,&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (1969). Violence, peace, and peace research. ''Journal of Peace Research, 6'' (3), 167-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (1990). Cultural violence. ''Journal of Peace Research, 27'' (3), 291-305.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which peace is not merely the absence of personal (direct) violence and war (= negative peace), but also the absence of structural (indirect) and cultural violence (= [[positive peace]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christie, D. J., Wagner, R. V., &amp; Winter, D. D. (2001). Introduction to peace psychology. In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, &amp; D. D. Winter (Eds.), ''Peace, conflict, and violence: Peace psychology for the 21st century'' (pp. 1-13). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal of peace can also be conceptualized as the comprehensive implementation of [[human rights]] (civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights); this should, among other purposes, ensure the satisfaction of basic human needs, such as positive personal and social identity, sense of control, security, (social) justice, well-being, a safe environment, and access to adequate food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Tropp, L. R. (2012). Understanding and responding to intergroup conflict: Toward an integrated analysis. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 3-10). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that focus on peace psychology include, for example, in the United States the Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence (Peace Psychology Division [Division 48] of the [[American Psychological Association]]) and Psychologists for Social Responsibility, a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.psysr.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has the Forum Friedenspsychologie,&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.friedenspsychologie.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Psychological Society has an Interest Group called Psychologists for Peace. On the international level, there is the Committee for the Psychological Study of Peace as well as the International Network of Psychologists for Social Responsibility, which links organizations from (among other countries) Germany, Finland, the United States, Australia, Costa Rica, India, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.inspsysr.org/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research ==

Peace psychological research can be analytically (research ''on'' peace) or normatively (research ''for'' peace) oriented. Regardless of its analytical or normative orientation, peace psychological research mainly deals with the ''psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts'' (including war), the ''psychosocial conditions conducive or detrimental to a sustainable peace'', and the ''psychosocial effects of war and violence''. In each case, different levels of analysis and explanation are relevant: from the level of individuals to groups, social organizations and institutions, states and state systems (e.g., the [[European Union]]), military alliances (e.g., [[NATO]]), and collective security systems (e.g., the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] [OSCE]).

=== Formation and escalation of conflict ===

Peace psychology focuses on the psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts. A [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] exists when the expectations, interests, needs, or actions of at least two parties to the conflict are perceived by at least one of the parties to be incompatible. Peace psychology is mainly concerned with conflicts between social groups (intergroup conflicts, such as between ethnic groups, clans, religious groups, states etc.), in terms of domains like power, wealth, access to raw materials and markets, cultural or religious values, honor, dignity, or recognition. In conflicts one has to distinguish between (overt) positions (e.g., " we don't negotiate with X") and underlying interests (e.g., power, spheres of influence and wealth) as well as between current triggers (e.g., violence at a political protest) and systematic, enduring, structural causes (e.g., deprivation of a group's political participation or access to professional employment). Although conflicts are inevitable and can lead to positive change when dealt with constructively,&lt;ref&gt;Kriesberg, L. (2007). ''Constructive conflicts: From escalation to resolution'' (3rd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; the escalation of conflicts and in particular the occurrence of violence are preventable. Psychological processes of information processing (attention, perception, memory, thinking, judgment), emotion, and motivation influence substantially how a conflict is handled, and in particular whether conflicts escalate to violent episodes. An important factor is the different points of view of the conflict parties, such as when behavior that is based on positive intentions is perceived by the opponent as aggressive and therefore contributes to escalation. Conflicts can easily escalate. A cycle of violence can arise in which both parties are involved, and original victims can become perpetrators, without realizing it ("victim myth").&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Tal, D. &amp; Hammack, P. L. (2012). Conflict, delegitimization, and violence. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 29-52). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicts can be intensified specifically through the construction of [[Enemy Image|enemy images]], [[psychological warfare]], and [[propaganda]] promulgated by the media, political elite, educational systems, socialization, cultural symbols and other means. [[Enemy Image|Enemy images]] may have a kernel of truth, but overstate the negative sides of the opponent. The core features of a strong enemy image include: (1) a negative evaluation of the opponent (e.g., aggressive, immoral, but also inferior), (2) a one-sided blame for negative events, and (3) a different evaluation of similar actions of one's own side than the enemy ("double standard"; e.g., build-up of arms on one’s own side is self-defense, on the enemy's it is aggression). These constructions can cause [[dehumanization]] of the opponent, so that moral standards no longer apply.  In extreme cases, it may seem acceptable, even desirable, for the opponent to suffer and be killed. The construction of the enemy image has the central function of justifying armament, violence, and war. In addition, it enhances the individual and collective self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologists for Social Responsibility (2004). Enemy images: A resource material for reducing enmity. Washington, DC: Psychologists for Social Responsibility. http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/Enemyimagesmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological warfare]] includes methods of generating or strengthening war support among the civilian population and the military. These methods include disinformation using the media (war propaganda), but also sabotage, displacement, murder, and terror. War propaganda consists of two complementary strategies: (1) repeating, highlighting, and embellishing with detail information that functions to intensify the enemy image or threat perceptions, and (2) ignoring and devaluing information that may lead to de-escalation. In addition, negative behavior of the adversary may be provoked (e.g., by maneuvers at the state borders) or charges that the enemy engaged in heinous acts may be entirely invented (e.g., the [[Nayirah (testimony)|Nayirah testimony]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, S. (2004). Propaganda und Kriegsberichterstattung. In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 317-329). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict reduction and resolution (peace psychological strategies) ===

Different peace psychological strategies for non-violent conflict resolution are discussed (conflict de-escalation, [[conflict resolution]], [[conflict transformation]]). One can distinguish between strategies on the ''official level'' (e.g., measures of tension reduction and trust build such as Charles E. Osgood's "Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tension Reduction" [GRIT], [[negotiations]], [[mediation]]), approaches of ''unofficial diplomacy'' (interactive problem-solving workshops), and strategies at the level of peace and conflict ''civil society'' (e.g., [[peace journalism]], contact between social groups).

==== Official level ====

Osgood's GRIT model was designed as a counter-concept to the [[arms race]] in the East-West conflict, in which the former superpowers, USA and USSR, constantly increased the quantity and quality of their arms so that the destruction of humankind by a [[nuclear war]] seemed increasingly possible. The GRIT model, in contrast, aimed to de-escalate and create an atmosphere of mutual trust. One party publicly announces and performs a verifiable, concrete step to reduce tension, and asks or invites the other side to do something similar (developing a spiral of trust). Care is taken so that each step does not endanger the safety of one's own side. GRIT was designed to reverse the tension involved in the nuclear arms race by having each side engage in graduated and reciprocal inititiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, C. E. (1962). ''An alternative to war or surrender.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no firm evidence, it has been suggested that U.S. President Kennedy and the Soviet leader Khrushchev based their negotiations after the [[Cuban missile crisis]] on this concept.&lt;ref&gt;Tzeng, O., Landis, D., &amp; Tzeng, D. Y. (2012). Charles E. Osgood's continuing contributions to intercultural communication and far beyond!. ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 36'', 832-842.&lt;/ref&gt;

When conflicted parties are engaged in long-lasting, severe conflicts, it can be difficult to have constructive bilateral negotiations. In this case, a third party (e.g., a social scientist or reputed politician) can serve as a mediator in order to facilitate conflict management. Mediators must be well aware of the conflict and its history, should have the confidence of both conflict parties, and need to be familiar with conflict analysis and communication strategies. Important strategies include establishing trust, working out the essential elements of conflict, and possibly dividing the problem so that at least partial solutions can be achieved and violence can be prevented or stopped. Problems arise when mediators are biased and have strong individual interests. Mediation success is more likely if the conflict is moderately intense, the power difference between the parties is low, and the mediators have high prestige (as a person or because of organizational affiliation).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, S. (2012). Mediation. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unofficial level ====

In severe, long-lasting conflicts, it may be advisable to intervene at a level below official [[diplomacy]]. Interactive problem solving is such an informal approach to bring members of the conflict parties together.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (2002). Interactive problem solving: Informal mediation by the scholar-practitioner. In J. Bercovitch (Ed.), ''Studies in international mediation: Essays in honor of Jeffrey Z. Rubin'' (pp. 167-193). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/node/831&lt;/ref&gt; These can include citizens who are well-respected from different areas of society, such as media, business, politics, education, or religion. A team of social scientists (e.g., psychologists) initiate and promote a problem-solving process with the elements of conflict diagnosis, generation of alternatives, and development of nonviolent solutions that results in outcomes that are satisfactory to all parties involved. There is the expectation or hope that the participants influence their governments and public opinion so that official negotiations can follow. Psychologically important components of the process are that the respective self and enemy images are corrected. Interactive problem solving was used in particular in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] by the U.S. psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] and his team.&lt;ref&gt;d' Estrée, T. P. (2012). Addressing intractable conflict through interactive problem-solving. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 229-251). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil society level ====

Media are often involved in the formation of enemy images and escalation of conflict. [[Peace journalism]], in contrast, has the objective of investigating and using the influence of the media as a means of encouraging the constructive, non-violent resolution of conflict. Key strategies include representing the conflicting parties as well as the conflict and its history appropriately, identifying propaganda, and articulating the suffering of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Kempf, W. (2012). Peace journalism. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[collective action]] and peaceful demonstrations of the population toward peaceful and socially just ends can have an influence on the decisions of those in power – particularly in democracies. Citizens' commitment depends, among other factors, on the existence of opportunities in society, individual value orientations (e.g., valuing non-violence, social justice), the presence of role models, and the perceived probability of success of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke, K., &amp; Shani, M. (2012). Activism, antiwar. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopidia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacts between opposing groups (e.g., on the level of municipalities, associations, universities, trade unions) can contribute to building positive relationships and the reduction of prejudice (see [[contact hypothesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The nature of prejudice.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2011). ''When groups meet: The dynamics of intergroup contact.'' New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, U., &amp; Hewstone, M. (2012). Intergroup contact. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 193-209). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions associated with the improvement of intergroup relations when groups come in contact with one another include: The actors involved have similar social status; there are common goals that can be achieved through cooperation; and the contacts are supported by authorities in society.

In [[asymmetric conflicts]], where one conflict party is politically, economically, and/or militarily clearly superior, the stronger party may not be interested in a truly sustainable conflict resolution. Under asymmetric conditions, when the root causes of the conflict cannot be sufficiently addressed, structural violence persists. For such situations, approaches have been developed such as [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[liberation psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., &amp; Sonn, C. C. (Eds.) (2009). ''Psychology of liberation: Theory and applications.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; which originated in Latin America and is related to [[liberation theology]].

[[Nonviolent resistance]] refers to public, non-violent behavior directed against injustice; it involves publicly explicating one's own intentions, committing to communicate with the other side, and the willingness to endure negative consequences of one's own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bläsi, B. (2004). Gewaltfreier Widerstand. In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 412-424). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of nonviolent resistance range from protests (e.g., demonstrations) to non-cooperation (e.g., strikes, boycotts) to [[civil resistance]] (e.g., traffic blockades). Particularly well known are the actions, speeches, and writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King]].

=== Effects of war and violence ===

Peace psychology examines war and violence between groups also with the aim of illustrating the psychological and social costs of war and violence and to document the human suffering caused. The psychological consequences include, in particular, [[Psychological trauma|traumatization]] (mainly of the civilian population, but also members of the military), cognitive and emotional damage, and the destruction of trustful social relationships. Wars often do not resolve the underlying problems; they often provoke new violence and wars. For example, in post-war societies an increased level of family and community violence can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Macnair, R. M. (2012). Traumatic stress, perpetration-induced. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, resources necessary to deal with civilian issues (e.g., education, health, social welfare) are lost. There is still little comprehensive and objective research on the consequences and costs of war.&lt;ref&gt;Kantner, E. (2007). ''Shock and awe hits home: U.S. health costs of the war in Iraq.'' Washington, DC: Physicians for Social Responsibility. http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/shock-and-awe.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosocial conditions of sustainable peace ===

Even when violence has been stopped or a [[Peace Treaty]] reached, to prevent the risk of a renewed escalation, physical and economic reconstruction as well as socio-political and psychosocial interventions are required. These interventions aim to cure psychosocial wounds of war, build trust, develop a common [[collective memory]], recognize past wrongdoing, and achieve [[conflict resolution|reconciliation]] and/or [[forgiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamber, B. (2009). ''Transforming societies after political violence: Truth, reconciliation, and mental health.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are trauma therapy and [[truth commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commissions]].

Also, irrespective of any specific conflict and violence, peace psychological research looks at the psychosocial conditions that hamper or promote sustainable peace. The basic aim is to transform cultures of violence into cultures of [[peace]].&lt;ref name="De Rivera"&gt;De Rivera, J. (2012). Culture of peace. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cultural characteristics are obstacles to the development of sustainable peace: the view of one's own group (ethnicity, religion, nation, etc.) to be superior and more valuable and others as inferior and of little value (or in the extreme case: no value); the development of enemy images, [[dehumanization]] of others, legitimization of violence and damage; underlying beliefs (ideologies) such as [[ethnocentrism]], [[social dominance orientation]], [[authoritarianism]], [[nationalism]], [[militarism]], and an education system that promotes these ideologies; power differentials that are defended or increased by the powerful and that create unequal conditions in areas such as wealth, health, education, and political participation ([[structural violence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, A. (2004). Kultur und Krieg In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 383-396). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among factors conducive to the development of sustainable peace are: the fundamental belief that conflicts are frequent, but that they can be solved without violence and for the benefit of the various conflict parties; the concept of [[humanism]] with the features of human dignity, [[pacifism]], [[empathy]], [[respect]], tolerance and [[solidarity]], and respect for all people or for humanity as a whole; critical proximity to one's own group that – in addition to positive identification – also integrates own weaknesses, mistakes, and committed wrongdoings in the collective self-concept.&lt;ref name="De Rivera" /&gt;

In the transformation of cultures of violence into cultures of peace the focus on [[human rights]] is of high importance. Human rights are inalienable rights that apply to all human beings, without distinction as to sex, color, ethnicity, language, religion, political opinion, or social origin (prohibition of discrimination). The UN Human Rights Charter contains the essential documents of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR, 1948) and the Twin Covenants (1966, [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]). The UDHR consists of 30 articles with more than 100 individual rights, including civil and political rights (e.g., right to life, prohibition of torture, right to fair and public trial, right to asylum, freedom of speech, regular elections), but also social, economic, and cultural rights (including the right to work, rest, holidays with pay, protection from unemployment, the right to food, clothing, housing, medical care, and free primary education). Of particular importance in the UN's human rights concept is that all human rights are significant (indivisibility) and that they apply to all people (universality). Psychological research on human rights has mainly examined knowledge, attitudes, and readiness to act in support of human rights. Representative surveys in Germany show that the realization of human rights is considered to be very important, but at the same time knowledge of human rights is low and inaccurate. The results show a "halving" of human rights: Some civil rights are known, while economic and social rights are hardly considered human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stellmacher, J., &amp; Sommer, G. (2012). Human rights and human rights violations, psychological aspects of. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology'' (Vol. 2, pp. 514-518). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance in peace psychology are also analyses of whether human rights are used in the sense of peace or whether they are abused for the construction of enemy images or to prepare wars.

== in education ==

Peace psychological findings are used in the content and practice of [[peace education]] at various levels, from primary school to secondary and tertiary education (e.g., in the form of peace psychology courses at universities&lt;ref&gt;[[Citation signal|See]] http://peacepsychology.org/peace-course-syllabi/&lt;/ref&gt;) to vocational training.

The Conflict Information Consortium at the University of Colorado offers the Beyond Intractability project, an openly accessible, cooperative learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.beyondintractability.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

Peace psychology practice refers, for example, to trauma therapeutic work, the implementation of trainings in nonviolent conflict resolution, and activities in such roles as [[Mediation|conflict mediator]] or [[peace worker|civil peace worker]]. Of particular importance is the cooperation between research and practice, such as in the form of [[evaluation research]], to contribute to the continuous improvement of practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">'''Posadnik''' ([[Cyrillic]]: ''посадник'', (literally: ''по-садник'' - ''pre-sident'') was the [[mayor]] in some [[East Slavic peoples|East Slavic]] cities or towns. Most notably, the posadnik (equivalent to a [[stadtholder]], [[Burgomaster|burgomeister]], or [[podestà]] in the medieval west) was the mayor of [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]].  The term comes from the Old Church Slavic{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} "posaditi," meaning to put or place; they were so-called because the prince in Kiev originally placed them in the city to rule on his behalf.  Beginning in the 12th century, they were elected locally.

==Novgorod==

Despite legends of posadniks such as [[Gostomysl]] that were set in the 9th century, the term ''posadnik'' first appeared in the [[Primary Chronicle]] under the year  997. The earliest Novgorodian posadniks include [[Dobrynya]] (an uncle of [[Vladimir the Great]]), his son [[Konstantin Dobrynich]] and [[Ostromir]], who is famous for patronizing the [[Ostromir Gospels]], among the first books published in Russia (it is now housed in the [[National Library of Russia]] in St. Petersburg). Also mention in a document from year 1189 referenced in SDHK [https://sok.riksarkivet.se/?Sokord=jacob+&amp;EndastDigitaliserat=false&amp;AvanceradSok=False&amp;page=5&amp;postid=sdhk_44456&amp;tab=post#tab 44456].

In the [[Novgorod Republic]], the city posadnik was elected from among the [[boyar]]s by the [[veche]] (public assembly). The elections were held annually. Novgorod boyars differed from boyars in other Rus' lands in that the category was not caste-like and that every rich merchant could reasonably hope to reach the rank of boyar. [[Valentin Yanin]], the Soviet "dean" of medieval Novgorodian history, has found that most posadniks held the office consecutively for sometimes a decade or more and then often passed the office on to their sons or another close relative, indicating that the office was held within boyar clans and that the elections were not really "free and fair."&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Lavrent'evich Yanin, ''Novgorodskie Posadniki'' (Moscow: Moscow State University, 1962; reprinted Moscow: Iazyki Russkoi kultury, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yanin's theory challenged historians' understanding of the Novgorod Republic, showing it to be a boyar republic with little or no democratic elements.  It also showed the land-owning boyarstvo to be more powerful than the merchant and artisan classes, which until that time were thought to play a significant role in the political life of the city.  It also called into question the true nature of the veche, which up until that time had been considered democratic by most scholars.  Yanin's interpretation of the Novgorod government as an hereditary [[oligarchy]] is not universally accepted, however.

Originally there was one posadnik, but gradually over time the office multiplied until, by the end of the Republic, there were something like 24 posadniks.  There were also posadniks for each of [[kontsy|the city's borough]]s (called ends - "kontsy", singular "konets" in Russian).  The multiplication of the office dates to the 1350s, when Posadnik [[Ontsifor Lukinich]] implemented a series of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Yanin, ''Novgorodskie Posadniki'', 262-287.&lt;/ref&gt;  Retired posadniks took the title "old posadnik", or ''старый посадник'') and the current, serving posadnik was known as the "stepennyi" posadnik (''степенный посадник''). In accordance with the reform of 1416-1417, the number of posadniks was increased threefold and stepennyi posadniks were to be elected for a six-month period.  In this manner, the various boyar clans could share power and one or another of them would neither monopolize power or be left out if they lost an election.  It, however, diluted power in the boyarstvo.  Some scholars have argued that the [[Archbishop of Novgorod]] became the head of the Republic and stood above the fray of partisan politics that raged among the boyardom, but the archbishops seem to have shared power with the boyardom and the collective leadership tried to rule by consensus. &lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Paul, "Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest," ''Kritika'' 8, No. 2 (Spr. 2007): 231-270.&lt;/ref&gt; The dilution of boyar power may, however, have weakened Novgorod in the 15th century, thus explaining the series of defeats it suffered at Moscow's hands and the [[Republic of Novgorod#Fall of the Republic|eventual fall of independent Novgorod]]. 

The posadnikdom (mayoralty) was abolished along with the veche when Grand Prince [[Ivan III]] of Moscow took the city in 1478.  In fact, upon being asked by Archbishop Feofil (1470-1480) on behalf of the Novgorodians what type of government he wanted, Ivan (speaking through Prince Patrikeev) told them "there will be no veche bell in our patrimony of Novgorod; ''there will be no posadnik'', and we will conduct our own government."&lt;ref&gt;''Moskovskii  Letopisnii svod'', Vol. 25 in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei''(Moscow ANSSSR, 1949, p. 146 (emphasis added).  See also  Paul, "Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest," 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pskov==

There were 78 known posadniks in Pskov between 1308 and 1510.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the office in Pskov, see Lawrence Langer, “The Posadnichestvo of Pskov: Some Aspects of Urban Administration in Medieval Russia.” ''Slavic Review'' 43, no. 1 (1984): 46−62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The posadnichestvo was abolished in Pskov in 1510 when Grand Prince [[Vasily III]] took direct control of the city.

'''Roscoe Dunjee''' (1883–1965) was an American civil rights activist, journalist, and editor in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. He founded the ''[[Black Dispatch]]'' in 1915, the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City, and used it as a platform to support civil rights and reveal injustices. Long active in the local chapter of the NAACP, in 1932 he brought together several chapters to found the state chapter or branch of the [[NAACP]]. He served as its president for 16 years, and was also on the national board of the NAACP.

Dunjee was a leader in Oklahoma City, using his newspaper to advance racial integration in housing, university admission, education, transportation and other public accommodations. He worked for fair jury selection and against lynchings.&lt;ref name=Sheeler /&gt;

==Early life==
Roscoe Dunjee was born June 21, 1883 in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Sheeler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheeler|first1=Reuben|title=Dunjee, Roscoe (1883–1965)|url=http://www.blackpast.org/saw/dunjee-roscoe-1883-1965|website=Black Past|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Reverend [[John Dunjee|John William]], who worked at [[Storer College]], a historically black college,, and his mother was Lydia Ann Dunjee.&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rummel|first1=Jack|title=African American Social Leaders and Activists|date=2003|publisher=Facts on File Inc|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780816048403|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family migrated to Oklahoma in 1892, as his father was representing the [[Baptist Home Missionary Society]]. Roscoe had a brother, Irving, and three sisters, Ella, [[Drusilla Dunjee Houston|Drusilla]], and Blanche. In 1903, when the young Dunjee was 20&lt;ref name="Sullins, William S"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roscoe Dunjee and the Oklahoma City Black Dispatch|url=http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/10618|website=Kansas state University Libraries|publisher=Sullins, William S|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; their father died.

He returned from [[Langston University|Langston College]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Langston, Oklahoma]] that then emphasized technical and industrial trades. Dunjee had learned to set type by working after hours in the print shop of ''The Langston Herald,'' a small community paper.&lt;ref name=Rummel /&gt; Dunjee took on the responsibility of earning a living to support his mother and a younger brother and sister. The family farm had produced vegetables for the family. Young Dunjee decided to enlarge the operation and become a truck farmer, selling directly to the public. He also worked as a bellhop at the Stewart Hotel in Oklahoma City, but looked for more opportunities. He educated himself also by reading widely in his father's 1500-volume library.

==Career==
Interested in the growing movement of black fraternalism, Dunjee joined the [[Pythian Grand Lodge]] and began lecturing in its behalf throughout the state. He also enlisted new members, and his reputation as an organizer grew. When Dunjee was traveling throughout Oklahoma, he could see the difficult conditions of black migrant sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Not only was the Negro unable to earn a living wage, the state had passed discriminatory laws related to segregation of transportation and other public accommodations. Dunjee began thinking seriously about establishing a newspaper that could tell the Negro story and reply to white racism.

In 1915, when he was 32 years of age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roscoe Dunjee on education|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4927|website=open-access repository of research by members of Oklahoma Higher Education|publisher=Hadley,Worth J.|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had a chance to purchase a job printing plant from Oliva J. Abby, an instructor in the Oklahoma City public schools, whose printer husband had become ill. He founded his own newspaper, the ''[[Black Dispatch]]'', the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City. He used this as a platform to publish editorials against segregation and report unfair treatment of blacks. The newspaper grew from a local publication to a national one, at one point boasting nearly 20,000 subscribers. Dunjee would regularly report on [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of blacks]] in both Oklahoma and Texas.

He worked to change voter laws that prohibited or constrained black voters from the polls. Oklahoma's new 1908 constitution, passed after statehood, had raised barriers to voter registration, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising blacks and other minority]] voters. It joined former states of the Confederacy across the South in taking such action. In 1916 the state passed a [[grandfather clause]] that enabled white voters to escape certain restrictions related to literacy. Dunjee's efforts contributed to court challenges; ultimately lawyers of the NAACP ([[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]) overturned the grandfather clause in the US Supreme Court case ''[[Guinn v. Allwright]]''.

Dunjee publicized the murder trial of [[Hollins v. State of Oklahoma|Jess Hollins]]. He was a black man arrested for the rape of a white woman, to which he confessed without having seen counsel. He was rapidly sentenced to death four days after the alleged attack in December 1931. Dunjee reported on the case, supporting an appeal. The judge said he moved fast because he feared another [[Tulsa Race Riot]], as had taken place in 1921. The state court ruled that Hollins deserved a jury trial. He was convicted by an [[all-white jury]] in 1934 and again sentenced to death. The case was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in ''[[Hollins v. State of Oklahoma]]'' (1935), that the systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury had been grounds for reversing Hollins' conviction.&lt;ref name=Rummel /&gt; It directed a new trial. Hollins was convicted by another all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. He died in 1950, and is now widely believed to have been innocent.

In 1916 the Oklahoma Board of Commissioners passed an ordinance forbidding black residents from moving into a house on a block occupied by at least 75% white residents. Dunjee funded the cases of several black residents who were attempting to integrate areas not zoned for blacks. William Floyd was a black shoemaker who purchased a home in a majority-white neighborhood. Floyd was jailed four times for attempting to occupy his newly purchased home. Dunjee bailed Floyd out each time and encouraged him to return to the home. In this period the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' (1917) that racially discriminatory state and local ordinances for housing were unconstitutional. A judge in Oklahoma ruled the state law was unconstitutional on those grounds.&lt;ref name=Lackmeyer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lackmeyer|first1=Steve|title=Roscoe Dunjee: Fighter for Equality|url=http://www.okchistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=185:roscoe-dunjee-fighter-for-equality&amp;catid=41:people&amp;Itemid=78|website=OKC History|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunjee was active in the NAACP, the Oklahoma Youth Legislature, the National Negro Democratic Association, and the Negro Business League.&lt;ref name=Rummel /&gt; He played a vital role in desegregating Oklahoma State University in 1948 (Rummel).

Dunjee never married,&lt;ref name=LaMotte&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaMotte|first1=Janet|title=Roscoe Dunjee|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/128172399|website=Find A Grave|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor had any known children. Although he sold the newspaper in 1954 to another publisher, he worked there until his death in 1965.

==Legacy and honors==
*In 1969 he was inducted posthumously into the Oklahoma Journalist Hall of Fame at [[University of Central Oklahoma|Central State University]].&lt;ref name=Sheeler /&gt;

==Black Dispatch newspaper==
Roscoe Dunjee published Oklahoma City’s first black newspaper, the ''Black Dispatch'', from 1915 to 1954. Its name refers to "[[Black Dispatches]]", the term during the American Civil War for intelligence given to the Union by free or enslaved African Americans in the South.)

The ''Black Dispatch''&lt;ref name="Sullins, William S"/&gt; was a member of the Western Negro Press Association during its formative years. It later subscribed to the [[Associated Negro Press]], which boasted of having 112 member newspapers in 1921. Dunjee added the Crusader Service, the Pacific Coast News Bureau, and Preston News Service, among others. In the 21st century, the ''Black Dispatch'' continues to be operated, the oldest continuously published black newspaper in Oklahoma.

A '''school district''' is a [[special-purpose district]] that operates local public [[elementary school|primary]] and [[middle school|secondary]] schools in various nations.

==United States==
{{See also|Lists of school districts in the United States}}
In the U.S, public schools belong to school districts, which are governed by '''school boards.''' Each district is an independent special-purpose government, or dependent school systems, under the guidelines of each [[U.S. state]] government and local school boards. A school district is a legally separate [[legal personality|body corporate and politic]]. School districts are local governments with powers similar to that of a [[town]] or a [[County (United States)|county]] including [[taxation]] and [[eminent domain]], except in [[Virginia]], whose [[school division]]s have no taxing authority and must depend on another local government (county, city, or town) for funding. Its governing body, which is typically elected by direct popular vote but may be appointed by other governmental officials, is called a ''[[school board]]'', ''board of trustees'', ''board of education,'' ''school committee'', or the like. This body appoints a ''[[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]]'', usually an experienced public school administrator, to function as the district's [[chief executive]] for carrying out day-to-day decisions and policy implementations. The school board may also exercise a [[quasi-judicial]] function in serious [[employee]] or [[student]] [[discipline]] matters.

School districts in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]] tend to cross municipal boundaries, while school districts in [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions tend to adhere to city, township, and/or county boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/ School Districts]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6ZQDSNym9 Archive]) [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|1951}} school districts were independent governmental units in 26 states, while in 17 states there were mixes of independent school districts and school districts subordinate to other local governments. In nine states there were only school districts subordinate to local governments.&lt;ref name=StateLocalgov1951p2&gt;"State and Local Government Special Studies: Governments in the United States 1951." ''Property Taxation 1941''. [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. G-SS-No. 29, March 1952. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=je6wa6nBhCkC&amp;pg=RA3-PA56 2] ([[Google Books]] RA3-PA56).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all school systems constitute school districts as distinct bodies corporate.  In most Southern states, school systems operate either as an arm of county government, or at least share coextensive boundaries with the state's counties.  In Maryland, most school systems are run at the county level, but the [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]] system operates separately, at a [[county-equivalent]] level. In [[New York (state)|New York]], most [[Administrative divisions of New York#School district|school districts]] are separate governmental units with the power to levy taxes and incur debt, except for the five cities with population over 125,000, where the schools are operated directly by the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Government Handbook, 6th Edition |url=https://www.dos.ny.gov/lg/publications/Local_Government_Handbook.pdf |publisher=New York Department of State, Division of Local Government Services |accessdate=31 August 2018 |page=75 |date=Published 2009; reprinted 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hawaii State Department of Education]] functions as a single statewide school district.  This is unique among the states, but the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] operates district public schools in [[Washington, DC]] and the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education]] operates all public schools in the Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]], thus they also function as single school districts.

===History===
From 1942 to 1951 the number of school districts declined from 108,579 to 70,452, a decrease by 38,127 or 35%.&lt;ref name=StateLocalgov1951p12&gt;"State and Local Government Special Studies: Governments in the United States 1951." ''Property Taxation 1941''. [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. G-SS-No. 29, March 1952. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=je6wa6nBhCkC&amp;pg=RA3-PA55 1]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=je6wa6nBhCkC&amp;pg=RA3-PA56 2] ([[Google Books]] RA3-PA55 and PA56).&lt;/ref&gt; Many states had passed laws facilitating school district consolidation. In 1951 the majority of the school districts in existence were rural school districts only providing elementary education, and some school districts did not operate schools but instead provided transportation to other schools. The [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] (North Central U.S.) had a large number of rural school districts.&lt;ref name=StateLocalgov1951p2/&gt;

Previously areas of the [[Unorganized Borough]] of [[Alaska]] were not served by school districts, but instead served by schools directly operated by the [[Alaska Department of Education]] and by [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) schools. The state schools were transferred to the [[Alaska State-Operated School System]] (SOS) after the [[Alaska Legislature]] created it in 1971; that agency was terminated in 1975, with its schools transferred to the newly created [[Alaska Unorganized Borough School District]], which was broken apart into twenty-one school districts the following year.&lt;ref name=Barnhardtindex&gt;Barnhardt, Carol. "[http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/curriculum/Articles/CarolBarnhardt/historical.html Historical Status of Elementary Schools in Rural Alaskan Communities 1867-1980]." Alaska Native Knowledge Network (ANKN), [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. Retrieved on March 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002 Census of Governments, the [[United States Census Bureau]] enumerated the following numbers of school systems in the United States:
*13,506 school district governments
*178 state-dependent school systems
*1,330 local-dependent school systems
*1,196 education service agencies and (agencies providing support services to public school systems)

School districts in the US have reduced the number of their employees by 3.3%, or 270,000 between 2008 and 2012, owing to a decline in property tax revenues during and after the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;USA Today  published  March 13, 2012, page A1,"Property taxes start to decline"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
{{Geographical imbalance|school districts in states across the U.S|date=December 2010}}
Although these terms can vary slightly between various states and regions, these are typical definitions for school district constitution:

====Schools====
* An ''elementary''  or ''primary school'' usually includes [[kindergarten]] and grades [[first grade|one]] through [[fifth grade|five]] or [[sixth grade|six]].  In some school districts, these grades are divided into two schools. ''Primary school'' is most commonly used for schools housing students in kindergarten through grade two or three in districts where the older elementary students are in intermediate schools (see below).
* A ''middle school'' usually includes grades six or [[seventh grade|seven]] through [[eighth grade|eight]] or [[ninth grade|nine]]. In some places, the alternative terms ''junior high school'' or ''intermediate school'' are still used.  ''Junior high school'' often refers to schools that cover grades seven through nine.  ''Intermediate school'' is also used for schools that cover grades three through five (or so) when they are separated from elementary schools.
* A ''high school'' usually includes grades nine or [[tenth grade|ten]] through [[twelfth grade|twelve]] and may also include grades seven and eight.  There are many high schools that cover only grades ten to twelve; this type of school is sometimes referred to as a ''senior high school''.

====Districts====
These terms may not appear in a district's name, even though the condition may apply.
* A [[unified school district]] includes [[Primary education|elementary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] ([[middle school]] and [[high school]]) educational levels.
* The word ''central'' in a district's name indicates that the district is formed from a consolidation ("centralization") of multiple districts and that the central district's operations are centralized relative to those of the previous districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niskayunaschools.org/about-us/district-history/ Niskayuna Central School District: District History]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The word ''free'' in a district's name indicates that no tuition is charged to attend district schools.  In New York, it is used in conjunction with ''union'' to indicate a district composed of multiple, formerly independent common school districts now ''free'' of restrictions placed on New York State's common school districts.
* The word ''union'' or ''consolidated'' in a district's name indicates that it was formed from two or more districts.
** In [[Missouri]], most district names include a ''C-'' (for "consolidated") or, more commonly, an ''R-'' (for "reorganized") followed by a number, commonly in [[Roman numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2015/03/06/answer-man-mean-school-district-names/24498631/|title=Answer Man: What's 'R' mean in school district names?|accessdate=10 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The word ''joint'' in a district's name indicates that it includes territory from more than one county. By extension, a ''joint state'' school district, such as [[Union County–College Corner Joint School District|Union County–College Corner JSD]], includes territory in more than one state.
* The word ''[[independent school district|independent]]'' can have different meanings, depending on the state.
** [[Kentucky]] — Under [[Kentucky Revised Statutes]] § 160.020, an "Independent" district is defined as one whose jurisdiction does not cover an entire county.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Revised Statutes [http://lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=43808 § 160.020].&lt;/ref&gt; If [[List of counties in Kentucky|a county]] has no independent district, its school district boundaries coincide exactly with its borders.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Revised Statutes [http://lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=3657 § 160.010].&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the state has 53 independent districts scattered throughout the state, with major concentrations in [[Northern Kentucky]] and the [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|Eastern Coalfield]] region. These districts are generally associated with a city, or sometimes with a cluster of adjoining cities. Unlike county districts, independent districts can cross county lines, as in the [[Caverna Independent School District]] centered on [[Cave City, Kentucky|Cave City]] and [[Horse Cave, Kentucky|Horse Cave]] and the [[Corbin Independent Schools]]. Note that some districts in the state are independent despite not having "Independent" in their official name, as in the [[Owensboro Public Schools]] and [[Paducah Public Schools]].
** [[Minnesota]] — Per Minnesota Statute 120A.05, "Independent" denotes any school district validly created and existing as an independent, consolidated, joint independent, county or a ten or more township district as of July 1, 1957, or pursuant to the Education Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=120A.05|title=120A.05 - 2014 Minnesota Statutes|work=mn.gov|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Texas]] — Here, "Independent" denotes that the district is separate from any county- or municipal-level entity. All of the state's school districts, with only one exception ([[Stafford Municipal School District]]), are independent of any municipal or county control. Moreover, school district boundaries rarely coincide with municipal limits or county lines.  Most districts use the term "Independent School District" in their name; in the few cases where the term "Common School District" is used the district is still an independent governmental entity.
*In [[Ohio]], school districts are classified as either ''city'' school districts, ''exempted village'' school districts, or ''local'' school districts. City and exempted village school districts are exempted from county boards of education, while local school districts remain under county school board supervision. School districts may combine resources to form a fourth type of school district, the joint vocational school district, which focuses on a technical skills–based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b835/b835_4.html Special Purpose Governments], Ohio State University.  Accessed 2008-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Michigan]] there are [[intermediate school district]]s (ISD), regional education service districts (RESD), or regional education service agencies (RESA), largely at the county level.  The local schools districts run the schools and most programs, but often bilingual aides, programs for the deaf and blind, special education for the severely impaired, and career and technical education programs are run by the intermediate school district or equivalent.
*In [[Maryland]] school districts are broken up by county.

===== Teacher assignment practices in school districts =====
{{Off topic|date=May 2017|Teacher}}
There are various approaches can when making decisions in assigning teachers. The deciding in assigning teachers can occur with the collaboration of human resource staff or decisions from the collaboration with principals and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, D. H. (1987). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1002040 "Assigning elementary pupils to their teachers."]. ''The Elementary School Journal''. 88(2): 166–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the decisions for teacher assignment can vary base on school districts, there are two most popular approaches that are currently occurring in assigning teachers. The first popular approach is assigning students to teachers based on sharing the same characteristics as their students.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, S., Worth, R., &amp; Meyer, R. H. (2011, April). Classroom assignment practices in urban school districts using teacher level value-added systems. In Association for Education Finance and Policy Annual Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, principals assign teachers to students based on academic performance, teachers’ personalities, teachers teaching styles, and teachers’ classroom management skills. During this assignment practices, there are some collaboration with teachers and principals. The second most popular approach is that teachers can be assigned based on their ability to improve students’ standardized test scores. This is identified as “staffing to the test”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cohen-Vogel, L. (2011). “Staffing to the test” are today’s school personnel practices evidence based? Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 33(4), 483-505. doi: 10.3102/0162373711419845.&lt;/ref&gt; in which principals observe the influence teachers have on students’ standardized test scores and then strategically move teachers to certain subjects or grades where standardized test are given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Even though two approaches are used to assign teachers to students, there are some obstacles that principals encounter when making teacher assignment decisions. For instance, one conflict is parents demand that their child be assigned to a specific teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Clotfelter, C.T., Ladd, H.F., &amp; Vigdor, J. (2005). Who teaches whom? Race and the distribution of novice teachers. ''Economics of Education Review, 24''(4), 377-392. {{doi|10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.06.008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The second conflict is that principals need to take into consideration policies, such as tenure or collective bargaining, which can influence teacher assignment practices.&lt;ref name="Youngs, P. 2015"&gt;Youngs, P., Pogodzinski, B., &amp; Galey, S. (2015). How Labor Management Relations and Human Resource Policies Affect the Process of Teacher Assignment in Urban School Districts. Educational Administration Quarterly, 51(2), 214-246. doi: 10.1177/0013161X14529148&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these challenges, many have suggested that principals should collaborate with teacher unions in order to address these conflicts.&lt;ref name="Youngs, P. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Useem, E., &amp; Farley, E. (2004). Philadelphia’s teacher hiring and school assignment practices: Comparisons with other districts.

==Europe==
Outside the United States, autonomous districts or equivalent authorities often represent various groups seeking education autonomy. In European history, as in much of the world, religious (confessional), linguistic, and ethnic divisions have been a significant factor in school organization. This paradigm is shifting.{{how|date=July 2014}}

In [[England and Wales]], [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] were established in 1870, and abolished in 1902, with [[county council]] and [[county borough]] councils becoming the [[local education authority|local education authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.powys.gov.uk/hold/board.html|title=Find archives &amp; local records|work=powys.gov.uk|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the system of the [[carte scolaire]] was dismantled by the beginning of the 2007 school year. More school choice has been given to French students; however, priority is given to those who meet the following criteria:

* students with disabilities
* students on scholarships or special academic merit
* students who meet "[[group cohesiveness|social cohesion]]" criteria (essentially to [[Diversity (politics)|diversify]] the school population)
* students who require specialized medical attention from a hospital
* students who want to study a course offered only by the school
* students who have siblings that attend the school
* students who live close to the school

In [[Germany]], schools are run and funded by the general regional entities, usually the [[States of Germany]] or municipalities. School districts in the meaning of distinct legal entities do not exist. 

In [[Italy]], school districts were established in 1974 by the "''Provvedimenti Delegati sulla scuola''" ("Assigned Laws [to the Government] about the school").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/dpr416_74.html |title=Text of the DPR n° 416 del 31 maggio 1974 ("Assigned Laws about the school") |date=1994 |origyear=31 May 1974 |access-date=2016-03-30 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each district must contain a minimum of 10,000 inhabitants. The national government attempted to link the local schools with local society and culture and local governments. The school districts were dissolved in 2003 by the "legge finanziaria" (law about the government budget) in an attempt to trim the national budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/02289l02.htm#legge|title=L 289/2002: Text of the law n° 289 del 27 dicembre 2002 ("legge finanziaria 2003") |date=2003 |origyear=27 Dec 2002 |access-date=2016-03-30 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Socialist Peasants' Party''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Partidul Socialist Țărănesc'', or ''Partidul Socialist Țărănist'', PSȚ) was a short-lived political party in [[Romania]], presided over by the academic [[Mihai Ralea]]. Created nominally in 1938 but dissolved soon after, it reemerged during [[World War II]]. A clandestine group, it opposed the [[Fascism|fascist]] regime of [[Ion Antonescu]], although its own roots were planted in authoritarian politics. Looking to the [[Soviet Union]] for inspiration, the PSȚ was cultivated by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR), and comprised a faction of radicalized [[Social democracy|social democrats]], under [[Lothar Rădăceanu]].

Perceived as a communist tool, the PSȚ was prevented by other parties from participating in the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] against Antonescu. It entered its legal phase in the late months of 1944, but was soon absorbed into the more powerful [[Ploughmen's Front]].

==Roots==
Ralea entered politics as one of the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) intellectuals in [[Iași]], before his 1938 move to [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.78, 100, 131, 184&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, he was a prominent figure in the [[Centrism|centrist]] faction of the party, with [[Armand Călinescu]] as his ally.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.126; Harre, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; A political and social theorist, he endorsed the PNȚ's [[Agrarianism|agrarian]]-and-[[Corporatism|corporatist]] notion of a "peasant state", against the social-democratic wing of the party. As scholar Angela Harre notes, Ralea and other PNȚ leaders "tried to use the vague picture of a peasant state to counterbalance the growing fascist impact on society with an alternative democratic state model."&lt;ref&gt;Harre, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, Ralea had established contacts with the outlawed Communist Party, and already supported its [[antifascist]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.126; Tismăneanu, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; PCdR contacts viewed him as one of the "bourgeois personalities with antifascist views."&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p.550&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Romanian general election, 1937|1937 election]], which saw pro-democratic parties unable to maintain a clear majority, the "peasant state" doctrine looked set to crumble. Harre argues: "A corporatist democracy became obsolete from the middle of the 1930s on, when the strongly polarized Romanian society did not resist the split between urban modernity and a rural traditional way of life any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Harre, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Ralea was editor of the National Peasantist organ, ''[[Dreptatea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; but at odds with PNȚ leader [[Iuliu Maniu]]. He broke away from the party to establish the PSȚ, in name only. According to [[Corneliu Coposu]], at the time a leader of the PNȚ youth, Ralea's party was "stillborn".&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 "Întâlniri secrete între Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D. Cocea și Mihail Ralea (1942–1944)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162339/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 |date=2014-07-14 }}, in ''Caiete Silvane'', Nr. 2/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] banned the PNȚ and all other mainstream parties, Ralea transformed himself into a pillar of Carol's authoritarian-corporatist [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN). He was highly decorated by the king, and appointed [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Minister of Labor]] in March of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.127, 131, 133-134, 141-143, 146, 148, 176, 189, 259&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he organized the ''[[Muncă și Voe Bună]]'' leisure service, directly modeled on fascist precedents such as ''[[Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro|Dopolavoro]]'', and converted the staples of socialist propaganda in support of the FRN.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.141-143, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the FRN regime was unable to secure Romania against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]: the country ceded [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Transylvania]], after which the regime crumbled. It was replaced by the Nazi-aligned [[National Legionary State]], an uneasy partnership between Antonescu and the [[Iron Guard]]. The latter made efforts to prosecute figures associated with the FRN, and Ralea was consequently stripped of his academic postings. He was reinstated in 1941, after the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clash between the Guard and Antonescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.176, 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; However, owing to Ralea's communist sympathies, Antonescu ordered his constant surveillance by ''[[Siguranța]]'', the country's secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.200, 236-237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reestablishment==
Ralea's contacts with the PCdR became a nuisance once Romania joined Nazi Germany's [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war against the Soviet Union]]. From December 1942 to March 1943, he was interned alongside other dissenters in [[Târgu Jiu]] camp.&lt;ref name="lb237"&gt;Boia, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his release, he resumed his contacts with other dissenting academics of Iași—[[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Constantin Ion Parhon]], [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]]—with whom, the ''Siguranța'' noted, he intended to start a "political action".&lt;ref name="lb237"/&gt; It did not materialize into a political movement. During summer 1943, Ralea resumed his contacts with the PNȚ, and was received by Maniu. This interview surprised the mainstream National Peasantists, for whom Ralea was a pariah (Maniu himself had implied that Ralea had "not a trace of character").&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; According to Coposu, Maniu reminded Ralea of his 1938 defection, and rejected his offer to rejoin the "democratic opposition" to Antonescu. Maniu suggested instead that Ralea and other "former supporters of Carol II" create their own "antihitlerite combat front, independent from the consistently democratic elements". He appreciated Ralea's rejection of Antonescu's "catastrophic orientation" and commitment to "the country's salvation", but noted that they could only buy him a measure of leniency "for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection."&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;

During late 1943, Ralea and other dissident National Peasantists were in [[Brașov]], where they began referring to themselves as a distinct Socialist Peasants' Party, and worked closely with an antifascist economist and doctrinaire, [[Victor Jinga]].&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p.555, 558&lt;/ref&gt; With a mandate from the PCdR, Ralea also approached [[Petru Groza]] of the [[Ploughmen's Front]] and [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], the former [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] and leader of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), who had already publicized their opposition to Antonescu's foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p.555&lt;/ref&gt; The newly (re)established PSȚ, also known as "Socialist Union of Workers and Peasants",&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; was soon joined by Rădăceanu. The latter, formerly a figure of importance in the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR), had earlier established his own clandestine [[Marxism|Marxist]] faction.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.116-117; Tismăneanu, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure of relative importance was [[Stanciu Stoian]], himself a PNȚ defector,&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="umerii132"&gt;Cioroianu, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; who was also affiliated with another underground force, the [[Union of Patriots (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p.299-300&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], the Socialist Peasants' Party, "entirely minor", had a "ghostly" existence under Antonescu's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.126, 132&lt;/ref&gt; It soon approached the PCdR and, represented by Ralea and Stoian,&lt;ref name="umerii132"/&gt; accepted inclusion into the "Patriotic Antihitlerite Front". Journalist Victor Frunză claimed the latter was also a shady organization, also deeming the very existence (beyond the adoption of a name) doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the same author, Rădăceanu and Ralea were among the PCdR's more credible outside sympathizers: "they moved [[Far left|to the left of the left]] for reasons of a personal predisposition toward [[totalitarianism]]."&lt;ref name="vf120"&gt;Frunză, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antihitlerite Front==
Alongside the PNȚ, PSDR, and National Liberals, the Communists were called in to organize the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] against Antonescu. An understanding was reached in March 1944, when the four groups set up a National Democratic Bloc (BND). The PCdR, marginally relevant in this alliance, tried to extend his influence by obtaining seats for the "Antihitlerite" parties: Ralea's PSȚ, Groza's Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. The move was vetoed by the mainstream parties.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vf120"/&gt; During a new meeting with Ralea, Maniu also rejected the PSȚ offer to reunite or align itself with the PNȚ.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; On May 24, 1944, the PSȚ also entered a "National-Democratic Coalition", formed around the [[National Liberal Party–Tătărescu]], which had a platform of loyalism toward King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and "active political collaboration with the Soviets." It also comprised Groza's Front, the Union of Patriots, the PSDR, [[Hungarian People's Union|MADOSZ]], and remnants of the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]], under [[Petre Topa]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiberiu Dumitru Costăchescu, "Partidul Național Liberal în anii regimurilor autoritare (februarie 1938 – august 1944)", in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 2/2006, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea and his group continued to campaign on their own. A ''Siguranța'' report of June 27 mentions that the PSȚ had received pledges and support from leftists such as [[Demostene Botez]], [[Scarlat Callimachi]], [[N. D. Cocea]], and [[D. I. Suchianu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/135/art07-arhiva.html " 'Prințul Roșu' "], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 135&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1944, Jinga produced a manifesto for the post-Antonescu era, prophesying a [[Socialization (economics)|socialized economy]] and [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="tu558"&gt;Undrea, p.558&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea had nevertheless lost the support of Rădăceanu and his followers, who returned to the PSDR as a distinctly pro-communist inner-party faction.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.117; Tismăneanu, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; A PSȚ man, Grigore Geamănu, still had a significant part to play in the preparation of the coup, helping PCdR's [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] to break out of Târgu Jiu camp.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BND then put an end to Antonescu's regime, aligning Romania with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], but also led the way for the [[Soviet occupation of Romania]]. The PSȚ emerged into legality on September 2, one of the seven parties mentioned by Premier [[Constantin Sănătescu]] in his decree on the transition to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu &amp; Radu, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; Its newly established daily, ''Dezrobirea'' ("Liberation"), publicized Jinga's July manifesto as a PSȚ party program.&lt;ref name="tu558"/&gt; ''Dezrobirea'' also praised Ralea's own antifascism, and claimed for the PSȚ a pedigree of "more than six years" of ideological combat.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by historian [[Lucian Boia]], such statements may imply that Ralea wished to present his FRN activity and his pro-communism as a coherent whole.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.131, 259&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately, Ralea's party was co-opted on other PCdR-controlled alliances. The "Antihitlerite Front" was formalized on September 6, when it denounced the alliance with the PNȚ and the PNL,&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p.301&lt;/ref&gt; and published its appeal to the populace on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu &amp; Radu, p.189-190&lt;/ref&gt; The Front then transformed itself into a broader "[[People's Democratic Front (Romania)|National Democratic Front]]", in stated opposition to Sănătescu's government. As members of this coalition, the Ploughmen's Front and the Socialist Peasantists had a particularly close relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu &amp; Radu, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, the PSȚ grew to include other figures formerly associated with the FRN including [[Mihail Ghelmegeanu]], [[Octav Livezeanu]], and [[Tudor Vianu]] (chairman of the [[National Theater Bucharest]]).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.262-263, 271, 273&lt;/ref&gt; The party also received into its ranks Ralea's student, poet [[Teohar Mihadaș]],&lt;ref name="vihusar"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Iancu, [[Al. Husar]], [http://www.romlit.ro/al._husar_caracterul_d_autoritate_sacerdoiului_critic "Caracterul dă autoritate sacerdoțiului critic"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 24/2005&lt;/ref&gt; who was hiding his earlier involvement with the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="asdetinut"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], Cicerone Ionițoiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/constant_tonegaru_-_deinut_politic "Constant Tonegaru - deținut politic"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disestablishment and aftermath==
In November 1944, the PSȚ was absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.259, 271, 273; Cioroianu, p. 154; Georgescu &amp; Radu, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader, Groza, became Prime Minister of a communist-aligned cabinet in which Ralea was [[Ministry of Culture (Romania)|Arts Minister]]; he would later serve as [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]], while Stoian became Minister of Religious Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.127, 132, 154, 289-290; Boia, p.259, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

Already by 1945, former PSȚ politicians were manifesting their opposition to communization. Soviet advisers noted with concern that Ghelmegeanu was influencing Groza to unseal his agreements with the PCdR.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as a diplomat, Ralea pressed the Americans to intervene in Romania and balance out Soviet influence, as a guarantee against the [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization of peasant property]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Romania after the full imposition of a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], he was awarded a seat in the [[Great National Assembly]] with the [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|formal elections of 1948]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.310-311, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1949, the [[Securitate]] secret police was clamping down on some less loyal PSȚ members. Mihadaș had established contacts with the [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anticommunist maquis]] and Western countries.&lt;ref name="vihusar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asdetinut"/&gt; He was arrested and tortured, being forced to invent a conspiracy that dragged into it various members of the political and literary underworld.&lt;ref name="asdetinut"/&gt; Ralea himself was placed under Securitate surveillance, once he began expressing his mistrust of the Communist Party. His Securitate file lists him as an "opportunistic element, a danger to our regime."&lt;ref name="lb334"&gt;Boia, p.334&lt;/ref&gt; Ghelmegeanu and Vianu were also marginalized, while Suchianu was arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="lb334"/&gt; Throughout the late 1950s and early '60s, Ralea maintained cordial relations with the communist leader, Gheorghiu-Dej, and backed the regime's gradual adoption of [[National communism in Romania|nationalist principles]].&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.161, 220&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1964, a member of the [[State Council of Romania|Romanian Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.334; Popescu, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Speed Limits.svg|thumb|600px|right|upright|Highest-posted speed limits around the world. Kilometres per hour are on the left and miles per hour on the right. (One or other is rounded in each case.)]]

A road '''speed limit''' is the limit of speed allowed by law for road vehicles, usually the maximum speed allowed. Occasionally, there is a minimum speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Speeds on Rural Interstate Highways Relative to Posting the 40&amp;nbsp;mph Minimum Speed Limit {{!}} Bureau of Transportation Statistics|url = http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/journal_of_transportation_and_statistics/volume_07_number_23/html/paper_06/index.html|website = www.rita.dot.gov|accessdate = 29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speed limits are commonly set by the legislative bodies of national or local governments.

==Overview==

The following tables show various jurisdictions' [[Speed limit#Maximum speed limits|default speed limit]]s (where applicable) that apply to different types of vehicles travelling on three different types of road. Actual speed limits may range beyond these values. Speeds are listed in [[kilometers per hour]]. The enforcement tolerance is specified in km/h or percentage above the stated limit. For the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], the speed limit listed in [[miles per hour]].&lt;ref name="mph" group="fn"/&gt; Germany, with its [[Autobahn]]s, is the only country without a general speed limit on its highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/motoring/a/18958067/fun-fun-fun-on-the-autobahn |title=Fun, fun, fun on the autobahn |publisher= |date=16 September 2013 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Isle of Man]] is the only jurisdiction without a general speed limit on rural two-lane roads.

Signs are posted in mph. Until recently, speed limit signs on a stretch of Interstate 19 in southern Arizona were the only ones based on the metric system. As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the federal government funded a project where the state of Arizona replaced the km/h signs on that stretch with miles-based speed limit signs.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AUT1" group="fn"&gt;
A provisional increase to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h was in place on a 12&amp;nbsp;km stretch on the A10 (between [[Spittal an der Drau]] and Paternion) in May and June 2006. The 160&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit was displayed only during the day (from&amp;nbsp;5 till&amp;nbsp;22) and under optimal conditions. In the night (from&amp;nbsp;22 till&amp;nbsp;5) the speed limit could be only up to 110&amp;nbsp;km/h. In bad weather or traffic conditions the displayed speed limit could be lowered. In very poor conditions, the rate was reduced to 80&amp;nbsp;km/h.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AUT2" group="fn"&gt;
Cars with heavy trailer: 80&amp;nbsp;km/h; lorries with heavy trailer: 70&amp;nbsp;km/h.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AUT3" group="fn"&gt;
Cars with heavy trailer: 100&amp;nbsp;km/h; lorries with heavy trailer: 80&amp;nbsp;km/h.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="DEU1" group="fn"&gt;
130&amp;nbsp;km/h is the ''recommended'' maximum speed on motorways, as indicated by a square blue sign (round blue sign = minimum speed). Many sections of the German motorway network are now covered by speed limits, usually ranging from 80 to 130&amp;nbsp;km/h (140&amp;nbsp;km/h as speed limit is being tested in [[Lower Saxony]] -some politicians are against it, because 140&amp;nbsp;km/h is over the ''recommended'' maximum speed, depending on local conditions (i.e., frequent traffic, terrain, etc.). It is usual for drivers involved in crashes who were exceeding the 'recommended' speed limit to be held to be at least partly at fault, regardless of the circumstances of the crash, and insurance companies have the right to withhold payment. Already more than 50% Autobahns now have a (partially variable) speed limit. Vehicles also must be able to go faster than 60&amp;nbsp;km/h.
&lt;br /&gt;Roughly 30% of german Autobahn have permanent limits. An additional 17% have at least partial limits depending on time, weather or traffic. [http://www.vcd.org/fileadmin/user_upload/redakteure/presse/position_tempolimit.pdf Study on the speed limit on german Autobahn.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525221306/http://www.vcd.org/fileadmin/user_upload/redakteure/presse/position_tempolimit.pdf |date=25 May 2013 }}

&lt;br /&gt;On two-way roads, cars and motorbikes are allowed to go 20&amp;nbsp;km/h over the speed limit in order to overtake a slower vehicle in a shorter amount of time.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="FIN1" group="fn"&gt;
During winter, when conditions are often bad, all Finnish motorways have a speed limit of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h or less. Also most roads with 100&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit in summer have 80&amp;nbsp;km/h limit during winter.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HK1" group="fn"&gt;
Speed limits have been signed in kilometres per hour since the 1980s. The unit "km/h" was signed below the number before the late 1990's.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HK2" group="fn"&gt;
Type restriction is not prescribed for private motor vehicles or motor cycles as opposed to goods vehicles and buses. The default speed limit is 50 km/h unless signed otherwise.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HK3" group="fn"&gt;
No default speed limit is mandated on expressways. The lowest signposted limit on main lines is 70 km/h, which is the norm for examples from the 1970's and 80's usually found in urban areas. More commonly, however, 80 km/h is signed. The rural standard is 100 km/h and is signed whenever practicable in the New Territories. The highest limit, 110 km/h, is only used on the island of Lantau.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HK4" group="fn"&gt;
Buses, as well as goods vehicles with a laden weight of 7.5 tonnes, are limited to 70 km/h, minibuses to 80 km/h. Most buses and all minibuses are mechanically restricted. The restriction for goods vehicles is not enforced by the police.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HK5" group="fn"&gt;
The default speed limit in the territory is 50 km/h. 30 km/h may be signed on less used roads built on rough terrain.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="IRL1" group="fn"&gt;
100&amp;nbsp;km/h is default limit on all National Routes regardless of design standard when local limits do not apply; regional and minor routes have an 80 km/h limit. All limits are signposted either way. *On urban motorways such as the M50 (100km/h or 80 km/h) or M1 (as low as 80km/h in places) or in tunnels (80km/h).
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="ISL1" group="fn"&gt;
Iceland does not have expressways/motorways in the traditional sense. There is only one true 'expressway', road 41(Reykjanesbraut), which is built to motorway standard most of its route – grade separated, 2 lanes each direction. However it does not have a higher speed limit. Other such expressways are located within Reykjavík city limits, and the maximum speed is 80&amp;nbsp;km/h.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="ITA1" group="fn"&gt;
A proposed 150&amp;nbsp;km/h limit on a few stretches of six-lanes motorways never went into force.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="MAL1" group="fn"&gt;
The speed limit on Malaysian federal and state roads has been reduced to 80&amp;nbsp;km/h during festive seasons, starting from the 2006 Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;ref name="MEX1" group="fn"&gt;
Some two lane Federal highways are posted at 110&amp;nbsp;km/h provided they have a paved shoulder.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="POL1" group="fn"&gt;
50&amp;nbsp;km/h in built-up areas during the day (from 5 till 23) and 60&amp;nbsp;km/h at night (from 23 till 5)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="ROU1" group="fn"&gt;
Speed limit is 130&amp;nbsp;km/h, but no legal sanction is established for driving within 10&amp;nbsp;km/h over the speed limit.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="FRA1" group="fn"&gt;
Speed limit is 60&amp;nbsp;km/h for trailers on 2-lane non-priority roads.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="FRA2" group="fn"&gt;
Speed limit is 80&amp;nbsp;km/h for lorries and trailers transporting dangerous goods.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="UK2" group="fn"&gt;
UK roads only have three blanket limits for non-towing private vehicles (separate from those for trucks, buses and towing vehicles). 30&amp;nbsp;mph (48&amp;nbsp;km/h) in towns (including dual carriageways), 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) on non-urban single carriageway roads, and 70&amp;nbsp;mph (113&amp;nbsp;km/h) on all dual-carriageway roads and motorways (including rare single-carriageway motorway sections, and [[slip road]]s), which apply without needing signs. Any other limits in force must be clearly posted. For example, 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h) limits are sometimes seen in residential estates and city-centre areas and outside primary schools, whereas 40&amp;nbsp;mph (64&amp;nbsp;km/h) limits are common on major urban through-routes, including many 2-lane single-carriageway residential urban roads, and usually come with both zone start/end signs and small repeaters (with 30&amp;nbsp;mph areas also usually having start/end signs for clarity, but rarely repeaters; 60/70 sections tend to be marked with struck-circle "de-restriction" signs, but very occasionally zone-start and repeaters for clarity or preserving the higher limit on limited-access routes that would otherwise technically class as an urban road). Higher limits in urban areas are usually reserved for limited-access dual carriageways. Lower limits are common on sections of dual carriageways, even on some major intercity routes. Permanent, mandatory lower motorway limits are rare but do exist, e.g. 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) is generally applied on tidal flow sections, in tunnels, some bridges or sections of substandard alignment and junction structure. Variable, legally-enforceable limits for traffic control (including hard-shoulder running at up to 50~60&amp;nbsp;mph) are being gradually introduced (at time of writing, on sections of the M25, M42 and M6) and may go as low as 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 10&amp;nbsp;mph steps. Any other speed signs on motorways are usually advisory-only but may be used for apportioning liability for accidents.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="UK3" group="fn"&gt;
In general, non-urban, all-purpose (i.e. not limited to motor traffic, except in the case of "A(M)" roads) dual carriageways are subject to the same 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit for light vehicles as motorways, but lower limits (50 and 60&amp;nbsp;mph) are in place for heavy trucks, buses/minibuses and towing vehicles. These roads take the place of motorways where a high-traffic trunk route is required but building a motorway would be impractical for reasons of cost and/or geography. For instance, steeper or more winding alignments and less forgiving junctions than would be found on motorways necessitate lower limits for some stretches – as low as 30&amp;nbsp;mph in some cases, e.g. around [[Penmaenbach]] on the A55 in [[Wales]], or a less severe 60&amp;nbsp;mph restriction on some parts of the A38 and A45.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="UK4" group="fn"&gt;
Generally in the UK, lorries over a laden weight of 7500&amp;nbsp;kg are mechanically or electronically speed-limited to 56&amp;nbsp;mph (90&amp;nbsp;km/h) because of overriding European law, even on motorways where they are legally permitted (under UK law) to travel at 60&amp;nbsp;mph. Some heavier machines are further limited to 53&amp;nbsp;mph (85&amp;nbsp;km/h) for the same reasons, and carry warning plates to this effect. Some lorries or trucks with a laden weight between 3500&amp;nbsp;kg and 7500&amp;nbsp;kg are also speed-limited to 56&amp;nbsp;mph (90&amp;nbsp;km/h) on all roads. On non-motorway roads, heavier trucks are legally limited to 50 (single-carriageway) or 60 (dual carriageway) mph (80 and 97&amp;nbsp;km/h) except in scotland where they are limited to 40 (single-carriageway) or 50 (dual carriageway (as of 6 April 2015), Medium trucks and buses/commercial van-based minibuses to 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;mph (80 and 97&amp;nbsp;km/h), though the latter are further subdivided: some are allowed a motorway speed of 60 mph (97 km/h) and others 70&amp;nbsp;mph (113&amp;nbsp;km/h). Light commercial vans are subject to the same 60/70/70&amp;nbsp;mph limits as private cars and motorcycles, and towing cycles/cars/vans subject to medium truck 50/60/60 limits.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="UK5"&gt;
Announced 29 September 2011 and reported in most national newspapers on the 30th, along with expanded plans for 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h) urban limits. As seen in [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/29/speed-limit-raised-80mph The Guardian], [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2043444/UK-motorway-speed-limit-increased-80mph.html Daily Mail] and [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-80mph-motorway-limit-20mph-in-towns-2362980.html Independent]. There has been some suggestion that the higher limit may only apply to electrically powered vehicles, as reported in [http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/259498/ Autocar].
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;ref name="NLD2" group="fn"&gt;
In the [[Netherlands]], only cars or vans pulling a trailer with a total weight of less than 3.5 [[metric ton]]s (with the trailer weighing less than 750 kg) are allowed to drive 90&amp;nbsp;km/h, except where a lower speed limit is posted. Vehicles of other categories (i.e. trucks), as well as cars or vans with a trailer weighing more than 3.5 tons are restricted to 80&amp;nbsp;km/h.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="NLD3" group="fn"&gt;
This is because the 3% are [[rounding|rounded up]]. 3% of 136 km/h is 4.08, which after rounding up results in a tolerance of 5 km/h. Thus after correction for tolerance, a measured speed of 136 km/h results in a fine for driving 131 km/h, or 1 km/h over the speed limit.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="TUR1" group="fn"&gt;
In June 2010, a motion has taken by the Turkish Grand National Assembly to increase the speed limit in double lane highways in rural areas from 90&amp;nbsp;km/h to 110&amp;nbsp;km/h. New law is expected to be valid from July 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AUS1" group="fn"&gt;
Default speed limits in Australia vary between states and territories. See [[Speed limits in Australia]] for more details.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AUS2" group="fn"&gt;
No special limit applies for automobiles with trailers. A 100&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit applies for heavy vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of 12 tonnes or more. A 100&amp;nbsp;km/h limit applies for buses with a gross vehicle mass of 5 tonnes or more. In some Australian states, [[Road Train]]s are limited to 90&amp;nbsp;km/h. In some cases, over steep descents or other potentially dangerous stretches of road, heavy vehicles may have other special speed limits as indicated by signage.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="US1" group="fn"&gt;
The lower speed limit in large inner-cities may be as low as {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for example on I-90/94 which goes through Chicago. In many urban areas, controlled-access highways typically take 5 – 15&amp;nbsp;mph off the speed limit. For example, in Cleveland and Cuyahoga county, the speed limit is {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Once out of the county, the speed limit returns to {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="US2" group="fn"&gt;
The state of Hawaii posts a {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} speed limit on many [[Interstate highways]].

&lt;ref name="UKR1" group="fn"&gt;
New speed limits in Ukraine effective since 1 January 2018.

&lt;ref name="SWE1" group="fn"&gt;
Sweden introduced new speed limits in 2008/2009, where the regular limits 30, 50, 70, 90 and 110&amp;nbsp;km/h are complemented by 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120&amp;nbsp;km/h. Please see [http://www.vv.se/filer/51793/faktablad_080327.pdf this document for more information]{{dead link|date=October 2018|fix-attempted=yes}} In general speed limits of 110 and 120&amp;nbsp;km/h apply on freeways only (4 lanes). However speed limits of 110&amp;nbsp;km/h remain on fence-divided 2–3 lane highways in the northern part of the country. Parts of the east-coast European Route E4 north of the city of Gävle towards Haparanda is an example of this. All other 2–3 lane highways previously zoned at 110&amp;nbsp;km/h have been lowered to either 90 or 100&amp;nbsp;km/h respectively.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="US3" group="fn"&gt;
One toll road near Austin, TX has a speed limit of 85 miles per hour. [http://tucsoncitizen.com/usa-today-news/2012/09/06/texas-sets-usas-highest-speed-limit-85-mph/ 85 MPH Highway Opens]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="SWE2" group="fn"&gt;
The 120&amp;nbsp;km/h limit is currently unenforced by the police due to lack of clarity in the legal text, per [http://www.teknikensvarld.se/2012/01/03/27422/avslojande-fri-fart-pa-120-vagar/ Teknikens Värld, 3 January 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314024935/http://www.teknikensvarld.se/2012/01/03/27422/avslojande-fri-fart-pa-120-vagar/ |date=14 March 2012 }}.

There are no specific speed limits in Venezuela.

'''The Pennsylvania Society''' is an annual weekend retreat for [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's]] politicians and business leaders held in New York City. It began during the late 19th century as a meeting of Pennsylvanians living in New York City who gathered annually beginning in 1899 to discuss events in their home state. As the first few meetings developed into an annual event, it morphed into weekend-long retreat where political networking and fundraising took place in New York's finest clubs, restaurants, and hotels. The main event of the weekend is the "Pennsylvania Society Dinner," which is sponsored by "The Pennsylvania Society," a nonprofit corporation.  In recent years the receptions hosted by lobbyists, political committees, and corporations have taken on increased importance.

It has been criticized because of its image as a stereotypical "[[smoke-filled room]]" where lobby groups gain access to government officials, a few of whom have been known to use taxpayer funds to pay their way to New York. Other observers criticize the retreat for being held in New York instead of within Pennsylvania.

==Origins and organization==
The tradition for Pennsylvania's political and business retreat dates to 1899, when James Barr Ferree, a native Pennsylvanian living in New York invited a group of 55 other Pennsylvanians living in New York to the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] to discuss current affairs in their native state.&lt;ref name=1997PI /&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{Cite web| title = History of The Pennsylvania Society | work = www.pasociety.com| publisher = The Pennsylvania Society| url = http://www.pasociety.com/history.html|accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dinner became a recurring event and the group began calling themselves "The Pennsylvania Society of New York."&lt;ref name=history /&gt; It later developed into an annual gathering of Pennsylvania politicians and businessmen on New York's "neutral ground."&lt;ref name=2005PI /&gt; The organization later changed its name to The Pennsylvania Society and became a nonprofit charitable organization.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{Cite web| title = Welcome to The Pennsylvania Society| work = www.pasociety.com| publisher = The Pennsylvania Society| url = http://www.pasociety.com/index.html|accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated in 1903, and currently claims 2,000 members.&lt;ref name=index /&gt; While it sponsors a high school essay contest,&lt;ref name=scholar&gt;{{Cite web| title = Benjamin Franklin Scholar Award | work =www.pasociety.com | publisher = The Pennsylvania Society| url = http://www.pasociety.com/scholar.html|accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main function of the organization is to organize the weekend retreat.&lt;ref name=1997PI&gt;{{Cite news| last = Eshleman Jr.| first = Russell E. | title = PA. Political, Business Luminaries Cluster| newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]| publisher = Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.| date = December 15, 1997| url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gathering began as an exclusively Republican event, but it now includes a sizable number of Democrats.&lt;ref name=1997PI /&gt; The early years of the meeting were reminiscent of the stereotypical [[smoke-filled room]], where Pennsylvania steel, coal and oil magnates met in closed-door meetings to select their political candidates.&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt;  That public perception continues, with political legend telling of New York-based businessmen summoning Pennsylvania's politicians to New York to receive their instructions for the following year.&lt;ref name=1997PI /&gt;

==Events and receptions==
[[File:Waldorf Astoria foyer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City, site of the Pennsylvania Society Dinner.]]
The main attraction of the weekend is the "Pennsylvania Society Dinner," a [[black tie]] event held in the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] on the final night of the weekend.&lt;ref name=1997PI /&gt; In 2005, about 1,500 individuals attended.&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt; However, much of the "real action" takes place in the invitation-only dinners and receptions hosted by businesses, candidates, and lobbying firms throughout the weekend.&lt;ref name=1997PI /&gt; In an attempt to attract more attendees, hosts have hired top tier guests, including [[Jon Stewart]],&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt; [[Lewis Black]],&lt;ref name=2004PI /&gt; and [[George H.W. Bush]], who ended his 2003 speech with a reference to [[Dana Carvey|Dana Carvey's]] impression of him by saying, "Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent."&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt;  Several events have become well known for drawing high-powered guests, including the events hosted by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association.&lt;ref name=1997PI /&gt; In 2004, an evening at an [[Upper East Side]] cigar lounge hosted by Republican national committeewoman [[Christine Toretti Olson]] gained significant praise from attendees.&lt;ref name=2004PI /&gt; In a 2005 event, [[Rick Santorum]] was able to raise $46,000 for his [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006 re-election campaign]] and $130,000 for the [[Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=2005PI /&gt;

The Pennsylvania Society has become known as the "unofficial start of the next year's big political season" because of its reputation as a place for potential political candidates to make contacts, meet fundraisers, and make a name for themselves early in the electoral process.&lt;ref name=2005PI /&gt;&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt;

Former [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] [[Bill DeWeese]] said in 2003 that the Pennsylvania Society is "a magnificent re-creation of the [[gilded age]] and the era of the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]]s of the late 19th century, when Fricks and Carnegies and Pews dominated Pennsylvania's commercial and political scene. Slender elements of its original purpose endure. However, it is primarily a hell of a party."&lt;ref name=2003PI&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jordan | first = Lara Jakes | title = Political, business bigwigs live it up – as usual – in N.Y.

==Criticism and Counter event==
[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol East Wing panorama.jpg|thumb|right|350px|East Wing of the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]], the site of the "Pennsylvania People's Dinner" protest event.]]
Public watchdogs have criticized the event as a chance for "wealthy special interests to mingle with the movers and shakers in state government" or as a gathering for "[[Fat cat (term)|fat cat]]" politicians away from their Pennsylvania constituents.&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt;

During the 2005 Pennsylvania Society weekend, [[Gene Stilp]] and [[Eric Epstein]], governmental reform and [[2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy|anti-pay raise activists]], hosted the "Pennsylvania People's Dinner," a reform-themed potluck dinner in the "darkened, barely heated" East Wing of the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]] while the members of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] are in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Micek| first = John| authorlink = John Micek| title = State pols gather for annual soiree ; Candidates head to New York City to wine and dine donors.| newspaper = [[The Morning Call]]| date = December 9, 2005 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=littledebbie&gt;{{Cite news| last = Worden| first = Amy| title = It was Little Debbie, not Big Apple Potluck politicking in the Capitol. | newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]| date = December 11, 2005| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event, described as "part parody, part celebration" of the November repeal of the controversial [[2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy|pay raise]], featured paper plates and folding chairs for the [[potluck]] style dinner.&lt;ref name=littledebbie /&gt;  The hosts decorated the capitol with toy pigs, the mascot of the anti-pay-raise movement, and stuffed cows, mocking [[John Perzel|John Perzel's]] defense of the pay raise by claiming that "immigrant cow-milkers" make as much as legislators.&lt;ref name=littledebbie /&gt; The dinner has become an annual event, with the lack of lighting and heating becoming part of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Warner| first = Bob |author2=[[John Baer (journalist)|John Baer]] |author3=[[Gar Joseph]] |author4=Dave Davies | title = Big time in the City | newspaper =[[Philadelphia Daily News]]| date = December 12, 2008| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = | first = | title = Tale of Two Galas| newspaper = [[Bucks County Courier Times]]| date = December 8, 2006| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has undergone several name changes: in 2006 it was called the "Pennsylvania New Society Dinner,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Micek| first = John| authorlink =John Micek | title = [[The Morning Call]]| newspaper = Pennsylvania politicos painting Big Apple red this weekend| date = December 8, 2006| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 it was the "Real Pennsylvania Society Dinner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Adams| first = Helen Colwell| title = Reform ahead?

==Location==
Attendees have been known to enjoy the New York City tourist attractions, including the Broadway theatre and the [[Fifth Avenue]] shopping district almost as much as, if not more than, the political networking opportunities.&lt;ref name=2005PI&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gelbart | first = Marcia |author2=Carrie Budoff | title = Pa. pols just can't resist N.Y. bash. The annual gathering of the Pennsylvania Society has attracted plenty of powerful folks, as usual.| newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]| date = December 11, 2005| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political pundits frequently note the irony of holding the Pennsylvania Society in New York. In 2003, [[Ed Rendell]] suggested that the $20–$40&amp;nbsp;million economic impact from the event would best be directed to a city in Pennsylvania, but said "since I can't get a budget passed, I'm going to leave that for another day."&lt;ref name=2003PI /&gt; In 2005, [[Philadelphia City Council]] unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by [[Frank DiCicco]] calling for the event to be moved within Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=2005PI /&gt;
"Everybody who is anybody, and everybody who wants to be somebody, is there.""The three-day crush of Manhattan cocktail parties known as the Pennsylvania Society is a requisite stop for aspiring candidates and potential donors."&lt;ref name=2004PI&gt;{{Cite news| last = Budoff | first = Carrie |author2=John Sullivan  | title = Political networking in a N.Y. weekend.

Society's 3-day schmooze-athon. | newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = December 12, 2004| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many attendees downplay the Pennsylvania Society's corrupt image, with Ken Davis, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party, telling the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]],'' "I don't know anybody who's been bought at Pennsylvania Society. Rented, maybe – but not bought."&lt;ref name=2005PI /&gt;

[[File:SanctuaryShelter2.jpg|thumb|The wooden shelter commemorating the Sanctuary at Storrington]]

The '''Sanctuary''', near [[Storrington]] in West Sussex, England, was a [[utopian community]] which was founded in 1923 and lasted about a decade.

==Founding and concept==
The founder and central figure of The Sanctuary community was [[Vera Pragnell]] (1897-1968), the daughter of a textile manufacturer. Using her inheritance, she purchased 50 acres of land at [[Heath Common]] and proceeded to give away plots of land free of charge to anyone who was willing to settle there. She lived in a house she named Sanctuary Cottage, part of which was kept open for any passing stranger who needed shelter or refreshment...&lt;ref name="Pragnell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pragnell|first1=Vera|title=The Story of the Sanctuary|date=1928|publisher=The Vine Press|location=Steyning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vera Pragnell was inspired both by Christianity (in particular [[William E. Orchard]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]])&lt;ref name="Hare"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Hare|first1 = Chris|title = The Washington Story|date = 2000|publisher = Washington Parish Council|isbn = 0-9538217-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the principles of pioneering socialist [[Edward Carpenter]].&lt;ref name="Pragnell" /&gt; She imposed no conditions or rules on prospective settlers and insisted that The Sanctuary was open to everyone. Initially, all who came to live there were given a half-acre plot on which they would park a caravan or build a simple house. Eventually communal facilities were created such as a shop, a school and a building used for theatre and dancing.

Lacking a single political or spiritual focus, The Sanctuary attracted a wide range of individuals as residents or visitors, often with unorthodox and radical views. These included pagans such as the occultist, poet and publisher [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg|Victor Neuburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Overton-Fuller|first1=Jean|title=The Magical Dilemma of Victor Neuburg|date=2005|publisher=Mandrake|isbn=1869928792}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dion Byngham, ex-leading light of the [[Order of Woodcraft Chivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutton|first1=Ronald|title=The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192854490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other residents included anarchist W. C. Owen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coates|first1=Chris|title=Utopia Britannica: British Utopian Experiments 1325-1945|date=2001|publisher=Diggers &amp; Dreamers|isbn=9780951494585}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Communist Party members.&lt;ref name="Hare" /&gt; Artists were also attracted to the community, such as the Shakespearian actor [[Wilfred Walter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storrington &amp; District Museum Newsletter 41. Spring 2012|url=http://www.storringtonmuseum.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/issue41.4081920.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the residents and visitors were friends and associates of Edward Carpenter, who was a supporter and inspiration to the community.&lt;ref name = "Rowbotham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowbotham|first1=Sheila|title=Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love|date=2008|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Vera Pragnell published her book "The Story of the Sanctuary" &lt;ref name="Pragnell" /&gt; and dedicated it to the "splendid pioneer" Edward Carpenter with a poem by Victor Neuburg praising Carpenter  as "our Youth's doyen". Vera had a personal connection with Carpenter, as in 1927 she had married the painter Dennis Earle, who had been previously been known as Ted Earle when he was Carpenter's lover &lt;ref name = "Rowbotham" /&gt;

==Decline==
The unconventional lifestyles of some members of the community began to generate scandal in the popular press, with stories featuring nudism and '[[free love]]' and allegations that they encouraged a girl to run away from home and live at the Sanctuary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Young girl wrecked by crooked moral cranks|journal=John Bull (newspaper)|date=2 March 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930s, Vera Pragnell's original inspiration had been lost amid disputes and disillusionment. Sanctuary residents began to register formal ownership of their own properties and from 1934 onwards the area was developed by Earle as a residential estate known as Longbury Hill.&lt;ref name="Hare" /&gt;

During World War II, the Kenyan independence leader [[Jomo Kenyatta]] lived in the area whilst working on a local farm. [[Communist Party (UK)|Communist Party]] youth camps continued to be held there until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hare" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Today, the history of the area is remembered in the street names Vera's Walk and Sanctuary Lane and the houses known as Sanctuary Cottages. A memorial shelter remains, erected and decorated by Dennis Earle, containing boards telling the story of The Sanctuary.

The area known as The Sanctuary was located in the parish of [[Washington, West Sussex]] (not Storrington). Vera Pragnell and Dennis Earle are buried in the graveyard at Washington Parish Church.
 
A play entitled Sanctuary, featuring Vera Pragnell and Victor Neuburg, written by Chris Green, was presented at the 2012 Brighton Fringe Festival.

'''Wabenzi''' is an [[Anglicization]] of the  [[pejorative]] [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[colloquialism]] WaBenzi, originally used in [[Kenya]] to refer to members of the new [[ruling class]] that superseded the [[Colonialism|colonial]] regime, that has come to refer to the new ruling class in any [[post-colonial]] [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] country.&lt;ref&gt;Eliseev, Alex, [http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/it-s-a-wabenzi-frenzy-1.446221 Its a Wabenzi Frenzi] June 2009, IOL News. Retrieved June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to a [[Corruption|corrupt]] government official, or family member of one, and derives from their being seen as driving an imported car. "Wa" is a [[prefix]] that refers to people in some Bantu languages; "benzi" comes from [[Mercedes-Benz]], a car perceived as prestigious. The Anglicized spelling form is more common than the original Bantu WaBenzi.&lt;ref&gt;Naipaul, Shiva, [http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141961972,00.html?strSrchSql=north+of+south/North_of_South_Shiva_Naipaul North of South: an African Journey], September 1996, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0-14-196197-2}}.

The '''Watts truce''' was a 1992 [[peace agreement]] among rival [[street gang]]s in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], declared in the neighborhood of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]. The truce was declared in the days just before the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], and although not universally adhered to, was a major component of the decline of street violence in the city during the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.

==Background==
The truce was influenced by the decision between two rival ''sets'' (sub-groups) within the extensive [[Crips]] gang to call a [[ceasefire]]. Many of the large American street gangs, such as the Crips and their primary rivals the [[Bloods]], had formed in the late 1960s and the 1970s to fight each other, but by the 1980s disorganization and the growth of [[crack cocaine]] had led to infighting among sets within the gangs. By the early 1990s, after 20 years of increasing internecine gang warfare across [[public housing project]]s that saw peak crime rates in Los Angeles, gang members themselves began trying to stem the violence.

==1992 Truce==
In late April 1992, sets from Crips and Bloods in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood in southern Los Angeles convened to negotiate peace. The [[Grape Street Crips]] from the [[Jordan Downs|Jordan Downs Projects]], the [[P Jay Crips|P Jay Watts Crips]] from the Imperial Courts housing projects, and the [[Bounty Hunter Bloods]] from the [[Nickerson Gardens|Nickerson Gardens housing projects]] met in the Imperial Courts Project [[gym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/01/straight_outta_boston.html |title=

Within days of the truce, despite the relative lawlessness caused by the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], most of the [[African-American]] and [[Latino]] gangs in the city declared themselves at peace and there were no major flare ups in violence. The Watts truce is generally credited with contributing to the trend in declining street violence rates in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/04/28/32221/forget-la-riots-1992-gang-truce-was-big-news/|title=Forget the LA Riots – historic 1992 Watts gang truce was the big news |last1=Stoltze |first1=Frank|last2= |first2= |date=April 28, 2012|website=89.3 [[KPCC]] Southern California Public Radio |publisher= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
