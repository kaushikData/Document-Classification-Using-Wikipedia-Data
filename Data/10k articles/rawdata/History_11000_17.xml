{{Slavery}}
The history of '''Puerto Ricans of African descent''' begins with free African men, known as ''libertos,'' who accompanied the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s in the invasion of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afropedea.org/afro-puerto-rican|title=Afro-Puerto Rican|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniards enslaved the [[Taínos]] (the native inhabitants of the island), many of whom died as a result of new [[infectious disease]]s and the Spaniards' oppressive colonization efforts. Spain's royal government needed laborers and began to rely on [[slavery]] to staff their mining and fort-building operations. The Crown authorized importing enslaved West Africans.  As a result, the majority of the African peoples who entered Puerto Rico were part of the forced migration of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and came from many different cultures and peoples of the [[Africa|African continent]].&lt;!-- removed the hardship comment from here, it needs quantifying --&gt;

When the gold mines in Puerto Rico were declared depleted, the Spanish Crown no longer considered the island to be a high colonial priority. Its chief ports served primarily as a garrison to support naval vessels. The Spaniards encouraged [[free people of color]] from British and French possessions in the Caribbean to emigrate to Puerto Rico, to provide a population base to support the Puerto Rican garrison. The Spanish decree of 1789 allowed slaves to earn or buy their freedom; however, this did little to help their situation. The expansion of [[sugar cane]] plantations drove up demand for labor and the slave population increased dramatically as new slaves were imported. Throughout the years, there were many [[slave revolts]] in the island. Slaves who were promised their freedom joined the 1868 uprising against Spanish colonial rule in what is known as the [[Grito de Lares]]. On March 22, 1873, slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico. The contributions of ethnic Africans to the music, art, language, and heritage have been instrumental in Puerto Rican culture.

==First Africans in Puerto Rico==
[[File:AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Slave transport in Africa, depicted in a 19th-century engraving]]
When Ponce de León and the Spaniards arrived on the island of [[Puerto Rico|Borikén]] (Puerto Rico), they were greeted by the [[Cacique]] [[Agüeybaná (The Great Sun)|Agüeybaná]], the supreme leader of the peaceful Taíno tribes on the island. Agüeybaná helped to maintain the peace between the Taíno and the Spaniards. According to historian [[Ricardo Alegria]], in 1509 [[Juan Garrido]] was the first free black man to set foot on the island; he was a [[conquistador]] who was part of [[Juan Ponce de León]]'s entourage. Garrido was born on the West African coast, the son of an African king. In 1508, he joined Juan Ponce de León to explore Puerto Rico and prospect for gold. In 1511, he fought under Ponce de León to repress the Carib and the Taíno, who had joined forces in Puerto Rico in a great revolt against the Spaniards.&lt;ref name="caron"&gt;{{cite web|first=Aimery|last=Caron|url=http://www.choice.vi/~crucian/caron.htm|title=The First West African on St. Croix?|publisher=University of the Virgin Islands|date=September 15, 1990|accessdate=May 9, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101092447/http://www.choice.vi/~crucian/caron.htm|archivedate=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrido next joined [[Hernán Cortés]] in the Spanish conquest of Mexico.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appiah|first1=Anthony|authorlink1=Kwame Anthony Appiah|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|authorlink2=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENx3XTTHXG4C|year=1999|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|isbn=978-0-465-00071-5|page=815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another free black man who accompanied de León was Pedro Mejías. Mejías married a [[Taíno]] woman chief (a cacica), by the name of Yuisa. Yuisa was baptized as Catholic so that she could marry Mejías.&lt;ref name="caron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt; She was given the Christian name of Luisa (the town [[Loíza, Puerto Rico]] was named for her.)

The peace between the Spanish and the Taíno was short-lived. The Spanish took advantage of the Taínos' good faith and enslaved them, forcing them to work in the gold mines and in the construction of forts. Many Taíno died, particularly due to epidemics of [[smallpox]], to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Other Taínos committed suicide or left the island after the failed Taíno revolt of 1511.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yaz|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az2/puertorico/Iagueybana.html|title="PUERTO RICO" GRILLA'S HOMEPAGE|publisher=Angelfire.com|date=June 29, 2001|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Slavechains.gif|right|thumb|Shackles used on slaves in Puerto Rico]] --&gt;

Friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who had accompanied Ponce de León, was outraged at the Spanish treatment of the Taíno. In 1512 he protested at the council of Burgos at the Spanish Court. He fought for the freedom of the natives and was able to secure their rights. The Spanish colonists, fearing the loss of their labor force, also protested before the courts. They complained that they needed manpower to work in the mines, build forts, and supply labor for the thriving sugar cane plantations. As an alternative, Las Casas suggested the importation and use of African slaves. In 1517, the Spanish Crown permitted its subjects to import twelve slaves each, thereby beginning the [[slave trade]] in their colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021226015714/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html|archivedate=2002-12-26|title=Bartoleme de las Casas|publisher=Oregonstate.edu|date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to historian Luis M. Diaz, the largest contingent of African slaves came from the areas of the present-day [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Dahomey]], and the region known as the area of Guineas, together known as the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]. The vast majority were [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]]s, ethnic groups from Nigeria, and [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] from the Guineas. The number of slaves in Puerto Rico rose from 1,500 in 1530 to 15,000 by 1555. The slaves were stamped with a hot iron on the forehead, a branding which meant that they were brought to the country legally and prevented their kidnapping.&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert A. Martinez|url=http://www.ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm|title=African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality|publisher=ipoaa.com|date=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African slaves were sent to work in the gold mines to replace the Taíno, or to work in the [[Field slave|fields]] in the island's ginger and sugar industries. They were allowed to live with their families in a [[Hut (dwelling)|bohio]] (hut) on the master's land, and were given a patch of land where they could plant and grow vegetables and fruits. Blacks had little or no opportunity for advancement and faced discrimination from the Spaniards. Slaves were educated by their masters and soon learned to speak the master's language, educating their own children in the new language.  They enriched the "Puerto Rican Spanish" language by adding words of their own. The Spaniards considered the blacks superior to the Taíno, since the latter were unwilling to assimilate. The slaves, in contrast, had little choice but to adapt to their lives. Many converted (at least nominally) to [[Christianity]]; they were baptized by the [[Catholic Church]] and were given the surnames of their masters. Many slaves were subject to harsh treatment; and women were subject to sexual abuse because of the power relationships. The majority of the Conquistadors and farmers who settled the island had arrived without women; many of them intermarried with the blacks or Taínos. Their [[mixed-race]] descendants formed the first generations of the early Puerto Rican population.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;

In 1527, the first major slave rebellion occurred in Puerto Rico, as dozen of slaves fought against the colonists in a brief revolt.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodriguez|first=Junius P.|authorlink=Junius P. Rodriguez|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXsBJzA61lcC&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=March 28, 2016|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33273-9|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few slaves who escaped retreated to the mountains, where they resided as [[Maroon (people)|maroons]] with surviving Taínos. During the following centuries, by 1873 slaves had carried out more than twenty revolts. Some were of great political importance, such as the Ponce and Vega Baja conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Esclavitud/esclavitud.htm|title=Esclavitud Puerto Rico|publisher=Proyectosalonhogar.com|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1570, the colonists found that the [[gold]] mines were depleted. After gold mining ended on the island, the Spanish Crown bypassed Puerto Rico by moving the western shipping routes to the north. The island became primarily a garrison for those ships that would pass on their way to or from richer colonies. The cultivation of crops such as tobacco, cotton, cocoa, and ginger became the cornerstone of the economy. With the scale of Puerto Rico's economy reduced, colonial families tended to farm these crops themselves, and the demand for slaves was reduced. &lt;!-- In the US South, both tobacco and cotton were extremely labor intensive - why not in PR? --&gt;&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3yO7M6gOeUC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico: Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795-1873''; by: Guillermo A. Baralt (2007; pp. 5 &amp; 6;  Publisher: Markus Wiener Publishers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102084915/https://books.google.com/books?id=U3yO7M6gOeUC&amp;pg=PA5 |date=January 2, 2014 }} {{ISBN|1-55876-463-1}} {{ISBN|978-1-55876-463-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With rising demand for sugar on the international market, major planters increased their cultivation and processing of sugar cane, which was labor-intensive. Sugar [[plantations]] supplanted mining as Puerto Rico's main industry and kept demand high for African slavery. Spain promoted sugar cane development by granting loans and tax exemptions to the owners of the plantations. They were also given permits to participate in the African slave trade.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

To attract more workers, in 1664 Spain offered freedom and land to African-descended people from non-Spanish colonies, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Saint-Domingue]] (later [[Haiti]]). Most of the [[free people of color]] who were able to immigrate were of [[mixed-race]], with African and European ancestry (typically either British or French paternal ancestry, depending on the colony.) The immigrants provided a population base to support the Puerto Rican garrison and its forts. [[Freedmen]] who settled the western and southern parts of the island soon adopted the ways and customs of the Spaniards. Some joined the local [[militia]], which fought against the British in the many British attempts to invade the island. The escaped slaves and the freedmen who emigrated from the West Indies used their former master's surnames, which were typically either English or French. In the 21st century, some ethnic African Puerto Ricans still carry non-Spanish surnames, proof of their descent from these immigrants.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;

After 1784, Spain suspended the use of hot branding the slave's forehead for identification.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt; In addition, it provided ways by which slaves could obtain freedom:

* A slave could be freed by his master in a church or outside it, before a judge, by testament or letter.
* A slave could be freed against his master's will by denouncing a forced rape, by denouncing a counterfeiter, by discovering disloyalty against the king, and by denouncing murder against his master.
* Any slave who received part of his master's estate in his master's will was automatically freed (these bequests were sometimes made to the master's mixed-race slave children, as well as to other slaves for service.) 
* If a slave was made a guardian to his master's children, he was freed. 
* If slave parents in Hispanic America had ten children, the whole family was freed.&lt;ref name="Graces"/&gt;

==Royal Decree of Graces of 1789==
[[File:Royal Decree of Graces of 1789.gif|right|150px|thumb|The Royal Decree of Graces of 1789 which set the rules pertaining to the Slaves in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean]]
In 1789, the Spanish Crown issued the "Royal Decree of Graces of 1789", which set new rules related to the slave trade and added restrictions to the granting of freedman status. The decree granted its subjects the right to purchase slaves and to participate in the flourishing slave trade in the Caribbean. Later that year a new slave code, also known as ''El Código Negro'' (The Black Code), was introduced.&lt;ref name="Code"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/BandoNegro.htm|title=El "Bando Negro" o "Código Negro"|trans-title=The "Black Edict" or "Black Code"|language=es|work=Government Gazette of Puerto Rico|issue=No. 67 - 3 June 1848|publisher=fortunecity.com|date=May 31, 1848|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606200620/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/BandoNegro.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under "El Código Negro," a slave could buy his freedom, in the event that his master was willing to sell, by paying the price sought. Slaves were allowed to earn money during their spare time by working as shoemakers, cleaning clothes, or selling the produce they grew on their own plots of land. Slaves were able to pay for their freedom  by installments. They pay in installments for the freedom of their newborn child, not yet baptized, at a cost of half the going price for a baptized child.&lt;ref name="Code"/&gt; Many of these freedmen started settlements in the areas which became known as Cangrejos ([[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]), [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], [[Loíza, Puerto Rico|Loíza]], and [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico|Luquillo]]. Some became slave owners themselves.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;

The native-born Puerto Ricans (criollos) who wanted to serve in the regular Spanish army petitioned the Spanish Crown for that right. In 1741, the Spanish government established the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico. Many of the former slaves, now freedmen, joined either the Fijo or the local civil militia. Puerto Ricans of African ancestry played an instrumental role in the defeat of Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]] in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] invasion of Puerto Rico in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Don Pedro Tomás|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/Invasion1797.html|title=La invasión británica a Puerto Rico de 1797|trans-title=The British invasion of Puerto Rico of 1797|language=es|publisher=1898 Society of Friends of the History of Puerto Rico|date=1830|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528152544/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/Invasion1797.html|archivedate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these paths to freedom, from 1790 onwards, the number of slaves more than doubled in Puerto Rico as a result of the dramatic expansion of the sugar industry in the island. Every aspect of sugar cultivation, harvesting and processing was arduous and harsh. Many slaves died on the sugar plantations.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

==19th century==

===Notable Puerto Ricans of African descent===&lt;!--These men were each born free, so they were not freedmen; they had never been slaves --&gt;
[[File:Rafael Cordero.JPG|130px|right|thumb|Rafael Cordero]]
*[[Rafael Cordero (educator)|Rafael Cordero]] (1790–1868), was born free in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Of African descent, he became known as "The Father of Public Education in Puerto Rico". Cordero was a self-educated Puerto Rican who provided free schooling to children regardless of their race. Among the distinguished alumni who attended Cordero's school were future abolitionists [[Román Baldorioty de Castro]], [[Alejandro Tapia y Rivera]], and [[José Julián Acosta]]. Cordero proved that racial and economic integration could be possible and accepted in Puerto Rico. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Church, upon the request of San Juan Archbishop [[Roberto González Nieves]], began the process of Cordero's beatification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luis R. Negrón Hernández|url=http://www.preb.com/biog/cordero.htm|title=Rafael Cordero Molina: Teacher of Great Men, Servant of God|publisher=PReb.com|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514141628/http://www.preb.com/biog/cordero.htm|archivedate=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not the only one in his family to become an educator. In 1820, his older sister, [[Celestina Cordero]], established the first school for girls in San Juan.&lt;ref name="PRWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://p-www.iwate-pu.ac.jp/~shigaki/profile/papers/PRW.html|title=A Modern Historical Perspective of Puerto Rican Women|publisher=P-www.iwate-pu.ac.jp|date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[José Campeche]] (1751–1809), born a free man, contributed to the island's culture. Campeche's father, Tomás Campeche, was a freed slave born in Puerto Rico, and his mother María Jordán Marqués came from the [[Canary Islands]]. Since she was considered European (or white), her children were born free. Of mixed-race, Campeche was classified as a [[mulatto]], a common term during his time meaning of African-European descent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Campeche is considered to be the foremost Puerto Rican painter of religious themes of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=7194|title=José Campeche y Jordán|work=Smithsonian American Art Museum|date=2001|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Capt. [[Miguel Henriquez]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1680–17??), was a former pirate who became Puerto Rico's first black military hero by organizing an expeditionary force that defeated the British in the island of Vieques. Capt. Henriques was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques back to the Spanish Empire and Puerto Rico. He was awarded "''La Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie''"; and the Spanish Crown named him "Captain of the Seas," awarding him a [[letter of marque and reprisal]] which granted him the privileges of a [[privateer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xpertia.com/home.asp?tip=usu&amp;id=5&amp;item=pregunta&amp;id_item=81560&amp;idr=67767|title=El corsario Miguel Henriquez|trans-title=The privateer Miguel Henriquez|language=es|work=xpertia.com|date=March 14, 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311040321/http://www.xpertia.com/home.asp?tip=usu&amp;id=5&amp;item=pregunta&amp;id_item=81560&amp;idr=67767|archivedate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}

The [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] was intended to encourage [[Spaniards]] and later other Europeans to settle and populate the colonies of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. The decree encouraged the use of slave labor to revive agriculture and attract new settlers. The new agricultural class immigrating from other countries of Europe used slave labor in large numbers, and harsh treatment was frequent. The slaves resisted -from the early 1820s until 1868, a series of slave uprisings occurred on the island; the last was known as the [[Grito de Lares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icp.gobierno.pr/galeria/archivogeneral/documentos/index.htm|title=Archivo General de Puerto Rico: Documentos|trans-title=General Archives of Puerto Rico: Documents|language=es|work=Institute of Puerto Rican Culture|date=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018040916/http://www.icp.gobierno.pr/galeria/archivogeneral/documentos/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1821, for instance, the slave [[Marcos Xiorro]] planned and conspired to lead a slave revolt against the sugar plantation owners and the Spanish Colonial government. Although the conspiracy was suppressed, Xiorro achieved legendary status among the slaves, and is part of Puerto Rico's heroic folklore.&lt;ref&gt;''Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico: Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795-1873''; by: Guillermo A.

The 1834 Royal Census of Puerto Rico established that 11% of the population were slaves, 35% were colored freemen (also known as [[free people of color]] in French colonies, meaning people of [[mixed-race]]), and 54% were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-History-of-Puerto-Rico4.html|title=The History of Puerto Rico by R.A.

Planters became nervous because of so many slaves; they ordered restrictions, particularly of their movements off a plantation. Rose Clemente, a 21st-century black Puerto Rican columnist, wrote, "Until 1846, Blacks on the island had to carry a notebook (Libreta system) to move around the island, like the passbook system in [[apartheid]] South Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/perspectives/who_is_black07-10-2001.htm|title=Who is Black?|publisher=Finalcall.com|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful slave rebellion against the French in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) in 1803, establishing a new republic, the Spanish Crown became fearful that the "Criollos" (native born) of Puerto Rico and [[Cuba]], her last two remaining possessions, might follow suit. The Spanish government issued the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] to attract European immigrants from non-Spanish countries to populate the island, believing that these new immigrants would be more loyal to Spain than the mixed-race Criollos. However, they did not expect the new immigrants to racially intermarry, as they did, and to identify completely with their new homeland.&lt;ref name="Graces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XIXE/castelar/esclavitud/cedula.htm|title=Teoría, Crítica e Historia: La abolición de la esclavitud y el mundo hispano|publisher=Ensayistas.org|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, most of the former Spanish possessions in the Americans had achieved independence.

On May 31, 1848, the Governor of Puerto Rico Juan Prim, in fear of an independence or slavery revolt, imposed draconian laws, ''"El Bando contra La Raza Africana",'' to control the behavior of all Black Puerto Ricans, free or slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guillermo A.

On September 23, 1868, slaves, who had been promised freedom, participated in the short failed revolt against Spain which became known as "''[[El Grito de Lares]]''" or "The Cry of Lares". Many of the participants were imprisoned or executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nylatinojournal.com/home/history/americas/el_grito_de_lares.html|title=El Grito de Lares|publisher=New York Latino Journal|date=September 23, 2006|accessdate=July 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021222236/http://nylatinojournal.com/home/history/americas/el_grito_de_lares.html|archive-date=2008-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--on what grounds were slaves promised their freedom in 1868? This event usually is referred to with these words, and it is confusing.--&gt;

During this period, Puerto Rico provided a means for people to leave some of the racial restrictions behind: under such laws as ''Regla del Sacar'' or ''Gracias al Sacar,'' a person of African ancestry could be considered legally white if able to prove they also had ancestors with at least one person per generation in the last four generations who had been legally white. Therefore, people of black ancestry with known white lineage became classified as white. This was the opposite of the later "one-drop rule" of hypodescent in the United States, whereby persons of any known African ancestry were classified as black.&lt;ref name="Kinsbruner1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsbruner|first=Jay|authorlink=Jay Kinsbruner|title=Not of Pure Blood: The Free People of Color and Racial Prejudice in Nineteenth-century Puerto Rico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLSU-SiojsYC|accessdate=March 29, 2016|year=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-1842-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As white Democrats regained power in state legislatures after the Reconstruction era, they asserted [[white supremacy]], and passed laws for [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]]. The one-drop rule was formalized in laws passed in the South in the early 20th century, after the whites had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] at the turn of the century by creating barriers to voter registration and voting.

During the 19th century, however, many southern states had looser constructions of race; in early 19th-century Virginia, for instance, if a person was seven-eighths white and free, the individual was considered legally white. Children born to slave mothers were considered slaves, no matter what their ancestry, and many were of mixed heritage.&lt;ref name="Rothman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothman|first=Joshua D.|title=Notorious in the Neighborhood: Sex and Families Across the Color Line in Virginia, 1787–1861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qo_O79bblBwC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=March 29, 2016|year=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-2768-0|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most famous were the mixed-race children of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by his slave [[Sally Hemings]]. He freed all four surviving children when they came of age: two informally, by letting them "walk away," and the two younger sons in his will.

===Abolitionists===
[[File:Porto Rican Peones (Puerto Rican Peons-- Children).jpg|left|300px|thumb|[[Peon]]es in Puerto Rico, 1898]]
During the mid-19th century, a committee of [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] was formed in Puerto Rico that included many prominent Puerto Ricans. Dr. [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]] (1827–1898), whose parents were wealthy landowners, believed in abolitionism, and together with fellow Puerto Rican abolitionist [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]] (1829–1867), founded a clandestine organization called "The Secret Abolitionist Society." The objective of the society was to free slave children by paying for freedom when they were baptized. The event, which was also known as ''"aguas de libertad"'' (waters of liberty), was carried out at the [[Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria Cathedral]] in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]]. When the child was baptized, Betances would give money to the parents, which they used to buy the child's freedom from the master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oscar G.

[[José Julián Acosta]] (1827–1891) was a member of a Puerto Rican commission, which included Ramón Emeterio Betances, Segundo Ruiz Belvis, and [[Francisco Mariano Quiñones]] (1830–1908). The commission participated in the "Overseas Information Committee" which met in [[Madrid]], Spain. There, Acosta presented the argument for the abolition of [[slavery in Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonai.com/promociones/biografias/0201/julian_acosta.asp|title=José J.

On March 22, 1873, the Spanish government approved what became known as the [[Moret Law]], which provided for gradual abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/baldorioty.html|title=The World of 1898: The Spanish–American War: Román Baldorioty de Castro 1822–1889|publisher=Hispanic Division, Library of Congress|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edict granted freedom to slaves over 60 years of age, those belonging to the state, and children born to slaves after September 17, 1868.

The Moret Law established the Central Slave Registrar. In 1872 it began gathering the following data on the island's slave population: name, country of origin, present residence, names of parents, sex, marital status, trade, age, physical description, and master's name. This has been an invaluable resource for historians and genealogists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubacreme.com/documents/loi-moret-es.htm|title=Ley Moret: Ley para los esclavos en Cuba|trans-title=Moret Law: Law for slaves in Cuba|language=es|publisher=cubacreme.com|date=July 4, 1870|accessdate=July 23, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018214100/http://www.cubacreme.com/documents/loi-moret-es.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition of slavery===
[[File:Indemnity bond.gif|right|thumb|160px|Indemnity bond paid as compensation to former owners of freed slaves]]
On March 22, 1873, slavery was "abolished" in Puerto Rico, but with one significant caveat. The slaves were not emancipated; they had to ''buy'' their own freedom, at whatever price was set by their last masters. The law required that the former slaves work for another three years for their former masters, other people interested in their services, or for the "state" in order to pay some compensation.&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web|author=José R. Bas García|url=http://www.independencia.net/historia/jrb_abolicionEsclavitudPR23mar09.html|title=La abolición de la esclavitud de 1873 en Puerto Rico|trans-title=The abolition of slavery in 1873 in Puerto Rico|language=es|work=Center for Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean|publisher=independencia.net|date=March 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319000600/http://www.independencia.net/historia/jrb_abolicionEsclavitudPR23mar09.html|archivedate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former slaves earned money in a variety of ways: some by trades, for instance as shoemakers, or laundering clothes, or by selling the produce they were allowed to grow, in the small patches of land allotted to them by their former masters. In a sense, they resembled the black [[sharecroppers]] of the southern U.S. after the [[American Civil War]], but the latter did not own their land. They simply farmed another's land, for a share of the crops raised.&lt;ref name="Code"/&gt; The government created the Protector's Office which was in charge of overseeing the transition. The Protector's Office was to pay any difference owed to the former master once the initial contract expired.

The majority of the freed slaves continued to work for their former masters, but as free people, receiving wages for their labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/slaves.html|title=The World of 1898: The Spanish–American War: Abolition of Slavery in Puerto Rico|publisher=Hispanic Division, Library of Congress|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the former slave decided not to work for his former master, the Protectors Office would pay the former master 23% of the former slave's estimated value, as a form of compensation.&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt;

The freed slaves became integrated into Puerto Rico's society. [[Racism]] has existed in Puerto Rico, but it is not considered to be as severe as other places in the New World, possibly because of the following factors:
* In the 8th century, nearly all of Spain was conquered (711–718), by the [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] who had crossed over from North Africa. The first Africans were brought to Spain during Arab domination by North African merchants. By the middle of the 13th century, Christians had reconquered the Iberian peninsula. A section of [[Seville]], which once was a Moorish stronghold, was inhabited by thousands of Africans. Africans became freemen after converting to Christianity, and they lived integrated in Spanish society. African women were highly sought after by Spanish males. Spain's exposure to people of color over the centuries accounted for the positive racial attitudes that prevailed in the New World. Historian Robert Martínez thought it was unsurprising that the first conquistadors intermarried with the native Taíno and later with the African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm|title=Africa &amp; Puerto Rico|publisher=Ipoaa.com|date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Catholic Church played an [[Catholic Church and slavery|instrumental role]] in preserving the human dignity and working for the social integration of the African man in Puerto Rico. The church insisted that every slave be baptized and converted to the Catholic faith. Church doctrine held that master and slave were equal before the eyes of God, and therefore brothers in Christ with a common moral and religious character. Cruel and unusual punishment of slaves was considered a violation of the fifth commandment.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;
* When the gold mines were declared depleted in 1570 and mining came to an end in Puerto Rico, the majority of the white Spanish settlers left the island to seek their fortunes in the richer colonies such as Mexico; the island became a Spanish garrison. The majority of those who stayed behind were either African or [[mulatto]]es (of mixed race). By the time Spain reestablished commercial ties with Puerto Rico, the island had a large multiracial population. After the Spanish Crown issued the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, it attracted many European immigrants, in effect "whitening" the island into the 1850s. But, the new arrivals also intermarried with native islanders, and added to the multiracial population. They also identified with the island, rather than simply with the rulers.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;

Two Puerto Rican writers have written about racism; [[Abelardo Diaz Alfaro|Abelardo Díaz Alfaro]] (1916–1999) and [[Luis Palés Matos]] (1898–1959), who was credited with creating the poetry genre known as Afro-Antillano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edgardo Rodríguez Juliá|author-link=Edgardo Rodríguez Juliá|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1998/04/19/sem-julia.html|title=Utopia Y Nostalgia En Pales Matos|publisher=Jornada.unam.mx|date=April 19, 1998|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish–American War==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1898 settled the [[Spanish–American War]], which ended the centuries-long Spanish control over Puerto Rico.

One Puerto Rican politician of African descent who distinguished himself during this period was the physician and politician [[José Celso Barbosa]] (1857–1921). On July 4, 1899, he founded the pro-statehood Puerto Rican Republican Party and became known as the "Father of the Statehood for Puerto Rico" movement. Another distinguished Puerto Rican of African descent, who advocated Puerto Rico's independence, was [[Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]] (1874–1938). After emigrating to New York City in the United States, he amassed an extensive collection in preserving manuscripts and other materials of black Americans and the African diaspora. He is considered by some to be the "Father of Black History" in the United States, and a major study center and collection of the New York Public Library is named for him, the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]]. He coined the term ''Afroborincano,'' meaning African-Puerto Rican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Knight|url=http://www.cwo.com/~lucumi/schomburg.html|title=Arturo Alfonso "Afroborinqueno" Schomburg|publisher=cwo.com|date=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000142/http://www.cwo.com/~lucumi/schomburg.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
[[File:Pedro Albizu Campos.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Lieutenant Pedro Albizu Campos (U.S. Army)]]
After the [[United States Congress]] approved the [[Jones-Shafroth Act|Jones Act]] of 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted US [[United States citizenship|citizenship]]. As citizens Puerto Ricans were eligible for the military draft, and many were drafted into the armed forces of the United States during World War I. The armed forces were segregated until after World War II. Puerto Ricans of African descent were subject to the discrimination which was rampant in the military and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/jonesact.html|title=Jones Act - The World of 1898: The Spanish–American War (Hispanic Division, Library of Congress)|publisher=Loc.gov|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Puerto Ricans residing in the mainland United States were assigned to all-black units. [[Rafael Hernández Marín|Rafael Hernández]] (1892–1965) and his brother Jesus, along with 16 more Puerto Ricans, were recruited by [[Jazz]] bandleader [[James Reese Europe]] to join the [[United States Army]]'s Orchestra Europe. They were assigned to the 369th Infantry Regiment, an African-American regiment; it gained fame during World War I and was nicknamed "[[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|The Harlem Hell Fighters]]" by the [[German people|Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salsa-merengue.co.uk/4bohemians/great_salsa_timeline.html|title=The Great Salsa Timeline|work=Salsa-merengue.co.uk|date=1999|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Nadal|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=6589|title=James Reese Europe: Biography|publisher=allaboutjazz.com|date=July 8, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214143509/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=6589|archivedate=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also segregated military units in Puerto Rico. [[Pedro Albizu Campos]] (1891–1965), who later became the leader of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], held the rank of lieutenant. He founded the "Home Guard" unit of Ponce and was later assigned to the 375th Infantry Regiment, an all-[[Black people|black Puerto Rican]] regiment, which was stationed in Puerto Rico and never saw combat. Albizu Campos later said that the discrimination which he witnessed in the Armed Forces, influenced the development of his political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hunter|last1=Stephen|title=American Gunfight: The Plot to Kill Harry Truman--and the Shoot-out that Stopped It|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date=2005|isbn=0-7432-8195-0|first2=John|last2=Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

Puerto Ricans of African descent were discriminated against in sports. Puerto Ricans who were dark-skinned and wanted to play [[Major League Baseball]] in the United States, were not allowed to do so. In 1892 organized baseball had codified a color line, barring [[African-American]] players, and any player who was dark-skinned, from any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolton |first=Todd |title=History of the Negro Major Leagues |publisher=Negro League Baseball Players Association |url=http://www.nlbpa.com/history.html |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220152334/http://www.nlbpa.com/history.html |archivedate=December 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ethnic African-Puerto Ricans continued to play baseball. In 1928, [[Emilio Navarro|Emilio "Millito" Navarro]] traveled to New York City and became the first Puerto Rican to play baseball in the [[Negro League]]s when he joined the [[Cuban Stars (East)|Cuban Stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emilio 'Millito' Navarro dies at 105|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=6457594|newspaper=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The persistence of these men paved the way for the likes of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famers]] [[Roberto Clemente]] and [[Orlando Cepeda]], who played in the Major Leagues after the colorline was broken by [[Jackie Robinson]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947; they were inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] for their achievements. Cepeda's father [[Pedro Cepeda]], was denied a shot at the major leagues because of his color. Pedro Cepeda was one of the greatest players of his generation, the dominant hitter in the [[Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente|Professional Baseball League of Puerto Rico]] after its founding in 1938. He refused to play in the [[Negro Leagues]] due to his abhorrence of the racism endemic to the segregated United States.&lt;ref name="Babe Cobb"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cope|first=Myron|title=The Babe Cobb Of Puerto Rico|journal=Sports Illustrated|volume=24|issue=20|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1078556/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175704/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1078556/index.htm|archivedate=2013-11-05|accessdate=September 11, 2013|date=May 16, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Puerto Ricans also participated in other sports as international contestants. In 1917, [[Nero Chen]] became the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain international recognition when he fought against (Panama) Joe Gan at the "Palace Casino" in New York.&lt;ref name="PPNY"&gt;''Pioneros Puertorriqueños en Nueva York''; by Joaquin Colon Lopez; pages: 229, 230; Publisher: Arte Publico Press (November 2001); {{ISBN|1-55885-335-9}}; {{ISBN|978-1-55885-335-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1948 Summer Olympics (the XIV Olympics), celebrated in London, boxer [[Juan Evangelista Venegas]] made sports history by becoming Puerto Rico's first Olympic medal winner when he beat Belgium's representative, Callenboat, on points for a unanimous decision. He won the bronze medal in boxing in the [[Bantamweight]] division.&lt;ref name="PRH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n30/PRSportsBeat0630-en.html |title=Commonwealth Gives Puerto Rico A Sports Identity |publisher=Puerto Rico Herald |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193045/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n30/PRSportsBeat0630-en.html |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was also historic because it was the first time that Puerto Rico had participated as a nation in an international sporting event. It was common for impoverished Puerto Ricans to use boxing as a way to earn an income.

On March 30, 1965, [[José Torres|José "Chegui" Torres]] defeated [[Willie Pastrano]] by technical knockout and won the [[World Boxing Council]] and [[World Boxing Association]] [[List of light heavyweight boxing champions|light heavyweight championships]].

Among those who exposed the racism and discrimination in the US which Puerto Ricans, especially Black Puerto Ricans, were subject to, was [[Jesús Colón]]. Colón is considered by many as the "Father of the [[Nuyorican]] movement." He recounted his experiences in New York as a Black Puerto Rican in his book ''Lo que el pueblo me dice--: crónicas de la colonia puertorriqueña en Nueva York'' (What the people tell me---: Chronicles of the Puerto Rican colony in New York).&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rouzie/569A/benington/bios.htm|title=Biography of Jesus Colon (1901–1974)|work=Biographical Dictionary of Hispanic Literature in the United States|publisher=oak.cats.ohiou.edu|date=1989|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608065941/http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rouzie/569A/benington/bios.htm|archivedate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of discrimination say that a majority of Puerto Ricans are racially mixed, but that they do not feel the need to identify as such. They argue that Puerto Ricans tend to assume that they are of Black African, American Indian, and European ancestry and only identify themselves as "mixed" only if they have parents who appear to be of distinctly different "races". Puerto Rico underwent a "whitening" process while under U.S. rule. There was a dramatic change in the numbers of people who were classified as "black" and "white" Puerto Ricans in the 1920 census, as compared to that in 1910. The numbers classified as "Black" declined sharply from one census to another (within 10 years' time). Historians suggest that more Puerto Ricans classified others as white because it was advantageous to do so at that time. In those years, census takers were generally the ones to enter the racial classification. Due to the power of Southern white Democrats, the US Census dropped the category of mulatto or mixed race in the 1930 census, enforcing the artificial binary classification of black and white. Census respondents were not allowed to choose their own classifications until the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It may have been that it was popularly thought it would be easier to advance economically and socially with the US if one were "white".&lt;ref name="How Puerto Rico Became White"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/demsem/loveman-muniz.pdf#search='race%20classification%20Puerto%20Rico|format=PDF|title=How Puerto Rico Became White: An Analysis of Racial Statistics in the 1910 and 1920 Censuses|publisher=Ssc.wisc.edu|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African influence in Puerto Rican culture==
The descendants of the former African slaves became instrumental in the development of Puerto Rico's political, economic and cultural structure. They overcame many obstacles and have contributed to the island's entertainment, sports, literature and scientific institutions. Their contributions and heritage can still be felt today in Puerto Rico's art, music, cuisine, and religious beliefs in everyday life. In Puerto Rico, March 22 is known as "Abolition Day" and it is a holiday celebrated by those who live in the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shagtown.com/days/puertorico.html|title=Encyclopedia of Days: Puerto Rico|publisher=shagtown.com|date=2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093145/http://www.shagtown.com/days/puertorico.html|archivedate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Many African slaves imported to Cuba and Puerto Rico spoke [[Bozal Spanish|"Bozal" Spanish]], a [[Creole language]] that was Spanish-based, with Congolese and Portuguese influence.&lt;ref name="clements"&gt;Clements, J.

Puerto Rican musical instruments such as barriles, drums with stretched animal skin, and Puerto Rican music-dance forms such as [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|Bomba]] or [[Plena]] are likewise rooted in Africa. Bomba represents the strong African influence in Puerto Rico. Bomba is a music, rhythm and dance that was brought by West African slaves to the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evan Bailyn|url=http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/genre/bomba/|title=Music Genre: Bomba|publisher=Music of Puerto Rico|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plena is another form of folkloric music of African origin. Plena was brought to [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] by blacks who immigrated north from the English-speaking islands south of Puerto Rico. Plena is a rhythm that is clearly African and very similar to Calypso, Soca and Dance hall music from [[Trinidad]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909182640/http://www.rhythmweb.com/jorge/plena.htm Rhythms of Puerto Rico by Jorge Ginorio] (Archived of [http://www.rhythmweb.com/jorge/plena.htm the original] on July 20, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bomba and Plena were played during the festival of Santiago (St. James), since slaves were not allowed to worship their own gods. Bomba and Plena evolved into countless styles based on the kind of dance intended to be used. These included ''leró, yubá, cunyá, babú'' and ''belén.'' The slaves celebrated baptisms, weddings, and births with the "bailes de bomba". Slaveowners, for fear of a rebellion, allowed the dances on Sundays. The women dancers would mimic and poke fun at the slave owners. Masks were and still are worn to ward off evil spirits and pirates. One of the most popular masked characters is the ''Vejigante'' (vey-hee-GANT-eh). The [[Vejigante]] is a mischievous character and the main character in the Carnivals of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipsonfire.com/HistoryInfo/diccionario.htm|title=Hips On Fire ~ Latino Dance Instruction, Performances &amp; DJ Services|publisher=Hipsonfire.com|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1953, Bomba and Plena were virtually unknown outside Puerto Rico. Island musicians [[Rafael Cortijo]] (1928–1982), [[Ismael Rivera]] (1931–1987) and the El Conjunto Monterrey orchestra introduced Bomba and Plena to the rest of the world. What Rafael Cortijo did with his orchestra was to modernize the Puerto Rican folkloric rhythms with the use of piano, bass, saxophones, trumpets, and other percussion instruments such as timbales, bongos, and replace the typical barriles (skin covered barrels) with congas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losplenerosdela21.org/artists.html|title=Nellie Tanco: Vocalist, Pandereta Seguidor|publisher=The Artists of Los Pleneros de la 21|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624090943/http://www.losplenerosdela21.org/artists.html|archivedate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rafael Cepeda]] (1910–1996), also known as "The Patriarch of Bomba and Plena", was the patriarch of the Cepeda family. The family is one of the most famous exponents of Puerto Rican folk music, with generations of musicians working to preserve the African heritage in Puerto Rican music. The family is well known for their performances of the bomba and plena folkloric music and are considered by many to be the keepers of those traditional genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netdial.caribe.net/~leviatan/don_rafael.html|title=Don Rafael Cepeda Atiles: Patriarca de la Bomba...y Plena (1910-1996)|trans-title=Don Rafael Cepeda Atiles: Patriarch to the Bomba ... and Plena (1910-1996)|language=es|publisher=netdial.caribe.net|date=|accessdate=July 20, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619010526/http://netdial.caribe.net/~leviatan/don_rafael.html|archivedate=June 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sylvia del Villard]] (1928–1990) was a member of the Afro-Boricua Ballet.

===Cuisine===

Nydia Rios de Colon, a contributor to the ''Smithsonian Folklife Cookbook,'' also offers culinary seminars through the Puerto Rican Cultural Institute. She writes of the cuisine:

{{quotebox|Puerto Rican cuisine also has a strong African influence. The melange of flavors that make up the typical Puerto Rican cuisine counts with the African touch. Pasteles, small bundles of meat stuffed into a dough made of grated green banana (sometimes combined with pumpkin, potatoes, plantains, or yautía) and wrapped in plantain leaves, were devised by African women on the island and based upon food products that originated in Africa."—Nydia Rios de Colon, ''Arts Publications''}}

Similarly, Johnny Irizarry and Maria Mills have written: 
{{quotebox|"The salmorejo, a local land crab creation, resembles Southern cooking in the United States with its spicing. The mofongo, one of the island's best-known dishes, is a ball of fried mashed plantain stuffed with pork crackling, crab, lobster, shrimp, or a combination of all of them. Puerto Rico's cuisine embraces its African roots, weaving them into its Indian and Spanish influences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Johnny Irizarry|author2=Maria Mills-Torres|author3=Marta Moreno Vega|author4=Anita Rivera|url=http://www.cosmos.ne.jp/~miyagawa/nagocnet/data/prhistory.html|title=Puerto Rico: Resistance in Paradise: Rethinking 100 Years of U.S. Involvement in the Caribbean and the Pacific|work=American Friends Service Committee|publisher=cosmos.ne.jp|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222012007/http://www.cosmos.ne.jp/~miyagawa/nagocnet/data/prhistory.html|archivedate=February 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary A.

===Religion===
[[File:Santeria artifacts.gif|thumb|160px|Santería artifacts]]
In 1478, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], established an ecclesiastical tribunal known as the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. It was intended to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in their kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Homza, Lu Ann (2006). ''The Spanish Inquisition, 1478&amp;ndash;1614''; Page xxv, Hackett Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87220-795-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the western hemisphere. Africans were not allowed to practice non-Christian, native religious beliefs. No single organized ethnic African religion survived intact from the times of slavery to the present in Puerto Rico. But, many elements of African spiritual beliefs have been incorporated into [[syncretic]] ideas and practices. [[Santería]], a [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]]-Catholic syncretic mix, and ''[[Palo Mayombe]],'' Kongolese traditions, are also practiced in Puerto Rico, the latter having arrived there at a much earlier time. A smaller number of people practice [[West African Vodun|Vudú]], which is derived from [[Dahomey]] mythology.&lt;ref name="OECD Data Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|format=XLS|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls|title=unrelated?|work=oecd.org|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511105416/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls|archivedate=May 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Palo Mayombe,'' or Congolese traditions, existed for several centuries before Santería developed during the 19th century. [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]] became nicknamed "the city of witches", because the religion was widely practiced in this town. ''Santeria'' is believed to have been organized in Cuba among its slaves. The Yoruba were brought to many places in the Caribbean and Latin America. They carried their traditions with them, and in some places, they held onto more of them. In Puerto Rico and Trinidad Christianity was dominant. Although converted to Christianity, the captured Africans did not abandon their traditional religious practices altogether. [[Lucumi religion|Santería]] is a syncretic religion created between the diverse images drawn from the Catholic Church and the representational deities of the African Yoruba ethnic group of [[Nigeria]]. Santería is widely practiced in the town of Loíza.&lt;ref name="Santería"&gt;{{cite web|author=Zenith Harris Merrill|url=http://www.bloomington.in.us/~lgthscac/santeria.htm|title=Santeria, the Orisha Tradition of Voudou: Divination, Dance, &amp; Initiation|publisher=bloomington.in.us|date=2002|accessdate=July 23, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714071545/http://www.bloomington.in.us/~lgthscac/santeria.htm|archivedate=July 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister traditions emerged in their own particular ways on many of the smaller islands. Similarly, throughout Europe, early Christianity absorbed influences from differing practices among the peoples, which varied considerably according to region, language and ethnicity.

Santería has many deities said to be the "top" or "head" God. These deities, which are said to have descended from heaven to help and console their followers, are known as "[[Orisha]]s." According to Santería, the Orishas are the ones who choose the person each will watch over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timboucher.com/journal/2006/07/24/at-the-crossroads|title=My First Santeria Reading|publisher=At the Crossroads - Pop Occulture Blog|date=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623142218/http://www.timboucher.com/journal/2006/07/24/at-the-crossroads|archivedate=June 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other religions where a worshiper is closely identified with a sect (such as [[Christianity]]), the worshiper is not always a "Santero". Santeros are the priests and the only official practitioners. (These "Santeros" are not to be confused with the Puerto Rico's craftsmen who carve and create religious statues from wood, which are also called Santeros). A person becomes a Santero if he passes certain tests and has been chosen by the Orishas.&lt;ref name="Santería"/&gt;

Heavy European immigration swelled Puerto Rico's population to about one million by the end of the 19th century, decreasing the proportion Africans made of Puerto Rico. In the early decades under US rule, census takers began to shift from classifying people as black to "white" and the society underwent what was called a "whitening" process from the 1910 to the 1920 census, in particular. During the mid 20th century, the US government forcefully sterilized Puerto Rican women, especially non-white Puerto Rican women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/puertorico.html |title=35% of Puerto Rican Women Sterilized |publisher=Uic.edu |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430130413/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/puertorico.html |archivedate=April 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

11% of Puerto Ricans identify as of multi-ethnic ancestry, and generally only as of "mixed race". Afro-Puerto Ricans have not had to cope with the same political situation as African Americans, who identified as black in part to collect their political power when trying to gain enforcement of their civil rights and protection of voting. However, in the 21st century, Puerto Rico is having a resurgence in black affiliation, mainly due to famous Afro-Puerto Ricans promoting black pride among the Puerto Rican community. In addition, Afro-Puerto Rican youth are learning more of their peoples' history from textbooks that encompass more Afro-Puerto Rican history.&lt;ref name="How Puerto Rico Became White"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativetimes.com/news/federal/5143-puerto-rico-sees-increase-in-blacks-american-indians|title=Puerto Rico sees increase in blacks, American Indians|publisher=Nativetimes.com|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2011/06/26/puerto-rico-afro-caribbean-and-taino-identity/|title=Puerto Rico: Afro-Caribbean and Taíno Identity|publisher=Repeating Islands|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 US census recorded the first drop of the percentage whites made up of Puerto Rico, and the first rise in the black percentage, in over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2011/03/31/prico_sees_increase_in_blacks_american_indians/|title=PRico sees increase in blacks, American Indians|publisher=Boston.com|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the  factors that may possibly perpetuate this trend include: more Puerto Ricans may start to identify as black, due to increasing black pride and African cultural awareness throughout the island, as well as an increasing number of black immigrants, especially from the Dominican Republic and Haiti, many of whom are illegal immigrants, &lt;ref&gt;[http://minorityrights.org/minorities/dominicans/ Minority Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/26/haitian-illegal-immigration-through-puerto-rico-is-skyrocketing-too/ HAITIAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THROUGH PUERTO RICO IS SKYROCKETING TOO]&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing emigration of white Puerto Ricans to the mainland US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2008/09/03/94243997/tego-calderon-reggaeton-on-black-pride|title=Tego Calderon: Reggaeton On Black Pride|publisher=NPR|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2012/12/african-descendants-in-puerto-rico-afro.html|title=Trip Down Memory Lane: African Descendants In Puerto Rico (Afro-Puerto Ricans)|publisher=Kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latinousa.org/2014/03/28/border-puerto-ricos-seas/|title=The Other Border: Puerto Rico's Seas|publisher=Latino USA|date=March 28, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/26/haitian-illegal-immigration-through-puerto-rico-is-skyrocketing-too/|title=Illegal Immigration Through Puerto Rico Is Skyrocketing Too|publisher=The Daily Caller|date=July 26, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/surge-of-migrants-being-smuggled-to-united-states-through-puerto-rico/|title=Surge of migrants being smuggled to United States through Puerto Rico|publisher=CBS News|date=July 26, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/haitian-immigrants-puerto-rico-_n_3225298.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507100317/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/haitian-immigrants-puerto-rico-_n_3225298.html|archivedate=2013-05-07|title=Haiti Immigrants Using Puerto Rico As Gateway To U.S. In New Migrant Route|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Greenblatt|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/06/02/318289167/dozens-of-haitian-migrants-abandoned-near-puerto-rico|title=Dozens Of Haitian Migrants Abandoned Near Puerto Rico: The Two-Way|publisher=NPR|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/08/01/third-border-crisis-number-haitian-migrants-heading-to-puerto-rico-jumps/|title='Third Border' Crisis: Number Of Haitian Migrants Heading To Puerto Rico Jumps|publisher=Latino.foxnews.com|date=August 1, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-03-11/puerto-rico-economy-brain-drain-exodus/53490820/1|title=Puerto Rico losing professionals to U.S. states|publisher=usatoday.com|date=March 11, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/data-pr-brain-drain-rate-picked-up-93282.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214122704/http://caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/data-pr-brain-drain-rate-picked-up-93282.html|archivedate=2014-02-14|title=Data: PR 'brain drain' rate picked up|publisher=Caribbeanbusinesspr.com|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following lists only include only the number of people who identify as black and do not attempt to estimate everyone with African ancestry. As noted in the earlier discussion, several of these cities were places where freedmen gathered after gaining freedom, establishing communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6577">'''Alun Howkins''' (8 August 1947 – 12 July 2018) was an English social historian, specialising in the history of English rural society. Regarded as a leading historian of the English countryside and its working class, Howkins was a professor of history at the [[University of Sussex]] and co-founder of the journal ''[[Rural History (journal)|Rural History]]''.

== Early life ==

=== Background ===
Howkins was born in [[Bicester]] on 8 August 1947 into a [[Working class|working-class]] family; his father, a [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] supporter, was a mechanic but a head injury sustained in [[World War II]] led him to take up less skilled worked as a store man later in life; Howkins' mother worked night-shifts in a hospital.&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;"Professor Alun Howkins", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 August 2018, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Oral-historians/021M-C1149X0010XX-0001V0 "Howkins, Alun (1 of 17).  Oral History of Oral History"] (transcription of oral history interview), [[British Library]]. Retrieved 22 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; After failing the [[Eleven-plus|eleven-plus examination]], he attended [[Bicester Highfield Secondary Modern School]]; he later moved to a technical college in [[Banbury]], but after he was expelled aged 15 he became an [[apprentice]] [[farm labourer]].&lt;ref name="tel" /&gt; 

=== Work, trade unionism and Ruskin College ===
Within a year and a half he had taken up a job at the ordnance depot in Bicester and in 1964 joined [[Pergamon Press]] as a [[Copy editing|copyeditor]]. Howkins had become involved with [[trade unionism]] while working as a farm labourer and at Pergamon he established a branch of the [[Clerical and Administrative Workers Union]]. He was introduced to the world of [[folk music]] at the same time, and through that the Communist Party. He was fired from his job at Pergamon in 1966 and worked for [[Blackwell's]] in [[Oxford]] for two years before enrolling at [[Ruskin College]] in Oxford, where he was taught by [[Raphael Samuel]] and became heavily involved in the [[History Workshop Movement]].&lt;ref name="tel" /&gt;

== Academic career ==
Howkins spent two years at Ruskin College,&lt;ref name="hwj"&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/hwj/article/1/1/281/557162 "Notes on the Editors"], ''[[History Workshop Journal]]'', vol. 1 (1977), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; before completing an [[undergraduate degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]; history and English were his chosen subjects.&lt;ref name="tel" /&gt; In 1973, he moved to the [[University of Essex]] to begin [[doctoral studies]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Oral-historians/021M-C1149X0010XX-0009V0 "Howkins, Alun (9 of 17).  Oral History of Oral History"] (transcription of oral history interview), British Library. Retrieved 22 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; three years later, he started working at the [[University of Sussex]],&lt;ref name="sussex"&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/45473 "Obituary: Professor Alun Howkins (1947–2018)"], ''[[University of Sussex]]'', 26 July 2018. Retrieved 22 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and only picked up his [[PhD]] studies again in the early 1980s, largely re-writing his [[thesis]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Oral-historians/021M-C1149X0010XX-0011V0 "Howkins, Alun (11 of 17).  Oral History of Oral History"] (transcription of oral history interview), British Library. Retrieved 22 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; the PhD was awarded by Essex in 1982 for "'The great momentous time': [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] and the [[Norfolk]] farm labourer 1872–1923".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=3&amp;uin=uk.bl.ethos.345340 "'The great momentous time': Radicalism and the Norfolk farm labourer 1872–1923"], ''EThOS'' (British Library). Retrieved 22 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; At Sussex, he became a professor of history and director of the School of Humanities' Graduate Centre before retiring in 2010 (whereupon he was appointed an emeritus professor).&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sussex"/&gt;

Outside of university, Howkins was co-founder of the journal ''[[Rural History (journal)|Rural History]]'',&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt; was an inaugural editor of the ''[[History Workshop Journal]]'',&lt;ref name="hwj"/&gt; and wrote and presented the 1999 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Fruitful Earth]]'', alongside the series [[Edwardian Farm and Mud|''Edwardian Farm'' and ''Mud'']]'', [[Sweat and Tractors: The Story of Agriculture]]''. Howkins' interest in [[rural history]] was an expression of his lifelong commitment to social justice, which also laid behind his trade union activism and his support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He was also a fond follower of folk music, performing in some of his lectures and classes, as well as outside university in several bands. In retirement, he moved to Norfolk. He died, aged 70, on 12 July 2018.&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sussex"/&gt;

== Research ==
When he died, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called Howkins a "leading" historian of English rural society, especially farm labourers, the rural poor and rural folklore of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Influenced by History Workshop, Howkins' research emphasised the long history of [[class conflict]] in the countryside and he explored the emergence of a distinctive [[class culture]] among the rural working class. But he was also keen to demonstrate the changing nature of rural England, as it became a place of [[leisure]] in the 20th century, and as it was influenced by the [[mechanisation of agriculture]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental concerns]].&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt;

The '''Bakran tribe'''   or Bagran tribe had connections with the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni Dynasty of Armenia]] and later [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Tirikan tribe]] with the [[Armenians|Armenian]] King [[Tigranes the Great]]. The reconstruction of [[Lake Van]] immediately east of the country of the Bakran tribe.

The Bakran tribe has given its name to the city of [[Diyarbakır]], also engendered the Bagratid royal house, which ruled intermittently, first over the Armenians and later over the Georgians, with major interruptions from the 9th through the beginning of the 19th century. The original domain of the early Bagratids was in fact the area of Diyarbakır to [[Bingöl]] in northwest [[Kurdistan]], according to Tergewondian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Kurds: a concise handbook|last= Mehrdad R.

'''Batasuna''' ({{pronunciation needed}}; {{lang-en|Unity}}) was a [[Basque nationalist]] [[political party]]. Based mainly in [[Spain]], it was banned in 2003, after a court ruling declared proven that the party was financing [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] with public money.

The party is included in the "European Union list of terrorist persons and organizations" as a component of ETA.&lt;ref name=EUList&gt;{{cite web|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_144/l_14420060531en00250029.pdf |title=EU list of terrorist organizations }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(43.6&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, 29 May 2006
:*''Euskadi Ta Askatasuna The following organisations are allegedly part of the terrorist group ETA: [[KAS Platform|KAS]], [[Xaki]]; [[Ekin]], [[Jarrai]]-[[Haika]]-[[Segi (organization)|Segi]], [[Gestoras Pro-amnistía]], [[Askatasuna]], Batasuna (also known as Herri Batasuna, also known as Euskal Herritarrok)&lt;/ref&gt; Right after having been banned, Batasuna still managed to organize or support some [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]], public actions and several workplace [[Strike action|strike]]s. The Spanish ruling was appealed before and, later on, confirmed by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

As an association and not as a political party, Batasuna had a minor presence in the [[French Basque country]], where it remained legal as "Batasuna" until its self-dissolution in January 2013.&lt;ref name="politica.elpais.com"&gt;[http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/01/03/actualidad/1357224725_721621.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Batasuna's ranks and support base have been represented under different names since it was first declared legal in the late 1970s with the [[Spanish Transition]] to democracy. Thus, Batasuna's predecessors were the original [[Herri Batasuna]] and, then, [[Euskal Herritarrok]]. After having been outlawed in 2003, Batasuna's core support revamped yet again by co-opting the thus far marginal parties [[EHAK]] and [[Acción Nacionalista Vasca]] (ANV).

Batasuna was a part of the ''[[Basque National Liberation Movement]]'' which includes social organizations, trade unions, youth ([[Jarrai]] and Gazteriak, now merged in Haika and Segi), and women's groups ([[Egizan]]). Jarrai-Haika-Segi, Gestoras pro-Amnistia, Askatasuna and other groups closely related to Batasuna were also declared illegal by different court rulings on the same charges of having collaborated with or being part of ETA.

==History and outline==

The party was founded in April 1978 as '''Herri Batasuna''', a coalition of leftist nationalist political groups mostly originating from [[Euskadiko Ezkerra]] initially brought together to advocate for "no" in the [[Spanish constitutional referendum, 1978|referendum to be held that year]] on the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish constitution]].

Its constituent parties had been called together by senior Basque nationalist [[Telesforo de Monzón]] in a 1978 meeting called "the table of [[Alsasua]]." Herri Batasuna's founding convention was held in [[Lekeitio]], home of [[Santiago Brouard]] who was then the leader of [[HASI]] (Herriko Alderdi Sozialista Iraultzailea or Revolutionary Socialist People's Party). The party won 150,000 votes in the Basque Country (15%) and 22,000 additional votes in Navarre (9%) in its first [[Spanish general election, 1979|Spanish general election]] in March 1979. Thus, they won three seats in the Spanish Parliament, which they did not occupy. Same happened in 1980 in the [[Basque parliamentary election, 1980|first elections to the Basque Parliament]], in which HB stood as second political force, with 151,636 votes (16.55%) winning 11 seats. Its absence allowed a [[Basque Nationalist Party|BNP]]-only Basque Government led by [[Carlos Garaikoetxea]]. On 20 November 1984 Brouard was assassinated by two members of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]]. The killing is perhaps the only one performed by the GAL [[death squad]] within Spain itself.

Another well-known Herri Batasuna leader and newly elected Spanish MP, [[Josu Muguruza]], was assassinated by right-wing extremists in November 1989 in [[Madrid]]. [[GAL (paramilitary group)|GAL]] claimed responsibility for Muguruza's assassination. Suspicions also centered on Spanish neo-Nazi group [[Bases Autónomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Leonisio, Fernando Molina, and Diego Muro, ''ETA's Terrorist Campaign: From Violence to Politics, 1968-2015'' (Philadelphia: Routledge, 2016), 122, https://books.google.com/books?id=2C9EDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT122; Christopher Ross, Bill Richardson, and Begoña Sangrador-Vegas, ''Contemporary Spain'' (Philadelphia: Routledge, 2016), 100, https://books.google.com/books?id=2p_7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent times==

Amid the first talk of the Spanish government investigating the ties of Herri Batasuna with ETA, in 1998 Herri Batasuna was the driving force of the newly formed '''Euskal Herritarrok''' (''We Basque Citizens'') coalition, an acronym which got the best results to date for Basque left separatism in the Basque community, with 224,000 votes out of a total of 1,250,000 in the Basque election [[Basque parliamentary election, 1998|held that year]].

The most recent public party spokesmen was [[Arnaldo Otegi]]. Otegi, like a number of other top-ranks in Herri Batasuna, had been a member of ETA and served several years in prison for bank assault. He is currently serving time in prison for ties with ETA. 
{{Politics of Basque Country (autonomous community)}}

Another important member of Batasuna was [[José Antonio Urrutikoetxea Bengoetxea]], alias Josu Ternera, the main leader of ETA between 1987 and 1989 and accused of a number of assassinations like the [[1987 Hipercor bombing]] which killed 21 people at [[Hipercor]] - a shopping center in [[Barcelona]]. He was imprisoned in France after 1989, released after finishing his sentence and was transferred to Spanish prisons, where he stayed for 2 more years until his release by the Constitutional Court, which stipulated that he had served his prison term in France. He was included in the Batasuna electoral ticket and elected to the Basque parliament between 1999 and 2001, where he was appointed as his party's representative in the Human Rights commission at the [[Basque Parliament]], which, given his criminal background caused a stir in the rest of parties. He disappeared when the Spanish courts reopened cold charges and presented new ones about his current membership in ETA. Presently he lives in hiding and is considered one of the leaders of ETA that are pushing for negotiations.

Amid a period of separatist [[kale borroka]] street attacks on the offices of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] and other establishment targets, Batasuna together with the union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] convoked a day of protest and [[general strike]] on 9 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/03/05/espana/1141557117.html |title=ElMundo.es |publisher=ElMundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629002437/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/03/05/espana/1141557117.html| archivedate= 29 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of the strike, ETA detonated several bombs near highways, with no injuries. Employers reported scant overall participation in the strike, approximately 0.5% of private sector workers, 1% of government workers and 3-4% of workers in education. A few thousands of Batasuna militants joined protests, while others blocked rail lines and roads and occupied municipal halls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conflicto-vasco.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1573 |title=Conflicto-Vasco.com |publisher=Conflicto-Vasco.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812095419/http://www.conflicto-vasco.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1573 |archivedate=2009-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Batasuna leader Arnaldo Otegi was ordered to appear in court to answer for the bomb attacks and disruption, but delayed his appearance repeatedly on the grounds of illness.

In September 2008, in what has been the closest to a disengagement of ETA so far, members of the party, while not condemning ETA's tactics whatsoever, did say the "political-military strategy" of the latter is an "obstacle" to aspirations for Basque independence. They called for a "unifying project for the pro-independence left" which would be aimed at creating an electoral list for regional elections to be held in Spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=244554&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=39&amp;parent_id=21 |title=Basque separatists call ETA an ‘obstacle’ |publisher=Gulf-times.com |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812075316/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=244554&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=39&amp;parent_id=21 |archivedate=2009-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral results==

Batasuna's support in the elections to the parliament of the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] (under the three brands it has used, i.e., Herri Batasuna, Euskal Herritarrok and EHAK) oscillates around 15% of the total votes, its best result being the 18.33% achieved in 1990 and the lowest the 10.12% of the total votes obtained in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www9.euskadi.net/q93TodoWar/q93Desplegar.jsp |title=Official results of elections held in the Basque Autonomous Community |publisher=.euskadi.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407091254/http://www9.euskadi.net/q93TodoWar/q93Desplegar.jsp |archivedate=2010-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Navarre]] its results in the elections to the Navarrese [[fuero|Foral]] parliament have been historically slightly less than 15% of the total votes, reaching their highest result in 1999 (15.95% of the total votes) and their lowest in 1995 (9.22% of the total votes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento-navarra.es/datos/elec.doc Official results of elections held in the Foral Community of Navarre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325102257/http://www.parlamento-navarra.es/datos/elec.doc |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this territory other Basque pro-independence left wing parties which reject violence and so remain legal - namely [[Batzarre]] and specifically, [[Aralar Party|Aralar]]- eroded Batasuna's support in a more significant way than in the Basque Autonomous Community.

Batasuna had representatives in the [[European Parliament]] and in the parliaments of [[Navarre]] and the provinces of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]]. It also ruled some 62 local councils,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm | work=BBC News | title=Profile: Batasuna | date=August 27, 2002 | accessdate=March 27, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100421002408/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm| archivedate= 21 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had members in many more. While it was fairly represented in all Basque and Navarrese Spanish territories, Batasuna counted as its stronghold the province of [[Gipuzkoa]]. After being banned, Batasuna lost all its representatives in the Spanish Parliament, since regaining (under different names) some their seats in elections held after its banning.

While the party has been barred from formally taking part in elections since 2003 (see below), it has coordinated a variety of forms of participation (or "quantifiable non-participation") in recent elections. After the May 2003 provincial and local elections, followers of the local lists protested claiming the council seats corresponding to the invalid votes (127,000, 10% of the total vote in the Basque Country).
For the Basque elections of 2005, Batasuna presented lists of candidates but they were dismissed as illegal. After the new election was held for the Basque regional parliament, Batasuna lost all their remaining elected representatives.

Like those parties, representatives of EHAK refused to explicitly condemn the ETA attacks but, given the fact that elections were to be held in a matter of days, the courts did not have the time to assess EHAK's compliance with the Ley de Partidos. The People's Party requested that the Spanish government conducts investigations to ban EHAK-PCTV too, though the State Legal Service (''Abogacía General del Estado'') and the Attorney General's Office (''Fiscalía General del Estado'') found no evidence to support legal actions against the party. Batasuna asked their supporters to vote for EHAK.

In the Basque elections of 17 April 2005, EHAK obtained 150,188 votes (12.5%), entering the [[Basque Parliament]] with nine seats (all but one being women).

===Spanish Parliament===

Batasuna stood in a number of elections for the [[Spanish Parliament]]. They first stood in [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979]] obtaining their best results in the Basque autonomous community where they polled 15% and won 3 seats.&lt;ref&gt;http://electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=1979&amp;community=14&lt;/ref&gt; In Navarre they polled almost 9% but failed to win a seat.

They lost a seat in the [[Spanish general election, 1982|1982 election]]. Their high point came in the [[Spanish general election, 1986|1986 election]] where they won 5 seats, including one seat in [[Navarra (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Navarre]], the only occasion in which they have won a seat there. They lost their Navarre seat in the [[Spanish general election, 1989|1989 election]] and lost a further 2 seats in the [[Spanish general election, 1996|1996 election]], which overall proved to be the party's worst performance in terms of vote share. At provincial level, their best results came in [[Guipúzcoa (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Guipúzcoa]] where the party topped the poll in the 1989 general election.

==Outlawed in Spain==

The party denied any links to ETA. However, proponents of the party's illegalization pointed to a coincidence of Batasuna and ETA's strategies. A significant number of Batasuna leaders have been imprisoned because of their activities in ETA. The party has never condemned any attack by ETA and its leaders have referred sometimes to the ETA members as 'Basque soldiers', and justified their actions: "ETA does not use the armed struggle as a mean to defend this or that political project but to give&lt;nowiki&gt; [the Basque Country]&lt;/nowiki&gt; democratic channels that enable the popular will to be expressed in full freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giacopucci|1994|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common to refer to ETA militants as ''Gudariak'', soldiers in Basque language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parissi|2008|pp=24–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giacopucci|1994|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rees|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s there had been talk of attempts to ban the party, which resulted in Batasuna frequently changing its name as part of the effort to avoid this, from the original ''Herri Batasuna'', then becoming part of the ''Euskal Herritarrok'' coalition in the 1990s and, finally, Batasuna. Members of the Basque left consider the Spanish government's efforts against Batasuna and its successors to be part of an organized campaign targeting the social support for the independence movement. They point to government crackdowns against the newspaper ''Egin'', the radio station Herri Irratia and the network of pubs that were gathering places for the independentist left.

In 2002 started the first serious attempt by the Spanish government to ban the party. In June the parliament passed legislation that outlawed parties under certain conditions, on the grounds of their support for terrorism. In July Batasuna was fined € 24 million for vandalism and street violence in 2001. Following an ETA car bomb attack on 4 August the Spanish parliament was recalled. The party was suspended for three years by Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] on 27 August to allow him to investigate the party links to ETA. Garzón and the government presented 23 arguments for the ban, focusing on the party's refusal to condemn ETA attacks, its reference to detainees as [[political prisoner]]s, collaboration with other banned abertzale forces, and ETA's support in communiqués for Batasuna's political strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-mundo.es/especiales/2002/08/espana/batasuna/motivos.html |title=El-Mundo.es |publisher=El-Mundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Batasuna was declared illegal in Spain by a court ruling of the [[Spanish Supreme Court]], then confirmed by the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]]. The decision automatically cut them off from the state funding received by all legal political parties with Parliament representation. In spite of legal text forbidding its reorganization under another name, its members tried to use, ever since the outlawing, a plethora of local lists.  Most of these lists were considered to be a front for Batasuna by the Spanish Supreme Court. This decision was confirmed by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The ban prohibits their representatives from contesting elections, holding public demonstrations or rallies and freezes their assets. On the 26th the Spanish parliament voted for an indefinite ban, 295 to 10. The party's main offices in [[Pamplona]] were closed by the police and further offices in [[San Sebastián]], [[Bilbao]] and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] were targeted.

Still, party activity did not cease completely, as proved by the fact that on 4 October 2007 twenty-three top members of Batasuna were arrested as they left a secret meeting in [[Segura (Guipúzcoa)]], accused of holding an illegal political meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/world/europe/06spain.html?ref=europe "Basque Leaders Arrested in Spain", ''The New York Times'', 6 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schism===

Prior to the outlaw effort, a dissenting minority had left the party to form [[Aralar Party|Aralar]]. While sharing separatist aims with Batasuna, Aralar rejected political violence and ETA's assassinations and therefore remains a legal party.

==Attempts to reorganize==

In spite of the prohibition of reorganizing under different names in order to circumvent the legal ruling, Batasuna's ranks have tried a series of attempts to reorganize under new names, which include, among others, [[Autodeterminaziorako Bilgunea]], [[Aukera Guztiak]], [[Askatasuna]] or [[D3M]]. All have been legally banned for alleged ties to Batasuna and, in turn, to ETA.

In May 2004, a list named ''[[Herritarren Zerrenda]]'' ("Citizens' List") was presented in Spain and France to the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European Parliament election]]. Spanish tribunals rejected it, as a successor of Batasuna. However, the HZ list in France remained legal.

HZ candidates in Spain then campaigned for using the French HZ ballot in Spain, which was to be counted as a [[null vote]].
There were more than 98,000 null votes in the Basque Autonomous Country and more than 15,000 in Navarre. HZ leaders interpreted the high rate of null votes, which was 12% of the total, to mean that most of the nulls were for HZ, since in the previous European elections the null vote was less than 1%.

A more successful strategy for Batasuna proved to be the one of co-opting existing marginal parties giving the shortest possible notice before an election, so that there was no time for the [[Spanish Supreme Court]] to legally assess the lawfulness of this move before the election was held. Thus, for the regional [[Basque parliamentary election, 2005]] the so-far marginal [[EHAK]] party announced that they were ready to bring the programs of Batasuna to the Basque regional parliament.
(EHAK had been legally registered in 2002 but had no known activity until 2005). The party could participate in those elections, but then was declared illegal by a court ruling because of ties with Batasuna, which prevented it from contesting the [[Spanish regional elections, 2007]].

Then, the same strategy was tried by co-opting [[Acción Nacionalista Vasca]] a historical, yet basically inactive Basque party. This time, the Spanish Supreme Court could make a quick assessment of ANV's municipal candidates, which resulted in roughly half of them being banned (because the candidates included people who had previously run for the illegal Herri Batasuna or Batasuna) while the other half was ruled lawful and could participate in the elections to be held shortly after the ruling.

Then, in September 2008 the full legal inquiry on the party was finalized, ruling that ANV as a whole was illegal, due to ties with Batasuna-ETA. The Basque regional government, then led by a Basque nationalist coalition of the [[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]] and [[Eusko Alkartasuna|EA]] objected to these legal rulings.

As a result of this pressure, for the first time since Herri Batasuna was formed, neither Batasuna nor its proxies could participate in the Basque regional parliament at the time of the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2009]].

In February 2011, [[Sortu]], a party described as "the new Batasuna",&lt;ref name="LV8F"&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/20110208/54111615502/el-nuevo-partido-de-la-izquierda-abertzale-se-denomina-sortu.html "El nuevo partido de la izquierda abertzale se denomina 'Sortu'", La Vanguardia, 8 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. Unlike predecessor parties, Sortu claimed that it explicitly rejected politically motivated violence, including that of ETA;&lt;ref name="LV8F"/&gt; however it did not condemn the record of ETA nor ask for the disbandment of the armed organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/rc/20110209/mas-actualidad/nacional/sortu-solicita-inscripcion-registro-201102090232.html "Sortu reniega de la violencia pero evita exigir el fin de ETA"]&lt;/ref&gt; Sortu was banned in March 2011 from registering as a political party by the Supreme Court of Spain.

Some members went on to form another party called [[Bildu]], which was first banned but then allowed to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-05/06/c_13860907.htm |title=Spanish Constitutional Court lifts ban on Bildu |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is Bildu which represents at the Parliament the electoral base of Batasuna.

==Reaction==

In October 2008 demonstrations were held in Bilbao to protest a Supreme Court decision the month before to ban ANV and EHAK, because of their ties to Batasuna. The protesters had a banner that read "Freedom for Euskal Herria." The protests was organised by left-wing Basque nationalists. ANV president, [[Kepa Bereziartua]], and the former spokesman for Batasuna, [[Arnaldo Otegi]], were present in the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hRnwgIJi3-jWS2YjzLB2u81Zvjdg |title=Google.com |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=2008-10-04 |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814031947/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hRnwgIJi3-jWS2YjzLB2u81Zvjdg |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rulings of the European Court of Human Rights==

At the time of its outlawing in Spain, Batasuna lawyers took the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR). After a long legal inquiry, in July 2009 the ECHR backed the Spanish rulings banning Batasuna and its proxies.

The ECHR said that disbanding the parties was a response "to a pressing social need" given their ties to ETA. "Given the situation in Spain for several years regarding terrorist attacks, these ties can be considered objectively as a threat to democracy," the court said, also adding that these parties "contradicted the concept of a 'democratic society' and presented a major danger to Spain's democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=200906301233dowjonesdjonline000503&amp;title=european-judges-uphold-spains-ban-on-batasuna-echr |title=Nasdaq.com |publisher=Nasdaq.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, when the outlawed Batasuna tried to use Acción Nacionalista Vasca as a proxy to re-organize its ranks, in a different case the ECHR also upheld in 2011 the previous Spanish court rulings which had outlawed ANV, noting that this party had not run by itself in elections since 1977 and that it basically conformed a "fraud" to circumvent the outlawing of Batasuna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Estrasburgo/respalda/anulacion/candidaturas/ANV/elpepuespvas/20101207elpepunac_19/Tes]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status in France ==

Batasuna has a minor presence in the Basque French country, where it runs elections as a civic organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Batasuna/anuncia/campana/Francia/ilegalizacion/elpepuesp/20081005elpepinac_7/Tes |title=ElPais.com |publisher=ElPais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; not like a political party. In France it used to get a few hundred votes&lt;ref name="politica.elpais.com"/&gt;
and did not reach any kind of representation at either local or regional level so far.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In September 2008, 14 people were detained by the French police, 10 of whom were from the French-wing of the party (including their spokesman Xabi Larralde), and charged with links to ETA. They were released four days later; it remained unclear whether the ongoing investigation would lead to an illegalization process similar to that in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Detenidos/miembros/Batasuna/Francia/elpepuesp/20080924elpepunac_1/Tes |title=ElPais.com |publisher=ElPais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Batasuna in France announced its self-dissolution, citing a process of "political reflection".&lt;ref name="politica.elpais.com"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

The ''Children of Zion'', published in January 1998, is considered as a [[Documentary film|documentary]] that was based on a collection of fragments of records compiled in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in 1943 by the Eastern Center for Information, a Polish government group.  The book was a source of the testimonies of Jewish children who were evacuated from the [[Soviet Union]] to Palestine.  Grynberg arranged the “collection of interviews” to serve as a reminder about the [[Holocaust]] experience.  The Polish children’s experiences during [[World War II]] also provided a recollection of their lives before the war.  Memories of when the war broke out were also discussed, apart from the “arrival of the [[German people|Germans]] and the [[Russian people|Russians]]”, the children’s journeys and life while in exile, and their condition after the so-called [[Władysław Sikorski|Sikorsky]] Agreement allowed them to leave the work camps.  Many of the children had to cope as orphaned émigrés.  The original document that had become the basis for Grynberg’s ''Children of Zion'' is at the [[Hoover Institution]] of [[Stanford University|Leland Stanford Junior University]].&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;&lt;ref name=NorthWestern/&gt;

==Identities of the children==
Grynberg's ''Children of Zion'' contains the original list of the Polish children who arrived in [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]] "on February 18th, 1943, those who arrived in August 1943, and those who gave the testimonies".  These children escaped from occupied Poland to Russia prior to arriving at Eretz Israel ([[Land of Israel]]).&lt;ref name=Ackerfeld&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Tehran/Teh001.html Ackerfeld, Lance and Joyce Field. List of the Children (Original list of the children who arrived to Eretz Israel in the middle of World War II, after escape from occupied Poland to Russia), JewishGen, Inc., 2004], retrieved on: July 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
Grynberg's book was originally published in [[Polish language|Polish]] as ''Dzieci Syjonu'' (Warszawa: Karta) in 1994.  It was later translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by Zeev Schuss (Yad Vashem, Jerusalem) in 1995.  Grynberg’s ''Children of Zion'' was translated into English by [[Jacqueline Mitchell]], a [[United Nations Interpretation Service|United Nations interpreter]], and published by [[Northwestern University Press]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

The '''Communist League''' (&lt;small&gt;[[German language|German]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''Bund der Kommunisten)'' was an international [[political party]] established on June 1, 1847 in [[London]], [[England]]. The organisation was formed through the merger of the [[League of the Just]], headed by [[Karl Schapper]] and the Communist Correspondence Committee of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in which [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were the dominant personalities. The Communist League is regarded as the first [[Marxism|Marxist]] political party and it was on behalf of this group that Marx and Engels wrote the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' late in 1847. The Communist League was formally disbanded in 1852, following the [[Cologne Communist Trial]].

== Organisational history ==
===Background===

During the decade of the 1840s the word "communist" came into general use to describe those who hailed the left wing of the [[Jacobin Club]] of the [[French Revolution]] as their ideological forefathers.&lt;ref name=Fern23&gt;David Fernbach, "Introduction" to Karl Marx, ''The Revolutions of 1848.'' New York: Random House, 1973; pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This political tendency saw itself as [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] inheritors of the 1795 [[Conspiracy of Equals]] headed by [[Gracchus Babeuf]].&lt;ref name=Fern23 /&gt; The ''[[sans-culottes]]'' of [[Paris]] which had decades earlier been the base of support for Babeuf — artisans, journeymen, and the urban unemployed — was seen as a potential foundation for a new social system based upon the modern machine production of the day.&lt;ref name=Fern24&gt;Fernbach, "Introduction" to ''The Revolutions of 1848,'' pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French thinker [[Étienne Cabet]] inspired the imagination with a novel about a utopian society based upon communal machine production, ''[[Icarians|Voyage en Icarie]]'' (1839).&lt;ref name=Fern24 /&gt; The [[revolution]]ary [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] argued in favor of an elite organising the overwhelming majority of the population against the "rich," seizing the government in a [[coup d'état]], and instituting a new egalitarian economic order.&lt;ref name=Fern24 /&gt;

One group of [[German people|Germans]] in Paris, headed by [[Karl Schapper]], organised themselves in the form of a [[secret society]] known as the [[League of the Just]] ''(Bund der Gerechten)'' and participated in a May 1839 rebellion in Paris in an effort to establish a "Social Republic."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Moss, [http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5704 "Marx and the Permanent Revolution in France: Background to the Communist Manifesto,"] in Leo Panitch and Colin Leys (eds.), ''The Communist Manifesto Now: The Socialist Register, 1998.'' New York: [[Monthly Review Press]], 1998; pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Following its failure the organisation relocated its centre to London, while also maintaining local organisations in [[Zürich]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Mehring]], ''[[Karl Marx: The Story of His Life]].'' Edward Fitzgerald, trans. London: George Allen and Unwin, 1936; pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolution was in the air across many of the monarchies of Europe.

=== Creation of the Communist League ===

The year 1846 found Karl Marx and his close friend and co-thinker [[Friedrich Engels]] in [[Brussels]], establishing a small political circle of radical German émigrés called the [[Communist Corresponding Committee]] and writing for the German-language ''[[Deutsche Brüsseler Zeitung]]'' ("Brussels German Newspaper").&lt;ref name=Draper22&gt;[[Hal Draper]], ''The Marx-Engels Chronicle: A Day-by-Day Chronology of Marx and Engels' Life and Activity: Volume 1 of the Marx-Engels Cyclopedia.'' New York: [[Schocken Books]], 1985; pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in this early circle was [[Wilhelm Wolff]], a talented and radical writer hailing from the [[Silesia]]n [[peasantry]] who had been forced to emigrate due to his agitation against the [[Prussia]]n [[autocracy]].&lt;ref name=Mehring135&gt;Franz Mehring, ''Karl Marx,'' pg. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brussels Communist Corresponding Committee had at the same time small counterparts located in London and Paris, composed of a handful of radical German expatriates living there. Relations between these small groups were not close, with petty jealousies and ideological disagreements preventing the participants from functioning as an effective political unit.&lt;ref name=Mehring135 /&gt;

Be that as it may, in the latter part of January 1847 the disparate parts of the fledgling German Communist movement began to congeal in a single organisational entity when the London center of the League of the Just first broached the idea of organisational unity with the Communist Corresponding Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Mehring, ''Karl Marx,'' pp. 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of 20 January 1847 by Schapper requested that Marx join the League in anticipation of a scheduled London congress at which a new set of principles would be adopted based upon the ideas previously expressed by Marx and Engels.&lt;ref name=Mehring139&gt;Mehring, ''Karl Marx,'' pg. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Marx and Engels were persuaded by the appeal and they both joined the League of the Just shortly thereafter, followed by other members of the Communist Corresponding Committee.&lt;ref name=Mehring139 /&gt;

In June 1847 the London congress took place and the League of the Just adopted a new charter formally changing the group's name to the Communist League.&lt;ref name=Mehring139 /&gt; The Communist League was structured around the formation of primary party units known as "communes," consisting of at least 3 and not more than 10 members.&lt;ref name=Mehring139 /&gt; These were in turn to be combined into larger units known as "circles" and "leading circles," governed by a central authority selected at regular congresses.&lt;ref name=Mehring139 /&gt; The League's programme called for the overthrow of the [[bourgeoisie]] and establishment of the rule of the [[proletariat]] and the construction of a new society free both of [[private property]] and [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name=Mehring139 /&gt;

The initial conference was attended by Engels, who convinced the League to change its motto to [[Karl Marx]]'s phrase, ''Working Men of All Countries, Unite!''. At the same conference, the organisation was renamed the ''Communist League'' and was reorganised significantly.

In particular, Marx did away with all "superstitious authoritarianism," as he called the rituals pertaining to secret societies.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''Primitive Rebels'', chapter titled "Rituals in Social Movements", p.169 of the 1965 edition by Norton Library&lt;/ref&gt; The conference itself was counted as the first congress of the new League.

The Communist League had a second congress, at [[Great Windmill Street]], London, in November and December 1847. Both Marx and Engels attended, and they were assigned the task of composing a manifesto for the organisation. This became ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.

The League was not able to function effectively during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 revolutions]], despite temporarily abandoning its clandestine nature. The [[Workers' Brotherhood]] was established in Germany by members of the League, and became the most significant revolutionary organisation there. During the revolution Marx edited the radical journal the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the Prussians (June and July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]].

The Communist League reassembled in late 1849, and by 1850 they were publishing the ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/nrz-revue/index.htm Neue Rheinische Zeitung Revue]'' journal, but by the end of the year, publication had ceased amid disputes between the managers of the group.

In 1850, the German master spy [[Wilhelm Stieber]] broke into Marx's house and stole the register of the League's members, which he sent to France and several German states. This caused the imprisonment of several members.

In 1852, after the [[Cologne Communist Trial]], the organisation was ended formally.

The Company of St. George was formed during the 1980s around [[Gerry Embleton]] and a group of history enthusiasts living in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;The Company of Saynt George. Miroque. 2011, Iss. 4, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally the Company has retained a close link to other groups in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Udo Brühe. Ein buntes Bild der Vergangenheit. A-Faktor, June 2011, Iss. 2, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Company of St. George has been made popular with the book "The Medieval Soldier", written by Gerry Embleton and [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], featuring over one hundred colour photographs of people in historical costume.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been translated into French, German and Italian. The book came out in 1994 and had an influence on living-history and [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]]. This is especially true on the European continent where it helped to make living history a popular hobby and the second half of the 15th century one of the most popular periods for re-enactment.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Membership&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ==
There are around one hundred people involved with the group and about sixty of them are considered active.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The active members live in [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. [[Tolkien]] illustrator [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]] and the historical illustrator [[Gerry Embleton]] are prominent members.

== Events ==
The Company of St. George primarily works with [[museum]]s and does living-history events in close cooperation with them. The ties with the [[Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg]] are particularly strong.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} There are also private events.

'''Cotton-spinning machinery''' refers to [[machines]] which process (or spin) prepared  [[cotton]] roving into workable [[yarn]] or thread. Such machinery can be dated back centuries. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as part of the [[Industrial Revolution]] cotton-spinning machinery was developed to bring [[mass production]] to the cotton industry. Cotton spinning machinery was installed in large factories, commonly known as [[cotton mill]]s.

==History==
Until the 1740s all spinning  was done by hand using a [[spinning wheel]]. The state of the art spinning wheel in England was known as the Jersey wheel however an alternative wheel, the Saxony wheel was a double band treadle spinning wheel where the spindle rotated faster than the traveller in a ratio of 8:6, drawing on both was done by the spinners fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1738 [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]] of [[Birmingham]] patented the Roller Spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing [[cotton]] to a more even thickness, using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds.&lt;!-- Perfected by [[Thomas Highs]] of Leigh, stolen by  , POV --&gt; This principle was the basis of [[Richard Arkwright]]'s later [[water frame]] design. By 1742 Paul and Wyatt had opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a [[donkey]], this was not profitable and soon closed. A factory was opened in [[Northampton]] in 1743, with fifty  spindles turning on five of Paul and Wyatt's machines, proving more successful than their first mill; this operated until 1764.

[[Lewis Paul]] invented the hand-driven [[carding]] machine in 1748. A coat of wire slips were placed around a card, which was then wrapped around a cylinder. Lewis' invention  was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and [[Samuel Crompton]], although the design came under suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn's factory in [[Leominster]] which used Paul and Wyatt's spindles. Bourn produced a similar patent in the same year.
[[File:Horrockses display.jpg|thumb|right|Old advertising display of items used in cotton textile manufacture during the industrial revolution]]
Rev John Dyer of Northampton recognised the importance of the Paul and Wyatt cotton spinning machine in a poem in 1757:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A circular machine, of new design&lt;br&gt;
In conic shape: it draws and spins a thread&lt;br&gt;
Without the tedious toil of needless hands.&lt;br&gt;
A wheel invisible, beneath the floor,&lt;br&gt;
To ev'ry member of th' harmonius frame,&lt;br&gt;
Gives necessary motion. One intent&lt;br&gt;
O'erlooks the work; the carded wool, he says,&lt;br&gt;
So smoothly lapped around those cylinders,&lt;br&gt;
Which gently turning, yield it to yon cirue&lt;br&gt;
Of upright spindles, which with rapid whirl&lt;br&gt;
Spin out in long extenet an even twine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spinning Jenny===
{{main article|Spinning jenny}}
[[File:Spinning Jenny improved 203 Marsden.png|upright|thumb|The [[spinning jenny]] that was used in [[cotton mill|textile mill]]s]]
The spinning jenny is a multi-spool spinning wheel. It was invented circa 1764, its invention attributed to [[James Hargreaves]] in Stanhill, near [[Blackburn]], Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water frame===
{{main article|Water frame}}[[File:Arkwright Spinning frame Marsden 212.png|thumb|upright|Arkwright's spinning frame]]
The [[Water frame]] was developed and patented by Arkwright in the 1770s. The roving was attenuated (stretched) by drafting rollers and twisted by winding it onto a spindle. It was heavy large scale machine that needed to be driven by power, which in the late 18th century meant by a water wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton mills were designed for the purpose by Arkwright, [[Jedediah Strutt]] and others along the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Water frames could only spin weft.

===Spinning mule===
{{main article|Spinning mule}}
[[Image:Mule spinning machine at Quarry Bank Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|A fully restored &amp; working mule at the [[Quarry Bank Mill]], UK.]] 
The '''spinning mule'''  or '''mule jenny''' was created in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]]. It was a combination of Arkwright's [[Water Frame|water frame]] and [[James Hargreaves|Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]]. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process:&lt;ref name="Marsden 1884 109"&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden |1884|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the return traverse, the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the [[throstle frame]] or [[Ring spinning|ring frame]] was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn twisted and wrapped in one action. The spinning mule became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasmith |1895|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1824 and 1830 [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] invented a mechanism that rendered all parts of the [[Spinning Mule|mule]] self-acting, regulating the rotation of the spindles during the inward run of the carriage.

The [[Platt Brothers]], based in [[Oldham]], [[Greater Manchester]] were amongst the most prominent machine makers in this field of work.

At first this machine was only used to spin coarse and low-to-medium counts, but it is now employed to spin all counts of yarn.

===Throstle===
{{main article|Throstle frame}}
The Throstle frame was a descendant of the water frame. It used the same principles, was better engineered and driven by steam. In 1828 the Danforth throstle frame was invented in the United States. The heavy flyer caused the spindle to vibrate, and the yarn snarled every time the frame was stopped.&lt;ref name=M298/&gt; Not a success. It was named throstle, as the noise it made when running was compared to the song of the throstle (thrush).

===Ring frame===
{{main article|Ring spinning}}
[[File:Ring 1.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Modern ring spinning frame'''&lt;br/&gt;1 Draughting rollers&lt;br/&gt;2 Spindle&lt;br/&gt;3 Attenuated roving&lt;br/&gt;4 Thread guides&lt;br/&gt;5 Anti-ballooning ring&lt;br/&gt;6 Traveller &lt;br/&gt;7 Rings&lt;br/&gt;8 Thread on bobbin]]
The Ring frame is credited to John Thorp in [[Rhode Island]] in 1828/9 and developed by Mr. Jencks of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], who ({{harvnb|Marsden|1885}}) names  as the inventor.&lt;ref name=M298&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- In order to prepare threads for doubling, it may be necessary to wind them side by side upon a flanged [[bobbin]], or upon a straight or tapering [[spool]], from two to six threads before twisting them into one.

[[Image:Working cotton spinners at Quarry Bank Mill.jpg|thumb|right|A fully restored &amp; working water-wheel driven spinning winder at the [[Quarry Bank Mill]], England.]]
Winding machines for this purpose are of various kinds. There are those in which the threads are laid evenly between the flanges of a bobbin, and those that coil the threads upon a straight or a tapering tube to form "cheeses". In the latter the tubes may be laid upon diagonally split drums and rotated by frictional contact.

By placing each group of threads to be wound in the slit of a rotating drum, it is drawn quickly to and fro and coiled upon a spool. If solid instead of split drums are used, the guides for all the threads on one side of a machine are attached to a bar, which is traversed by a [[cam]] placed at one end of the frame. Otherwise, an independent mechanism may be provided throughout for treating each group of threads to be wound. 
--&gt;
The bobbins or tubes may be filled from "cops", "ring spools" or "hanks", but a stop motion is required for each thread, which will come into operation immediately a fracture occurs.

==Further processes==
For many purposes, the threads as spun by the ring frame or the mule are ready for the manufacturer; but where extra strength or smoothness is required, as in threads for sewing, crocheting, hosiery, lace and carpets; also where multicoloured effects are needed, as in Grandrelle, or some special form of irregularity, as in corkscrewed, and knopped yarns, two or more single threads are compounded and twisted together. This operation is known as "doubling".

[[File:The lamentation by Scipione Pulzone - 1593.jpg|thumb|''[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]'', [[Scipione Pulzone]], 1593]]

'''Counter-''Maniera''''' or '''Counter-Mannerism''' (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of [[Mannerism]], the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590.  Counter-''Maniera'' or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the [[The_Reformation_and_art#Council_of_Trent|vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity]] in art issued by the [[Council of Trent]] in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of [[High Renaissance]] art, with "clarity in formal order and legibility in content".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was devised by the art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians.  Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his ''Painting in Italy, 1500–1600'', first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: "First ''Maniera'', High ''Maniera'', Counter-''Maniera'' and Late ''Maniera''".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High ''Maniera'' remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-''Maniera'' in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high ''maniera'' style.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedberg's contemporary [[Federico Zeri]] had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term ''arte sacra'' ("sacred art") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-''Maniera'' may be in decline, as impatience with such "[[Style (visual arts)|style]] labels" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and characteristics==
The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so.  Many parts of Italy, led by [[Venice]] and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of ''maniera'' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded ''maniera'', without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as "counterpart" and "[[counterpoint]]", explaining that he intends "implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429 quoted, and ''passim'' on individual artists; Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the ''maniera'' often retained in counter-''maniera'' works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the ''maniera'' that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a [[decorum]] suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168–169, 178–179; Friedländer, 6–10, and Part 1 generally&lt;/ref&gt; In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 657–660&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term counter-''maniera'' is not usually applied to the more radical [[Bologna|Bolognese]] reaction of the [[Carracci family|Carraccis]] from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was "a new and un-Maniera attitude to art";&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-''Maniera'' with "anti-Maniera", apparently reflecting "Anti-Mannerism", the term used by [[Walter Friedländer]] for the "palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting" that occurred "sometime around 1590".&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the "anti-Maniera" of [[Antonio Campi]] see 585–587, and for that of [[Scipione Pulzone]] see 658, and "non-Maniera" is also used; &lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term has not been extended to [[Northern Mannerism]].

Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in [[John Shearman]]'s ''Mannerism'' (1967), he picks [[Santi di Tito]]'s ''Vision of St Thomas Aquinas'' (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is [[Federigo Barocci]], who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632–640&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Many painters looked to revive the styles of [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of [[Michelangelo]]'s late work was important for many artists.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine biographer and critic [[Raffaello Borghini]], author of ''Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura'' published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Conclusion"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg&lt;/ref&gt; but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: "Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 499, when discussing [[Girolamo Muziano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ''Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a "pro-Bolognese" artistic account of Counter-''Maniera'' reform.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed. Alice Sedgwick Wohl, Helmut Wohl and Tomaso Montanari (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''crystal skulls''' are [[human skull]] [[hardstone carving]]s made of clear or milky white [[quartz]] (also called "rock crystal"), claimed to be [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n artifacts by their alleged finders; however, these claims have been refuted for all of the specimens made available for scientific studies.

The results of these studies demonstrated that those examined were manufactured in the mid-19th century or later, almost certainly in [[Europe]] during a time when interest in ancient culture was abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/crystal-skulls/|title=Crystal Skulls -- National Geographic|work=National Geographic|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Museum (n.d.-b), Jenkins (2004, p.217), Sax ''et al.'' (2008), Smith (2005), Walsh (1997; 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The skulls were crafted in the 19th century in Germany, quite likely at workshops in the town of [[Idar-Oberstein]], which was renowned for crafting objects made from imported [[Brazil]]ian quartz in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;British Museums (n.d.-b); Craddock (2009, p.415).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some claims presented in an assortment of popularizing literature, legends of crystal skulls with mystical powers do not figure in genuine Mesoamerican or other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythologies and spiritual accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred (2000, ''passim.''); Jenkins (2004, pp.218–219). In this latter work, [[Philip Jenkins]], former Distinguished Professor of History and Religious Studies and subsequent endowed Professor of Humanities at [[Pennsylvania State University|PSU]], writes that crystal skulls are among the more obvious of examples where the association with Native spirituality is a "historically recent" and "artificial" synthesis. These are "products of a generation of creative spiritual entrepreneurs" that do not "[represent] the practice of any historical community".&lt;/ref&gt;

The skulls are often claimed to exhibit [[paranormal]] phenomena by some members of the [[New Age]] movement, and have often been portrayed as such in [[fiction]]. Crystal skulls have been a popular subject appearing in numerous [[sci-fi]] [[television series]], novels, films, and [[video game]]s.

==Collections==
Trade in fake pre-Columbian artifacts developed during the late 19th century to the extent that in 1886, [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] archaeologist [[William Henry Holmes]] wrote an article called "The Trade in Spurious Mexican Antiquities" for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (1886)&lt;/ref&gt; Although museums had acquired skulls earlier, it was [[Eugène Boban]], an antiquities dealer who opened his shop in Paris in 1870, who is most associated with 19th-century museum collections of crystal skulls. Most of Boban's collection, including three crystal skulls, was sold to the [[ethnographer]] [[Alphonse Pinart]], who donated the collection to the [[Trocadéro]] Museum, which later became the [[Musée de l'Homme]].

==Research==
Many crystal skulls are claimed to be [[pre-Columbian]], usually attributed to the [[Aztec]] or [[Maya civilization]]s.  [[Mesoamerica]]n art has numerous representations of skulls, but none of the skulls in museum collections come from documented excavations.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Research carried out on several crystal skulls at the [[British Museum]] in 1967, 1996 and 2004 shows that the indented lines marking the teeth (for these skulls had no separate jawbone, unlike the [[Crystal skull#Mitchell-Hedges skull|Mitchell-Hedges skull]]) were carved using [[jewellery|jeweler's]] equipment ([[Die grinder|rotary tools]]) developed in the 19th century, making a supposed pre-Columbian origin problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock (2009, p.415)&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of crystal was determined by examination of [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] inclusions.&lt;ref&gt;
	{{

		title=These iron chlorite inclusions found in the British Museum's fake skull are found only in quartz from Brazil or Madagascar but not Mexico;&lt;br&gt;from google (crystal skull fakes) result 1|

		}}
		&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only found in [[Madagascar]] and [[Brazil]], and thus unobtainable or unknown within pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The study concluded that the skulls were crafted in the 19th century in Germany, quite likely at workshops in the town of [[Idar-Oberstein]], which was renowned for crafting objects made from imported Brazilian quartz in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;British Museums (n.d.-b); Craddock (2009, p.415).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been established that the crystal skulls in the British Museum and Paris's [[Musée de l'Homme]]&lt;ref&gt;The specimen at the Musée de l'Homme is half-sized.&lt;/ref&gt; were originally sold by the French antiquities dealer Eugène Boban, who was operating in [[Mexico City]] between 1860 and 1880.&lt;ref&gt;See "The mystery of the British Museum's crystal skull is solved. It's a fake", in ''The Independent'' (Connor 2005). See also the Museum's issued public statement on its crystal skull (British Museum n.d.-c).&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum crystal skull transited through New York's [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], while the Musée de l'Homme's crystal skull was donated by [[Alphonse Pinart]], an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] who had bought it from Boban.

In 1992, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] investigated a crystal skull provided by an anonymous source; the source claimed to have purchased it in Mexico City in 1960, and that it was of [[ Aztecs|Aztec]] origin.  The investigation concluded that this skull also was made recently.  According to the Smithsonian, Boban acquired his crystal skulls from sources in Germany, aligning with conclusions made by the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;See the account given by Smithsonian anthropologist Jane Walsh of her joint investigations with British Museum's materials scientist Margaret Sax, which ascertained the crystal skull specimens to be 19th century fakes, in Smith (2005). See also Walsh (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' published a detailed study by the British Museum and the Smithsonian in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Sax ''et al.'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[X-ray crystallography]], a team of British and American researchers found that the British Museum skull was worked with a harsh abrasive substance such as [[corundum]] or [[diamond]], and shaped using a rotary disc tool made from some suitable metal. The Smithsonian specimen had been worked with a different abrasive, namely the silicon-carbon compound [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (Silicon carbide) which is a synthetic substance manufactured using modern industrial techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Carborundum occurs naturally only in minute amounts in the extremely rare mineral [[moissanite]], first identified in a [[meteorite]] in 1893. See summary of the discovery and history of silicon carbide in Kelly (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the synthesis of carborundum dates only to the 1890s and its wider availability to the 20th century, the researchers concluded "[t]he suggestion is that it was made in the 1950s or later".&lt;ref&gt;See reportage of the study in Rincon (2008), and the study itself in Sax ''et al.'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other artifacts of controversial origin==
None of the skulls in museums come from documented excavations.  A parallel example is provided by [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian mirrors]], ritual objects widely depicted in Aztec art. Although a few surviving obsidian mirrors come from archaeological excavations,&lt;ref&gt;Such as at [[Teotihuacan]]; see Taube (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; none of the Aztec-style obsidian mirrors are so documented. Yet most authorities on Aztec material culture consider the Aztec-style obsidian mirrors as authentic pre-Columbian objects.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Olivier (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Michael E. Smith]] reports a non [[peer-reviewed]] find of a small crystal skull at an Aztec site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2008/05/blog-post.html |title=Aztec Crystal Skulls |last=Smith |first=Michael E. |work=Publishing Archaeology Blog |date=May 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal skulls have been described as "A fascinating example of artifacts that have made their way into museums with no scientific evidence to prove their rumored pre-Columbian origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Smithsonian puts its fake- crystal skull- on display |journal=San Francisco Chronicle |year=2008 |issue=July 18 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/11/DDV111N1T2.DTL |accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar case is the "Olmec-style" face mask in [[jade]]; hardstone carvings of a face in a mask form.  Curators and scholars refer to these as "Olmec-style", as to date no example has been recovered in an archaeologically controlled [[Olmec]] context, although they appear Olmec in style.  However they have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of [[Tenochtitlan]] ([[Mexico City]]), which would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the Aztecs buried it, suggesting these were as valued and collected as Roman antiquities were in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20080415091406/http://artworld.uea.ac.uk/cms/index.php?q=node/873 Artworld University of East Anglia collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual skulls==

===Mitchell-Hedges skull===
Perhaps the most famous and enigmatic skull was allegedly discovered in 1924 by Anna Mitchell-Hedges, adopted daughter of British adventurer and popular author [[F.A. Mitchell-Hedges]].  It is the subject of a video [[Documentary film|documentary]] made in 1990, ''Crystal Skull of Lubaantun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crystal Skull of Labaantun (1990) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/11717/Crystal-Skull-of-Lubaantun/overview?scp=6&amp;sq=%22crystal%20skull%22&amp;st=cse |accessdate=2008-07-20 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was examined and described by Smithsonian researchers as "very nearly a replica of the British Museum skull—almost exactly the same shape, but with more detailed modeling of the eyes and the teeth."&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2008). See also the 1936 debate on its resemblance to the British Museum skull, in Digby (1936) and Morant (1936), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;
Mitchell-Hedges claimed that she found the skull buried under a collapsed altar inside a temple in [[Lubaantun]], in [[British Honduras]], now [[Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;See Garvin (1973, caption to photo 25); also Nickell (2007, p.67).&lt;/ref&gt;  As far as can be ascertained, F.A. Mitchell-Hedges himself made no mention of the alleged discovery in any of his writings on Lubaantun. Others present at the time of the excavation recorded neither the skull's discovery nor Anna's presence at the dig.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007, pp.68–69"&gt;Nickell (2007, pp.68–69)&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent evidence has come to light showing that F.A. Mitchell-Hedges purchased the skull at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in London on October 15, 1943, from London art dealer [[Sydney Burney]].&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Jane MacLaren |title=The Skull of Doom |journal=Archaeology Magazine |date=May 27, 2010 |url=https://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/mitchell_hedges/acquisition_history.html |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1943, F.A. Michell-Hedges disclosed his purchase of the skull in a letter to his brother, stating plainly that he acquired it from Burney.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Society, "The Truth Behind: The Crystal Skulls" (2011), a broadcast which includes an interview with Dr. Jane Walsh, Smithsonian Institution: "It was sold at auction, at Sotheby's, to Frederick Mitchell-Hedges, so he didn't get it at Lubaantun, he didn't dig it up."&lt;/ref&gt;

The skull is made from a block of clear quartz about the size of a small human cranium, measuring some {{convert|5|in|cm}} high, {{convert|7|in|cm}} long and {{convert|5|in|cm}} wide. The lower jaw is detached. In the early 1970s it came under the temporary care of freelance art restorer Frank Dorland, who claimed upon inspecting it that it had been "carved" with total disregard to the natural crystal axis, and without the use of metal tools. Dorland reported being unable to find any tell-tale scratch marks, except for traces of mechanical grinding on the teeth, and he speculated that it was first chiseled into rough form, probably using diamonds, and the finer shaping, grinding and polishing was achieved through the use of sand over a period of 150 to 300 years. He said it could be up to 12,000 years old. Although various claims have been made over the years regarding the skull's physical properties, such as an allegedly constant temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21&amp;nbsp;°C), Dorland reported that there was no difference in properties between it and other natural quartz crystals.&lt;ref&gt;Dorland, in a May 1983 letter to Joe Nickell, cited in Nickell (2007, p.70).&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Dorland's care the skull came to the attention of writer Richard Garvin, at the time working at an advertising agency where he supervised [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s advertising account. Garvin made arrangements for the skull to be examined at Hewlett-Packard's crystal laboratories in Santa Clara, California, where it was subjected to several tests. The labs determined only that it was not a composite as Dorland had supposed, but that it was fashioned from a single crystal of quartz.&lt;ref&gt;See Garvin (1973, pp.75–76), also Hewlett-Packard (1971, p.9). The test involved immersing the skull in a liquid ([[benzyl alcohol]]) with the same [[diffraction]] coefficient and viewing it under [[polarized light]].&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory test also established that the lower jaw had been fashioned from the same left-handed growing crystal as the rest of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin (1973, pp.75–76); Hewlett-Packard (1971, p.9).&lt;/ref&gt; No investigation was made by Hewlett-Packard as to its method of manufacture or dating.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett-Packard (1971, p.10).&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the traces of mechanical grinding on the teeth noted by Dorland,&lt;ref&gt;Garvin (1973, p.84); also cited in Nickell (2007, p.70).&lt;/ref&gt; Mayanist archaeologist [[Norman Hammond]] reported that the holes (presumed to be intended for support pegs) showed signs of being made by drilling with metal.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, in a May 1983 letter to Nickell, cited in Nickell (2007, p.70). See also Hammond's recounting of his meeting with Anna Mitchell-Hedges and the skull in an article written for ''The Times'', in Hammond (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Mitchell-Hedges refused subsequent requests to submit the skull for further scientific testing.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007, p.69"&gt;Nickell (2007, p.69)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest published reference to the skull is the July 1936 issue of the British anthropological journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'', where it is described as being in the possession of Sydney Burney, a London art dealer who is said to have owned it since 1933.&lt;ref&gt;See Morant (1936, p.105), and comments in Digby (1936). See also discussion of the prior ownership in Nickell (2007, p.69).&lt;/ref&gt; No mention was made of Mitchell-Hedges. 

F. A. Mitchell-Hedges mentioned the skull only briefly in the first edition of his autobiography, ''Danger My Ally'' (1954), without specifying where or by whom it was found.&lt;ref&gt;See Mitchell-Hedges (1954, pp.240–243); also description of same in the chapter "Riddle of the Crystal Skulls", in Nickell (2007, pp.67–73).&lt;/ref&gt; He merely claimed that "it is at least 3,600 years old and according to legend it was used by the High Priest of the Maya when he was performing esoteric rites. It is said that when he willed death with the help of the skull, death invariably followed".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell-Hedges' quote, as reproduced in Nickell (2007, p.67).&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent editions of ''Danger My Ally'' omitted mention of the skull entirely.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007, p.69"/&gt;

[[File:EBoban.jpg|thumb|Eugène Boban, main French dealer in pre-Columbian artifacts during the second half of the 19th century and probable source of many famous skulls]]
In a 1970 letter Anna also stated that she was "told by the few remaining Maya that the skull was used by the high priest to will death."&lt;ref&gt;Garvin (1973, p.93)&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, the artifact is sometimes referred to as "The Skull of Doom". Anna Mitchell-Hedges toured with the skull from 1967 exhibiting it on a pay-per-view basis.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere between 1988 and 1990 she toured with the skull. She continued to grant interviews about the artifact until her death.

In her last eight years, Anna Mitchell-Hedges lived in [[Chesterton, Indiana]],  with Bill Homann, whom she married in 2002. She died on April 11, 2007. Since that time the Mitchell-Hedges Skull has been owned by Homann. He continues to believe in its mystical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Stelzer | first = C.D. | publisher = Illinois Times | date = 2008-06-12 | title = The kingdom of the crystal skull | url = http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid:7678 | accessdate = 2009-02-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130103054921/http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid:7678 | archivedate = 2013-01-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Homann took the skull to the office of [[anthropologist]] [[Jane MacLaren Walsh]], in the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] for examination.&lt;ref name="Archaeology Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/mitchell_hedges/microscope.html|title=The Skull of Doom:Under the Microscope|last= Walsh|first=Jane MacLaren|date=May 27, 2010|work=Archaeology Magazine|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered [[Optical microscope|light microscope]], and [[computerized tomography]]. Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, ''Legend of the Crystal Skull'' and on this occasion Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal rotary tool coated with a hard abrasive such as diamond. Walsh's extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by abrading the surface with stone or wooden tools and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh to the conclusion that the skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.&lt;ref name="Archaeology Magazine"/&gt;

In the [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary "The Truth Behind the Crystal Skulls", [[forensic art]]ist Gloria Nusse performed a [[forensic facial reconstruction]] over a replica of the skull. According to Nusse, the resulting face had female and [[Europe]]an characteristics. As it was hypothesized that the Crystal Skull was a replica of an actual human skull, the conclusion was that it could not have been created by ancient Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title= The Truth Behind the Crystal Skulls|url= http://natgeotv.com/uk/the-truth-behind/videos/crystal-skull|series= National Geographic Channel: The Truth Behind |credits= |network=[[National Geographic Channel]] | medium=Documentary |date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Museum skull===
The crystal skull of the [[British Museum]] first appeared in 1881, in the shop of the Paris antiquarian, [[Eugène Boban]]. Its origin was not stated in his catalogue of the time. He is said to have tried to sell it to Mexico's national museum as an Aztec artifact, but was unsuccessful. Boban later moved his business to New York City, where the skull was sold to [[George H. Sisson]]. It was exhibited at the meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in New York City in 1887 by [[George F. Kunz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Great Labor Problem. It Receives Attention from the Scientists. They devote attention, too, to a beautiful adze and a mysterious crystal skull |journal=New York Times |year=1887 |issue=August 13 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/08/13/100928264.pdf |accessdate=2008-07-17 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold at auction, and bought by [[Tiffany and Co.]], who later sold it at cost to the [[British Museum]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum (n.d.-a, n.d.-b)&lt;/ref&gt;
This skull is very similar to the Mitchell-Hedges skull, although it is less detailed and does not have a movable lower jaw.&lt;ref&gt;Digby (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum catalogues the skull's [[provenance]] as "probably European, 19th century AD"&lt;ref&gt;British Museum (n.d.-a)&lt;/ref&gt; and describes it as "not an authentic pre-Columbian artefact".&lt;!--NOTE: this is a direct quote. Do not change the spelling to 'artifact'.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Museum (n.d.-c). See also articles on the investigations which established it to be a fake, in Connor (2005), Jury (2005), Smith (2005), and Walsh (1997, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been established that this skull was made with modern tools, and that it is not authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Rincon (2008), Sax ''et al.'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris skull===
[[File:Crystal skull in Musée du quai Branly, Paris.jpg|thumb|Crystal skull at the Musée du quai Branly, Paris]]
The largest of the three skulls sold by Eugène Boban to Alphonse Pinart (sometimes called the Paris Skull), about {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} high, has a hole drilled vertically through its center.&lt;ref&gt;Kunz (1890, pp.285–286), see description in  [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/kunz_gems_and_precious_stones/page_311 "Ch. XIV: Mexico &amp; Central America"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a collection held at the [[Musée du Quai Branly]], and was subjected to scientific tests carried out in 2007–08 by France's national [[Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France]] (''Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums in France'', or C2RMF). After a series of analyses carried out over three months, C2RMF engineers concluded that it was "certainly not pre-Columbian, it shows traces of polishing and abrasion by modern tools."&lt;ref&gt;Quote reported by Agence France-Presse, see Rosemberg (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Particle accelerator tests also revealed occluded traces of water that were dated to the 19th century, and the Quai Branly released a statement that the tests "seem to indicate that it was made late in the 19th century."&lt;ref&gt;Quote reported by Agence France-Presse, see Rosemberg (2008). See also Walsh (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 2009 the C2RMF researchers published results of further investigations to establish when the Paris skull had been carved. [[Scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) analysis indicated the use of [[lapidary]] machine tools in its carving. The results of a new dating technique known as [[quartz hydration dating]] (QHD) demonstrated that the Paris skull had been carved later than a reference quartz specimen artifact, known to have been cut in 1740. The researchers conclude that the SEM and QHD results combined with the skull's known provenance indicate it was carved in the 18th or 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Calligaro ''et al.'' (2009, ''abstract'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smithsonian Skull===
The "Smithsonian Skull", Catalogue No. A562841-0 in the collections of the Department of Anthropology, [[National Museum of Natural History]], was mailed to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] anonymously in 1992, and was claimed to be an [[Aztec]] object by its donor and was purportedly from the collection of [[Porfirio Diaz]]. It is the largest of the skulls, weighing {{convert|31|lb|kg}} and is {{convert|15|in|cm}} high.  It was carved using [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]], a modern abrasive. It has been displayed as a modern fake at the [[National Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Owen|title=The Smithsonian's Crystal Skull|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The_Smithsonians_Crystal_Skull.html|publisher=Smithsonian Museum|accessdate=24 April 2012|date=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paranormal claims and spiritual associations==
Some individuals believe in the paranormal claim that crystal skulls can produce a variety of miracles. Anna Mitchell-Hedges claimed that the skull she allegedly discovered could cause visions, cure [[cancer]], that she once used its magical properties to kill a man, and that in another instance, she saw in it a premonition of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Various authors. "The Crystal Skulls" ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] magazine''. Vol. 14, No. 2. 2008. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1931 play ''The Satin Slipper'' by [[Paul Claudel]], King Philip II of Spain uses "a death's head made from a single piece of rock crystal," lit by "a ray of the setting sun," to see the defeat of his Armada in its attack on England (day 4, scene 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–44).&lt;ref&gt;Claudel, Paul. ''The Satin Slipper.'' Trans. John O'Connor and Paul Claudel. London: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1931. Originally published as ''Le Soulier de Satin'' (Paris: Nouvelle Revue Française).&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of the healing and [[supernatural]] powers of crystal skulls have had no support in the scientific community, which has found no evidence of any unusual phenomena associated with the skulls nor any reason for further investigation, other than the confirmation of their provenance and method of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;See Nickell (2007, pp.67–73); Smith (2005); Walsh (1997; 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, that of the skull written about in Richard T. Cole's book, ''Crystal Clear,'' the skull was not crystal at all, but clear acrylic plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Randi |first1=James |authorlink1=James Randi |title=It Just Never Stops... |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=18-20 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929181720/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/it_just_never_stops_ |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another novel and historically unfounded speculation ties in the legend of the crystal skulls with the completion of the current [[Maya calendar]] ''[[b'ak'tun]]''-cycle on December 21, 2012, claiming the re-uniting of the thirteen mystical skulls will forestall a catastrophe allegedly predicted or implied by the ending of this calendar (see [[2012 phenomenon]]). An airing of this claim appeared (among an assortment of others made) in ''The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |people=John Schriber (Executive Producer). Kevin Huffman, Erin McGarry, Andrew Rothstein and Andrea Skipper (Producers). Jayme Roy (Director of Photography). [[Lester Holt]] (Presenter) |title=The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls |url=http://www.scifi.com/crystalskulls/ |date=May 2008 |medium=television program |location=New York |publisher=[[NBC|Peacock Productions (NBC)]], in association with the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2008 program produced for the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in May and shown on [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]] in June. Interviewees included [[Richard C. Hoagland|Richard Hoagland]], who attempted to link the skulls and the Maya to life on Mars, and [[David Hatcher Childress]], proponent of lost Atlantean civilizations and anti-gravity claims.

Crystal skulls are also referred to by author [[Drunvalo Melchizedek]] in his book ''Serpent of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;Serpent of Light - Beyond 2012, {{ISBN|1-57863-401-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that he came across indigenous Mayan descendants in possession of crystal skulls at ceremonies at temples in the Yucatán, which he writes contained souls of ancient Mayans who had entered the skulls to await the time when their ancient knowledge would once again be required.

The alleged associations and origins of crystal skull mythology in Native American spiritual lore, as advanced by [[neoshamanism|neoshamanic]] writers such as Jamie Sams, are similarly discounted.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of the various claims put forward by Sams, Kenneth Meadows, Harley Swift Deer Reagan and others concerning crystal skulls, [[ancient astronaut theories|extraterrestrials]], and Native American lore, in Jenkins (2004, pp.215–218).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, as [[Philip Jenkins]] notes, crystal skull mythology may be traced back to the "baroque legends" initially spread by F.A. Mitchell-Hedges, and then afterwards taken up:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1970s, the crystal skulls [had] entered New Age mythology as potent relics of ancient Atlantis, and they even acquired a canonical number: there were exactly thirteen skulls.&lt;br/&gt;None of this would have anything to do with North American Indian matters, if the skulls had not attracted the attention of some of the most active New Age writers.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Jenkins (2004, pp.217–218).&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), the 4th installment in the action-adventure franchise, revolves around a fictional back-story about crystal skulls, specifically mentioning the Mitchell-Hedges skull.
*''[[Stargate SG-1 (season 3)]]'', Episode 21 revolves around a crystal skull found on an alien planet, and an associated skull that seems to borrow details from the Mitchell-Hedges skull, other than the discoverer. In the show it was reportedly found by Daniel Jackson's grandfather, Nick Ballard. 
*''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'', The first half of the second season revolves around finding the 13 Aztec crystal skulls, which hold the power to grant 1 irreversible wish to the person that holds the 13th skull, after the other 12 are placed in the Gargoyles of Pantheon.

'''Dmytro Doroshenko''' ({{lang-uk|Дмитро Іванович Дорошенко}}, ''Dmytro Ivanovych Doroshenko'', {{lang-ru|Дми́трий Ива́нович Дороше́нко}}; 8 April 1882 – 19 March 1951) was a prominent [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] political figure during the revolution of 1917–1918 and a leading Ukrainian emigre [[historian]] during the inter-war period. Doroshenko was a supporter of federal ties with the [[Russian Republic]] and a member of the [[Ukrainian Party of Socialist Federalists]].

==Political career==
Doroshenko was born into an old Ukrainian [[Cossack]] noble family which had given [[Ukraine]] two prominent [[Hetman]]s during the seventeenth century. He studied history at the universities of [[Warsaw]], [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Kiev]] and was active in the Ukrainian national movement during the early years of the twentieth century; he contributed articles on history and literature to Ukrainian periodicals and edited the political journal ''Ukrainskii vestnik'' (The Ukrainian Herald) which reflected the views of the Ukrainian Club in the Russian State [[Duma]] (1906). Thereafter, he became active in the Ukrainian Scientific Society in Kiev and the [[Prosvita]] educational society in [[Yekaterinoslav]]. During the war which broke out in 1914 he was active in the [[Union of Cities]] and did relief work in Russian held [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Bukovina]].

During the revolution of 1917–1918, Doroshenko held several responsible positions under the radical and socialist Ukrainian [[Central Rada]], which quickly emerged as a kind of Ukrainian national parliament, and he helped to build the autonomous [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. However, distressed by the continuous shift to the left of the Central Rada, Doroshenko supported the conservative coup staged by General [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] and his German military supporters and was named Foreign Minister in the new Hetmanate, or monarchy, that was then established. He was a firm supporter of the Ukrainian national element in this regime to which many [[White movement|"White" Russian]] elements were attracted, but he also had the difficult task of reconciling various pro-Russian, pro-German, and pro-Ukrainian influences on the foreign policy of the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]]. The task proved impossible and Doroshenko eventually resigned shortly before the collapse of this conservative regime.

==Emigration==
In 1919, Doroshenko went into exile and eventually settled in [[Prague]] where the Czechoslovak government gave refuge to Ukrainian and Russian emigres, especially scholars. During the inter-war period, Doroshenko was in turn a professor of history at the Ukrainian Free University in Prague, Director of the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Berlin]], and Professor of Church History at the [[University of Warsaw]]. In 1937 and 1938, he made two highly successful lecture tours of Canada which at that time possessed a large Ukrainian immigrant population.  In 1939, he returned to Prague where he continued his historical work at the Ukrainian Free University.

In 1945, Doroshenko fled to western Germany where he became the first president of the Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences. In 1947, he moved to Canada where he taught history and literature at Saint Andrew's College in [[Winnipeg]] and together with the literary historian, Leonid Biletsky, and the philologist, [[Jaroslav Rudnyckyj]], established a branch of the Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences. However, he fell ill in Winnipeg and in 1950 returned to Europe. He died in Munich in early 1951.

==Historian==
As a historian, Doroshenko represented the conservative ''Derzhavnyk'' or "statist" trend in Ukrainian historiography. On the one hand, he accepted the historical scheme of the famous Ukrainian historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], which saw continuity in the history of his country from [[Kievan Rus']] to modern times and claimed the heritage of Kievan Rus' primarily for modern Ukraine, but on the other hand, he rejected Hrushevsky's stress upon the role of the common people, instead stressing the role of the educated political elite. Doroshenko was especially fond of the old Cossack officer class which evolved into the later Ukrainian gentry and he gave much space in his histories to the strivings of this elite for political autonomy and independence.

==Major works==
Doroshenko authored a two volume ''Survey of Ukrainian History'', a ''Survey of Ukrainian Historiography'', biographies of several major figures of the Ukrainian national awakening of the nineteenth century, a book on German depictions of Ukraine throughout the centuries, works on the revolutionary period and the Hetman state of 1918, a major work on his relative, the seventeenth century Cossack Hetman, [[Petro Doroshenko]], booklets on church history, and two volumes of memoirs which treated the period from 1900 to 1919. His personal bibliography lists almost 1000 titles.

'''Edgar Cayce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|iː}}; March 18, 1877&amp;nbsp;– January 3, 1945) was an American [[clairvoyant]] who answered questions on subjects as varied as [[healing]], reincarnation, wars, [[Atlantis]], and future events while claiming to be in a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].  A biographer gave him the nickname, '''The Sleeping Prophet'''. A nonprofit organization, the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]],&lt;ref name='ARE About/Mission'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx?id=1036 | title = About A.R.E. and Our Mission | accessdate = December 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded to facilitate the study of Cayce's work.

Some consider him the true founder and a principal source of the most characteristic beliefs of the [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements |first=Michael |last=York |year=1995 |page=60 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-8001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce is also notable for his contributions to the notions of diet and health, particularly the issues of [[food combining]], [[acid/alkaline diet]], and the [[Food therapy|therapeutic use of food]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Edgar Cayce was born on March 18, 1877, near [[Beverly, Kentucky|Beverly]], south of [[Hopkinsville]], [[Kentucky]]. He was one of six children of [[farmers]] Carrie Elizabeth (née Major)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88291563/carrie-elizabeth-cayce|title=Carrie Elizabeth Major Cayce (1855-1927) - Find A...|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie Burr Cayce.&lt;ref name='ARE Chronology'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx?id=1971 | title = Chronology | accessdate = December 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, he played with the 'little folk'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is a River|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|publisher=A.R.E. Press (50th Anniversary edition)|year=1942|isbn=0876042353|location=Virginia Beach, VA|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was alleged to have seen his deceased grandfather. He regarded them all as incorporeal because he could see through them if he looked hard enough.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  However, he found it very difficult to keep his mind on his lessons at school.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was taken to church when he was 10, and from then he read the Bible, becoming engrossed, and completing a dozen readings by the time he was 12.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In May 1889, while reading the Bible in his hut in the woods, he 'saw' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered, and asked him what he wanted most of all. He was frightened, but he said that most of all he wanted to help others, especially sick children.  He decided he would like to be a missionary.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next night, after a complaint from the school teacher, his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling, eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation.  At that point, Cayce 'heard' the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before.  She told him that if he could sleep a little 'they' could help him.  He begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book.  When his father came back into the room and woke him up, he knew all the answers.  In fact, he could repeat anything in the book.  His father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him out of the chair again.  Eventually, Cayce used all his school books that way.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 46–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1892, the teacher regarded Cayce as his best student. On being questioned, Cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books. His father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around, resulting in Cayce becoming "different" from his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this, Cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep.  He was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game, after which he began to act very strangely, and eventually was put to bed. He went to sleep and diagnosed the cure, which his family prepared and which cured him as he slept.  His father boasted that his son was, "the greatest fellow in the world when he's asleep."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this ability was not demonstrated again for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce's uncommon personality is also shown in an unusual incident in which he rode a certain mule back to the farmhouse at the end of a work day.  This stunned everyone there, as the mule could not be ridden. The owner, thinking it may be time to break the animal in again, attempted to mount it but was immediately thrown off.  Cayce left for his family in the city that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1893 to 1912: Kentucky period===
{{Christian mysticism}}
In December 1893, the Cayce family moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and occupied 705 West Seventh on the southeast corner of Seventh and Young Streets. During this time, Cayce received an eighth-grade education, is said by the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] to have developed psychic abilities,&lt;ref name='ARE Bio'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx | title = About Edgar Cayce | accessdate = December 19, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left the family farm to pursue various forms of employment.

Cayce's education stopped in the ninth grade because his family could not afford the costs involved.&lt;ref name="MM_13"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A ninth-grade education was often considered more than sufficient for working-class children. Much of the remainder of Cayce's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money. On March 14, 1897, Cayce became engaged to Gertrude Evans.

Throughout his life, Cayce was drawn to church as a member of the Disciples of Christ. He read the [[Bible]] once a year every year, taught at [[Sunday school]],&lt;ref name="ARB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and recruited missionaries. He said he could see [[wikt:aura|aura]]s around people, spoke to angels, and heard voices of departed relatives. In his early years, he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is a River|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|publisher=A.R.E. Press (50th Anniversary edition)|year=1942|isbn=0876042353|location=Virginia Beach, VA|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Cayce formed a business partnership with his father to sell [[Woodmen of the World]] [[Insurance]]; however, in March he was struck by severe [[laryngitis]] that resulted in a complete loss of speech.&lt;ref name="MM_13"/&gt; Unable to work, he lived at home with his parents for almost a year. He then decided to take up the trade of [[photography]], an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice. He began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville, and eventually became quite talented in his trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, a traveling stage [[hypnotist]] and entertainer named Hart, who referred to himself as "The Laugh Man", was performing at the Hopkinsville Opera House. Hart heard about Cayce's condition and offered to attempt a cure. Cayce accepted his offer, and the experiment was conducted in the office of Manning Brown, the local throat specialist. Cayce's voice allegedly returned while in a hypnotic trance but disappeared on awakening. Hart tried a posthypnotic suggestion that the voice would continue to function after the trance, but this proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="MM_14"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Hart had appointments at other cities, he could not continue his hypnotic treatments of Cayce, but admitted he had failed because Cayce would not go into the third stage of hypnosis to take a suggestion.  A New York hypnotist, Dr Quackenboss, found the same impediment but, after returning to New York, suggested that Cayce should be prompted to take over his own case while in the second stage of hypnosis. The only local hypnotist, Al Layne, offered to help Cayce restore his voice.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 116-120&lt;/ref&gt; Layne suggested that Cayce describe the nature of his condition and cure while in a hypnotic trance.&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; Cayce described his own ailment from a first-person plural point of view: "we" instead of the singular "I".&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; In subsequent sessions, when Cayce wanted to indicate that the connection was made to the "entity" of the person that was requesting the reading, he would generally start off with, "We have the body." According to the reading for the "entity" of Cayce, his voice loss was due to psychological paralysis, and could be corrected by increasing the blood flow to the voice box. Layne suggested that the blood flow be increased and Cayce's face supposedly became flushed with blood, and both his [[chest]] and [[throat]] turned bright red.&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; After 20 minutes, Cayce, still in a trance, declared the treatment over. On awakening, his voice was alleged to have remained normal. Apparently, relapses occurred, but were said to have been corrected by Layne in the same way, and eventually the cure was said to be permanent.

Layne had read of similar hypnotic cures by the [[Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Franz Mesmer]], and was keen to explore the limits of the healing knowledge involved with the trance voice.&lt;ref name="MM_15"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 123–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the [[newspaper]]s, which inspired many postal inquiries.&lt;ref name="MM_19"/&gt; Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and  location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed "the entity," and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him.  Few people knew what he was up to.  There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.

In May 1902 he got a bookshop job in the town of [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] where he boarded with some young professionals, two of whom were doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt;  He lost his voice while there and Layne came to help effect the normal cure, finally visiting every week.  Cayce, still worried, kept the meetings secret, and continued to refuse money for his readings.  He invented a card game called ''[[Pit (game)|Pit]]'' or ''Board of Trade'', simulating wheat market trading, that became popular, but when he sent the idea to a game company they copyrighted it and he got no returns. He still refused to give readings for money.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 134–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce and Gertrude Evans married on June 17, 1903, and she moved to Bowling Green with him. They had three children: Hugh Lynn Cayce (March 16, 1907 – July 4, 1982), Milton Porter Cayce (March 28, 1911 – May 17, 1911), and Edgar Evans Cayce (February 9, 1918 – February 15, 2013).&lt;ref name="ARE Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Virginian Pilot (obituaries) Feb 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She still disapproved of the readings, and Cayce still agonized over the morality of them.  A few days later Layne revealed the activity to the professionals at the boarding house, one of whom was a magistrate and journalist, after which state medical authorities forced Layne to close his practice. He left to acquire osteopathic qualifications in Franklin.  Cayce and Gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could, greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in Bowling Green, while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon, with Cayce’s co-operation. All the experiments confirmed the accuracy of the readings. However, Cayce refused a lucrative offer to go into business. After a violent examination by doctors while in a trance, Cayce refused any more investigations, declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 146–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios, leading to bankruptcy.  Between the two fires, his first son was born on March 16, 1907. He became debt free by 1909, although completely broke, and ready to start again.  In 1907, outstanding diagnostic successes in the family helped his confidence. He again refused an offer to go into business, this time with homeopath Wesley H. Ketchum from Hopkinsville, who was introduced by his father.  He found a job at the H. P. Tresslar photography firm.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 161–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ketchum was persistent, spread information in various medical circles, and in October 1910 got written up in the press.  When a reporter contacted Cayce, he explained to the reporter that he somehow had the ability to easily go into the intuitive sleep when he wanted to, and this was different from how he went to sleep normally like everyone else. When asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method, they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 175–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ketchum again urged Cayce to join a business company. After soul searching the whole night, Cayce finally accepted the offer under certain conditions, including that he did not take money for the readings.  Instead the company was to furnish him with a photographic studio for his livelihood, and build a separate office for the readings. The contract was modified to give 50% of the earnings to Cayce and his father. Cayce read the back readings, but they contained so many technical terms that he gained no more understanding of what he was doing.  He preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis, but only the doctors in Hopkinsville would cooperate, whereas most of the patients were not in that locality. Also, doctors from all specialties were needed as the treatments prescribed varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 180–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Cayce, and especially Gertrude, still did not give therapeutic priority to the readings and supposedly lost their second child due to this reticence. When Gertrude became fatally ill with tuberculosis, they used the readings after the doctor had given up. Miraculously, the treatment cured her. Shortly after this, in 1912, Cayce, whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings, discovered that Ketchum had not been honest about them, and had also used them to gamble for finance.  He argued in defense that the medical profession were not backing them. Cayce quit the company immediately and went back to the Tresslar photography firm in Selma, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 191–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912 to 1923: Selma, Alabama period===
[[File:Cayce Selma AL DCP 0924.JPG|thumb|right|Historic marker in downtown [[Selma, Alabama]], in front of the building where Cayce lived and worked from 1912 to 1923.]]

Cayce's work grew in volume as his fame grew. He asked for voluntary donations to support himself and his family so that he could practice full-time. To help raise money he invented [[Pit (game)|''Pit'']], a card game based on the commodities trading at the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], and the game is still sold today. He continued to work in an apparent trance state with a hypnotist all his life. His wife and eldest son later replaced Layne in this role. A secretary, Gladys Davis, recorded his readings in shorthand.&lt;ref name="MM_19"/&gt;

The growing fame of Cayce along with the popularity he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities. Even though Cayce was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give his readings, which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful. A cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market; however, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant's offer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Several times he was persuaded to give such readings as an experiment. However, when he used his ability for such purposes, he did no better than chance alone would dictate. These experiments allegedly left him depleted of energy, distraught, and unsatisfied with himself. Finally, he decided to use his gift only to help the distressed and sick.&lt;ref name="MM_19"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Arthur Lammers, a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics, persuaded Cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce was told by Lammers that, while in his trance state, he spoke of Lammers' past lives and of [[reincarnation]], something Lammers believed in. Reincarnation was a popular subject of the day but is not an accepted part of Christian doctrine. Because of this, Cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced. He challenged Lammers' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue:

:Cayce: I said all that?... I couldn't have said all that in one reading.
:Lammers: No. But you confirmed it. You see, I have been studying metaphysics for years, and I was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check what is right and what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff I've been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cayce's stenographer recorded the following:

:In this we see the plan of development of those individuals set upon this plane, meaning the ability to enter again into the presence of the Creator and become a full part of that creation.
:Insofar as this entity is concerned, this is the third appearance on this plane, and before this one, as the monk. We see glimpses in the life of the entity now as were shown in the monk, in this mode of living. The body is only the vehicle ever of that spirit and soul that waft through all times and ever remain the same.

Cayce was quite unconvinced that he had been referring to the doctrine of reincarnation, and the best Lammers could offer was that the reading "opens up the door" and to go on to share his beliefs and knowledge with Cayce.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Lammers had come to him with quite a bit of information of his own to share with Cayce and seemed intent upon convincing Cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that 12 years earlier Cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation. In reading 4841-1, given April 22, 1911, Cayce referred to the soul being "transmigrated." Because Cayce's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923, it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings.

=== 1923 to 1925: Dayton, Ohio period ===
Lammers asked Cayce to come to Dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings.  Cayce eventually agreed and went to Dayton. Gertrude Cayce was dubious but interested. There, Cayce produced much metaphysical information, which Cayce tried to reconcile with Christianity. Lammers declared that the fifth chapter of Matthew was the constitution of Christianity and the Sermon on the Mount was its Declaration of Independence.  It appeared that Cayce's subconscious mind was as much at home with the language of metaphysics as it was with the language of anatomy and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 234–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce reported that his conscience bothered him severely over this conflict. His readings of reincarnations were going against his biblical teachings and at one point he wanted to cease his channeling sessions. Once again Cayce lost his voice and in a reading for himself he was informed if he was no longer going to be a channel, his mission in this life was complete. Ultimately his trance voice, the "we" of the readings, dialogued with Cayce and finally persuaded him to continue with these kinds of readings.&lt;ref name="MM_25"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Lammers wanted to ask the readings the purpose of Cayce's clairvoyance, and to put up money for an organisation supporting Cayce's healing methods.  Cayce decided to accept the work and  asked his family to join him in Dayton as soon as they could. But by the time the Cayces had arrived there, near the end of 1923, Lammers found himself in financial difficulties and could be of no use.  Cayce used his knowledge of the Bible to convince his family that it agreed with reincarnation and other metaphysical teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 243–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time Cayce directed his activities to provide readings centred around health. The remedies that were channeled often involved the use of unusual electrotherapy, ultraviolet light, diet, massage, gemstones, less mental work and more relaxation in sand on the beach. His remedies were coming under the scrutiny of the American Medical Association and Cayce felt that it was time to legitimize the operations with the aid of licensed medical practitioners. In 1925 Cayce reported while in a trance, "the voice" had instructed him to move to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The readings increasingly came to involve occult or esoteric themes.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, ch. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Money was extremely scarce, but help came from interested persons.  The idea of an association and a hospital was mooted again, but the readings insisted on Virginia Beach, not suiting most of the people. Gertrude Cayce began to conduct all the readings. Morton Blumenthal, a young man who worked in the stock exchange in New York with his trader brother, became very interested in the readings, shared Cayce's outlook, and offered to finance the vision in the right spirit. He bought them a house at Virginia Beach.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 267–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 1927, the Association of National Investigations was incorporated in the state of Virginia. This would manage building the hospital and a scientific study of the readings. Morton was president and his brother and several others were vice presidents. Cayce was secretary and treasurer, and Gladys was assistant secretary. To protect against legal prosecution, the rules required any person requesting a reading to become a member of the Association and agree they were participating in an experiment in psychic research.  Early in 1928, Dr Moseley Brown, head of the psychology dept at Washington and Lee University, became convinced of the readings and joined the Association.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 274–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1928, the dedication ceremonies for the hospital complex were held.  It contained a lecture hall, library, vault for storage of the readings, and offices for research workers. There was also a large living room, a 12-car garage, servants quarters, and a tennis court. It contained "the largest lawn, in fact the only lawn, between the Cavalier and Cape Henry." The first patient was admitted the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 281–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This facility would enable consistent checking and rechecking of the remedies, which was Cayce's goal.  There were consistent remedies for many of the illnesses regardless of the patient, and Cayce hoped to produce a compendium that could be used by the medical profession.  A distinguished chemist, Dr Sunker A. Bisley, DPhil (Oxon), who also used psychic knowledge to produce medicines, collaborated with Cayce to produce [[Atomidine]], an absorbable form of iodine, which was perfected and sold.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 285–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic raison d'etre for all the cures was the "assimilation of needed properties through the digestive system, from food taken into the body… [All treatments, including all schools and types of treatment, were given in order to establish] the proper equilibrium of the assimilating system."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 290–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Therapies as divergent as salt packs, poultices, hot compresses, [[Chromotherapy|color healing]], magnetism, vibrator treatment, massage, osteopathic manipulation, dental therapy, colonics, enemas, antiseptics, inhalants, homeopathics, essential oils, mud baths were prescribed.  Substances used included oils, salts, herbs, iodine, witch hazel, magnesia, bismuth, alcohol, castoria, lactated pepsin, turpentine, charcoal, animated ash, soda, cream of tartar, aconite, laudanum, camphor, and gold solution.  These were prescribed to overcome conditions that prevented proper digestion and assimilation of needed nutrients from the prescribed diet. The aim of the readings was to produce a healthy body, removing the cause of the specific ailment.  Readings would indicate if the patient's recovery was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 290–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a waiting list of months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 295, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Blumenthal and Brown went ahead with ambitious plans for a university as a supplement to the hospital and a "parallel service for the mind and spirit".  In fact, it was to dwarf the hospital and rival other universities in respectability before psychic studies would begin. It was to open on September 22, 1930.   On September 16 Blumenthal  called a meeting of the Association resulting in his ownership of the hospital to curb expenses.  After the first semester he ceased his support of the university, and on February 26, 1931, closed down the Association.  Cayce removed the files of the readings from the hospital and took them home.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 306–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression|Depression]] years saw Cayce turn his attention to spiritual teachings. In 1931, Edgar Cayce's friends and family asked him how they could become psychic like him. Out of this seemingly simple question came an eleven-year discourse that led to the creation of  "Study Groups". From his altered state, Cayce relayed to this group that the purpose of life is not to become psychic, but to become a more spiritually aware and loving person. Study Group #1 was told that they could "bring light to a waiting world" and that these lessons would still be studied a hundred years into the future. The readings were now about dreams, coincidence (synchronicity), developing intuition, karma, the akashic records, astrology, past-life relationships, soul mates and other esoteric subjects. Hundreds of books have been published about these readings.

June 6, 1931, 61 people attended a meeting to carry on the work and form a new organization called the Association for Research and Enlightenment. In July the new association was incorporated, and Cayce legally returned the house to Blumenthal and bought another place.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 317–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Lynn proposed that they develop a stock in trade rather than something  grandiose, and that they build a library of research into the phenomena and hold study groups, and that Cayce would do two readings a day. The association accepted this, and Hugh Lynn also started a monthly bulletin for association members. The bulletin contained readings on general interest subjects, interesting cases, book reviews on psychic subjects, health hints from readings, and news of psychic phenomena in other fields.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 324–328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Lynn narrowed the mailing list to some 300 members who were genuinely enthusiastic, and as a result the first annual congress of the association was held in June 1932.  He procured speakers on various metaphysical and psychic subjects and included public readings by Cayce.  Members left the conference eager to start study groups in their own localities.   Records were kept of everything that went on in the readings including the attitudes and routines of Cayce. Everything was then checked with the subjects of the readings, most of whom were not present during the reading, and the data was published in a study entitled "100 cases of clairvoyance."   However, the response from scientists in general was that none of the experiments were performed under test conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 330–333.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hugh Lynn continued to build files of case histories, parallel studies in psychic phenomena, and research readings for the study groups.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Association activities remained simple and un-publicized.  Members raised a building fund for an office, library, and vault, which they erected in 1940-1 as a single unit added on to the Cayce residence.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 346–7, 354&lt;/ref&gt;  No sign guided visitors to the centre.  Association membership averaged 500 to 600. The turnover from year to year was approximately half this total.  The other half remained a solid basis for the research work, an audience for case studies, pamphlets, bulletins—and the Congress bulletin, which was a yearbook and record of congress events. A mailing list of several thousand served people who remained interested in Cayce's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 346–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Members were drawn from all of the Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions.  Cayce's philosophy was, if it makes you a better member of your church then it's good; if it takes you away from your church, it's bad.  The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization.  The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 348–350.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Both sons entered the forces during the war.  They both married, Hugh Lynn in 1941 and Edgar Evans in 1942.&lt;ref name="Sugrue 2003, p. 355"&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In March 1943 the first edition of the only biography written during Cayce's lifetime, by Thomas Sugrue, was published.  As a consequence, public demand increased. Office staff had to be increased, and the mailman could no longer carry all the mail so Gertrude got it from the post office by car.  Hugh Lynn was away in the forces, and Cayce coped with the letters and increased his readings to four to six per day.&lt;ref name="Sugrue 2003, p. 355"/&gt;

Cayce gained national prominence in 1943 after the publication of a high-profile article in the magazine ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'' titled "Miracle Man of Virginia Beach".&lt;ref name="AAR"/&gt; [[World War II]] was taking its toll on American soldiers and he felt he could not refuse the families who requested help for their loved ones who were missing in action. He increased the frequency of his readings to eight per day to try to make an impression on the ever-growing pile of requests. He said this took a toll on his health as it was emotionally draining and often fatigued him. The readings themselves scolded him for attempting too much and that he should limit his workload to just two life readings a day or else these good efforts would eventually kill him.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 1943 to June 1944, 1,385 readings were taken.  By August 1944 Cayce collapsed from strain.  When he gave a reading on this situation, the instructions were to rest until he was well or dead. He and Gertrude went away to the mountains of Virginia, but in September Edgar Cayce suffered a [[stroke]] at the age of 67, in September 1944, and died on January 3, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;

After the death of Cayce the Association continued the work of classifying and cross referring the over 14,000 files of readings that had been taken throughout Cayce's lifetime from March 31, 1901, to September 17, 1944. The results of these have been disseminated through the Associations publications with the members as the recipients of this material.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 356–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims for psychic abilities==

Until September 1923, his readings were not systematically recorded or preserved. However, an article published in the ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' on October 10, 1922, quotes Cayce as saying that he had given 8,056 readings as of that date and it is known that he gave approximately 13,000–14,000 readings after that date. A total of 14,306 are available at the A.R.E. Cayce headquarters in Virginia Beach and on an online member-only section along with background information, correspondence, and follow-up documentation.&lt;ref&gt;EdgarCayce.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Other abilities that have been attributed to Cayce include [[astral projection]], [[prophecy|prophesying]], [[mediumship]], viewing the [[Akashic records]] or "[[Book of Life]]", and seeing [[aura (paranormal)|aura]]s. Cayce said he became interested in learning more about these subjects after he was informed about the content of his readings, which he reported that he never actually heard himself.&lt;ref&gt;Bro, Harmon Hartzell. ''Edgar Cayce: A Seer out of Season'', Aquarian Press, London, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters==
Cayce's clients included a number of famous people such as [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Irving Berlin]], and [[George Gershwin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar Cayce: an American prophet'', Sidney Kirkpatrick, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gina Cerminara]] published books such as ''Many Mansions'' and ''The World Within''. [[Brian Weiss]] published a bestseller regarding clinical recollection of past lives, ''Many Lives, Many Masters''. These books provide broad support for [[spiritualism]] and reincarnation. ''Many Mansions'' elaborates on Cayce's work and supports his stated abilities with real life examples.

In 1971 Edgar Cayce's sons Edgar Evans Cayce and Hugh Lynn Cayce published a book titled ''The Outer Limits of Edgar Cayce's Power'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/148598|title=The outer limits of Edgar Cayce's power|last=Evans.|first=Cayce, Edgar|others=Cayce, Hugh Lynn,|isbn=1931044686|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=148598}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Cayce's readings had an approximate 85% success rate. The majority of the book investigated cases where Cayce's readings were demonstrably incorrect.

He graduated from the Cleveland College of Homeopathic Medicine in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Original Articles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;dq=wesley+harrington+ketchum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P1zXeUJwBt&amp;sig=AWVEEFSWTUGavU3oN0rOmLaIuJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BmyLU-ymDpPqoAT4yICoCA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCg |work= Cleveland Medical and Surgical Reporter |volume= 12 |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took up the practice of medicine in Hopkinsville Kentucky.  He practiced medicine in Hopkinsville until 1912.  In 1913 he traveled across country to San Francisco, and took passage to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he opened a new practice.  He returned to California in 1918, and established an office in Palo Alto California, practicing medicine there until the 1950s.  He retired to Southern California around 1963, settling in San Marino, just outside Pasadena.  He died on November 28, 1968, in Canoga Park, California.

He wrote ''The Discovery of Edgar Cayce'', published by the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment|A.R.E. Press]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/discovery-of-edgar-cayce/oclc/3537711 |title=The discovery of Edgar Cayce, (Book, 1964) |publisher=[WorldCat.org] |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism== &lt;!-- This section is referenced in [[Atomidine]] article, if you change the title please change the link --&gt;

===Controversy===
Cayce advocated some controversial ideas in his trance readings. In many trance sessions, he interpreted the history of life on Earth. One of Cayce's controversial claims was that of [[polygenism]]. According to Cayce, five human races (white, black, red, brown, and yellow) had been created separately but simultaneously on different parts of the Earth. Cayce also accepted the existence of aliens and [[Atlantis]], and claimed that "the red race developed in Atlantis and its development was rapid." Another claim by Cayce was that "soul-entities" on Earth intermingled with animals to produce "things": giants that were as much as twelve feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;Orser, Charles E. (2004). ''Race and Practice in Archaeological Interpretation''. p. 68. University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-3750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Olav Hammer]] wrote that many of Cayce's readings discussed race and skin color and that the explanation for this is that Cayce was not a racist but was influenced by the occult ideas of [[Helena Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]]. (2001). ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age''. Brill Academic Publishing. p. 114 and the footnote at the bottom of the page. {{ISBN|978-9004120167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce declared that the [[Piltdown man]] was genuine, claiming he was an Atlantean colonizer who had travelled to Britain.&lt;ref name="Fagan 2002"&gt;Fagan, Garrett G. (2002). ''Alternative Archaeology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC--CLIO. pp. 9-16. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Piltdown man was exposed as a [[hoax]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Fagan 2002"/&gt;

Philosopher and skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]], in his book ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', wrote, "Cayce is one of the main people responsible for some of the sillier notions about Atlantis." Carroll mentioned some of Cayce's ideas, including his belief in a giant solar crystal, activated by the sun, and used to harness energy and provide power on Atlantis, and his prediction that in 1958, the United States would rediscover a death ray that had been used on Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert Todd]]. (2003). ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''. Wiley. p. 69. {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930s, Cayce also incorrectly predicted that  North America would experience chaos: "Los Angeles, San Francisco... will be among those that will be destroyed before New York". These events were to have happened "in the period of '58 to '98".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/profecias/esp_profecia01h4.htm|title=American Prophecy - 4|website=www.bibliotecapleyades.net|access-date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

Skeptics challenge Cayce's alleged [[psychic]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |first=Martin |last=Gardner |authorlink=Martin Gardner |year=1957 |pages=216–219 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Randi |authorlink=James Randi |year=1982 |title=[[The Truth About Uri Geller]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |page=195 |isbn=0-87975-199-1 |quote=The matter of Edgar Cayce boils down to a vague mass of garbled data, interpreted by true believers who have a very heavy stake in the acceptance of the claims.

(1990). ''HealthSmarts: How to Spot the Quacks, Avoid the Nonsense, and Get the Facts that Affect Your Health''. Health Facts Publishing. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-0962614507}} "Some quacks, such as Edgar Cayce, attributed their powers to God. Cayce, who made his diagnoses while in trance, claimed that his healing powers came from God. To treat patients he used spinal manipulation as well as Red Bug Juice and Oil of Smoke in his cures."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. [http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/cayce.html ''The Legacies of Edgar Cayce'']. Quackwatch. Retrieved January 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writers and [[Skepticism|skeptics]] have suggested that the evidence for Cayce's alleged psychic powers comes from contemporaneous [[newspaper]] articles, affidavits, anecdotes, testimonials, and books. [[Martin Gardner]], for example, wrote that while Cayce's [[trance]]s did happen, most of the information from his trances was derived from books that Cayce had been reading by authors such as [[Carl Jung]], [[P. D. Ouspensky]], and [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Gardner's hypothesis was that the trance readings of Cayce contain, "little bits of information gleaned from here and there in the occult literature, spiced with occasional novelties from Cayce's unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;[[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson, K. Paul]]. (1998). ''Edgar Cayce in Context: The Readings, Truth and Fiction''. State University of New York Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0791439067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]] writes in ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', "Uneducated beyond the ninth grade, Cayce acquired his broad knowledge through voracious reading and from this he wove elaborate tales."&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]]. ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time]]'', 2002, {{ISBN|0-8050-7089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shermer wrote that, "Cayce was fantasy-prone from his youth, often talking with angels and receiving visions of his dead grandfather." Magician [[James Randi]] has said that "Cayce was fond of expressions like 'I feel that' and 'perhaps'—qualifying words used to avoid positive declarations." Examination of the readings do not show qualifying terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1992). ''Missing Pieces: How to Investigate Ghosts, UFOs, Psychics, &amp; Other Mysteries''. Prometheus Books. p. 159. {{ISBN|0-87975-729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Cayce was never subjected to proper testing, ESP pioneer [[Joseph Banks Rhine|Joseph B. Rhine]] of Duke University — who should have been sympathetic to Cayce's claims — was unimpressed. A reading that Cayce gave for Rhine's daughter was notably inaccurate. Frequently, Cayce was even wider off the mark, as when he provided diagnoses of subjects ''who had died'' since the letters requesting the readings were sent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. p. 159. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Science writer [[Karen Stollznow]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The reality is that his cures were hearsay and his treatments were folk remedies that were useless at best and dangerous at worse&amp;nbsp;... Cayce wasn't able to cure his own cousin, or his own son who died as a baby. Many of Cayce's readings took place after the patient had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Stollznow, Karen. (2014).

His father-in-law was the idealist philosopher [[William Ernest Hocking]].

==Education and career==
Edward A. Kracke Jr. was born in [[Brooklyn]], N.Y. and raised largely in [[Chicago]] and Europe.&lt;ref name=reischauer/&gt; He attended [[Harvard University]] where he received three academic degrees: B.A. in 1932, M.A. in 1935, and Ph.D. in 1941. His undergraduate degree was in architecture and the fine arts, but a course under [[Langdon Warner]] ignited his interest in China. With an M.A. under his belt, he studied Chinese and [[Central Asia]]n history under [[Étienne Balazs]] at [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|l'École nationale des langues orientales vivantes]] in [[Paris]], France in 1935–36. From 1936 to 1940 he studied Chinese language and history at [[Yenching University]] in [[Beiping]] ([[Beijing]]), China, where he associated with [[William Hung (sinologist)|William Hung]].&lt;ref name=liu/&gt; Subsequently he returned to Harvard, working with [[Edwin O. Reischauer]], [[John K. Fairbank]] and [[Serge Elisséeff]] and completing a post-doctoral fellowship in Japanese language.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.KRACKEEA|website=[[University of Chicago Library]]|year=2010|title=Guide to the Edward A. Kracke, Jr. Papers 1927-1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Kracke worked as an intelligence officer at the Far East Division, Research and Analysis Branch of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. From January 1944 to October 1945 he headed the Japanese Political Section, producing reports on political conditions in Japan, Formosa ([[Taiwan]]), and Korea. In 1946 he transferred to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s Division of Far East Intelligence, where he stayed for less than six months before resigning to devote himself to scholarly pursuits.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

In 1946, Kracke went as a visiting professor to the [[University of Chicago]], where he would remain until retiring in 1973. In 1953 he published a monograph titled ''Civil Service in Early Sung China'', a pioneering study of the Song (Sung) society and institutions based on his dissertation. From 1954 to 1957, he served as director of the Far Eastern Association (now [[Association for Asian Studies]]), from 1957 to 1963, Chairman of the Committee on Far Eastern Civilizations, from 1970 to 1971, Chairman of the Committee on Far Eastern Studies, and from 1972 to 1973, president of the [[American Oriental Society]]. He also served as the Director of the Center for Far Eastern Studies from 1961 to 1964 and again in 1971–1972.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;&lt;ref name=reischauer/&gt;

'''Federico Chabod''' or '''Frédéric Chabod'''&lt;ref&gt;Due to the bilingual status of [[Aosta Valley]], his name is quoted in French as well: [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=mwWjP59-L3MC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric+chabod&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2j2oSDBrA5&amp;sig=eIti8rX4VNId4fYJB4ThNolB_8U&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBDgKahUKEwjxsrKL0_TGAhWEzYAKHWxzAFw#v=onepage&amp;q=fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20chabod&amp;f=false La création des régions autonomes à statut spécial en Italie]&lt;/ref&gt; (February 23, 1901 – July 14, 1960) was an Italian historian and politician.

== Biography ==
Born at [[Aosta]], he studied at the [[University of Turin]] under [[Pietro Egidi]] and [[Gaetano Salvemini]], writing his thesis on [[Machiavelli]]. His thesis was published with the title of "Introduzione al 'Principe'" in 1924. After graduating from the University of Turin, he continued his studies, this time at the [[University of Berlin]] under [[Friedrich Meinecke]]. He began his academic career at the [[University of Perugia]] and the [[University of Milan]]. In 1946, he was hired by the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] to head the [[Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Storici]] founded by [[Benedetto Croce]].  He is best known for  expanding Italian historiography from its traditional insularity by linking it in a broader, European context. 

Chabod died at Rome in 1960.

{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}
There are 17 indigenous tribes in [[Paraguay]] with the majority having their territories in the Chaco region. Tribes in this region include the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]], [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreo]], Toba-Maskoy, [[Aché people|Aché]] and Sanapan which according to the census from 2002 number an estimated 86,000 or roughly around 2 per cent of the total population. These peoples have faced persecution particularly under the dictator [[Alfredo Strossner]] that some observers call a '''Genocide of indigenous peoples in Paraguay.'''
==Repression under Alfredo Stroessner==
Between 1956 and 1989, while under the military rule of General [[Alfredo Stroessner]], the indigenous population had more territory taken than at any other period in Paraguay's history and were subjected to systematic human rights abuses. In 1971, Mark Münzel, a German anthropologist accused Stroessner of attempted genocide against the indigenous peoples of Paraguay{{sfn|Münzel|1973|p=5}} and Bartomeu Melià, a [[Jesuit]] anthropologist stated that the forced relocations of the indigenous peoples was [[ethnocide]].{{sfn|Becker|2010}} In the early 1970s the Stroessner regime was charged by international groups of being complicit in genocide. However, because of the repressive actions undertaken by the state the indigenous tribes organized themselves politically and had a major role in bringing about the end of the military dictatorship and the eventual transition to democracy.{{sfn|Minority Rights Group International|2007}}{{sfn|Becker|2010}}{{sfn|Horst|2003|p=104}}
==Destruction of the Ache tribe==
During the 1960s and 1970s, 85 percent of the Aché tribe died, with many hacked to death with machetes to make room for the timber industry, mining, farming and ranchers.{{sfn|Churchill|2000|p=433}} One estimate posits this amounts to 900 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1023.4008&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf
Victims of State:Genocide, Politicides and Group Repression Since 1945
Page 26
Babara Haff &amp; Ted Robert Gurr&lt;/ref&gt;According to Jérémie Gilbert, the situation in Paraguay has proven that it is difficult to provide the proof required to show "specific intent", in support of a claim that genocide had occurred. The Aché, whose cultural group is now seen as extinct, fell victim to the development by the state, who had promoted the exploration of Aché territory by transnational companies for natural resources. Gilbert concludes that though planned and voluntary destruction had occurred, it is argued by the state that there was no intent to destroy the Aché, as what had happened was due to development.{{sfn|Gilbert|2006|p=118}}

==Assessment of persecution as a genocide==
The allegation of genocide by the state was brought before the [[Inter-American Human Rights Commission]] which has jurisdiction on allegations of genocide carried out by a state. The commission gave a provisional ruling that Paraguay had not carried out a genocide, but stated it had concerns over "possible abuses by private persons in remote areas of the territory of Paraguay".{{sfn|Quigley|2006|p=125}}

'''Giorgi "Gogi" Khoshtaria''' ({{lang-ka|გიორგი (გოგი) ხოშტარია}}; born October 4, 1938) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] art historian and former politician who served as the first [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Georgia|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] of post-Soviet Georgia from November 1990 to August 1991. He is ranked as First Class Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Envoy.

== Career ==

Gogi Khoshtaria was born in [[Tbilisi]] in the family of Georgian [[intelligentsia]]. His father, Metode Khoshtaria (1911–1938), a highway engineer and a nephew of the wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Akaki Khoshtaria]], was shot at the age of 27 during the [[Great Purge]]. His mother, Tinatin Virsaladze (1907–1985), was an art historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kobiashvili|first=Meri|title=ზვიად გამსახურდიას ყველაზე დიდი შეცდომა მანანა იყო|date=August 7, 2013|volume=Reitingi|url=http://www.reitingi.ge/aqtualuri-sakhe/599-zviad-gamsakhurdias-yvelaze-didi-shecdoma-manana-iyo.html?lang=ka-GE|accessdate=March 2, 2014|trans-title=An interview with Giorgi Khoshtaria|language=Georgian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogi Khoshtaria was also trained as an art historian at the [[Tbilisi State University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giorgi Khoshtaria|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=482|work=Ex-Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Georgia|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia|accessdate=June 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609142648/http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=482&amp;lang_id=ENG|archivedate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pursued an academic career. In the 1980s, he joined the dissident movement and became closely associated with [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], who became the first post-Communist leader of Georgia and made Khoshtaria Minister of Foreign Affairs on November 26, 1990.

As a foreign minister, Khoshtaria met with the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Alexander Bessmertnykh (politician)|Alexander Bessmertnykh]] twice after Georgia's declaration of independence in April 1991, but the [[Georgia–Russia relations|relations between Moscow and Tbilisi]] became increasingly tense and the contacts between the two ministires ceased by mid-1991. Khoshtaria worked with the Turkish government for closer [[Georgian–Turkish relations]] and resisted the Soviet attempts to bring these ties under control. He also visited Germany and France in April and the United States in June 1991 to further the Georgian independence cause and lobby for closer economic relations. Despite his efforts, Khoshtaria became alienated from Gamsakhurdia and was dismissed in August 1991. He cited Gamsakhurdia's authoritarian tendencies and failure to immediately denounce the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] as the reasons behind the split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nichol|first=James P.|title=Diplomacy in the Former Soviet Republics|date=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0275951928|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Shale|title=From Ethnic Conflict to Stillborn Reform: The Former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia|date=2005|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=1585443964|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Opponents Charge Republic Is Led by Dictator|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/06/world/soviet-turmoil-georgia-opponents-charge-republic-is-led-by-dictator.html|accessdate=March 2, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, Khoshtaria resumed academic career. He lectures at several other academia and is a frequent commentator on culture and monument protection.

In 1951, he enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]]. Before his assignment to [[Turkey]], he learned [[Russian language|Russian]] at the [[United States Army|Army]] [[Defense Language Institute]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]]. His military duties involved the interception of [[radio]] communications from the former [[Soviet Union]]. He earned bachelor's and law degrees from the [[University of Virginia]] and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], both in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Career==

In 1964, Pettit was elected to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] for District 53 [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]]. He served three two-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.e-archives.ky.gov/Pubs/LRC/infobull/IB175b.pdf|title=Membership of Kentucky General Assembly, 1900-2004|publisher=E-archives.ky.gov|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Pettit was elected as the mayor of Lexington, a [[non-partisan]] position which he held from 1972 to 1978. Tmunicipal and county governments were consolidated in 1974, through the joint effort of Mayor Petit and Fayette County Judge Robert Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2014/10/18/3488579/former-lexington-mayor-h-foster.html|title=Former Lexington mayor H.

While Pettit was mayor, the [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] opened, and [[the Lexington Ballet]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexingtonballet.org/ |title=Lexington Ballet |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington|Federal Medical Center]] in Lexington was designated a federal prison in 1974. That same year, the [[Festival of the Bluegrass]] was launched. Opening in the Pettit years were the [[Lexington Mall]], which closed in 2005; the [[Lexington Center]], an entertainment, convention, and sports complex, a new modern airport terminal at Blue Grass Field, and the 23,500-seat [[Rupp Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ground to Be Broken for Lexington CC|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rI9DAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ia4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1783,5839806&amp;dq=en|newspaper=''Williamson Daily News''|date=June 29, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pettit was succeeded as mayor by his former election rival, James Amato. From 1979 to 1981, Pettit was the Secretary of Public Protection and Regulation during the administration of Democratic [[governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] He was of counsel with the prestigious Lexington law firm of [[Wyatt, Tarrant &amp; Combs]], named for Kentucky Democrat politicians [[Wilson W. Wyatt]] and [[Bert T.

From 1970 to 1999, Pettit owned the 15-story First National Building on West Main Street in Lexington, which was remodeled into a museum hotel with city support. He was a former chairman of Bluegrass FLOW (For Local Ownership of Water), a group which failed in an effort to acquire the Kentucky-American Water Company. Pettit was president of the Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation and was active in the [[Salvation Army]], the [[American Red Cross]], the [[Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Family and death==

On October 16, 2014, while [[fishing]] with friends in [[Mississippi River Delta|the Louisiana delta]], Pettit's boat capsized in shallow water. Though rescued several hours later by the [[United States Coast Guard]], Pettit sustained a cut on his leg and died five weeks later at [[Hammond, Louisiana#Health care|North Oaks Medical Center]] in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], [[Tangipahoa Parish]], of [[vibrio]], a [[bacteria]]l infection common to coastal waters.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2014/11/22/3553604_former-lexington-mayor-h-foster.html?rh=1|title=Former Lexington mayor H.

'''Jacob Aall''' (27 July 1773 – 4 August 1844) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[politician]], [[historian]], [[landowner]] and [[Economist|government economist]].

He was born the son of Nicolai Benjamin Aall (1739-1798), who was a merchant in [[Porsgrunn]], [[Norway]] and owner of Ulefos Manor. He was also the nephew of merchant Jacob Aall (1754-1826).

==Career==
In 1791, Aall began attending a school in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] where he earned a [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[theology]] in 1795. After graduating, he returned to Norway where he tried working as a [[cleric]], but he felt that his abilities were not well at use and decided to take up other studies. In 1796, he returned to Copenhagen, where he began studying [[natural science]]. In 1797, he journeyed to [[Germany]], touring the scientific schools of [[Leipzig]], [[Kiel]] and [[Göttingen]]. In Germany he became acquainted with the [[geologist]] [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]].

In 1799, after spending the winter at the academy of mines in [[Freiberg]], Aall returned to Norway. Following his father's death, he invested his [[Property|patrimony]] in the purchase of the immense [[Næs jernverk|Nes Iron-works]] in the [[Arendal]] ore region. After purchasing the iron-works, the operation became more efficient, but was placed in a difficult position at the outbreak of the [[English Wars (Scandinavia)|English Wars]] in 1801. However, the business persevered.

In 1814 he took a prominent part in the framing of the free [[Constitution of Norway]], and for fourteen years (1816-1830), he was a leading member of the [[Storting]], the Norwegian National Assembly.

As a writer, he translated and published [[Snorri Sturluson|Snorri Sturluson's]] ''[[Heimskringla]]''. His ''Reminisciences'' (1844-1845) is a repository of data concerning the contemporaneous history of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian]] peninsula.

In his later years, Aall increasingly withdrew from public life, and left most of the work at the iron-works to his son.

==Personal life==
In 1799 he married Louise Andrea Stephansen (1779-1825), with whom he had at least one son.

==Legacy==
Aall lent his name to Jacob Aall Street in [[Oslo]].

He was one of the 41 Norwegian citizens who helped make the creation of the [[University of Oslo]] (previously named Royal Frederick University) possible through donations.

Aall was bestowed upon the Medal for Bogerdåd, the [[Order of Vasa]] and the [[Order of the Polar Star]].

He was a member of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters|Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences]] and the Royal Danish Science Ernes Society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''James Francis Dimock''' (1810–1876) was an English cleric and historical scholar.

==Life==
The son of John Giles Dimock, rector of [[Uppingham]], [[Rutland]], he was born at [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire]], on 22 November 1810. He was educated at [[Uppingham School]] under Dr Buckland, was admitted pensioner of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], on 21 February 1829, and was elected Bell's scholar in 1830. He graduated B.A. in 1833, and M.A. in 1837.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Dimock, James Francis|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DMK829JF|name=Dimock, James Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been ordained deacon and priest by the [[bishop of Lincoln]], Dimock was in 1846 appointed minor canon of [[Southwell Cathedral]]; he gave up the canonry on his appointment as rector of [[Barnburgh]], near [[Doncaster]], in 1863. In 1869 he was made prebendary of Lincoln, and he held the prebend with his rectory until his death at Barnburgh on 21 April 1876.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Dimock was interested in ecclesiastical and mediaeval history: his earliest work was ''Illustrations of the Collegiate Church of Southwell'', London, 1854. In 1860 he published at Lincoln an edition of the ''Metrical Life of St. Hugh'', and in 1864 he edited for the [[Rolls Series]] the ''Magna Vita S. Hugonis, Episcopi Lincolniensis'', 1864. He also published ''The Thirty-nine Articles . . . explained, proved, and compared with her other authorized formularies'', London, 1843, 1845, 2 vols.

His major work was his edition of part of the works of [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] for the Rolls Series; the first four volumes were edited by [[John Sherren Brewer]], and vols. v-vii., which appeared between 1867 and 1877, by Dimock; the edition was completed with an eighth volume by [[George Frederic Warner]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3338">Very little is known about the life and times of '''James Metz'''.  It is a mystery when he was born and when he died, but what is known is that he was philosophically active in the first decade of the fourteenth century. Of his works that survive presently, much of it remains unedited, and only a dozen manuscript copies still exist.&lt;ref&gt;Gracia, Jorge J.E., and Timothy B. Noone. A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Malden : Blackwell, 2003. 249-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  James was known as a Dominican Theologian, which meant following the teachings of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]].  However, James earned the reputation for being a "critical-Thomist,"&lt;ref&gt;Irribarren, Isabel. "Henry of Ghent's Teaching on Modes and its Influence in the Fourteenth Century." Mediaeval Studies. 64. Toronto : Pontificial Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; as he openly disagreed some of Aquinas's positions.  One account of James describes him as an “eclectic thinker,” and that his works were partially influenced by [[Peter of Auvergne]] as well as [[Henry of Ghent]].&lt;ref&gt;Gracia, Jorge J.E., and Timothy B. Noone. A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Malden : Blackwell, 2003. 249-251.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical==

The only philosophical work of James’s that is known for certain is that he gave two lectures on Peter Lombard’s ''[[Sentences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pasnau, Robert. The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge 
University Press, 2010. 899. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Presumably, these lectures occurred at the University of Paris, roughly from 1300-1306.  An instance in which James did not see eye-to-eye with Aquinas was in regard to the way Aquinas described individuation by matter.  Aquinas held the view that that matter is the principle of individuation.  James, on the other hand, believed that form is the principle of individuation.&lt;ref&gt;Gracia, Jorge J.E., and Timothy B. Noone. A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Malden : Blackwell, 2003. 249-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another disagreement between James and Aquinas concerned the process of knowledge, primarily knowledge of immaterial substances and knowledge of God.  James’s views differed from those of Aquinas in that James attempted to find compatibility between Augustinian and Aristotelian accounts of knowledge.  These disagreements with Aquinas warranted criticism from the Master General of Dominican Order, [[Hervaeus Natalis]], as he wrote a doctrine called "A Correction of Brother James Metz." &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Stephen F., and Juan Carlos Flores. Historical Dictionary of Medieval Philosophy and Theology. 76. Toronto : The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2007. 150-151. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerning the divine essence, James held the view that it functioned as an origin, and that it “performs solely in relation to being.”&lt;ref&gt;Mojsisch, Burkhard. Meister Eckart: Analogy, Univocity, and Unity. Philadelphia: John Benjamins B.V., 2001. 113-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  James advocated that there is a duality to the divine essence.  In one instance it is a pure essence, the sole origin of our act and our being.  In the second instance, James believed essence can also be seen as an attribute, and that it is the cause of specific actions.

'''John Ferguson Godfrey''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC}} (born December 19, 1942) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] educator, journalist and former Member of Parliament.

==Background==
Godfrey was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. His father, Senator [[John Morrow Godfrey]] (June 28, 1912 – March 8, 2001), was a Canadian pilot, lawyer and politician. John Godfrey graduated from [[Upper Canada College]] in 1960. In 1961, he attended the [[Neuchâtel Junior College]] in [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Who's Who |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Trinity College, Toronto|Trinity College]], [[University of Toronto]] and in 1967, he received a [[Master of Philosophy]] from [[Balliol College, Oxford]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil)]] from [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] in 1975. He worked as an economist, historian and journalist. In the mid-1970s Godfrey was a history professor at [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]]. He served as president of the [[University of King's College]] from 1977-87. From 1987 to 1991 he was editor of the ''[[Financial Post]]''.

== Politics ==
He was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Toronto]] area [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Don Valley West]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]], and was re-elected in each subsequent vote until his resignation in 2008.&lt;ref name="1993 results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Results may be more complete than as published Riding-by-riding results from across Canada Ontario Algoma |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=October 26, 1993 |page=B10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995 Quebec referendum]], Godfrey had an acquaintance perform a psychiatric evaluation of separatist leader [[Lucien Bouchard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26Params%3DM1ARTM0011395 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503003841/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0011395 |archivedate=2005-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he and fellow Liberal MP [[Peter Milliken]] introduced the [[Godfrey–Milliken Bill]] a parody of the American [[Helms–Burton Act]]. The gesture received extensive media coverage including in the United States, where Godfrey was featured on the CBS program ''[[60 Minutes]]''. From 1996 to 2004, Godfrey served as a [[Parliamentary Secretary]] under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]].

== Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities  ==

In 2003, Paul Martin succeeded Chrétien as Liberal leader and prime minister. Following the subsequent [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]], Godfrey, among other key Martin allies, was appointed to the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] in the role of [[Minister of State (Canada)|Minister of State]] for Infrastructure and Communities. In this role, he was primarily responsible for overseeing the "New Deal for Cities", [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] relationship, and other initiatives in Canadian federal-municipal relations. This role was considered a keystone of Martin's industrial strategy.

According to [[Auditor General of Canada]] [[Sheila Fraser]], Canada lags far behind the US and UK in [[municipal performance audit]]s for government, in applying its own statements to [[procurement]], and in direct federal standards applying to municipal operations. Godfrey was tasked with dealing with these substantial problems, a role complicated by the fact that, constitutionally, provinces in Canada have formal jurisdiction over cities and municipalities, and have blocked most necessary changes in funding and operations. This is markedly different from in the US where the [[General Accounting Office]] has applied specific accounting standards, and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] has required specific upgrades to city emergency responses. As in major American cities, federal support of a [[municipal emergency response]] is a problem of particular concern in Godfrey's home city of Toronto, following the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] outbreak, the [[Northeast blackout of 2003|August 2003 blackout]] and smog and snow crises. Toronto is also considered to be the primary target for any [[asymmetric warfare]]/[[terrorism|terrorist]] attack on Canada.

As an additional complexity, Canadian cities faced with [[gridlock]] and [[smog]] problems due to [[commuting]] and [[urban sprawl]], now face [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Accord]] requirements to cut [[greenhouse gas]] output.

To deal with these problems, on a national level, Godfrey was directly involved in negotiations regarding climate change auditing and other municipal performance indicators that would apply at least to cities in Canada, and eventually to all municipalities.

== Liberal leadership ==

On February 3, 2006, [[CBC News Network|CBC Newsworld]]'s [[Don Newman (broadcaster)|Don Newman]] announced on air that Godfrey was planning a run for the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|Liberal Party leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/clips/rm-newsworld/politics/politicspm_fri.ram (.ram)]&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey declared his candidacy on ''Goldhawk Live'' on March 19, shortly after the rules and convention date were set. Media reaction was positive, but competed with coverage of [[Ashley MacIsaac]], who declared his intention to run to the ''[[The Daily News (Halifax)|Halifax Daily News]]'' the next day.

In the early stages of the campaign he was recurrently cited as exemplar of intellectualism in the race, being one of three former university professors in the running. Name-recognition remained a challenge, but Godfrey received plaudits in the [[Canadian blogosphere]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgarygrit.blogspot.com/2006/04/its-fun-to-stay-at-l-p-c.html]&lt;/ref&gt; for his performance in the first all-candidates meeting at the Liberal Party of Alberta convention on April 8.

On April 12, 2006, Godfrey announced his withdrawal from the race, due to concerns about his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/poor-health-pushes-godfrey-from-liberal-race-1.585830 | work=CBC News | title=Poor health pushes Godfrey from Liberal race | date=April 12, 2006 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, 2006, Godfrey announced his support for [[Bob Rae]] for the federal Liberal leadership. He made the announcement at the National Press Club, on the occasion of a speech by Rae on the environment.

==Leaving politics==

Godfrey announced in November 2007, that he would be resigning his seat in parliament on July 1, 2008 and would leave earlier if an election were called before that date. He subsequently delayed his resignation date until August 1. The Conservative Party alleged that the Liberals chose to delay the by-election for financial reasons&lt;ref&gt;Ivison, John, "[https://archive.is/20140604221957/http://www.nationalpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=d4a22917-e89f-42a0-b043-38be983736c1&amp;k=77576 Liberal war chest on credit]", ''National Post'', July 9, 2008. Retrieved 2014-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; though Godfrey's office stated that the delay was due to a private members bill Godfrey had worked on not being given [[Royal Assent]] until June 26.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210152/http://www.thehilltimes.ca/html/cover_index.php?display=story&amp;full_path=%2F2008%2Fjuly%2F14%2Fbyelection_calls%2F&amp;c=1 "Candidates girding for byelection calls"], ''Hill Times'', July 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, in a point of order following Question Period, Godfrey gave his resignation speech to the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2&amp;DocId=3586222#SOBQ-2540711&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headmaster of the Toronto French School==

John Godfrey left politics to become  Headmaster of the [[Toronto French School]], a prestigious independent school in the [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]] area with two campuses in Toronto. He held the position from 2008 until resigning in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/11/26/muslim_former_students_win_apology_from_toronto_french_school.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19127">[[José de San Martín]] is the [[Folk hero|national hero]] of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], and along with [[Simón Bolívar]], the most important ''[[Libertadores|Libertador]]'' of the [[Spanish American Wars of Independence]]. For this reason, he is homaged and depicted in several cultural works of those countries, and even internationally.

==Remains==
[[File:SanMartinMausoleum.JPG|thumb|Mausoleum of San Martín at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]]. The three statues are [[national personification]]s of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]].]]
José de San Martín died on 17 August 1850, in his house at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], [[France]]. He requested in his will to be taken to the cemetery without any [[funeral]], and to be moved to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], afterwards. He also bequeathed his [[Curved saber of San Martín|curved saber]] to the Argentine governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. [[Mariano Balcarce]] informed Rosas and the foreign minister [[Felipe Arana]] of San Martín's death. Balcarce oversaw the [[embalming]] of his remains and his temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent the saber to Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 569-574&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the rebellion of [[Justo José de Urquiza]] against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat at the [[battle of Caseros]] and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Martín's remains to Buenos Aires. Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Martín, regardless of their ongoing conflict. Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the [[state of Buenos Aires]], dominated by Unitarians who despised San Martín. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favourable conditions to the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 574-577&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of San Martín were finally repatriated on May 29, 1880, during the presidency of [[Nicolás Avellaneda]]. The mausoleum was placed inside the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]]. As San Martín was suspected of being a [[Freemasonry|freemason]], the mausoleum was placed in an expanded wing of the Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
[[File:Historia de San Martín.jpg|thumb|Cover of the book ''[[Historia de San Martín y de la emancipación sudamericana]]'' ({{lang-es|History of San Martín and the South American emancipation}}) by [[Bartolomé Mitre]].]]
San Martín was first acclaimed as a national hero of Argentina by the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federals]], as Rosas and Urquiza. [[Bernardo de Irigoyen]] published the ''Recuerdos del General San Martín'' ({{lang-es|Memoirs of the General San Martín}}) in 1851. The [[Unitarian Party|unitarians]] still resented his refusal to aid the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Directors]] with the [[Army of the Andes]] against [[Estanislao López]] and [[Francisco Ramírez (governor)|Francisco Ramírez]], which led to their downfall at the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]], and San Martín's constant support to Rosas.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 574-576&lt;/ref&gt; 

The unitarian [[Bartolomé Mitre]] wrote a series of biographies, and established [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] as a national hero of Argentina. However, as Rivadavia was a statesman without a military career, Mitre sought to create a military national hero, to complement Rivadavia, and wrote a biography of [[Manuel Belgrano]]. This attempt did not prove completely effective, as Belgrano had grave defeats in his military career.&lt;ref&gt;"''General Belgrano is a historical man who does not seduce by his appearance; he did not shine in the art of war, as San Martín, nor left undying traces in fundamental institutions, as Rivadavia''" ([[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]) - Galasso, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Mitre wrote a biography of San Martín, "''[[Historia de San Martín y de la emancipación sudamericana]]''" ({{lang-es|History of San Martín and the South American emancipation}}). By that time, several accounts of San Martín were being written at many countries: [[Valentín Ledesma]] from [[Lima]] wrote in 1853 about San Martín's campaign in Peru, and [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] from [[Chile]] wrote in 1856 about the [[Chilean War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

San Martín's support to the [[Latin American integration]] contradicted the strong centralism of the government party. As a result, the biography written by Mitre modified details about him. The [[Spanish American wars of independence]] are not treated as a continent-wide revolution, but merely as an Argentine revolution that extends freedom to Chile and Peru. Bolívar is portrayed instead as a conqueror, annexing the new free countries into an artificial unity. The war is described to be [[separatism|separatist]] from the beginning, and encouraged and supported by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 582-583&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the specific case of San Martín this scenario could seem contradictory, as he had left America as a child and served for the Spanish army for 22 years. As a result, his [[Military career of José de San Martín in Spain|military career in Spain]] is summarized in six pages (the whole book has more than six hundred), giving very little detail about him before his arrival to Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Galasso583"&gt;Galasso, p. 583&lt;/ref&gt; As for the reason for his departure from the Spanish army to join the South American ones, the book describes that "''he decided to return to his distant nation, which he had always loved as a true mother, to offer her his sword and devote her his life''".&lt;ref&gt;Mitre, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning, that his first six years living in America shaped his personality more than the twenty eight he had lived so far in Spain. This point generated [[Military career of José de San Martín in Spain#Return to South America|controversy]] among historians.&lt;ref name="Galasso583"/&gt;

The historiography outlined by Mitre was first questioned in the 1930s, by historians who sought to update the information about [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. The support of San Martín to Rosas and the bequeathing of his saber was usually concealed or downplayed by the Mitrist historians, those new ones highlighted it. Later historians would point even more informations that contradicted the portrayal by Mitre, such as his good relations with the other ''[[caudillo]]s'' and his personal enmity with Rivadavia, which included a cancelled [[duel]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments and memorials==
[[File:2017 Santiago de Chile - Avenida Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins - Estatua Ecuestre de San Martín.jpg|thumb|Monument of San Martín in [[Santiago de Chile]].]]
When the news of the death of San Martín arrived to [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], the governor [[Justo José de Urquiza]] erected a column in his recognition at the main plaza of [[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 574&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomás Guido]] proposed a statue at the [[Santa Fe Province]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis-Joseph Daumas]] began a monument of San Martín in [[Santiago de Chile]] in 1859, so another one was requested to the sculptor and rushed in [[Buenos Aires]] at the Plaza Marte (modern [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]]). The monument in Chile was inaugurated in 1863, and the one in Buenos Aires in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt;

Two monuments were erected in Peru in the early 20th century, one in front of the [[Real Felipe Fortress]] in 1901 and another in Lima in 1921. A statue was built in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] in 1883. [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] got one in 1901, [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] in 1904, [[Corrientes]] in 1806, and so on. Finally, the ''[[Cerro de la Gloria]]'' in Mendoza was inaugurated on February 12, 1914, an anniversary of the [[Battle of Chacabuco]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthems and marches==
The battle of San Lorenzo, the only battle actually fought by San Martín in the modern territory of Argentina, is the theme of the [[San Lorenzo march]]. The military march was composed in February 1901 by [[Cayetano Alberto Silva]] following a proposal from Representative Celestino Pera. It was first officially played on October 30, 1902 at the inauguration of the monument to General San Martín in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The lyrics were written by professor Carlos Benielli in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/textos/parte2/texto042.php |title=La marcha de San Lorenzo |author=David Marchini and Diego Mayochi |date= |work=El combate de San Lorenzo |publisher=[[San Martín National Institute]] |language=Spanish |trans-title=The battle of San Lorenzo |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083905/http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/textos/parte2/texto042.php |archivedate=July  6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The march became famous in other countries and, according to the [[Argentine British Community Council]], it has been considered in Europe to be one of the five best military marches ever written.&lt;ref name="ABCC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abcc.org.ar/health-issues---our-hospital/la-marcha-de-san-lorenzo|title= La Marcha de San Lorenzo or St. Lawrence’s March|author= Dr. John Emery and Ian Gall|work= |publisher= Argentine British Community Council|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military bands of Uruguay, Brazil and Poland, amongst others, include it in their musical repertory.&lt;ref name="ABCC"/&gt;

Yerga el Ande su cumbre más alta,&lt;br/&gt;
Dé la mar el metal de su voz,&lt;br/&gt;
y entre cielos y nieves eternas&lt;br/&gt;
se alce el trono del Libertador.

Suenen claras trompetas de gloria&lt;br/&gt;
y levanten un himno triunfal,&lt;br/&gt;
que la luz de la historia agiganta&lt;br/&gt;
la figura del Gran Capitán.

De las tierras del Plata a Mendoza,&lt;br/&gt;
de Santiago à la Lima gentil,&lt;br/&gt;
fue sembrando en la ruta laureles&lt;br/&gt;
a su paso triunfal San Martín.

San Martín, el señor en la guerra,&lt;br/&gt;
por secreto designio de Dios,&lt;br/&gt;
grande fue cuando el sol lo alumbraba,&lt;br/&gt;
y más grande en la puesta del Sol.

¡Padre augusto del pueblo argentino,&lt;br/&gt;
héroe magno de la libertad!&lt;br/&gt;
A su sombra la Patria se agranda&lt;br/&gt;
en virtud, en trabajo y en paz.

¡San Martín! ¡San Martín! Que tu nombre,&lt;br/&gt;
honra y prez de los pueblos del Sur,&lt;br/&gt;
asegure por siempre los rumbos&lt;br/&gt;
de la Patria que alumbra tu luz.&lt;br/&gt;

Rise the [[Andes]] its highest peak;&lt;br/&gt;
Give the sea the metal of his voice.&lt;br/&gt;
And between skies and everlasting snows,&lt;br/&gt;
shall arise the throne of the Liberator.

May trumpets of glory sound clearly&lt;br/&gt;
and play a triumphal anthem&lt;br/&gt;
because the light of history aggrandizes&lt;br/&gt;
the figure of the Great Captain.

From the lands of [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] to [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]],&lt;br/&gt;
from [[Santiago]] to genteel [[Lima]],&lt;br/&gt;
he went, planting laurels along the way&lt;br/&gt;
in his triumphal journey, San Martín.

San Martín, the lord of war,&lt;br/&gt;
by secret choice of God,&lt;br/&gt;
was great when the Sun was shining on him,&lt;br/&gt;
and even greater in the sunset.

Great father of the Argentine People,&lt;br/&gt;
Greatest hero of freedom!&lt;br/&gt;
beneath his shadow the fatherland grows&lt;br/&gt;
in virtue, in work, and in peace.

San Martín! San Martín! may your name,&lt;br/&gt;
the honour and glory of the people of the South,&lt;br/&gt;
assure for ever the fates&lt;br/&gt;
of the fatherland enlightened by your light.&lt;br/&gt;

==Portraits==
[[File:San Martín por Castro 2.jpg|thumb|Portrait of San Martín by [[José Gil de Castro]]. It is the first known case when San Martín posed for a portrait.]]
San Martín was born in [[Yapeyú, Corrientes]], in a poor family, and moved to Spain a short time afterwards. For evident reasons, he did not pose for any portrait during his infancy. Neither he did during his [[Military career of José de San Martín in Spain|military career in Spain]], as he lived in the barracks and it was not common to make portraits of young military. He was usually reluctlant to pose for portraits, because of modesty and his frugal military lifestyle. During his stay in Argentina there is a drawing on ivory in his [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers|mounted grenadier]] uniform, of unknown author.&lt;ref name="Sanmartiniano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/textos/parte3/texto097.php |title=San Martín visto por los artistas |trans-title=San Martín saw by artists |language=Spanish |author=Enrique Mario Mayochi |date= |work= |publisher=[[San Martín National Institute]] |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601052823/http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/textos/parte3/texto097.php |archivedate=June  1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known case where San Martín posed for a portrait was the 1818 portrait by [[José Gil de Castro]], made in Chile.&lt;ref name="Sanmartiniano"/&gt; It was painted after the [[battle of Chacabuco]], as part of the celebrations for victory, and it was officially exhibited the following year, during the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]]. Castro's portrait features a notable sharp aquiline nose, but that was part of his particular style, and his other works usually feature similar noses. It is unknown if he posed for other portraits in Peru: the one by the contemporary Mariano Carrillo was signed after San Martín's departure from the Americas, and the one by Drexel was made five years after it.&lt;ref name="Sanmartiniano"/&gt;

When he moved to [[Brussels]], after his retirement, Jean Henri Simon made a medal of him. He posed for a new portrait in an unknown date for the artist Francois Joseph Navez, which is currently kept at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]]. In 1828 the general Miller, who was writing his memoirs, requested San Martín to pose again, in military uniform. The work was done by [[Jean-Baptiste Madou]]. Madou made both a portrait and a testing [[lithography]], which are kept in the aforementioned museum. After it, San Martín swore that he would not pose for further portraits. However, a new technology was developed in France by then, the [[daguerreotype]], preddecesor of modern photography. San Martín's daughter took him with pretexts to the house of the daguerreotypist and, once there, convinced him to pose for it. He posed for two daguerreotypes.&lt;ref name="Sanmartiniano"/&gt;

The first portraits of the [[crossing of the Andes]] featured San Martín mounting a white horse. This was done for visual purposes, to make San Martín prominent among the other soldiers, and the white color has visual impact. This led to the common misconception that San Martín may have crossed the Andes on a white horse, when he actually did so on a mule, which is better suited to move in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
[[File:Alfredo Alcon.JPG|thumb|[[Alfredo Alcón]] as José de San Martín (right) and the director [[Leopoldo Torre Nilsson]] during the filming of "''[[El Santo de la Espada]]''".]]
The first Argentine [[silent movie]]s were created in the 1910s, nearing the [[Argentina Centennial]]. José de San Martín was played by the novice actor Federico López in the movie "''El himno nacional''" ({{lang-es|The national anthem}}), singing the [[Argentine National Anthem]]. It was directed by [[Mario Gallo (director)|Mario Gallo]], who made other films related to San Martín: "''La batalla de San Lorenzo''" ({{lang-es|The battle of San Lorenzo}}), "''La batalla de Maipú''" ({{lang-es|The battle of Maipu}}) and "''Episodios de San Martín''" ({{lang-es|Episodes of San Martín}}). Those last three films are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Bordón, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full [[biographical film]] of San Martín was "''[[Nuestra Tierra de Paz]]''" ({{lang-es|Our land of peace}}), from 1939. It was written by Arturo Mom and the main actor was Pedro Tocci. Except for the scenes at the [[Andes]], it was all filmed at the [[Campo de Mayo]] military base. A new biographical film, "''[[El Santo de la Espada]]''", starred by [[Alfredo Alcón]], was made in 1970. Directed by [[Leopoldo Torre Nilsson]], it kept the technical crew and most of the cast of an earlier movie about the [[Martín Fierro]]. It was one of the most expensive Argentine films to that date. San Martín was used as a secondary character in the films "''[[Güemes: la tierra en armas]]''" (1971) and "''[[Juan Manuel de Rosas (film)|Juan Manuel de Rosas]]''" (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Bordón, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial [[National Reorganization Process]] reduced the popular interest in warfare films. "''[[El General y la fiebre]]''" ({{lang-es|The General and the fever}}) was an attempt in 1993 to make a film about San Martín without warfare. Written by [[Jorge Coscia]] and starred by [[Rubén Stella]], it focused on his brief stay in Córdoba recovering from his diseases, and his [[opium addiction]] as a form of [[History of general anesthesia|anesthesia]]. The 2010 [[Argentina Bicentennial]] renewed the interest in historical films, which led to a new biographical film of San Martín, "''[[Revolución: El cruce de los Andes]]''" ({{lang-es|Revolution: the crossing of the Andes}}), directed by [[Leandro Ipiña]] and starring [[Rodrigo de la Serna]]. San Martín, played by [[Pablo Echarri]], was also a secondary character of the film ''[[Manuel Belgrano (film)|Manuel Belgrano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bordón, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[Bicentennial of Chile]] led to the creation of the miniseries ''[[Héroes (Chilean miniseries)|Héroes]]'', with biopics of national heroes of Chile [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[José Miguel Carrera]] and [[Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza|Manuel Rodríguez]], along others. [[Daniel Muñoz (actor)|Daniel Muñoz]] played San Martín at the three films, ''"O'Higgins, vivir para merecer su nombre"'', ''"Carrera, el príncipe de los caminos"'' and ''"Rodríguez, hijo de la rebeldía"''.

He succeeded [[Simplicius of Zaragoza]] as [[Bishop]] and was influential in the conversion of the Visigothic Kings to [[Catholicism]].
He assisted at the Councils of [[Council of Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 599 and [[Council of Egara|Egara]] in 614, held the [[Councils of Saragossa|Second Council of Zaragoza]], against [[Arianism]], in 592, and signed a decree of Gundemar of 610.

Maximus also contributed to the [[Visigothic]] cultural renaissance of the 6th and 7th [[century|centuries]], which was continued by such scholars as [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Eugenio of Toledo]] and [[Braulio of Zaragoza]].
It has been theorized that he wrote the ''Chronicles of Zaragoza'', a history of that time surviving via a 16th-century [[manuscript]] copy, because Isidore of Seville notes that Maximus had written on history. However, {{harvtxt|Collins|1980}} and {{harvtxt|Johnson|1993}} argue that the ''Chronicles'' were not the work of a single author.

Maximus was succeeded in his see by [[John II (Bishop of Zaragoza)|John]], brother of Braulio of Zaragoza, who was in turn succeeded by Braulio; see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Collins|1995}}.

{{POV check|date=July 2015}}

'''Michael D. Coe''' (born 1929) is an American [[archaeologist]], [[anthropologist]], [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] and [[author]]. Primarily known for his research in the field of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n studies (and in particular, for his work on the [[Maya civilization]], where he is regarded as one of the foremost [[Mayanist]] scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merrin|first=Edward H|title=The Olmec World of Michael Coe|url=http://www.edwardmerrin.com/2011/11/olmec-world-of-michael-coe.html|work=Edward Merrin|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the latter 20th century), Coe has also made extensive investigations across a variety of other [[archaeological site]]s in North and South America. He has also specialised in comparative studies of ancient tropical forest [[civilization]]s, such as those of Central America and [[Southeast Asia]]. He currently (as of 2005) holds the chair of Charles J. MacCurdy Professor of Anthropology, Emeritus, [[Yale University]], and is Curator Emeritus of the Anthropology collection in the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], where he had been Curator from 1968 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum staff (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korean War]], Coe worked as a [[CIA]] case officer; as a part of a front organization, Western Enterprises, in [[Taiwan]]; the CIA's efforts at the time were intended to counter influences and actions of Mao's China in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Michael D. 2006. Final Report: An Archaeologist Excavates His Past. Thames &amp; Hudseon.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has authored a number of popular works for the non-specialist audience, several of which have been best-selling and much reprinted, such as ''The Maya'' (1966) and ''Breaking the Maya Code'' (1992). He also co-authored the book ''Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs'' (1962, sixth edition, 2008) with Rex Koontz.

==Early life and education==
Coe attended [[Fay School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fayschool.org/ftpimages/486/download/2010_Fay%20Magazine%20Spring%202010%20-%20low%20res.pdf|format=PDF|title=FAY MAGAZINE|website=Fayschool.org|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Southborough, Massachusetts]] and St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire. He graduated from Harvard College in 1950 and received his PhD in anthropology from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences in 1959. Shortly after commencing his graduate studies program there, in 1955 he married the daughter of the noted [[evolutionary biologist]] and [[Russia]]n émigré [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], Sophie, who was then an undergraduate anthropology student at [[Radcliffe College]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992), p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie translated from Russian, the work of epigrapher, [[Yuri Knorozov|Yuri Valentinovich Knorosov]], ''The Writing of the Maya Indians'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Stuart and Houston 1989: 15,85; Scarborough 1994: 40&lt;/ref&gt; Knorosov based his studies on [[De Landa alphabet|De Landa's phonetic alphabet]] and is credited with originally breaking the Maya code.

==Career==
His graduate advisor was Gordon Willey.

Coe is considered, by most scholars of Mesoamerica and the Maya,{{who|date=August 2015}} to have done foundational work in three areas: 1) in his Harvard dissertation, at La Victoria, Guatemala, he established the first secure chronology of ceramics for southern Mesoamerica and which has served, almost without revision, to anchor chronologies elsewhere in Mesoamerica and the Maya world{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}; 2) from his work (with Richard Diehl) at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, Veracruz, Mexico and employing the then new technology of magnetometry to locate and salvage most of the Olmec colossal heads now known, he greatly expanded knowledge of the Olmec civilization such that he is considered one of the discoverers of the Olmec{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}; 3) against the very public rebukes of the then reigning doyen of Maya archaeology, [[J. E. S. Thompson]], Coe championed [[Yuri Knorosov]] and the phonetic decipherment of Maya writing, and set about solving what was then the greatest research problem for the Maya, decipherment of Maya writing, along with his own fundamental discoveries, by stimulating and inspiring his Yale University students Peter Mathews and Karl Taube to great breakthroughs; another student, Stephen Houston, became co-author of many of the papers with them and with the greatest epigrapher of the day, David Stuart; Coe also provided insights and guidance to Floyd Lounsbury, noted anthropological linguist at Yale, and to the authors of the acclaimed ''The Blood of Kings'', a work about Classic Maya rulership, Mary Ellen Miller, at Yale, and Linda Schele, at the University of Texas at Austin, the latter who was also a central figure in Maya epigraphy for most of the 1970s and 1980s; Coe’s ''Breaking the Maya Code'' (1992), which was nominated for a National Book Award, relates the story.

Coe was, also, the first to date El Baúl Stela 1 correctly (Coe 1957; cf. Parsons 1986:61); this sculpture from the Southern Maya Area (SMA) is one of three known with Cycle 7 Long Count dated monuments; since then, that it predated all Lowland Long-Count dated sculpture was not questioned. He also, with Kent Flannery, was the first to observe that the greatest southern area site, Kaminaljuyu, probably profited greatly from its proximity to and exploitation of the enormous El Chayal obsidian fields. Coe's own discovery of the Primary Standard Sequence, a sequence of hieroglyphs appearing around the rim of many Classic Maya ceramic vessels, and also of the [[Grolier Codex|fourth Maya codex]] still in existence, in themselves would have secured a place in the history of Maya research. Finally, his many insights, dropped casually to his students or written up in short reports, including that the Popol Vuh was but a fragment of a great lost pan-Maya mythology, and that Classic Maya rulers were shamanic figures as well as administrators, exemplify how he has been the singular leader of research in Mesoamerica and the Maya, and one of a handful of general figures in archaeology as a whole throughout the 1960s and even to today to rank with the founders of the discipline of anthropology. Considering everything, to many other scholars, researchers and students, such are his achievements that they warrant labeling the period from the 1960s almost until today as "the Coe Epoch."

In addition to many seminal publications about Mesoamerica and the Maya, Coe contributed several key papers outside of his own specialized foci, including “The Churches on the Green,” which, during the height of the “New Archaeology,” succinctly pointed out how processualism failed.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Indicative of the wide range and breadth of his intellect, his book on the Angkor civilization of ancient Cambodia, "Angkor and the Khmer Civilization (Ancient Peoples and Places)" (Thames and Hudson) is considered the best single volume on the subject,{{who|date=August 2015}} following up on an early comparative interest.

==Debates==
Coe has added qualified support to the "Cultura Madre" view of the Olmec as the "mother culture of Mesoamerican civilization"; another issue, use of information obtainable from looted Maya ceramics, has brought criticism. Recently, some of Coe's work has come under scrutiny by two scholars of [[Pre-Columbian art]]. His work on, for example, the [[Cascajal Block]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruhns|first1=Karen|last2=Kelker|first2=Nancy|title=Did the Olmec Know How to Write|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/315/5817/1365.2.citation|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=Science Magazine|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[The Wrestler (sculpture)|the Wrestler]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, Nancy L. 2004. The Olmec wrestler: Pre-Columbian art or modern fake?. Minerva 15(5):30-31&lt;/ref&gt; has been called into question. Other scholars dispute these claims and find them inadequately supported by evidence. The Cascajal block in particular is argued to have many features fully consistent with Olmec imagery,&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, David, and F. Kent Reilly III. 2010. The flesh of God, cosmology, food, and the origins of political power in southeastern Mesoamerica" in Pre-Columbian Foodways: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Food, Culture, and Markets in Mesoamerica edited by John E. Staller and Michael D. Carrasco. pp. 635–680. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decipherment.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/dead-bugs-and-olmec-writing/|title=Dead Bugs and Olmec Writing|date=20 April 2010|website=Decipherment.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the same has been said for the Wrestler.&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath, Susan. 1979). Study of Olmec Sculptural Chronology. Studies in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology No. 23. Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, Trustees for Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Michael D. and Mary Miller. 2004. The Olmec wrestler: a masterpiece of the ancient Gulf Coast Minerva 16(1):18-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyphers, Ann, and Artemio Lopez Cisneros. 2008. La historia de "El Luchador," in Olmeca: Balance y perspectivas, edited by Maria Teresa Uriarte and Rebecca B. Gonzalez Lauck. 411-423.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, such criticisms are based on what other scholars consider poorly or undefined notions of Olmec iconography and of rulership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">'''Milan Bulajić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Милан Булајић}}; 6 September 1928 – 29 November 2009) was a [[Serbia]]n historian, expert in [[Holocaust studies]], and [[Yugoslavia]]n diplomat. He was one of the founders of the {{ill|Museum of Genocide Victims, Belgrade|lt=Museum of Genocide Victims|sr|Музеј жртава геноцида}} and Fund for Genocide Research ({{lang|sr|Fond za istraživanje genocida}}) in [[Belgrade]], and {{ill|The International Commission for the Truth on Jasenovac|sr|Међународна комисија за утврђивање истине о Јасеновцу}}.

Bulajić was born in [[Vilusi, Nikšić|Vilusi]] near [[Nikšić]] (now in [[Montenegro]]), the son of an educated worker and grandson of a ''barjaktar'' (flag-bearer) in the [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegrin]] Army and later government deputy. He joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] at the start of [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]]. He finished the Law Faculty in Belgrade in 1951 and received a master's degree at the journalist-diplomat school in 1952, as the best in class. He received the doctoral degree in 1953.

'''Military democracy''' is a term used to describe the war-based society of historical peoples. An example is [[Frederick Engels]]' characterization:

{{cquote|"The military commander, the council, and the popular assembly formed the organs of military democracy, military because war and the organization of war were now the regular functions of life of the people. The wealth of their neighbors excited the greed of the peoples, who began to regard acquisition of wealth as one of the main purposes in life. They were barbarians: plunder appeared to them easier and even more honorable than productive work. War, once waged simply to avenge aggression or as a means of enlarging territory that had become inadequate, was now waged for the sake of plunder alone, and became a regular profession. . . . The growth of slavery had already begun to brand working for a living as slavish and more ignominious than engaging in plunder."&lt;ref name=Helfen-191&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Maenchen-Helfen|title=The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrUdgzSICxcC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01596-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to Engels, the [[Greek Heroic Age]] was a typical example of military democracy.&lt;ref name=Helfen-191/&gt; [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] spoke of two features: "the military state of society, and the system of administration consisting of an elective and removable supreme chief, a council of elders and a popular assembly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7338">[[File:Mitchell Map Liberia colony 1839.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Map of Liberia in the 1830s, where the Mississippi colony and other state-sponsored colonies are identified.]]
'''Mississippi-in-Africa''' was a colony on the [[Pepper Coast]] (West Africa) founded in the 1830s by the '''Mississippi Colonization Society''' of the United States and settled by American [[free people of color]], many of them former slaves. In the late 1840s, some 300 former slaves from [[Prospect Hill Plantation]] and other [[Isaac Ross (planter)|Isaac Ross]] properties in [[Jefferson County, Mississippi]] were the largest single group of emigrants to the new colony. Ross had freed the slaves in his will and provided for his plantation to be sold to pay for their transportation and initial costs.

These [[freedmen]] and other American immigrants to the colony and its neighbors, [[Liberia]] (which annexed Mississippi-in-Africa in 1842) and [[Republic of Maryland]] (which also merged with Liberia, in 1857) developed as the [[Americo-Liberians]], an ethnic group who formed a political and economic elite. They dominated what became the independent country of [[Liberia]] into the late 20th century, having taken power over the indigenous natives. The Mississippi colony was located in what is present-day [[Sinoe County]], Liberia.

==History==
The [[American Colonization Society]] was founded in the United States in 1817 as a joint project by abolitionists and slaveholders to establish a colony for free American blacks in West Africa. Slaveholders wanted to relocate [[free people of color]] out of the South, as they believed that free blacks threatened the stability of their slave societies. Some who supported eventual abolition of slavery believed that transporting freed slaves to Africa would give them a better opportunity to make their own communities. Disheartened by the discrimination faced by free blacks in the North, some abolitionists also supported the ACS, because they thought free blacks might be able to create a better society for themselves in Africa.

Most free blacks did not want to emigrate; they considered the colonization plan to be a means to export them. They believed they had a native-born claim to the United States, were part of the society, and wanted to gain equal rights in their native land. [[Samuel Cornish]] and [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]] published ''Freedom's Journal'' in New York City, writing articles that opposed the colonization movement.

In the 1830s, major planters and slaveholders [[Stephen Duncan]], [[Isaac Ross (planter)|Isaac Ross]] (1760-1838), [[Edward McGehee]] (1786-1880), [[John Ker (planter)|John Ker]] (1789-1850), and educator [[Jemeriah Chamberlain]] (1794-1851), president of [[Oakland College (Lorman, Mississippi)|Oakland College]], co-founded the [[Mississippi Colonization Society]]. Their goal was to relocate (repatriate) [[free negro|free blacks]] and [[manumission|newly freed]] slaves from their state to the developing colony of [[Liberia]] on the African continent.&lt;ref name="marycarolmiller"&gt;Mary Carol Miller, ''Lost Mansions of Mississippi'', Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2010, Volume II, pp. 53-54 [https://books.google.com/books?id=a2niviowphQC&amp;pg=PA53]&lt;/ref&gt; This Society bought a portion of land for the colony, which was known as Mississippi-in-Africa. They believed that free blacks threatened the stability of slave societies, and Mississippi's population had a majority of slaves, outnumbering whites by a three-to-one ratio.&lt;ref name="marycarolmiller"/&gt;

Isaac Ross provided for manumission of his slaves in his will, if they agreed to relocation to West Africa. His plantation was to be sold to provide funds for transportation and for supplies for the pioneer settlers. A grandson contested the will, but it was upheld by Mississippi's High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi|Supreme Court]]). In the late 1840s, approximately 300 African-American freedmen from Ross's [[Prospect Hill Plantation]] emigrated to Mississippi-in-Africa. They were the largest single group of American colonists to migrate to Liberia.

Ross's grandson and heir Isaac Ross Wade contested the will through years of litigation, during which time he occupied the plantation. Wade was supposed to pay the freedmen for their labor. In 1847 the court ruled that the slaves, then technically free, could leave the United States. In 1848 the last group of Ross's freed slaves emigrated to the colony in West Africa. The passage to Africa was arranged by the [[Mississippi Colonization Society]]. It had purchased land on the [[Pepper Coast]] for a colony for freedmen from Mississippi. The late Ross was the first among its founders to have arranged for manumission of his slaves.

The freedmen developed a society in West Africa much like the one they had left but taking the dominant position in relation to indigenous natives. They built houses in the style of Southern mansions and established a hierarchical society with strong continuities to what they had known in the United States. They established plantations and battled local tribes for control of the territory, believing their American culture and Christianity made them superior.&lt;ref name="huffman"&gt;Alan Huffman, ''Mississippi in Africa: The Saga of the Slaves of Prospect Hill Plantation and Their Legacy in Liberia,'' University Press of Mississippi, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement existed independently from 1835 until 1842, when it was incorporated into the [[Commonwealth of Liberia]]. In 1847 Liberia became independent of the American Colonization Society.

Journalist Alan Huffman's history of the settlement explores its influence in contributing to more than a century of resentment between the majority of tribal peoples and the [[Americo-Liberians]], descendants of the colonists who dominated the politics and economy of Liberia well into the 20th century. These groups have been on opposite sides of the civil war in Liberia since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="huffman"/&gt;

In historical [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] society, '''''nīþ''''' ({{lang-non|níð}} {{lang-ang|nīþ, nīð}}; {{lang-odt|nīth}}); was a term for a [[social stigma]] implying the loss of [[honour]] and the status of a villain. A person affected with the stigma is a '''nīðing''' ({{lang-non|níðingr}}/ᚾᛁᚦᛁᚴᛦ, {{lang-ang|nīðing, nīðgæst}}, or {{lang-goh|nidding}}), one lower (''cf.'' modern English ''be&lt;u&gt;neath&lt;/u&gt;'', modern Dutch ''be&lt;u&gt;need&lt;/u&gt;''/''beneden'', modern German ''&lt;u&gt;nied&lt;/u&gt;er''{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} and modern Danish and Swedish ''&lt;u&gt;ned&lt;/u&gt;re'') than those around him.
[[Middle English]] retained a cognate ''nithe'', meaning  "envy" (''cf.'' modern Dutch ''[[wiktionary:nijd|nijd]]'' and modern German ''neid''/''neidvoll''), "hate", or "malice."&lt;ref&gt;The last attestations recorded by the [[OED]] date to the early 15th century. See also the entry [http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/html/oe_bosworthtoller/b0722.html níþ] from Bosworth &amp; Toller (1898/1921). ''An Anglo-Saxon dictionary, based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth'', edited and enlarged by T. Northcote Toller, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

A related term is ''[[ergi]]'', carrying the connotation of "unmanliness".

==Níð, argr, ragr and ergi==
''Ergi'' and ''argr'' (Wendish 'inclosure') or ''ragr'' (Wendish 'entrance') can be regarded as specifying swearwords. ''Ergi'', ''argr'' and ''ragr''   were the severe insults made by calling someone a ''coward'', and due to its severity old Scandinavian laws demanded retribution for this accusation if it had turned out unjustified. The Icelandic [[Gray Goose Laws]]&lt;ref name="graugans"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Heusler|first=Andreas|title=Isländisches Recht - Die Graugrans|year=1937|location=Weimar|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to three words that were regarded as equal to ''argr'' by themselves. Those were ''ragr'', ''strodinn'', and ''sordinn'', all three meaning the passive role of a man included in same-sex activities among males.&lt;ref&gt;Seebold, Elmar (Ed.): Art. arg, in: Kluge. Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache, 24. Auflage, Berlin, New York 2002, S. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Another semantic belonging to ''argr'', ''ragr'' and ''ergi'' was, from the ''Gray Goose'', "being a sorcerer's friend."

Examples from Old Scandinavian Laws: The ''Gulathing'' law&lt;ref name="gulathing3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meißner|first=Rudolf|title=Norwegisches Recht - Das Rechtsbuch des Gulathings|year=1935|location=Weimar|language=German|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to "being a male [[Bottom (sex)|bottom]]," "being a slave," "being a seiðmaðr," the ''Bergen/Island''&lt;ref name="birkinsel1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meißner|first=Rudolf|title=Stadtrecht des Königs Magnus Hakonarson für Bergen - Bruchstücke des Birkinselrechts und Seefahrerrechts der Jónsbók|year=1950|location=Weimar|language=German|pages=65, 105, 347, 349, 437}}&lt;/ref&gt; law referred to "being a [[Seiðr|seiðmaðr]]," "being a sorcerer and/or desiring same-sex activities as a [passive] male (''kallar ragann'')," the ''Frostothing'' law&lt;ref name="frostothing1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meißner|first=Rudolf|title=Norwegisches Recht - Das Rechtsbuch des Frostothings|year=1939|location=Weimar|language=German|page=193ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "desiring male same-sex activities as a bottom."
Thus, it is apparent that ''ergi'' of a ''níðingr'' was strongly connoted not only with sorcery, unmanliness, weakness, and [[effeminacy]] but also especially with lecherousness or sexual perversion in the view of Old Scandinavian people during the Early and High Middle Ages. ''Ergi'' of females was considered as excessive lecherousness bordering raging madness, ''ergi'' of males as perversity, effeminacy and the passive role within [[same-sex intercourse between men]], while an active role of a man, who had been included into same-sex intercourse, was not to be tanged by ''ergi'', ''ragr'', ''argr'' or ''níð''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Karras Mazo: Sexualität im Mittelalter. Aus dem Amerikanischen von Wolfgang Hartung, Düsseldorf 2006, pp. 275-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scolding and níðstang==
{{Further|Niðing Pole}}
''Níðing''s had to be ''scolded'', i. e. they had to be shouted in their faces what they were in most derogatory terms, as ''scolding'' (Anglo-Saxon ''scald'', Norse ''[[skald]]'', Icelandic ''skalda'', OHG ''scelta'', Modern German ''Schelte''; compare ''scoff'', Modern Dutch ''schelden'',  Anglo-Saxon ''[[scop]]'', and [[flyting]]) was supposed to break the concealing ''seiðr'' spell and would thus force the fiend to give away its true nature.&lt;ref name="vries1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jan de Vries|title=Die Religion der Nordgermanen|journal=Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte|year=1957|volume=2|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The actual meaning of the adjective ''argr'' or ''ragr'' [Anglo-Saxon ''earg''] was the nature or appearance of effeminacy, especially by obscene acts. ''Argr'' was the worst, most derogatory swearword of all known to the Norse language. According to Icelandic law, the accused was expected to kill the accuser at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gering|first=Hugo|editor=B. Sijmons|title=Kommentar zu den Liedern der Edda|year=1927|location=Halle|language=German|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If the accused did not retort by violent attack, either right on the spot or by demanding ''[[holmgang]]'', yielding either the challenging accuser to take his words back or the accuser's death, he was hence proven to be a weak and cowardly ''níðingr'' by not retorting accordingly.&lt;ref name="heusler"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Heusler|first=Andreas|title=Das Strafrecht der Isländersagas|year=1911|location=Leipzig|language=German|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside by words, ''scolding'' could also be performed by pejorative visual portrayals, especially by so-called ''níðstang''s or ''nīþing poles''. These were usually single poles with a carved man's head, on which a horse or a horse's head was impaled. In two attested instances (''Bjarnar saga Hítdælakappa'' ch. 17, ''Gísla saga Súrssonar''), two ''níðstang''s were arranged so as to suggest homosexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="thule2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sammlung Thule (Band 9)|year=1964|language=German|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "classical definition of ''ergi'' is found in the ''scoldings'' (see section below) of opposing warriors Gudmund and Sinfyötli in the ''New Helgi song'', offending each other as ''earg'' and thus challenging each other before a fight. Gudmund perjorates Sinfyötli in verse 36:

:'''Verse 36'''
:''Prince you cannot
:''talk about me
:''like that,
:''scolding a
:''noble man.
:''For you ate
:''a wolf's treat,
:''shedding your brother's
:''blood, often
:''you sucked on wounds
:''with an icy maw,
:''creeping to
:''dead bodies,
:''being hated by all.

and in following verses 37-39 Sinfyötli rebuts this:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-break}}
'''Verse 37'''&lt;br&gt;
''Walkury, an abhorrent&lt;br&gt;
''monster have you been&lt;br&gt;
''frightening, and ''earg'',&lt;br&gt;
''by Odin!&lt;br&gt;
''The [[Einherjar]]s&lt;br&gt;
''fought in desire&lt;br&gt;
''about you&lt;br&gt;
''stubborn whore.
{{Col-break}}
'''Verse 38'''&lt;br&gt;
''Hag on Warinsey island&lt;br&gt;
''that was you&lt;br&gt;
''so insidiously&lt;br&gt;
''conjuring illusions.&lt;br&gt;
''You said that&lt;br&gt;
''the only warrior&lt;br&gt;
''you desired to marry&lt;br&gt;
''was I, Sinfyötli.&lt;br&gt;
{{Col-break}}
'''Verse 39'''&lt;br&gt;
''On saganes&lt;br&gt;
''you gave birth&lt;br&gt;
''to nine wolves&lt;br&gt;
''fathered by&lt;br&gt;
''Sinfyötli.
{{col-end}}

In accordance with these more detailed descriptions of what constituted ''ergi'' as appearing in the ''New Helgi song'', the ''Gulathing'' law&lt;ref name="gulathing3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meißner|first=Rudolf|title=Norwegisches Recht - Das Rechtsbuch des Gulathings|year=1935|location=Weimar|language=German|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to ''eacans'' swearwords further describing ''earg'' as "being a mare," "being a pregnant animal," "being a bitch," "having indecent intercourse with animals," the ''Bergen/Island'' law&lt;ref name="birkinsel2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meißner|first=Rudolf|title=Stadtrecht des Königs Magnus Hakonarson für Bergen - Bruchstücke des Birkinselrechts und Seefahrerrechts der Jónsbók|year=1950|location=Weimar |language=German |pages=89, 345, 397}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to "biting another man," "being a pregnant animal," the ''Frostothing'' law&lt;ref name="frostothing1" /&gt; to "being a female animal," the ''Uplandslag'' law to "having sexual intercourse with an animal."&lt;ref name="uplandslag"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schwerin|first=Claudius v.|title=Schwedische Rechte - Älteres Westgötalag, Uplandslag |year=1935 |location=Weimar |language=German |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's worth to note that such activities where as being a "a pregnant animal" and having intercourse with animals are activities which are attributed to the god [[Loki]] in ''[[Lokasenna]]'' and ''[[Gylfaginning]]''.

==Nīþ  and criminality==
{{Further|Early Germanic law}}
The ''seiðr'' used prominently by ''níðing''s was linguistically closely linked to botany and poisoning.&lt;ref name="schrader1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schrader|first=Otto|title=Reallexikon der Indogermanischen Altertumskunde (Band 2) |year=1928 |location=Berlin |language=German|page=697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philippson1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Philippson |first=Ernst Alfred |title=Germanisches Heidentum bei den Angelsachsen|year=1929|location=Leipzig|language=German |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''seiðr'' to a degree might have been regarded as identical to murder by poisoning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This Norse concept of poisoning based on magic was equally present in Roman law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] equality in Germanic and Roman law about equalling poisoning and magic was not created by influence of Roman laws upon Germanic people, even though an identical conception was indeed manifest in Roman law. This apparent likeness is probably based upon the shared original primitive conceptions about religion due to a shared Indo-European origin of both people.&lt;ref name="vordemfelde1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vordemfelde|first=Hans|title=Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten|year=1923|location=Gießen|language=German|chapter=Die germanische Religion in den deutschen Volksrechten|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Níðing'' poisoning ties in with the legal Germanic differentiation of  ''murder'' and ''killing''. Criminal murder differed from legitimate killing as by being performed in secret insidiously, away from the eyes of the community that had not been involved in the matter.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sorcery [in Norse antiquity] equalled mysteriously utilizing evil forces, just as mysterious and abhorrent a crime as sexual deviancy. As for theft and murder, even more recent common Old Scandinavian belief still regarded them to be so closely associated to magical practices as to be entirely impossible without these latter. Those that were capable of breaking open heavy locks at night without being noticed by watchdogs nor waking up people had to be in command of supernatural abilities. Equally weird were those that were capable of murdering innocent lives. They were aided, guided, or coerced by an evil force to do their evil deeds.&lt;ref name="klein1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since sorcery "was not accepted officially, it could not serve the kinship as a whole, only private cravings; no decent person was safe from the secret arts of sorcerers,"&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lehmann|first=Alfred|title=Aberglaube und Zauberei|year=1925|location=Stuttgart|language=German|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as nīþ was insidiousness, a níðing was also thought to be a pathological liar and an oathbreaker, prone to committing perjury and especially treason. Summing up the relations between ''nīþ'' and criminality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Severe misdeeds were perjury deeds, especially if they had been committed insidiously and in secret. Such perpetrators were ''nithing''s, despicable beings. Their perjury deeds included: Murder, theft, nightly arson, as well as any deeds that harmed the kinship's legally protected rights (treason, deserting to the enemy, deserting from the army, resisting to fight in a war, and perversion).&lt;ref name="conrad1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Conrad|first=Hermann|title=Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte (Band 1): Frühzeit und Mittelalter|year=1962|location=Karlsruhe|language=German|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Furthermore these deeds included] any crimes offending the deities, such as breaking a special peace treaty (for example ''[[Thing (assembly)|thing]]'' peace, armistice, security of the ceremony places and buildings, or a special festivity peace), trespass, defilement of graves, sorcery, finally all perjury deeds indicating moral degeneration, such as oathbreaking, perversion, acts of nasty cowardness&lt;ref name="schroeder1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schröder|first=Richard|author2=Eberhard v. Künßberg |title=Lehrbuch der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte|edition=7|year=1932|location=Berlin/Leipzig|language=German|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [i. e. any acts] of moral degeneration.&lt;ref name="schwerin1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schwerin|first=Claudius v.|title=Grundzüge der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte|year=1950|location=Berlin and Munich|language=German|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This excessive mass of ''níðing'' associations might at first seem cumbersome and without any recognizable pattern. However the pattern behind it is outlined in the following sections.

The immediate consequence of being proven a ''níðing'' was outlawing the exile. (see for example&lt;ref name="his1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=His|first=Rudolf|title=Das Strafrecht der Friesen im Mittelalter|year=1901|location=Leipzig|language=German|page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YectAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The outlawed did not have any rights, he was ''exlex'' (Latin for "outside of the legal system"), in Anglo-Saxon ''utlah'', Middle Low German ''uutlagh'', Old Norse ''utlagr''. Just as feud yielded enmity among kinships, outlawry yielded enmity of all humanity.&lt;ref name="brunner1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brunner|first=Heinrich|title=Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte (Band 1)|year=1961|location=Berlin|language=German|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Nobody is allowed to protect, house, or feed the outlaw. He must seek shelter alone in the woods just like a wolf."&lt;ref name="schwerin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=His|first=Rudolf|title=Das Strafrecht der Friesen im Mittelalter|year=1901|location=Leipzig|language=German|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yet that is but one aspect of outlawry.

Ancient dehumanizing terms meaning both "wolf" and "strangler" were common as synonyms for outlaws: OHG ''warc'', Salian ''wargus'', Anglo-Saxon ''wearg'', Old Norse ''vargr''.&lt;ref name="brunner2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brunner|first=Heinrich|title=Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte (Band 1)|year=1961|location=Berlin|language=German|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Not any measure to this end was considered too awkward."&lt;ref name="groenbech3" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It could be better to fixate the haunting evil's body by placing large rocks on it, impaling it [..]. Often enough, people saw their efforts had been in vain, so they mounted destruction upon destruction on the individual fiend, maybe starting by beheading, then entirely burning up its body, and finally leaving its ashes in streaming water, hoping to absolutely annihilate the evil, incorporeal spirit itself.&lt;ref name="groenbech4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grönbech|first=Wilhelm|title=Kultur und Religion der Germanen (Band 1)|year=1954|location=Darmstadt|language=German|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nīþ and witchcraft==
{{Further|Seiðr}}

It was believed that the reason for a ''nīþing'' to resort to insidious ''[[seiðr]]'' "witchery" in order to cause harm instead of simply attacking people by decent, belligerent violence to achieve the same end was that it was a cowardly and weak creature, further indicating its  being direct opposite of Old Norse warrior ethos.&lt;ref name="hermann"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hermann|first=Paul|title=Das altgermanische Priesterwesen|year=1929|location=Jena|language=German|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="helm1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Helm|first=Karl|title=Die Entwicklung der germanischen Religion|year=1926|location=Heidelberg|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Earg'' is often but translated as "cowardly, weak". By definition, any ''seiðberender'' (practitioner of ''seiðr'') was immediately rendered ''argr'' by these very despicable magic practices.&lt;ref name="weisweiler1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Josef Weisweiler|title=Beiträge zur Bedeutungsentwicklung germanischer Wörter für sittliche Begriffe|journal=Indogermanische Forschungen|year=1923|volume=41|pages=16, 19, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nīþ did not only motivate practicing ''seiðr''&lt;ref&gt;''Seid'' (Old Norse [http://web.ff.cuni.cz/cgi-bin/uaa_slovnik/gmc_search_v3?cmd=formquery2&amp;query=SEI%26ETH;R&amp;startrow=1 ''seiðr'']) on the ''Germanic Lexicon Project''&lt;/ref&gt; but was regarded the most likely motivation of all for practicing ''seid''.&lt;ref name="schoeck1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schoeck|first=Helmut|title=Der Neid - Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft|year=1966|location=Freiburg and Munich|language=German|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nīþing used its malicious ''seiðr'' magic to destroy anything owned and made by man, ultimately the human race and ''[[Midgard]]'' itself.&lt;ref name="groenbech1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grönbech|first=Wilhelm|title=Kultur und Religion der Germanen (Band 1)|year=1954|location=Darmstadt|language=German|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since primitive societies exclusively attributed their fear of evil sorcerers [i.e., ''seiðmaðr''] to the sorcerer's motivating envy, all Indo-Germanic proverbs on the matter indicate that passive envy easily turns into aggressive crimes. He who envies is not satisfied to passively wait for his neighbours to run into accidents by coincidence to secretly gloat over them (while his gloating habits are widely accepted as a fact), he makes sure that they will live in misery or worse. […] Envy brings death, envy seeks evil ways.&lt;ref name="schoeck1" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hence, the nīþing was regarded as a mythological fiend "that only exists to cause harm and bring certain undoing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fries|first=Jan de|title=Die geistige Welt der Germanen|year=1964|location=Darmstadt|language=German|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harboring a nīþ was regarded as destroying the "individual qualities that constituted man and genetical relation,"&lt;ref name="groenbech2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grönbech|first=Wilhelm|title=Kultur und Religion der Germanen (Band 1)|year=1954|location=Darmstadt|language=German|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; making deviant, perverse, and ill instead so that this fiend was considered the direct opposite of decent man and its [nīþ] as contagious.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Nīþings] were aided, guided, or coerced by an evil force to do their evil deeds. Hence, a ''nithing'' was not only degenerated in a general [moral] sense [...] it had originally been a human being of evil, fiendish nature that had either sought evil deliberately or had been taken into possession by evil forces unwillingly.&lt;ref name="klein1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ernst Klein|title=Der Ritus des Tötens bei den nordischen Völkern|journal=Archiv für Religionswissenschaft|year=1930|volume=28|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Association with physical disability==
''Nithings'' were thought to be suffering of physical ailments and were associated with crippledness. Most notably were limping as an outer indication of being a ''nithing'' (such as in the story of Rögnvald Straightleg whose last name was in fact but an ironic offence as his legs were actually crippled&lt;ref name="thule1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sammlung Thule (Band 14)|year=1965|language=German|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the belief that sorcerers would not only give birth to animals but also to crippled human children.&lt;ref name=hentig1&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hentig|first=Hans v.|title=Die Strafe - Frühformen und gesellschaftliche Zusammenhänge|year=1954|location=Berlin, Göttingen, and Heidelberg|language=German|pages=316, 318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[...]'' a ''nithing'' was not only degenerated in a general ''[moral]'' sense ''[...]'' This ''[moral]'' degeneration was often innate, especially apparent by physical ailments.''&lt;ref name="klein1" /&gt;

These physical afflictions were regarded as furthermore supporting weakness of a ''nithing''. It was often hard to distinguish these attributes from actual physical illness, and since "any eeriness and incomprehensibility was what made people suspect a person of being a ''nithing'', whether this was based upon physical anomalies or mental traits", they were often regarded as ''mentally ill'' even during ancient times already, as defined by actually or perceivedly deviant social behaviour and feeling.&lt;ref name="mass1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=E. Maaß|title=Eunuchos und Verwandtes|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|year=1925|volume=74|pages=432ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sm 5, Transjö.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Runestone [[England runestones#Sm 5|Sm 5]] uses the opposite of ''niðingr'', or ''oniðingr'', to describe a man who died in England.]]

==Association with effeminacy==
''Nithings'' sometimes practiced ''seid'' in female clothes regardless of their biological sex, and they were considered to lose their physical biological sex by that act if they had been male before.&lt;ref name="stroem1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ström|first=Folke|title=Loki - Ein mythologisches Problem|year=1956|location=Göteborg|language=German|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent dialect forms of ''seid'' linguistically link it to "female sex organs."&lt;ref name="stroembaeck1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strömbäck |first=Dag |title=Seyd - Textstudier i Nordisk Religionshistorika |journal=Nordiska Texter och Undersökningar |year=1935 |volume=5 |language=Swedish |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there exists (or existed) evidence on the [[Golden horns of Gallehus]] that male initiates of ''seid'' were ritually castrated.&lt;ref name="danckert"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Danckert |first=Werner |title=Unehrliche Leute - Die verfemten Berufe |year=1936 |location=Bern and Munich |language=German|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According ''eacans'' in the ''Gulathing'' law&lt;ref name="gulathing3"/&gt; were "having born children as a male," "being a male whore," while the ''Gray Goose''&lt;ref name="graugans" /&gt; referred to "being a woman each ninth night," and "having born children as a male."

==Runestones==
Although no runic inscription uses the terms ''níð'' or ''níðingr'', several [[Viking Age]] runestones use the term ''oníðingr'', which with the ''o-'' prefix means the opposite of ''níðingr'', to describe a man as being virtuous. [[Rundata]] translates this term as "unvillainous." This term is used as a descriptive term on [[runestones]] [[Östergötland Runic Inscription 77|Ög 77]] in Hovgården, Sö 189 in Åkerby, [[England runestones#Sm 5|Sm 5]] in Transjö, Sm 37 in Rörbro, Sm 147 in Vasta Ed, and DR 68 in Århus,&lt;ref name="Rundata"&gt;[http://www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk] - [[Rundata]].&lt;/ref&gt; and appears as a name or part of a name on inscriptions Ög 217 in Oppeby, [[Aringsås Runestones#Sm 2|Sm 2]] in Aringsås, and Sm 131 in Hjortholmen.&lt;ref name="Zilmer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zilmer |first=Kristel |url=http://www.fl.ut.ee/orb.aw/class=file/action=preview/id=110134/zilmer.pdf |title="He Drowned in Holmr's Sea": Baltic Traffic in Early Nordic Sources |year=diss. 2005 |publisher=Tartu University Press |ISBN=9949-11-090-4 |page=178 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720131505/http://www.fl.ut.ee/orb.aw/class%3Dfile/action%3Dpreview/id%3D110134/zilmer.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[Alliterative verse|alliterative]] Old Norse phrase, ''manna mæstr oniðing&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;'', which is translated as "the most unvillainous of men," appears on Ög 77, Sm 5, and Sm 37,&lt;ref name="Zilmer"/&gt; and DR 68 uses a variant of this phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Naumann |first=Hans-Peter |authorlink= |editor-last=Hoops |editor-first=Johannes |editor2-last=Beck |editor2-first=Heinrich |contribution=Hann var manna mestr oniðingr: Zer Poetizität Metrischer Runeninschriften |title=Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1994 |location=Berlin |pages=490–502 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8kiWfP7e7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=3-11-012978-7}} pp. 499-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture (OI)''' is the oldest organization in the United States exclusively dedicated to advancing the study, research, and publication of scholarship bearing on the history and culture of early America, broadly construed, from circa 1450 to 1820. Their scope of inquiry includes North America and related histories of the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, and Africa. Since 1943 the Institute has published the ''[[William and Mary Quarterly]]'' and books, and sponsored conferences and fellowships.

The [[College of William &amp; Mary]] and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation founded the Institute of Early American History and Culture in 1943. The College continues to jointly sponsor its work. In 1996, the name Omohundro was added to the Institute’s name in recognition of a generous gift from the late Mr. and Mrs. Malvern H. Omohundro, Jr.

== Publications ==

=== Books ===
The Institute publishes a select number of books each year on topics pertaining to the histories and cultures of North America from circa 1450 to 1820, including related developments in the British Isles, Europe, West Africa, and the Caribbean. Since the first book appeared in [http://oieahc.wm.edu/books/book.cfm?Action=All print in 1947], the OI has published 233 titles, which have won a total of [http://oieahc.wm.edu/books/prize.cfm 174 awards].

The Institute partners with the [[University of North Carolina Press]] in publishing its titles, and UNC Press also distributes the OI's books.

=== ''William and Mary Quarterly'' ===
The ''[[William and Mary Quarterly]]'' is an academic journal with a focus on early American history and culture. It ranges chronologically from Old World-New World contacts to about 1820. Geographically, it focuses on North America from [[New France]] and the [[Spanish-American borderlands]] to [[British America]] and the [[British West Indies|Caribbean]] and extends to Europe and West Africa. Although grounded in history, it welcomes works from all disciplines (for example, literature, law, political science, anthropology, archaeology, material culture, cultural studies) bearing on the early American period. Currently in its Third Series, the ''Quarterly'' is published in January, April, July, and October. The journal originated in 1892, making it one of the oldest scholarly journals in the United States.

=== Digital publications ===
In addition to a regular blog (''Uncommon Sense),'' the OI maintains both an online feed of blogs about early American scholarship and (''Early America Online'' aka "''The Octo"),'' an up-to-date listing of conferences and events of interest to the Early Americanist community (''The Map)'' and a current listing of fellowships and grants available for research in the field (''The List).''

The OI also publishes the ''OI Reader'', which features a digital edition of the ''William and Mary Quarterly'' as well as additional digital projects.

== Fellowships ==
[[Image:Omohundro Institute sign.jpg|thumb]]
All OI fellowship applicants are evaluated by outside committees of scholars who volunteer their time and expertise. The following scholarships are offered:

* Omohundro Institute-NEH Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
* Lemon Project Postdoctoral Fellowship
* Scholars' Workshop
* Georgian Papers Programme Fellowship
* Jamestown Rediscovery-Omohundro Institute Short-term Fellowship
* OI-Folger Institute Short-term Fellowship
* Lapidus-OIEAHC Fellowship	

== Events ==
Most OI events are open to the public; costs to the participant vary.

=== Annual conferences ===
The OI offers an annual conference in June each year. The location varies each year in order to accommodate a wide range of scholars. Panels and papers are chosen by an external committee. The committee typically represents a large variety of institutions and disciplines and is formed by members from the host institution. Graduate students, junior, mid-career and senior scholars are all invited to submit proposals via a Call for Papers; all levels of career achievement are likewise represented on the final program.

=== Topical conferences ===
The OI also typically offers one topically-themed conference each year, usually in the fall. The location varies. An organizing theme or topic is proposed by a group of scholars who then form a program committee and issue a Call for Papers. The number of papers and panels offered is typically smaller than at the annual conference, likewise the overall number of participants.

=== THis Camp ===
THis Camp (or That History Camp) sessions are now offered at every OI conference. The goal of the sessions is to teach participants one software of particular use to historians at a Beginner's level.

Max Edelson, University of Virginia, taught the first THis Camp in October 2015 at the "Emerging Histories of the Early Modern French Atlantic" (topical) conference. By the end of the session, participants were able to use the popular [http://mapscholar.org/ Map Scholar] software to annotate maps and begin their own digital atlases.

=== ''WMQ''-EMSI workshops ===
Each May, the ''William and Mary Quarterly'' in conjunction with the [https://dornsife.usc.edu/emsi Early Modern Studies Institute] at the University of Southern California conducts a workshop designed to identify and encourage new trends in our understanding of the history and culture of early North America. The participants are primarily mature scholars working on second or subsequent book projects; they share their work in progress with the aim of deepening and enriching their perspectives, their approaches, and ultimately the final products of their research.

=== Colloquia ===
The OI’s colloquium meets four or five times a semester to discuss projects (usually a book chapter) in progress. The Institute offers overnight accommodations and up to $300 for travel for those chosen to present their work.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
On March 14, 1897 (lunar calendar February 12), he was born in Guanzhuang Village, [[Ninghai County]], [[Zhejiang Province]]. His birth name was Pan Tianjin (天谨) and [[courtesy name]] Tianshou (天授).

In 1903, his mother died. In summer, he was enrolled in private school in the village. Beside taking classes, he liked calligraphy, and also enjoyed imitating illustrations on novels such as the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and the ''[[Water Margin]]''.

In Spring 1910, he entered Zhengxue Primary School in town, and received western school education. After class, he was interested in calligraphy, painting and stamp carving. He brought "Jieziyuan Painting Album" (芥子园画谱) and several albums of models of calligraphy. Those were enlightening materials for him to self-study Chinese painting and calligraphy, and he thus was determined to devote his whole life to Chinese painting.

In Autumn 1915, he was enrolled into Zhejiang First Normal School in [[Hangzhou]] with excellent grades.

In 1918, he was on 4th grade at school, and drew "Loquats" (枇杷图) for fellow students.

In 1919, he drew "Chinese Bulbul on Wisteria" (紫藤白头翁) and other paintings for fellow students. In that year, he participated in "May 4th" patriotic students gathering in Hangzhou. Around 1919 to 1920, he met [[Liu Haisu]] for first time in Jingjia Hill, Hangzhou.

In Spring 1920, he participated in advanced students uprising at Zhejiang First Normal School.  In leisure time, he dedicatedly studies painting, calligraphy, poems and stamp carving. He drew "Desolate Crow in Sparse Forest" (疏林寒鸦) and "Forlorn Bell Rings among Mountains at Night"(晚山疏钟) for Zhao Pingfu ([[Rou Shi]]).

In 1921, he habitually imitated ancient folk calligraphy and paintings, and studies painting theory. He drew "Bright Moon above Wisteria" (紫藤明月), "Mynah in Snow" (雪景八哥) etc.

===Career===
In Summer, he graduated and went back to Ninghai to teach at Zhengxue Primary School. In Spring 1922, he moved to teach at the primary school in Xiaofeng County (now [[Anji County]]), Zhejiang. Together with Shen Suizhen (沈遂贞), he held an exhibition in Yizi Pavilion, Xiaofeng County. There were finger-ink painting among his works. He drew "Lonely Crow on Aged Tree" (古木寒鸦), "Pristine Water in Breeze" (长风白水), "Jigong Monk and Elephant" (济公与象), "Bald Monk" (秃头僧), etc.

In Spring 1923, he became a teacher at Republic of China female workers school in Shanghai. In that Summer, he was also appointed as a lecturer in painting practice and theory classes in department of Chinese painting at Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. He got to know [[Wu Changshuo]], [[Wang Yiting]], [[Huang Binhong]], [[Wu Fuzhi]], and [[Zhu Qizhan]]. His style approached Wu Changshuo, evolving from unrestrained to profound. He drew "Flowers Wet with Dew in Autumn" (秋华湿露). He changed his name to "Tianshou" (天寿).

In 1924, he became a professor at Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, started writing the book "The History of Chinese Painting". He was actively engaged in a variety of exhibitions, studying preserved ancient paintings and meeting with noted painters. He specialized in liberal-style flowers and birds painting, and also excelled in landscape painting. He drew "The Beggar" (行乞图), "Horse Fastened on Poplar" (垂杨系马), and "Fox Servant at New Year Eve" (狸奴守岁).

In January 1925, he completed "History of Chinese Painting" in Shanghai, and wrote preface of the book in Hangzhou in February. On June 20, he co-sponsored an advertisement on "Sheng Newspaper" with [[Liu Haisu]], Zhu Wenyun and other professors, and held a charity sale exhibition for workers and citizens deceased in May 30 Riot. He drew "Mountains at Dawn" (晴峦晓色), "Soothing Spring Breeze" (春风淡荡), "Aged Plum Blossoms" (古梅), etc.

In July 1926, his "History of Chinese Painting" was published by Commercial Press. In Winter, together with Yu Jifan and Pan Booying, he co-founded Shanghai Xinhua School of Fine Arts.

In Spring 1927, Xinhua School enrolled first-year class, and Pan became the chief professor in Education Department.

Pan was appointed director of the National Academy ([[Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts]]) by the Kuomintang Minister of Culture [[Chen Lifu]] in 1945. Two years later, he lost his appointment to Wang Rizhang, who was more acceptable to the Guomindang. Despite this professional disappointment, Pan took up his painting with renewed energy, making breakthrough works that fused modern and traditional idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Julia F.|last2=Shen|first2=Kuiyi|title=The Art of Modern China|date=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520271068|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the era of [[People's Republic]], he was again appointed the head of the academy in 1957 which lasted until 1966.

===Political persecution and death===
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Pan was taken by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] on 6 September 1966, and paraded the next day on the streets of Hangzhou with more than thirty of his colleagues in dunce caps to be publicly humiliated.  For five years, he was regularly taken to public rallies to be criticized and renounced.  He was also falsely accused of being a [[Kuomintang]] spy, after which the persecution became more intense and he was paraded in the other towns as well.  He died in a hospital in Hangzhou on 5 September 1971.&lt;ref name="turmoil"/&gt;

'''Paul Bairoch''' (24 July 1930 in [[Antwerp]] – 12 February 1999 in [[Geneva]]) was one of the great post-war [[economic history|economic historians]] who specialised in global economic history, urban history and historical demography. He published or co-authored more than two dozen books and 120 scholarly articles.

His son is a Swiss bioinformatician [[Amos Bairoch]].

==Academic career==

Bairoch gained a bachelor's degree by correspondence, intending to become an engineer but he turned to studying economic history in 1956 at the parisian [[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]]. He obtained his doctorate in 1963 at the [[Free University of Brussels]] where he worked from 1965 to 1995. He was economic adviser to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) at Geneva from 1967 to 1969, professor at the [[Sir George Williams University]] (Concordia) in [[Montréal]] from 1969 to 1971 and on recommendation of [[Fernand Braudel]] became director of studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes from 1971 to 1972. In 1972 he was made professor of history at the [[University of Geneva]].  He retired in 1995. He was also visiting professor at [[Harvard]] and at the [[Collège de France]] (1983) and [[Doctor honoris causa]] at the [[ETH Zurich]]. From 1985, Bairoch directed a number of research projects on the world economy at a Centre for International Economic History in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblio.unizh.ch/F/M3SNJSSQ956IA41FTAVGK4UU8F8HN1UD143PS53I4SPRL4P7R2-01078?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=005681&amp;set_entry=000015&amp;format=999]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Paul Bairoch sought through quantitative, empirical research of historical trends to question and challenge many beliefs which are nowadays generally accepted in [[economics]] (see in particular his work ''Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes''), among which: the idea that [[free trade]] historically led to periods of economic growth; that moving away from free trade caused the [[Great Depression]]; and that [[colonialism|colonial]] powers in the 19th and early 20th centuries became rich by exploiting the [[Third World]].

Bairoch argued that such beliefs are based on insufficient knowledge and misguided interpretations of the economic history of the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and the [[Third World]]. He researched extensively the reasons why an [[Rostovian take-off model|industrial takeoff]] was prevented in the colonised countries of the Third World (see e.g. his book ''Révolution industrielle et sous-développement''). He is particularly known for his detailed empirical research on economic problems of Third World countries, on the [[industrial revolution]] and its aftermath and on urban history. His historical estimates of [[Gross Domestic Product|Gross Product]] measures are still being referred to in the literature, although some are also challenged by other economic historians such as [[Angus Maddison]].

Bairoch argues that [[free trade]] contributed to [[deindustrialization]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In contrast to the [[protectionism]] of China, Japan, and [[Spain]], the Ottoman Empire had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal trade]] policy, open to foreign imports. This has origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673 and 1740, which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but later criticized by British politicians such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There has been free trade in Turkey, and what has it produced? It has destroyed some of the finest manufactures of the world. As late as 1812 these manufactures existed; but they have been destroyed. That was the consequences of competition in Turkey, and its effects have been as pernicious as the effects of the contrary principle in Spain.}}

==Quotes==

{{Quotation|"L'occident n'a pas besoin du tiers monde, ce qui est une mauvaise nouvelle pour le tiers monde." ("The West doesn't need the third world, which is bad news for the third world.") - Paul Bairoch, ''Le tiers monde dans l'impasse'' (1992)}}

{{Quotation|"L'occident n'avait pas besoin du tiers monde, ce qui est une bonne nouvelle pour le tiers monde." ("The West didn't need the third world, which is good news for the third world.") - Paul Bairoch, ''Mythes et paradoxes de l'histoire économique''}}

Paul Bairoch referred here to colonialism and to the exploitation of the third world in the 19th and early 20th century. He argued that this exploitation was not indispensable for industrialisation. This he thought is "good news" for the third world because it means that development could occur without exploitation of other regions.

{{Quotation|"S’il me fallait résumer ce que l’essence de l’histoire économique peut apporter à la science économique, je dirais qu’il n’existe pas de « lois » ou règles en économie qui soient valables pour toutes les périodes de l’histoire ou pour chacun des systèmes économiques." ("If I had to summarise the essence of what economic history can contribute to economic science, I would say that there exist no "laws" or rules in economics which are valid for all periods of history or for every economic system") - Paul Bairoch, ''Mythes et paradoxes de l'histoire économique'' (1993)}}

'''Philippa Jayne Langley''', [[MBE]] (born  29 June 1962) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] screenwriter and historian who is best known for her contribution to the [[exhumation and reburial of Richard III|exhumation of Richard III]] in 2012. 

==Richard III Society==
Langley is the President of the Scottish branch of the [[Ricardian (Richard III)|Richard III Society]].&lt;ref name="Richard III Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardiii.net/leicester_dig_team.php|title=Philippa Langley|publisher=[[Richard III Society]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attributes the discovery to a feeling she had when first visiting the northern end of the Social Services car park where the king was later found, having gone to [[Leicester]] for the purpose of finding out more about the historical figure for a screenplay she was writing; other members of the Richard III Society had suggested the three central car parks location as long ago as 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Grey Friars, Leicester |journal=The Ricardian |last=Strange |first=Audrey |date=September 1975 |volume=3| number=no. 50 |pages=3–7 |publisher=Richard III Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an oversight in footnoting gave no evidence for it. According to Langley, "the first time I stood in that car park, the strangest feeling just washed over me. I thought: 'I am standing on Richard's grave'."&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/05/king-richard-iii-found|title='It's like Richard III wanted to be found'|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=5 February 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proceeded to fundraise, organise and commission the excavation of the site, leading to the eventual discovery of Richard III's remains.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-02-04/meet-philippa-langley-the-woman-who-discovered-richard-iii-in-a-car-park|title=Meet Philippa Langley: the woman who discovered Richard III in a car park|last=Dickson|first=E.

She is co-author, with Michael K. Jones, of ''The King's Grave: The Search for Richard III'' (US title: "The King`s Grave: The Discovery of Richard III’s Lost Burial Place and the Clues It Holds"). In 2013 Langley was working on the screenplay for a proposed film on the life of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], in which she hoped Richard would be portrayed by English actor [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]], who was himself named after the king.&lt;ref name="Nutt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/hobbit-actor-lines-up-role-as-richard-iii.20080483|title=Hobbit actor lines up role as Richard III|last=Nutt|first=Kathleen|date=2 February 2013|work=[[Herald Scotland]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 Langley objected to a plan to stage Shakespeare's play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at [[Leicester Cathedral]], on the basis that it was contrary to the undertaking by the [[Dean of Leicester]], made in March 2015, that the king would be reburied in the Cathedral "with all dignity and honour". The play was staged in sold-out performances at the cathedral on 19 and 20 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/historian-leicester-cathedral-needs-urgently-175797|title=Why Cathedral 'needs rethink over staging Richard III play'|first=Dan|last=Bird|date=7 July 2017|publisher=leicestermercury.co.uk|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/richard-iii-comes-leicester-cathedral-gripping-results-review/|title=Richard III comes to Leicester Cathedral, with gripping results - review|author=Dominic Cavendish|website=The Telegraph|date=20 July 2017|access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other projects==
In 2014, Langley detailed the years of research behind the Looking For Richard Project that got her to the northern end of the car park in Leicester in search of the church and grave in Finding Richard III: The Official Account of Research by the Retrieval &amp; Reburial Project.  The co-authored work includes chapters from Looking For Richard Project members, Dr. [[John Ashdown-Hill]] and Drs David and Wendy Johnson and is edited by Annette Carson.

In March 2015, she backed a project to locate the remains of [[Henry I of England]], who was buried at [[Reading Abbey]] which later fell into ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A search for bones of Henry I is planned in Reading|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-32037999|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Langley was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 2015 for "services to the exhumation and identification of Richard III".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Queen-s-Birthday-Honours-List-honours-Richard-III/story-26686602-detail/story.html#ixzz3cuAOI5Of ''Leicester Mercury''].

'''Samuel Taylor''' (1748/49 – 1811&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;) was the British inventor of a widely used system of [[stenography]].

He began working on his own method of stenography in 1773, based on earlier efforts. In 1786, he published ''An essay intended to establish à standard for an universal system of Stenography, or Short-hand writing'', the first shorthand system to be used all over the English-speaking world. His stenographic method consisted in cutting out the superfluous consonants as well as the vowels in polysyllabic words. It used an alphabet composed of 19 letters of simplified shapes.

He taught stenography at [[Oxford]] as well as the universities of Scotland and Ireland for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

His system was adopted for several other languages, including French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;Melin, 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was translated and published in France by [[Théodore-Pierre Bertin]] in 1792 under the title ''Système universel et complet de Stenographie ou Manière abrégée d'écrire applicable à tous les idiomes''.

He also published a book on [[angling]] in 1800, titled ''Angling in All Its Branches''.

'''Shangjing Longquanfu''' ({{zh|t=上京龍泉府}}) or '''Sanggyeong Yongcheonbu''' ({{Korean|hangul=상경용천부}}), also known as '''Shangjing'''/'''Sanggyeong''' (上京, 상경), '''Huhan/Holhan Fortress''' (忽汗城, 홀한성), is an archaeological site in [[Ning'an]], [[Heilongjiang]], China.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; It was the capital of the [[Balhae]] (Bohai) Kingdom in 756–785 and 793–926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ko icon}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=86961 "Sanggyeong Yongcheonbu", ''Naver encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is located in about {{convert|3|km}} from the modern town of Dongjingcheng (东京城), and the ruined city is also colloquially called "Dongjingcheng". The site has been protected since the 1960s. The Chinese government has established the '''Bohai Shangjing National Archaeological Park''' and an archaeological museum at the site.&lt;ref name=ia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaogu.cn/cn/kaoguyuandi/kaogubaike/2014/0425/45962.html |title=渤海上京考古遗址公园（第二批国家考古遗址公园） |trans-title=Bohai Shangjing National Archaeological Park |publisher=[[Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] |date=25 April 2014 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimension==
Shangjing was modelled after [[Chang'an]], capital of the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]. It was about one fifth of the size of Chang'an, measuring {{convert|4.68|km}} from east to west, and {{convert|3.47|km}} from north to south. It was composed of the outer city, the inner city, and the palace city which enclosed five palaces. It is one of the best preserved medieval capital cities in the world.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt;

==History==
Balhae was founded at the Dongmo Mountain by [[Dae Jo-yeong]]. However, Balhae set up five capitals to rule its territories, and also transferred the main seat of the government several times because stabilizing and strengthening central rule over various ethnic tribes in its realm, which was expanded temporarily. In 756, during the reign of [[Mun of Balhae|King Mun]], Shangjing Longquanfu was established as the permanent capital near [[Lake Jingpo]], south of today's [[Ning'an]], [[Heilongjiang]], China.

[[Silla]] (57 BC – 935 CE) was one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. In the early years, Silla was ruled by the [[Park (Korean name)|Pak]], [[Seok (Korean name)|Seok]], and [[Kim (Korean name)|Kim]] families. Rulers of Silla had various titles, including ''Isageum, Maripgan, and Daewang''. Like some Baekje kings, some declared themselves emperor.

'''The Hague''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|ɡ}}; {{lang-nl|Den Haag}}, {{IPA-nl|dɛn ˈɦaːx|pron|Nl-Den Haag.ogg}}, short for ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s-&amp;#8288;Gravenhage'' {{IPA-nl|ˌsxraːvə(n)ˈɦaːɣə||Nl-'s-Gravenhage.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] on the western coast of the [[Netherlands]] and the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[South Holland]]. It is also the [[seat of government]] of the Netherlands.

With a metropolitan population of more than 1 million, it is the third-largest city in the Netherlands, after [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]]. The [[Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area]], with a population of approximately 2.7 million, is the [[List of urban areas in the European Union|13th-largest in the European Union]] and the most populous in the country. Located in the west of the Netherlands, The Hague is in the centre of the [[Haaglanden]] [[conurbation]] and lies at the southwest corner of the larger [[Randstad]] conurbation.

The Hague is the seat of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Cabinet]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]], and the [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Council of State]] of the Netherlands, but the city is not the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|constitutional]] [[capital of the Netherlands]], which is [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daum|first=Andreas|title=Berlin - Washington, 1800–2000 Capital Cities, Cultural Representation, and National Identities|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521841178|pages=13, 38|quote=Amsterdam is the statuary capital of the Netherlands, while the Dutch government resides in De Hague.

The Hague is also home to the world headquarters of [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and other  Dutch companies.

Most foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] in the Netherlands and 150 international organisations are located in the city, including the [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[International Criminal Court]], which makes The Hague one of the major cities hosting a [[United Nations]] institution along with [[New York City]], [[Geneva]], [[Vienna]], [[Rome]] and [[Nairobi]]. Due to these reasons, The Hague is largely known as the home of international law and arbitration.

==Etymology==
The Hague was first mentioned as ''Die Haghe'' in 1242.&lt;ref name="ZH"/&gt; In the 15th century, the name ''des Graven hage'' came into use, literally "The Count's Wood", with connotations like "The Count's Hedge, Private Enclosure or Hunting Grounds". "Gravenhage" was officially used for the city from the 17th century onward. Today, this name is only used in some official documents like birth and marriage certificates. The city itself uses "Den Haag" in all its communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1199/ |title='s-Gravenhage / Den Haag |publisher=Taaladvies.net |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of The Hague}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:Joust on the Hofvijver, by Dutch School of the 17th century.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Binnenhof]] at the [[Hofvijver]], 1625]]
[[File:Beest Street in The Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Street in The Hague'' by Sybrand van Beest, c. 1650, [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

Little is known about the origin of The Hague. There are no contemporary documents describing it, and later sources are often of dubious reliability. What is certain is that The Hague was founded by the last counts of the House of Holland. [[Floris IV, Count of Holland|Floris IV]] already owned two residences in the area, but presumably purchased a third court situated by the present-day [[Hofvijver]] in 1229, previously owned by a woman called Meilendis. Presumably, Floris IV intended to rebuild the court into a large castle, but he died in a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] in 1234, before anything was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04a_florisiv.htm |title=De geschiedenis van den Haag: graaf Floris IV |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son and successor [[William II of Holland|William II]] lived in the court, and after he was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1248, he promptly returned to The Hague, and had builders turn the court into a "royal palace" (''regale palacium''), which would later be called the [[Binnenhof]] ("Inner Court"). He died in 1256 before this palace was completed but parts of it were finished during the reign of his son [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]], of which the [[Ridderzaal]] ("Knights' Hall"), still intact, is the most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04b_willemii.htm |title=Den Haag en graaf Willem II |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04d_bouw_binnenhof.htm |title=Het Binnenhof: ontstaat |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used for political events, such as the annual [[speech from the throne]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[monarch]]. From the 13th century onward, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their administrative center and residence when in Holland.

The village that originated around the Binnenhof was first mentioned as ''Die Haghe'' in a charter dating from 1242. It became the primary residence of the Counts of Holland in 1358, and thus became the seat of many government institutions. This status allowed the village to grow; by the Late Middle Ages, it had grown to the size of a city, although it did not receive city rights.&lt;ref name=ZH&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://geschiedenisvanzuidholland.nl/locatie/geschiedenis-van-den-haag |title=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |website=Geschiedenis van Zuid-Holland |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, the village was located in the ''ambacht'', or rural district, of [[Monster, South Holland|Monster]], which was governed by the Lord of Monster. Seeking to exercise more direct control over the village, however, the Count split the village off and created a separate ''ambacht'' called Haagambacht, governed directly by the Counts of Holland. The territory of Haagambacht was considerably expanded during the reign of Floris V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04e_die_haghe.htm |title=Het dorp Die Haghe: het ontstaan |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[House of Burgundy]] inherited the counties of Holland and Zeeland in 1432, they appointed a [[stadtholder]] to rule in their stead with the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]] as an advisory council. Although their seat was located in The Hague, the city became subordinate to more important centres of government such as [[Brussels]] and [[Mechelen]], from where the sovereigns ruled over the increasingly centralised [[Burgundian Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=ZH/&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Eighty Years' War]], the absence of city walls proved disastrous, as it allowed [[Spain|Spanish]] troops to easily occupy the town. In 1575, the States of Holland, temporarily based in [[Delft]], even considered demolishing the city but this proposal was abandoned, after mediation by [[William the Silent]]. In 1588, The Hague became the permanent seat of the States of Holland as well as the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.merkdenhaag.nl/de-allerkortste-geschiedenis-van-den-haag |title=De allerkortste geschiedenis van Den Haag |website=Merkboek Den Haag |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for the administration to maintain control over city matters, The Hague never received official city status, although it did have many of the privileges normally granted only to cities. In modern administrative law, "city rights" have no place anymore.

=== Modern history ===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
[[File:Den Haag - Stadhuis 1900.jpg|thumb|The [[Old City Hall (The Hague)|Old City Hall]] of The Hague around 1900]]
Only in 1806, when the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was a puppet state of the [[First French Empire]], was the settlement granted city rights by [[Louis Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/news-and-events/press-room/to/A-short-history-of-The-Hague.htm |title=A short history of The Hague |date=28 November 2011 |website=Denhaag.nl |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], modern-day [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] were combined in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] to form a buffer against [[France]]. As a compromise, [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]] alternated as capital every two years, with the government remaining in The Hague. After the separation of Belgium in 1830, Amsterdam remained the capital of the Netherlands, while the government was situated in The Hague. When the government started to play a more prominent role in Dutch society after 1850, The Hague quickly expanded. Many streets were specifically built for the large number of civil servants employed in the country's government and for the Dutchmen who were retiring from the administration of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The growing city annexed the rural municipality of [[Loosduinen]] partly in 1903 and completely in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra |title=Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten |publisher= KNAW |year=2006 |url= http://www.knaw.nl/cfdata/publicaties/detail.cfm?boeken__ordernr=20061061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city sustained heavy damage during [[World War II]]. Many Jews were killed during the German occupation. Additionally, the [[Atlantic Wall]] was built through the city, causing a large quarter to be torn down by the Nazi occupants. On 3 March 1945, the [[Royal Air Force]] mistakenly [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|bombed]] the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter. The target was an installation of [[V-2 rocket]]s in the nearby [[Haagse Bos]] park, but because of navigational errors, the bombs fell on a heavily populated and historic part of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.nl/dossiers/geschiedenis/bombardement-op-bezuidenhout|title=Bombardement op Bezuidenhout maart 1945|trans-title=Bombing of the Bezuidenhout March 1945|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]|accessdate=5 December 2013|language=nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215125838/http://www.kb.nl/dossiers/geschiedenis/bombardement-op-bezuidenhout|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in the area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=FcOXUtmIFYfwhQeC-4CgAQ&amp;id=_vQfUQxCjtMC&amp;dq=The+Low+Countries%3A+Arts+and+Society+in+Flanders+and+the+Netherlands%2C+a+Yearbook&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=razed |title=The Low Countries: arts and society in Flanders and the Netherlands, a yearbook |volume=9 |author=Stichting Ons Erfdeel |year=1998 |publisher=Flemish-Netherlands Foundation |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused 511 fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010462560%3Ampeg21%3Ap008%3Aa0146 Bombardement Bezuidenhout 3 maart '45 Voor velen stortte in luttele minuten de wereld in elkaar], Amigoe di Curacao, 4 March 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, The Hague became at one time the largest building site in Europe. The city expanded massively to the south-west, and the destroyed areas were quickly rebuilt. The population peaked at 600,000 inhabitants around 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, mostly white middle-class families moved to neighbouring towns like [[Voorburg]], [[Leidschendam]], [[Rijswijk]] and, most of all, [[Zoetermeer]]. This led to the traditional pattern of an impoverished inner city and more prosperous suburbs. Attempts to include parts of these municipalities in the city of The Hague were highly controversial. In the 1990s, with the consent of the Dutch Parliament, The Hague annexed fairly large areas from neighbouring towns as well as from not even bordering ones, on which the complete new residential areas were built and are still being built.

The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the [[North Sea]] in the Netherlands and forms the centre of a [[conurbation]] called [[Haaglanden]]. [[Westland (municipality), Netherlands|Westland]] and [[Wateringen]] lie to the south, [[Rijswijk]], [[Delft]] and the [[Rotterdam]] conurbation (called ''Stadsregio Rotterdam'' or ''[[Rijnmond]]'') to the southeast, [[Pijnacker-Nootdorp]] and [[Zoetermeer]] to the east, [[Leidschendam-Voorburg]], [[Voorschoten]] and the [[Leiden]] conurbation to the northeast and [[Wassenaar]] to the north.

The conurbations around The Hague and Rotterdam are close enough to be a single conurbation in some contexts. For example, they share the [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport]] and a light rail system called [[RandstadRail]]. Consideration is being given to creating a Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan area. This large conurbation centred on The Hague and Rotterdam is, in turn, part of the [[Randstad]]—specifically a band of municipalities called the South Wing ([[Zuidvleugel]]). The Randstad, which also includes among others [[Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], has a population of 6,659,300. The Hague lies at the southwestern corner of one of the largest urban areas in Europe.

The Hague is divided into eight official districts which are, in turn, divided into neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/stadsdelen-en-wijken/to/Stadsdelen-9.htm|title=Stadsdelen|date=18 October 2010|publisher=Denhaag.nl|language=Dutch|accessdate=31 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144925/http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/stadsdelen-en-wijken/to/Stadsdelen-9.htm|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most prosperous and some of the poorest neighbourhoods of the Netherlands can be found in The Hague. The wealthier areas like [[Statenkwartier]], [[Belgisch Park]], [[Marlot]], [[Benoordenhout]] and [[The Hague Center#Archipelbuurt|Archipelbuurt]] are generally located in the northwestern part of the city, closer to the sea, whereas the southeastern neighbourhoods like [[The Hague Center#Transvaal|Transvaal]], [[Moerwijk]], and the [[Schilderswijk]] are significantly poorer, with the exception of the [[Vinex-location]]s of [[Leidschenveen-Ypenburg]] and [[Wateringse Veld]]. This division is reflected in the local accent: The more affluent citizens are usually called "Hagenaars" and speak so-called ''bekakt Haags'' ("posh"), this contrasts with the ''Hagenezen'', who speak ''plat Haags'' ("vulgar"); see [[#Demographics|Demographics]] below.

The districts are:
* '''[[The Hague Center|Centrum]]''' (99,283 inhabitants) forms the heart of The Hague. The [[Binnenhof]], the [[Noordeinde Palace]], the [[Mauritshuis]] museum, the [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]], the [[Grote of Sint-Jacobskerk (The Hague)|Grote Kerk]], the [[Old City Hall (The Hague)|Old City Hall]] and the current [[The Hague City Hall|City Hall]] are located here. Architecture varies from medieval up to 20th century.
* '''[[Escamp]]''' (118,483 inhabitants) is the most populous district of The Hague, built largely after the [[World War II]] as part of The Hague's large expansion to the south east. One railway station can be found here: [[Den Haag Moerwijk railway station|Den Haag Moerwijk]]. The district is divided into six neighbourhoods.
* '''[[Haagse Hout]]''' (42,000 inhabitants) is a wealthy district in the northeast of the city and the location of the [[Haagse Bos]], a large forest. The King of the Netherlands lives in the royal palace [[Huis ten Bosch]], located in this forest. The district also includes the financial centre of the city, the [[Beatrixkwartier]].
* '''[[Laak, The Hague|Laak]]''' (40,222 inhabitants) is the smallest district of the city, southeast of its centre, for the most part, built in the 20th and 21st century. The area used to be part of [[Rijswijk]], until the municipality of The Hague bought the land in 1844. The [[Den Haag Hollands Spoor railway station|Hollands Spoor]] railway station and [[The Hague University]] are located here, as well as the site of the planned [[mixed-use development]] [[Nieuw Binckhorst]].
* '''[[Leidschenveen-Ypenburg]]''' (47,088 inhabitants) is an early 21st-century [[Vinex-location]] located south east of the city, geographically connected to the main body of the city [[Flagpole annexation|only by a narrow corridor]]. The district is divided into Leidschenveen and Ypenburg, which were part of [[Leidschendam]], [[Nootdorp]] and [[Rijswijk]] before the areas were annexed by The Hague in 2002. This area was the site of [[Ypenburg Airport]] which was a military airport during the World War II.
* '''[[Loosduinen]]''' (45,485 inhabitants) is the westernmost district of The Hague. It was a village unto itself until 1923, when it was annexed by The Hague. The less popular of the city's two seaside resorts, [[Kijkduin]] is located here. The district is divided into four neighbourhoods.
* '''[[Scheveningen]]''' (53,425 inhabitants) is the wealthy northernmost district of The Hague. A modern beach resort, Scheveningen is a popular tourist destination. It has a long sandy beach and its own esplanade, pier and lighthouse, but also a [[Pathé]] cinema, a musical theatre and a casino. The district also includes a fishing harbour. Notable buildings include the [[Kurhaus of Scheveningen|Kurhaus]] and farther inland, the [[Peace Palace]].
* '''[[Segbroek]]''' (60,054 inhabitants) is a district located between Scheveningen and Loosduinen. The population has decreased until around 2005, but since then has begun to grow again, driven by students and east European immigrants. It became a district of The Hague in 1988 and is divided into five neighbourhoods.

=== Climate ===
The Hague experiences a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen:]] ''Cfb'') similar to almost all of the [[Netherlands]]. Because of its location on the coast, it experiences milder winters and cooler summers than more inland locations. It also gets more sunshine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

City life concentrates around the [[Hofvijver]] and the [[Binnenhof]], where the States General of the Netherlands are located. Because of its history, the historical inner city of The Hague differs in various aspects from the nearby smaller cities of [[Leiden]] and [[Delft]]. It does not have a cramped inner city, bordered by canals and walls. Instead, it has some small streets in the town centre that may be dated from the late [[Middle Ages]] and several spacious streets boasting large and luxurious 18th-century residences built for diplomats and affluent Dutch families. It has a large church dating from the 15th century, an impressive [[Old City Hall (The Hague)|City Hall]] (built as such) from the 16th century, several large 17th-century palaces, a 17th-century [[Protestant]] church built in what was then a modern style, and many important 18th-century buildings.

[[File:Hofvijver29042007.jpg|thumb|The [[Hofvijver]] and the buildings housing the [[States General of the Netherlands]]]]
[[File:The Hague Hoftoren.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Hoftoren]] (left) and the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]] (right)]]
The city is becoming more student friendly with the introduction of a new campus in 2012 of [[Leiden University]] as well as [[Leiden University College The Hague]], which was established in 2010. The [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]] and the [[Royal Academy of Art (The Hague)|Royal Academy of Art]] are also located there, as well as [[The Hague University]], a [[vocational university]] and a branch of The Open University of the Netherlands. The city has many [[civil servant]]s and [[diplomat]]s{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. In fact, the number and variety of foreign residents (especially the [[expatriate]]s) make the city quite culturally diverse, with many foreign [[pub]]s, shops and cultural events.

The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the [[North Sea]] and includes two distinct [[beach resort]]s. The main beach resort [[Scheveningen]], in the northwestern part of the city is a popular destination for tourists as well as for inhabitants. With 10 million visitors a year, it is the most popular beach town in the [[Benelux]] area. [[Kijkduin]], in the south west, is The Hague's other beach resort. It is significantly smaller and attracts mainly local residents.

The former Dutch colony of the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]], now [[Indonesia]], has left its mark on The Hague. Since the 19th century, high level civil servants from the Dutch East Indies often spent long term leave and vacation in The Hague. Many streets are named after places in the Netherlands East Indies (as well as other former Dutch colonies such as Suriname) and there is a sizable "[[Indo people|Indo]]" (i.e. mixed Dutch-Indonesian) community. Since the loss of these Dutch possessions in December 1949, "[[Indo people]]" also known as "Indische people" often refer to The Hague as "the Widow of the Indies".&lt;ref&gt;Dutch: 'de Weduwe van Indie'. As per song text by the famous singer [[Wieteke van Dort]], see text of the song "Arm Den Haag" ("Pity The Hague"): [http://www.muzikum.eu/nl/123-1151-22012/wieteke_van_dort/arm_den_haag-songtekst.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The older parts of the town have many characteristically wide and long streets. Houses are generally low-rise (often not more than three floors). A large part of the south western city was planned by the progressive Dutch architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|H.P. Berlage]] about 1910. This 'Plan Berlage' decided the spacious and homely streets for several decades. In World War II, a large amount of the western portion of The Hague was destroyed by the Germans. Afterwards, modernist architect [[Willem Marinus Dudok|W.M. Dudok]] planned its renewal, putting apartment blocks for the middle class in open park-like settings.

The layout of the city is more spacious than other Dutch cities and because of the incorporation of large and old nobility estates, the creation of various parks and the use of green zones around natural streams, it is a much more green city than any other in the Netherlands. That is, excepting some medieval close-knitted streets in the centre. The Hague has a canal system around the old city center, which is mainly used for boat tours around the city. Most of the canals were drained in the late 19th century but many have been restored recently.

The tallest buildings of The Hague are both 146-metre-tall ministries of [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Justice and Security]] and the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Interior and Kingdom Relations]] of the [[Netherlands]], designed by [[Hans Kollhoff]]. Other significant skyscrapers include the [[Hoftoren]], [[Het Strijkijzer]] and [[De Kroon (The Hague)|De Kroon]].

As of 1 January 2014, The Hague counts 509,779 inhabitants, making it the third largest city of the Netherlands. Between 1800 and 1960, the city saw a considerable growth from 40,000 in 1800 to 200,000 in 1900 and eventually 600,000 in 1960. The growth following 1900 was partially caused by the housing act of 1901, which stimulated the expansion of cities such as The Hague. In the period between 1960 and 1980, The Hague saw a shrinkage from 600,000 to 440,000 inhabitants, caused mostly by the spatial policy, demographic processes and lack of space. After several annexations and housing construction, The Hague has since grown again, celebrating its 500,000th inhabitant in 2011. The municipality expects the growth to continue to 513,000 inhabitants in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Bevolkingsprognose-Den-Haag-20122020-1.htm |title = Bevolkingsprognose Den Haag 2012-2020 |date = 10 April 2012 |website = DenHaag.nl |accessdate = 25 November 2013 |language = nl |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225108/http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Bevolkingsprognose-Den-Haag-20122020-1.htm |archive-date = 2 December 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonym of The Hague officially is ''Hagenaar'',{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} but the term ''Hagenees'' is informally used for someone who was born and raised in The Hague. The usage of these demonyms appears to be class-bound, with Hagenaar being the upper-class term and Hagenees being the lower-class one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stam |first1=Niek |title=Kaakstand maakt verschil tussen Hagenaar en Hagenees |url=https://www.rd.nl/vandaag/binnenland/kaakstand-maakt-verschil-tussen-hagenaar-en-hagenees-1.358927 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=Reformatorisch Dagblad |date=17 December 2013 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jaspers |first1=Klaartje |title=Den Haag: uitvergrote versie van Keeping Up Appearances? |url=https://www.haacs.nl/identiteit-den-haag-keeping-up-appearances/ |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=HAACS |date=30 March 2016 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic make-up===
The proportion of Dutch people is 48%, while that of Western [[immigrants]] is 15.6%, and that of non-western immigrants is 34.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.denhaag.buurtmonitor.nl/ Den Haag in Cijfers].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Just under half of The Hague's population identifies with a religious group. The two most popular religions are [[Christianity]] (29%) and Islam (14.1%). Indonesian, Turks, Moroccans and Surinamese people are particularly likely to adhere to a religion. Islam is the most common religion among Turks and, particularly, among Moroccans. Surinamese people are more religiously mixed, although Hinduism is the most common. Of The Hague's native Dutch population, almost all religious people belong to Christianity. Just under 40% of the population of The Hague regularly attends a house of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Burgerschapsmonitor-2009.htm |title = Burgerschapsmonitor (2009) |date = 28 September 2009 |website = DenHaag.nl |accessdate = 25 November 2013 |language = nl |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222237/http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Burgerschapsmonitor-2009.htm |archive-date = 2 December 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ministry of Justice, Affairs and Security in Den Haag.jpg|thumb||200px|Ministry of Justice, Affairs and Security]]
The Hague is home to many different international judicial bodies, such as the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), and the Appeals Chamber of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR). The Hague is the fourth major centre for the [[United Nations]], after New York, Geneva and Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1132183/2009/03/11/Beveiliging-is-routine-voor-Haagse-autoriteiten.dhtml|title=Beveiliging is routine voor Haagse autoriteiten|last=Slager|first=Seije|date=11 March 2009 |publisher=Trouw|language=Dutch|accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of The Hague as an [[Hague Justice Portal|"international city of peace and justice"]] started at the end of the 19th century, when the first global [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Conference of peace]] took place in The Hague on [[Tobias Asser]]'s initiative, with then a second one a few years later. A direct result of these meetings was the establishment of the world's first organisation for the settlement of international disputes: the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA). Shortly thereafter the Scottish-American millionaire [[Andrew Carnegie]] made the necessary funds available to build the [[Peace Palace]] to house the PCA. After the establishment of the [[League of Nations]], The Hague became the seat of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], which was replaced by the UN's [[International Court of Justice]] after [[World War II]]. The establishments of the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] (1981), the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (1993) and the [[International Criminal Court]] (2002) in the city further consolidated its role as a centre for international legal arbitration. Most recently, on 1 March 2009, the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], a U.N. tribunal to investigate and prosecute suspects in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, opened in the former headquarters of the Netherlands General Intelligence Agency in [[Leidschendam]], a town within the greater area of The Hague.

Other major international and European organisations based in The Hague include:
* [[Eurojust]], European Union body composed of national prosecutors
* [[European Patent Office]]
* [[Europol]], European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation
* [[The Hague Academy of International Law]], centre for high-level education in both public and private international law
* [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], (HCCH), the oldest and preeminent private international law harmonisation institution
* [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]
* [[NATO Communications and Information Agency]], (NCI Agency)
* [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]], (OPCW)
* [[European Library|The European Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/index.html |title=TheEuropeanLibrary.org |publisher=TheEuropeanLibrary.org |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Europeana]], the EU digital platform for cultural heritage

Many academic institutions in the fields of international relations, international law and international development are based in The Hague. The [[Hague Academic Coalition]] (HAC) is a consortium of those institutions.

Its member institutions are:
* [[Carnegie Foundation (Netherlands)|Carnegie Foundation]]
* [[Hague Institute for the Internationalisation of Law]] (HiiL)
* [[International Institute of Social Studies]] (ISS) of [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]
* [[Leiden University College The Hague]]
* [[Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael|Netherlands Institute of International Relations 'Clingendael']]
* [[The Hague Academy of International Law]]
* [[The Hague University of Applied Sciences]]
* [[T.M.C. Asser Instituut]]

In 1948 the [[Congress of Europe]] was held with 750 delegates from 26 European countries, providing them with the opportunity to discuss ideas about the development of the [[European Union]].

== Economy ==
[[File:RandstadRail Den Haag netkous.jpg|thumb|The Hague's central financial district, [[Beatrixkwartier]], with the modern tram viaduct called the ''{{lang|nl|Netkous}}'' ("[[Fishnet stocking]]")]]
The Hague has a [[Service economy|service-oriented]] economy. Professional life in the city is dominated by the large number of civil servants and diplomats working in the city; {{As of|2006|lc=y}}, 26% of the jobs in The Hague are those offered by the Dutch government or the international institutions. Large employers in this sector include the ministries of [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Defence]], [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Justice]], [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Foreign Affairs]], the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Interior]] and [[Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management (Netherlands)|Transport, Public Works and Water Management]].

Several large international businesses have their headquarters in The Hague, including [[Royal Dutch Shell]], the world's fifth largest company in terms of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.fortune.com/global500/royal-dutch-shell-5 |title=Fortune 500 2016 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant companies headquartered in The Hague include [[Aegon N.V.|Aegon]], [[APM Terminals]], [[Damco]], [[KPN]], [[Nationale Nederlanden]], [[NIBC Bank]], [[Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company]] and [[PostNL]]. The city is also host to the regional headquarters of [[Siemens]], [[T-Mobile]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Huawei]], [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation]], [[Saudi Aramco]] and [[Total S.A.]].  There has never been any large-scale industrial activity in The Hague, with the possible exception of the fishing activities of the harbour in [[Scheveningen]]. Many of the city's logistical and minor-industrial services are located in the Binckhorst in the Laak district, which contains many sizeable warehouses.

Tourism is an important sector in The Hague. The city is the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] second biggest tourist destination, after [[Amsterdam]]. In 2012, the city welcomed 1.2 million tourists (an increase of 80,000 compared to the previous year), half of whom came from abroad. The number of hotel nights in The Hague increased by 5%; in particular, visitors from neighbouring countries are finding their way to The Hague. Compared to 2011 Belgians booked 27% more hotel nights, while the Germans were good for 24% more hotel nights, and the French booked 20% more hotel nights. The 14% average increase in visits by foreign tourists more than compensated for the slight decrease of less than 1% by Dutch visitors. Tourists spend an average of €2 billion a year in the local economy. Today 1 in 10 residents make their living from the tourism sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/More-tourists-visiting-The-Hague.htm More tourists visiting The Hague] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191319/http://denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/More-tourists-visiting-The-Hague.htm |date=29 October 2013 }}.

The Hague originated around the 13th century [[Binnenhof]], and this is still considered the cultural centre of the city. Night life centres around the three main squares in the city centre. The ''[[Het Plein|Plein]]'' (literally "Square") is taken by several large sidewalk cafés where often politicians may be spotted. The ''Grote Markt'' (literally "Great Market") is completely strewn with chairs and tables, summer or winter. The [[Buitenhof (The Hague)|Buitenhof]] (literally "Outer Court", located just outside the [[Binnenhof]]) contains a six screen [[Pathé]] cinema and a handful of bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Adjacent to the Buitenhof is [[De Passage]], the country's first covered shopping mall. Dating from the late 19th century, it contains many expensive and speciality shops. One of the country's largest music venues, [[Paard van Troje]], can be found in the centre of The Hague. Another popular music venue in The Hague is Muziekcafé de Paap.

The Spuiplein is a modern fourth square in the city centre, opposite the [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]]. Besides the [[The Hague City Hall|City Hall]], this was also the location of the [[Dr. Anton Philipszaal]], home to the [[Residentie Orchestra]], and the [[Lucent Danstheater]], home to the internationally celebrated modern dance company [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. These buildings, designed by [[Rem Koolhaas]] in 1988, have been demolished to make space for a new theatre, the [[Spuiforum]], which would house both institutes as well as the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague|Royal Conservatory]]. Despite efforts of the municipality, public support for the proposed theatre remains low. At the heart of the city centre across the palace gardens is the home of [[Summerschool Den Haag]], international school for dance with guest teachers such as [[Valentina Scaglia]], [[Igone de Jongh]], and [[Maia Makhateli]]. The [[Koninklijke Schouwburg]], home to the Nationaal Toneel, can also be found in the city centre - on the Korte Voorhout. [[New European Ensemble]] is an ensemble for [[contemporary music]] consisting on international musicians. The ensemble has its main base in the city.

[[Scheveningen]] forms a second cultural centre of The Hague, having its own [[Pathé]] cinema as well as the musical theatre [[Circustheater]] although, especially in the summer, most night life concentrates around the sea-front boulevard with its bars, restaurants and gambling halls. Several other attractions can be found in Scheveningen, such as the [[miniature park]] [[Madurodam]], the [[Beelden aan Zee]] museum, and a [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Centre]].

The Hague is the residence of the Dutch monarch, and several (former) royal palaces can be found in the city. King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]] and Queen [[Máxima of the Netherlands]] live in [[Huis ten Bosch]] in the [[Haagse Bos]], and work in the [[Noordeinde Palace]] in the city centre. Moreover, there are two former royal palaces in The Hague. The [[Kneuterdijk Palace]], built in 1716, is now home to the [[Council of State of the Netherlands]], and the Lange Voorhout Palace is now occupied by the [[Escher Museum]], dedicated to Dutch graphical artist [[M. C. Escher]].

The Hague has its share of museums, most notably the [[Mauritshuis]], located next to the Binnenhof, which exhibits many [[painting]]s by Dutch masters, such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] and [[Paulus Potter]]. Other museums include the science museum [[Museon]], the modern art museum [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]], the historic museum [[Haags Historisch Museum]], the national [[postal museum]] [[Museum voor Communicatie]], the [[Museum Bredius]], the [[Louis Couperus Museum]], the museum [[Beelden aan Zee]] in [[Scheveningen]], and the former prison housed in a 15th-century gatehouse, the [[Gevangenpoort]].

Since early times, possibly as far back as the 16th century, the [[stork]] has been the symbol of The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Haagse-weetjes.htm |title=Den Haag - Haagse weetjes |publisher=Denhaag.nl |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602153030/http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Haagse-weetjes.htm |archivedate=2 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several films have been (partially) shot in The Hague, including ''[[Mindhunters]]'' (2004), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' (2004), ''[[Zwartboek|Black Book]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sonny Boy (2011 film)|Sonny Boy]]'' (2011). Parts of the second season of the Netflix series ''[[Sense8]]'' were filmed in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denhaagfm.nl/2016/07/10/opnamen-netflix-serie-sense8-dit-weekend-in-den-haag/ |title=Opnamen Netflix-serie ‘Sense8’ dit weekend in Den Haag |publisher=DenhaagFM.nl |date=10 July 2016 |accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable actors and filmmakers from The Hague include; [[Martin Koolhoven]], [[Georgina Verbaan]], [[Carel Struycken]], [[Frederique van der Wal]], [[Marwan Kenzari]], [[Vincent van Ommen]], [[Anna Drijver]], [[Renée Soutendijk]] and [[Paul Verhoeven]], who grew up in the city from an early age.

An alternative music video of [[Coldplay]]'s "[[Viva la Vida]]" was also shot in The Hague.

=== Sports ===
Currently the city's major [[association football|football]] club is [[ADO Den Haag]], who compete in the [[Eredivisie]], the top division in the Netherlands. ADO Den Haag have won the [[KNVB Cup]] twice and won the League twice in the era before professional football. They play their matches at the 15,000 seat [[Kyocera Stadion]]. Amateur team [[HVV Den Haag|HVV]] are also based in the city. Prior to the professional era the club won 10 national titles and one KNVB Cup, and they remain fourth in the all-time [[List of Dutch football champions|list of national title winners]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/nedchamp.html|title=Netherlands - Champions|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HBS Craeyenhout (football club)|HBS Craeyenhout]] are another amateur club in the city, who won three national titles before the establishment of the Eredivisie&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The local [[rugby union]] team is Haagsche Rugby Club (a.k.a. HRC) and has been in the Guinness Book of Records for becoming Dutch (in adult and youth) champions so often.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The ice hockey team is [[HYS The Hague]]. The handball team is [[SV Wings]], active in the top division. The local [[American Football]] team is [[Den Haag Raiders'99]].

[[Darts]] is another sport played in The Hague; its popularity was increased by [[Raymond Van Barneveld]] winning several World Championships.

The half marathon race [[CPC Loop Den Haag]] is held annually in The Hague. In 1994, The Hague held the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] World Equestrian Games.

=== Annual events ===
[[Koningsdag]], or ''King's Day'', is held annually on 27 April. It is traditionally celebrated with fairs and flea markets throughout the city. On this day the colour orange predominates at a [[funfair]] (which sells orange [[cotton candy]]) and scores of informal street markets. The day is a ''vrijmarkt'' (literally "free market"), which means no licence is needed for street vending; children traditionally use this day to sell old unwanted toys. Since King's Day is a national holiday and thus a day off, many people also go out and party on the evening before King's Day. This evening is called King's Night, or ''Koningnach'' in The Hague. The "t" is left out because ''nacht'' is pronounced as ''nach'' in The Hague. Outdoor concerts throughout the city centre of The Hague draw tens of thousands of visitors every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Kings-Day-Koningsdag.htm |title=King's Day (Koningsdag) |date=11 November 2013 |website=Denhaag.nl |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419221344/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Kings-Day-Koningsdag.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/The-Hague-turns-Orange-on-Kings-Day.htm |title=The Hague turns Orange on King's Day!) |date=26 March 2014 |website=Denhaag.nl |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419224259/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/The-Hague-turns-Orange-on-Kings-Day.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every third Tuesday in September is [[Prinsjesdag]], or ''Prince's Day'', the opening of Dutch parliament. A festive day, children in The Hague are free from school so they may watch the procession of the [[Golden Coach (Netherlands)|Golden Coach]]. The King is driven in the coach from [[Noordeinde Palace]] to the [[Ridderzaal]] in the [[Binnenhof]]. Here, the King reads the [[Speech from the Throne]], written jointly by the Ministers and Secretaries of State. This ''troonrede'' outlines the government's plans for the coming year. As the procession returns to the Noordeinde Palace, the road is lined with members of the Dutch Royal Armed Forces and in the afternoon the Royal Family appears on the palace balcony to address an adoring and often frenzied public (''balkonscène'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Princes-Day-Prinsjesdag.htm |title=Prince's Day (Prinsjesdag) |date=26 August 2013 |website=Denhaag.nl |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220113/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Princes-Day-Prinsjesdag.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vlaggetjesdag]] ([[:nl:Vlaggetjesdag|nl]]), literally ''Flag Day'', is the annual celebration of the arrival of the year's first herring (Hollandse Nieuwe) in [[Scheveningen]]. Hundreds of thousands of people gather in Scheveningen for the festivities, and the fishing boats are decorated especially for the occasion. In addition to the omnipresent herring, this day also features a number of activities unrelated to fish. In Scheveningen, the first barrel of herring is traditionally sold at an auction on the Thursday preceding the official Vlaggetjesdag, and the proceeds go to charity. Vlaggetjesdag was made official in 1947. The festive tradition around the beginning of herring season is much older, however. In the 18th century, the villages along the coast, including Scheveningen, were forbidden to gut the caught herring. Since herring was most appropriate for smoking around September, most fishing boats fished flatfish or round-bodied fish during a part of the summer so as to avoid a surplus of fresh herring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Flag-Day-Vlaggetjesdag.htm |title=Vlaggetjesdag (Flag Day) |date=19 July 2013 |website=Denhaag.nl |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214619/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Flag-Day-Vlaggetjesdag.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July or August, The city hosts a series of weekly firework displays by the sea front in [[Scheveningen]], as part of an international fireworks festival and competition.

[[Tong Tong Fair]], formerly ''Pasar Malam Besar'', is the largest festival in the world for [[Indo people|Indo]] culture. Established in 1959, it is one of the oldest festivals and the fourth largest grand fair in the Netherlands. It is also the annual event with the highest number of paying visitors of The Hague, having consistently attracted more than 100,000 visitors since 1993. The Milan Festival is Europe's biggest Hindustani open-air event, annually held in [[Zuiderpark]]. The Hague also hosts several annual music festivals. The last Sunday in June, the city hosts [[Parkpop]], the largest free open air pop concert in Europe. [[Crossing Border Festival]], [[State-X]] and [[The Hague Jazz]] festival are among other music festivals in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Music-City-The-Hague-5.htm |title=Music City The Hague |date=23 August 2012 |website=Denhaag.nl |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214407/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Music-City-The-Hague-5.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crossing Border Festival]] is an annual festival in November, focusing on music and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crossingborder.nl/ |title=Crossing Border Festival |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition took place in 1993.

Nine days filled with screenings of fiction films and documentaries, daily talk-shows, music performances and exhibitions. The first edition took place in 2006.

Moreover, The Hague International Model United Nations, annually in January, is a five-day conference held at the World Forum, gathering over 4,000 students from over 200 secondary schools across the globe. It is the oldest and largest high school [[United Nations]] simulation in the world. ''Den Haag Sculptuur'' is an open-air exhibition of sculptures. The 10th edition, in 2007, celebrated the 400 years of the relationship between the Netherlands and Australia. Since 2009, the city of The Hague also annually presents a [[LGBT]]-[[emancipation]] award called the [[John Blankenstein Award]]. The exact date of the ceremony varies each year.

The Hague shares an [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport|airport]] with [[Rotterdam]]. It can be reached from Central Station by [[RandstadRail]] Line E, with an Airport Shuttle to and from [[Meijersplein RandstadRail station|Meijersplein Station]]. However, with several direct trains per hour from the railway stations Hollands Spoor and Centraal, [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] is more frequently used by people travelling to and from The Hague by air.

===Rail===
[[File:Den Haag Centraal.jpg|thumb|Internal view of The Hague Central station]]
There are two main [[railway station]]s in The Hague: [[Den Haag HS railway station|Hollands Spoor]] (HS) and [[Den Haag Centraal railway station|Centraal Station]] (CS), only {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} away from each other. Because these two stations were built and exploited by two different railway companies in the 19th century, east-west lines terminate at Centraal Station, whereas north-south lines run through Hollands Spoor. Centraal Station does, however, now offer good connections with the rest of the country, with direct services to most major cities, for instance [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Utrecht]].

Other destinations include [[Leiden]], [[Haarlem]], [[Zwolle]], [[Groningen]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Enschede]] and [[Breda]], [[Eindhoven]]. There is an international service to [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]].

===Urban transport===
Public transport in The Hague consists of [[Trams in The Hague|a tramway network]] and a sizeable number of [[bus]] routes, operated by [[HTM Personenvervoer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htm.net/smartsite.dws?id=169 Public transport map] (from [[HTM Personenvervoer|HTM]])&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for a subway were shelved in the early 1970s. However, in 2004 a tunnel was built under the city centre with two underground tram stations ([[Spui RandstadRail station|Spui]] and [[Grote Markt RandstadRail station|Grote Markt]]); it is shared by RandstadRail lines 3 and 4 and tram routes 2 and 6.

[[RandstadRail]] connects The Hague to nearby cities, Zoetermeer, Rotterdam and Leidschendam-Voorburg. It consists of four light rail lines (2, 3, 4 and 19 to Zoetermeer, Rijswijk, Delft and Leidschendam-Voorburg) and one subway line (E to Rotterdam).

===Road===
Major motorways connecting to The Hague include the [[A12 motorway (Netherlands)|A12]], running to Utrecht and the German border. The A12 runs directly into the heart of the city in a cutting. Built in the 1970s, this section of motorway (the "Utrechtsebaan") is now heavily overburdened. Plans were made in the late 1990s for a second artery road into the city (the "Rotterdamsebaan" or previously called "Trekvliettracé") which is due to be built between 2016 and 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wegenwiki.nl/Rotterdamsebaan|title=Rotterdamsebaan - Wegenwiki|website=www.wegenwiki.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other connecting motorways are the [[A4 motorway (Netherlands)|A4]], which connects the city with [[Amsterdam]], and the [[A13 motorway (Netherlands)|A13]], which runs to [[Rotterdam]] and connects to motorways towards the Belgian border. There is also the [[A44 motorway (Netherlands)|A44]] that connects the city to [[Leiden]], [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]]. In the 1970s, plans of building another motorway to Leiden existed. This "Leidsebaan" was supposed to start in the city centre and then follow the railway line The Hague - Amsterdam. Some works have been executed, but removed already in the 1980s.

'''''The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor''''' ({{ISBN|0-393-04017-8}}), published in 1998 (with an epilogue added to the 1999 paperback edition), is a book by the late [[David Landes]], formerly Emeritus Professor of Economics and former Coolidge Professor of History at [[Harvard University]]. In it, Landes elucidates the reasons why some countries and regions of the world experienced near miraculous periods of explosive growth while the rest of the world stagnated. He does this by comparing the long-term [[economic histories]] of different regions of the world, giving priority to Europe and the United States, as well as [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[Arab world]], and [[Latin America]]. In addition to analyzing economic and [[cliometric]] figures, he gives substantial credit to such intangible assets as culture and enterprise in the different societies he examines in order to explain economic success or failure.

In doing so, he revives, at least in part, several theories he believes have been incorrectly discarded by academics over the last 40 years:

* The 'cultural thesis' or [[Protestant work ethic]] of [[Max Weber]], whereby the values imposed by the [[Protestant]] religion on its adherents would have pushed them to value hard work, timeliness, enterprise, free market and free-thinking to a much greater extent than for their Catholic brethren, which would explain the great success of northern Protestant regions such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Great Britain]], [[Denmark]] and parts of [[Germany]] as compared to southern Catholic nations such as [[Spain]] and [[France]].
* The [[Hydraulic empire|'hydraulic thesis']] or 'Oriental Despotism thesis' of [[Karl A. Wittfogel]], in which despots would control the use of water in order to submit the population to its will.
* The 'climate thesis' that posits that [[tropical climes]] are, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', poor candidates for development.
* Many of the theories of [[Adam Smith]], whose ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' is borrowed from for the title. That does not necessarily mean a doctrinaire [[neoclassical economics|neoclassicism]], as Landes notes that 'comparative advantage' can change over time.

He also spends a good deal of effort to debunk claims that the [[Asian miracle]] did not happen, was not significant, or was financed by [[European colonialism]], and he draws a correlation between the economic level of a country and the way it treats its women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11831.html] https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11831.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, he argues that the vast economic growth of the [[Industrial Revolution]] was no accident but instead resulted from several qualities of Europe, including its climate, political competition, economic freedom and attitude towards science and religion, more specifically from certain countries in Western Europe, primarily England.

==Criticism and response==
Critics have charged Landes with [[eurocentrism]] in his analysis, a charge which Landes himself does not deny; in fact, he embraces it explicitly, arguing that an explanation for an economic miracle that happened originally only in Europe (though he deals with the later '[[Asian miracle]]' in ''Wealth and Poverty'') must of necessity be a Eurocentric analysis, thus siding at least at some level with thinkers such as [[Bernard Lewis]]. Following Daniel Bell, knowledge is the necessary link between 'The European miracle' and the American [[post-industrial society]].

Landes and Professor [[Andre Gunder Frank]], author of ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age'' ({{ISBN|0520214749}}), are noted for having come to very different conclusions about the long-vie significance of economic developments in "the West" during the modern era and publicly debated their findings in 1998 at Northwestern University.

Additionally, an alternate theory relies on literacy and the gap between Protestants and Catholics as an explanation for the difference in economic results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Becker|first1=Sascha O.|last2=Wößmann|first2=Ludger|year=2007|title=Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History - Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7|publisher=Department of Economics University of Munich|location=Munich|page=|url=http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist Paul Krugman remarked in The Trouble with History (article published on his MIT-hosted blog) that the book, while containing an enormous amount of information, offered very few ideas. « What (does) ... Landes actually believe? And the answer, which seems to me to be damning, is that I am not sure. (...) So I am still waiting for a book that helps me understand what really happened in this utterly perplexing century... Whoever writes that book will have to be a person unafraid of offering theories as well as facts, and therefore of saying things that might turn out to be wrong. »

==Big picture==

===Ancient times===
[[Greeks|Greek]] [[physician]] [[Hippocrates]] first recognizes stroke more than 2,400 years ago, calling the condition ''[[apoplexy|apoplexia]]''. Hippocrates doesn't clarify that the condition actually happens in the [[brain]],&lt;ref name=healthline/&gt; instead resolving into a "stagnation of the blood, whereby all the motion and action of the spirits is taken away", and that the motion is stopped by sharp humours, or a ''[[wikt:plethora|plethora]]'' (an excess of red blood cells or bodily humours). [[Galen]] (129 AD) accepts and develops the theory of Hippocrates, believing that apoplexy is caused by anything interfering with the flow of the ''vital spirit'' to the brain. The galenic theory persists for centuries.&lt;ref name=oxfordjournals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/5/331.full.pdf|title=From apoplexy to stroke|author=|date=|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern times===
[[United Kingdom|British]] physician [[William Harvey]] (1578–1657) publishes his theory on the circulation of the blood. Others, like [[Johann Jakob Wepfer|Wepfer]] (1620–1695), still believe that apoplexy is caused by an obstruction in the path to the brain, suggesting that the brain did not receive enough "animal spirits". G.G.J. Robinson theorizes that there is a "plethora of fulness of blood", therefore bleeding is acceptable since it lessens the pressure on the "animal organs". Overall, the definition introduced by [[Hippocrates]] is still in use.&lt;ref name=oxfordjournals/&gt;

===1700s===
Although remnants of old dogma persist, the foundations have been laid for apoplexy to shed some ancient traditions based on symptomatic presentation and to evolve into a [[vascular disease]] based on clinico–pathological and patho–physiological correlates. [[Théophile Bonet|Bonet]] publishes ''Sepulchretum sive Anatomica Practica'', which becomes a prominent resource for physicians during most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;

===1800s===
The earliest known stroke treatments start to happen, when surgeons begin performing [[surgery]] on the [[carotid arteries]]. Surgeons begin operating to reduce cholesterol buildup and remove blockages that could then lead to a stroke.&lt;ref name=healthline/&gt; Reports of successful closures of injuries to the carotid arteries are documented.&lt;ref name=nhsjs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nhsjs.com/2014/stroke-historical-review-and-innovative-treatments/|title=Stroke: Historical Review and Innovative Treatments|author=|date=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900s===
Early in the [[20th century]], most of the treatments for stroke patients are limited to rehabilitation after an acute stroke, and most patients are usually left with permanent and severe deficits.&lt;ref name=nhsjs/&gt; In the 1950s new techniques and therapies are developed to explore and modify the internal processes of [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=oxfordjournals/&gt; In the 1960s carotid endarterectomy is greatly improved but is used mostly for stroke prevention and there is still no effective treatment after an acute stroke. In the 1970s [[aspirin]] is found to be very effective in stroke prevention. In the 1980s [[cigarette]] [[smoking]] is found to be a definite risk factor for stroke, and [[smoking cessation]] programs become very important. In the 1990s [[tissue plasminogen activator]] starts to be used for treatment of [[embolic]] or [[thrombotic]] stroke.&lt;ref name=nhsjs/&gt;

===2000s===
Today, rapid diagnosis is crucial for immediate treatment.&lt;ref name=nhsjs/&gt; Stroke remains the second most common cause of death worldwide, accounting for 6.7 million deaths in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/|title=The top 10 causes of death|author=|date=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2010, the age-standardised incidence of stroke significantly decreased by 12% in [[developed country|high-income countries]], and increased by 12% in [[developing country|low-income]] and [[developing country|middle-income]] countries. In the same period, mortality rates showed a significant decrease in all countries.&lt;ref name=Fei2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feigin VL, Forouzanfar MH, Krishnamurthi R, Mensah GA, Connor M, Bennett DA, Moran AE, Sacco RL, Anderson L, Truelsen T, O'Donnell M, Venketasubramanian N, Barker-Collo S, Lawes CM, Wang W, Shinohara Y, Witt E, Ezzati M, Naghavi M, Murray C | title = Global and regional burden of stroke during 1990-2010: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 | journal = Lancet | volume = 383 | issue = 9913 | pages = 245–54 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24449944 | pmc = 4181600 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61953-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trần Trọng Kim''' (1883 &amp;ndash; December 2, 1953), [[courtesy name]] '''Lệ Thần''', was a [[Vietnam]]ese scholar and politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Vietnam|Prime Minister]] of the short-lived [[Empire of Vietnam]], a [[State (polity)|state]] established with the support of [[Imperial Japan]] in 1945. This came after Japan had [[Japanese coup de main in French Indochina|seized direct control of Vietnam]] from the [[Vichy French]] colonial forces during the Second World War.  He was an uncle of [[Bui Diem]].

==Early years==
Kim was born in [[Dan Pho]],&lt;ref name="d85"&gt;Dommen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hà Tĩnh Province]] in northern central Vietnam in 1883.&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt; At the time, [[French Indochina]] had just been formed after the [[History of Vietnam|colonization of Vietnam]], and Hà Tĩnh was part of the central region, which had been become a French [[protectorate]] under the name of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. In the immediate decade afterwards, the province was the scene of a [[guerrilla]] movement led by [[Phan Đình Phùng]] that attempted to expel the French authorities. This movement was particularly popular in the [[Nghệ An]]-Hà Tĩnh region, which had boasted a long line of [[Nationalism|nationalist]] icons.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;Marr, pp. 50&amp;ndash;68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the movement was crushed; and when Kim grew up,&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; he initially studied in [[Hanoi]] at schools reserved for the ruling elite.&lt;ref name="d85"/&gt; He then worked in the public service of the French administration. Kim's early career was as an interpreter, serving in [[Ninh Bình]] in northern Vietnam, which was known as the protectorate of [[Tonkin]]. In 1905, Kim was sent to France as an employee of a private company. In 1908, he won a scholarship from the École Coloniale (Colonial School) to begin his training as a teacher at the École Normale of [[Melun]] ([[Seine-et-Marne]]). Kim returned to Vietnam in September 1911, commenced his career as a teacher in Annam, and slowly rose in the educational hierarchy. By 1942, he had risen to become an inspector of elementary public instruction in [[Tonkin]].&lt;ref name="c301"&gt;Chieu, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many works on [[pedagogy]] and also started a review on the topic.&lt;ref name="d85"/&gt; Kim was also a [[freemason]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Hammer, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Academia==
In contrast to his low-key career as an education official, Kim was widely known as a scholar for a collection of textbooks published in Romanized Vietnamese (''[[quốc ngữ]]''), especially for his writings on [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[History of Vietnam|Vietnamese history]].&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt;

His two best known works were ''[[Việt Nam sử lược]]'' (''A Brief history of Vietnam''), published in 1920, and ''Nho giáo'' (''Confucianism''), published in 1929&amp;ndash;1933.&lt;ref name=mc77&gt;McHale, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first book, Kim emphasised the Chinese influence on Vietnamese society.&lt;ref name="mc88"&gt;McHale, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter book dealt with examining [[Confucianism]] in China and its impact on Vietnam. Kim strongly praised Confucianism, and his book provoked much intellectual debate on the philosophy's place in Vietnamese society.&lt;ref&gt;McHale, pp. 77&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nho giáo'' was seen as a link between the generations of scholars who were brought up under the Confucian examination system of pre-French Vietnam and those who grew up under the French system.&lt;ref&gt;McHale, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Việt Nam Sử Lược'' remains in print as of 2009.&lt;ref name="d85"/&gt;

Due to his reputation in literary circles, Kim was a leading figure in the Buddhist and Confucian associations, and in 1939 he was appointed to the Chamber of People's Representatives in Tonkin.&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt; He was made a chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] and listed in a French publication in 1943 that profiled prominent figures in French Indochina.&lt;ref name="d85"/&gt;
==World War II==
After the outbreak of the Second World War, Japan continued its military conquest of Asia. It invaded and annexed Indochina into its [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] in 1940-1941. As France had fallen to [[Nazi Germany]], the colonial administration in Vietnam of Admiral [[Jean Decoux]] was loyal to the Axis collaborationist [[Vichy France]] of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]. As Vichy France was nominally allied to Japan, the French administration was left in charge of the day-to-day affairs of French Indochina, with the Japanese overseeing them.

In the early 20th century, Japan was also seen by many Vietnamese as a promoter of Asian nationalism, and many Vietnamese nationalists had travelled to Japan in an attempt to further the Vietnamese independence movement. During the period, Kim was approached by several Japanese experts in Vietnamese studies. These contacts, together with his ties to a progressive organisation in Hanoi, made Kim politically suspect to the Decoux administration. When Decoux implemented his second major purge of pro-Japanese Vietnamese in the autumn of 1943, Kim was reported to be on the list of the [[Sûreté]] (Criminal Investigation Department). On October 28, 1943, Japanese agents escorted Kim to the [[Kempeitai]] (military police) office in Hanoi and put him under protection. There, Kim was joined by [[Duong Ba Trac]], a co-editor on a dictionary that was currently being written. According to Kim's account, Trac persuaded him to co-sign a letter applying for an evacuation to [[Singapore]]. At the beginning of November, the Japanese escorted them to [[Saigon]]. After briefly living at the Kempeitai office, they became the guests of Dai Nan Koosi, a Japanese business firm owned by [[Matsushita Mitsuhiro]], which was known as a front for intelligence operations.&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt;

On January 1, 1944, Kim and Trac boarded a Japanese vessel headed for Singapore.&lt;ref name="c301"
/&gt; According to [[Ellen Hammer]], the French threat to Kim appeared "to have been a wholly illusory French menace".&lt;ref name="h48"/&gt; After spending just over a year on the island, and following Trac's death from [[lung cancer]] in December 1944, Kim was transferred to [[Bangkok]]. Three months later, on March 30, 1945, he was unexpectedly recalled to Saigon by the Japanese to be consulted on "history".&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt; This came after Captain Michio Kuga from the Japanese Army's liaison office in Saigon was flown to Bangkok for talks.&lt;ref name=sf1389&gt;Shiraishi and Furuta, pp. 138&amp;ndash;139.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this stage, the [[Liberation of Paris]] in August 1944 and the fall of Vichy France meant that Japan could no longer depend on the French colonial administration to cooperate. As a result, they assumed direct control of Indochina by deposing the French in a coup on March 9, and declared Vietnam to be independent under the newly created [[Empire of Vietnam]] with [[Bảo Đại]], who was Vietnam's titular monarch, as its head of state. Japan however, maintained military control. Bảo Đại was then charged with selecting a prime minister and a cabinet. It was believed that Bảo Đại sent a message to [[Ngô Đình Diệm]], who was then living under Japanese protection in [[Saigon]], asking him to form a government. However, the message never arrived, and this was put down to Japanese concerns that Diệm would seek to govern independently rather than toe the Japanese line.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in Saigon, he met with General Saburo Kawamura, Chief of Staff of the [[Thirty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Japanese Indochina Garrison Army]], and Lieutenant Colonel [[Hayashi Hidezumi]], Kawamura's chief of political affairs. Kawamura told Kim that he was one of the "notables" invited by Emperor Bảo Đại to consult in [[Huế]] on the creation of the new independent government.&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt; During this time, Kim also met with Diệm for the first time, finding out that he had not been included on the Japanese shortlist.&lt;ref name="sf1389"/&gt;

According to his own account, Kim accepted the invitation to talk with Bảo Đại because [[Hoàng Xuân Hãn]], a young friend, was also on the emperor's list. Kim departed Saigon on April 2, and arrived in Huế three days later. On April 7, Bảo Đại held a personal meeting with Kim,&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt; and at first Kim refused to accept the prime ministerial post. Kim said that he was too old, was an independent with no political party infrastructure, as well as his lack of prior involvement in politics.&lt;ref name="sf1389"/&gt; However, Kim prolonged his stay for further negotiations and finally agreed to form a new government on April 16. The following day, Kim submitted his proposed cabinet consisting of ten ministers. With the exception of one nominee who refused his cabinet post, the others arrived in the capital by late April or early May to take office).&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt;

Most of his cabinet members had been trained in French schools but were regarded as nationalists although they were not regarded as anti-French.&lt;ref name="h48"/&gt; The cabinet ([[:vi:Nội các Trần Trọng Kim (tháng 4, 1945)|vi]]) included [[Phan Anh]] as minister of youth.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Marr ''Vietnam: State, War, and Revolution (1945–1946)'' 2013 - Page 420 "Perhaps Nationalist Party leaders, familiar with Phan Anh's credentials as unflinching defense lawyer and energetic minister of youth in the brief Trần Trọng Kim Cabinet,"&lt;/ref&gt; Kim's regime was quickly endorsed by the [[Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng]] and the [[Việt Nam Phục quốc Đồng minh Hội]] ([[:vi:Việt Nam Phục quốc Đồng minh Hội|vi]]), two nationalist political parties. The Phuc Quoc were connected to [[Phan Bội Châu]] and [[Cường Để]],&lt;ref name="h48"/&gt; two leading anti-colonial activists from the early 20th century who championed cooperation with Japan and pan-Asianism to expel French colonialism.
==Rule==
{{Main article|Empire of Vietnam}}
Kim only had the chance to rule for five months, and most of his policies were not implemented before the [[Viet Minh]] seized power following the Japanese collapse at the end of the Second World War. After his government collapsed, Kim returned to his research and academic work.&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt;

Kim's actions have caused a debate as to whether he was a Japanese puppet. [[Milton Sacks]] and [[John T. McAlister]] regard him as such, although others, such as [[Trương Bửu Lâm]], regard Kim and his cabinet as a group of apolitical technocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Shiraishi and Furuta, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urakami''' was an area in the northern part of the city of [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]].

==History==
In 1614, by the orders of shōgun leader [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], Christianity was banned in Japan in order to suppress European influence and to prevent the undermining of the Japanese government. Most Japanese Christians who openly spoke about their religion were open to prosecution and subject to extreme harsh treatment, such as torture or crucifixion. As a result, Urakami became the stronghold for oppressed believers who steadfastly adhered to their religion in secret.&lt;ref name="KIF"&gt;[http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/regional/nagasaki/urakami.html A stronghold for believers of a banned Christian faith.

During this time period, the Oura Cathedral played the important role as spiritual support for Christians in Urakami. The existence of Christians within the Urakami area resulted the Japanese government to launch a crackdown in order to implement the ban. On September 1, 1790, the first persecution began in Urakami; hidden Christians were discovered and arrested, though there were no deaths. In 1839, a new wave of persecution was launched in Urakami, though this too didn’t result in any deaths either. But in the third kuzure (literally, ”disintegration"), conducted in 1859, more than 10 people died under torture. The fourth and final persecution was conducted between 1867 and 1873, better known as the [[Urakami Yoban Kuzure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelusonline.org/index.php?section=articles&amp;subsection=print_article&amp;article_id=27 Under the Sign of Assumption]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process, 68 residents of Urakami were arrested and were forced to renounce their religion entirely. This led to protests from foreign consuls, and the Tokugawa Shogunate relented. However, soon after Tokugawa Shogunate ended and in February 1868 the new [[Meiji government]] appointed Sawa Nobuyoshi in charge of public order in Kyūshū. His dislike of all things foreign was well known, and, after consultation, he decided to deal with the problem once and for all. His plan to exile the entire village was approved by an Imperial council on 25 April and implemented in two stages: first the ringleaders to Hagi, Tsuwano and Fukuyama, and then the rest of the village. Families were split up, and in total 3,414 Christian men, women, and children were sent into exile to all over Japan: 500 to Kanazawa, 160 to Tsuwano, 150 to Satsuma, 117 to Tsuru Shima, Okayama, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Izumi Interview in, Photo-Documentary of Christian history in Japan with Concentration on Hidden Christians, Eagan, B., St. Olaf College (2006).

However, under pressure, and wanting to keep the relationship with the United States and European countries, especially after the Japanese government opened to the world in the 1850s, the ban was lifted in 1873 and the Japanese Christians were finally able to return to Urakami. In 1895, Christians built the [[Urakami Cathedral|first cathedral]] in Asia in the Urakami area. The construction of the cathedral was fully completed in 1925.

On August 9, 1945, near the end of [[World War II]], Urakami became the site for [[ground zero]] when the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb exploded]] at about a height of {{convert|500|m|ft}}. The damage caused by the heat rays and the blast was almost entirely restricted to this area, while the Nakashima area was fairly well shielded by the hills. However, 36% of the total structures in both areas were damaged. The Urakami Cathedral was also heavily damaged during the blast. 

Following the war, Urakami was rebuilt and now houses the once-damaged Cathedral site.&lt;ref name="KIF" /&gt;
