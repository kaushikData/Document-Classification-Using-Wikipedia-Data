'''''A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar''''', also known as '''''The Guide to Science''''' or '''''Brewer's Guide to Science''''', is a book by [[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]] presenting explanations for common phenomena.&lt;ref name="1880 ed preface" /&gt; First published in the United Kingdom around 1840, the book is laid out in the style of a [[catechism]] and proved very popular.&lt;ref name="WAndrews" /&gt; 47 editions were printed by 1905 in English alone&lt;ref name="booklist" /&gt; and translations made into various other languages. A revised version was produced for the US market which was digitised and republished in 2005 as part of ''[[Making of America]] IV: the American voice, 1850–1877''.&lt;ref name="Mirlyn" /&gt;

Although presented itself as an accurate science text,&lt;ref name="1880 ed preface" /&gt; the book actually promotes religious ideas, including [[Teleological argument|divine design]].&lt;ref name="BLightman" /&gt;

The popularity of ''The Guide to Science'' enabled Brewer to gather material for his ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' which remains a classic reference work.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Guide to Science contents 1.jpg|thumb|left|Pages vi and vii of the 38th edition including the first page of the contents]]
[[File:Guide to Science contents 2.jpg|thumb|left|Page viii and 1 of the 38th edition including the second page of the contents]]
The object of ''The Guide to Science'' was to present answers to over 2000 questions about common phenomena.&lt;ref name="1880 ed preface" /&gt; There are questions dealing with the man-made objects such as candles, stoves and chimneys as well as answers seeking to explain [[Natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] (including a mention of [[ball lightning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|1880|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[cloud]]s, [[dew]] and [[rainbow]]s. Brewer intended that his book should be intelligible to a child, since children might often ask the questions he was seeking to answer, but without being so foolish as to offend the scientific.&lt;ref name="1880 ed preface" /&gt;

The book is separated into two or three parts, depending upon the edition, each part having several chapters. ''Part one'' deals with questions relating to [[heat]] such as the sources of heat and its effects on humans and animals, while ''Part two'' deals with questions relating to [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], explaining why metal rusts in air, the operation of barometers and the transmission of sound. A ''Miscellaneous'' section&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;The ''Miscellaneous'' section is included as a third part in the 1864 US edition, but is presented as a further chapter of the second part in the 1880 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; deals with several more nebulous questions, including questions about sleep and dreaming. Within each part, the different chapters break the questions and answers up into subject areas organised thematically.

==History==
''The Guide to Science'' had its origin in a habit of Brewer's of making and saving notes from his reading.&lt;ref name="notthis"&gt;{{Cite web
 |url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/rodgers1908/edwinstowe1.htm
 |title=Nottinghamshire History: Edwinstowe
 |accessdate=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ferguson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set his notes out in a [[FAQ|question-and-answer]] or [[catechism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightman|2007|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; style, leaving a space for answers when they were obtained.&lt;ref name="notthis" /&gt; Brewer bound his book into a volume and, disregarding advice from one man of science to burn it,&lt;ref name="notthis" /&gt; sought to have it [[publishing|published]]. His initial offer to [[Thomas Jarrold]] to sell the [[copyright]] for 50 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] was rejected.&lt;ref name="WAndrews"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andrews|2008|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notthis" /&gt; Instead, Jarrold agreed to publish the book under a [[profit sharing]] arrangement.&lt;ref name="WAndrews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="notthis" /&gt; The ultimate success of the book meant that this arrangement proved to be very profitable for both Brewer and Jarrold&lt;ref name="notthis" /&gt; with Jarrold later refusing to sell his share back to Brewer even when offered 4000 pounds.&lt;ref name="WAndrews" /&gt;

An edited version of the book by Robert Evans Peterson was published in the United States in 1851 as ''Familiar Science; or, the Scientific Explanation of Common Things'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a revised edition following in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1863}}&lt;/ref&gt; These versions were edited and rearranged in order to make them more suitable for American pupils&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1863|p=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were used as a text-book by schools in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1863|p=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer wrote to Peterson expressing his satisfaction at the rearrangement&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1863|p=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nevertheless prepared a revised edition of his own which was published in the US in 1864.&lt;ref name="US ed title"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|1864|loc=Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was digitised and republished by the [[University of Michigan Library]] in 2005 following a grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] as part of ''[[Making of America]] IV: the American voice, 1850–1877''.&lt;ref name="Mirlyn"&gt;{{Cite web

==Religious perspectives==
Brewer said that he consulted "the most approved modern authors" and submitted additions to "the revision of gentlemen of acknowledged reputation for scientific attainments".&lt;ref name="1880 ed preface" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BLightman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightman|2007|pp=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, religious rather than scientific answers to certain questions are prevalent in the book, particularly answers inferring [[Teleological argument|divine design]].&lt;ref name="BLightman" /&gt; For example, although modern theories of [[ice]] formation show that most of its unusual properties result from the [[hydrogen bond]] between neighbouring water molecules,&lt;ref name="MCavelleri"&gt;{{Citation
 |last=Cavelleri 
 |first=Matteo 
 |year=2004 
 |title=Local Structure of Hydrogen-Bonded Liquids 
 |place=[[Stockholm]] 
 |page=8 (footnote) 
 |url=http://www.math.nuk.edu.tw/jinnliu/papers/Cavalleri-Thesis-Water.pdf 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083522/http://www.math.nuk.edu.tw/jinnliu/papers/Cavalleri-Thesis-Water.pdf 
 |archivedate=2007-09-29 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer suggested that the reason ice is lighter than water, expanding as it freezes, is because it has been "wisely ordained by God that water shall be an exception to a very general rule".&lt;ref name="MCavelleri" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|1880|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewer was ordained as a [[deacon]] and later as a [[priest]]&lt;ref name="BLightman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1981|loc=Introduction, p. vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wished to provide a religious framework for science.&lt;ref name="BLightman42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightman|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and many other Christian [[Populism|populist]] science writers of the time presented religious themes and were able to keep them relevant to modern science in the mind of the public even after the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref name="BLightmanPre"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightman|2007|pp=vii-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Brewer's approach in promoting his ideas was to avoid discussing religious perspectives until about a third of the way into the book so that the introduction of these ideas would appear more natural.&lt;ref name="BLightman" /&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
A review of the second edition of ''The Guide to Science'' was published by [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] magazine in 1850.&lt;ref name="punch" /&gt; The book was seen to be a "very useful little work". However, in typical ''Punch'' [[satire|satirical]] style, the reviewer disagreed with one answer that we "feel a desire for activity in cold weather" due to "fanning combustion in the blood" by instead insisting that we feel a desire "to sit cosily over a fire in cold weather".&lt;ref name="punch" /&gt;

The success of ''The Guide to Science'' convinced Brewer that his readers still accepted religious explanations rather than [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary theory]].&lt;ref name="BLightman" /&gt; Following the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, Brewer wrote ''Theology in Science; or The Testimony of Science to the Wisdom and Goodness of God'' (published in 1860) in order to demonstrate that evolution had not destroyed theological tradition and to continue ''The Guide to Science'''s promotion of [[natural theology]].&lt;ref name="BLightman" /&gt; The book's popularity also resulted in Brewer being sent "a large number of questions on all imaginary matters".&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evansx"&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1981|loc=Introduction, p. x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These questions and their answers became the nucleus of ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', first published in 1870.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evansx" /&gt; This latter book has long outlived all of Brewer's other publications&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1981|loc=Editor's Preface, p. v}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains a classic reference work.&lt;ref name="times" &gt;Comment by the [[Times Educational Supplement]] noted on the 1981 revised edition of [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]] {{Harv|Evans|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Wet Dream on Elm Street''''' is a 2011 [[Pornographic film|pornographic]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Lee Roy Myers]]. It is a parody of the 1984 horror film classic ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''.

== Plot ==

After having sex with her boyfriend, a woman is shocked when he transforms into [[Freddy Krueger]], who she mistakes for [[Edward James Olmos]]. Freddy seduces the woman with his glove, which has vibrators affixed to the fingers.

At the second annual Elm Street High School reunion, three women discuss how all their classmates have mysteriously died. The [[Sex education|sex ed]] professor appears and corrects them, explaining that their classmates fell into orgasm-induced "pleasure comas" while they slept. The professor theorizes it is the work of Freddy, a sex toy salesman who sold overpriced and shoddy merchandise. Angered by Freddy's defective products, the townspeople set him on fire, with the professor throwing the first match ("That guy sold me a crappy toy. Told me it was a [[Fleshlight]]. It turned out just to be a flashlight"). Freddy burnt from the waist up, and as he died he swore he would get his revenge on his killers through their children. The professor is dumbfounded by the girls failing to remember this (they witnessed Freddy's burning, and attended the [[block party]] celebrating the event) and warns them not to fall asleep.

At home, Betty tries to keep herself awake by watching the porno ''Dead Man Fucking'', but the video turns into one showing Freddy having sex with a female guard in a prison cell. When Freddy finishes with the guard he attacks Betty, but she wakes up. At the school, Betty tells the others about her nightmare, and the professor admits he once had a dream about Freddy ("It's not gay") where he saw Freddy's glove long enough to allow him to create a replica of it. Thinking the copy can help them find Freddy's weakness, the professor gives the glove to Kami. Kami masturbates into unconsciousness with the glove, and is rendered comatose by Freddy.

While the professor takes Kami to a hospital and Betty goes home, Denise stays behind ("If I learned anything from horror movies, it's that the psychotic fictional horror villain never goes for the hot girl in a room that's dark when she's all alone and most vulnerable"). Hearing noises coming from her old textbook, Denise flips through the pages, and sees herself and the professor having sex in them. Denise is transported into the book, and when she and the professor finish fornicating, the professor turns into Freddy, and he puts Denise into a coma.

Fed up with living in fear, Betty goes to sleep, and confronts Freddy in her dream. The two have sex, and when Freddy tries to put her into a coma afterward, Betty reveals she stole his glove's batteries ("Now all you have to turn those girls on is that burnt face, and that 1980s sweater"). With Freddy robbed of his power, Betty wakes up, wonders if it was all just a dream, and discovers her underwear is soaked through.

== Reception ==

The cast and effects were commended by Video Junkie Strikes Back from Beyond the Grave, which wrote it "might just be the best horror [[porn parody]] to date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://originalvidjunkie.blogspot.ca/2011/10/halloween-havoc-wet-dream-on-elm-street.html?zx=706021cefcf21380|title = Halloween Havoc: ''A Wet Dream on Elm Street'' (2011)|last = Wilson|first = William|publisher = Video Junkie Strikes Back from Beyond the Grave|date = 26 October 2011|website = originalvidjunkie.blogspot.ca|accessdate = 17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar sentiments were expressed by the websites Scarred Stiff Reviews, The Movies Made Me Do It, Blue Screw Reviews, Nerd Reactor and Coolest Porn Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.scaredstiffreviews.com/?p=1612|title = Lee Roy Myers' ''Wet Dream on Elm Street'' - XXX Porn Parody (Movie Review)|last = Garza|first = Melissa|publisher = Scared Stiff Reviews|date = 17 March 2012|website = scaredstiffreviews.com|accessdate = 17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.moviesmademe.com/movie/review/2564|title = ''A Wet Dream on Elm Street'' (2011)|last = |author = TM|publisher = The Movies Made Me Do It|date = 5 December 2011|website = moviesmademe.com|accessdate = 17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluescrewreview.com/main/2011/11/18/a-wet-dream-on-elm-street-review/ |title=''A Wet Dream on Elm Street'' Review |last=Cypher |first=D |publisher=Blue Screw Review |date=18 November 2011 |website=bluescrewreview.com |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511150229/http://www.bluescrewreview.com/main/2011/11/18/a-wet-dream-on-elm-street-review/ |archivedate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nerdreactor.com/2011/11/06/freddys-going-to-make-you-moan-in-a-wet-dream-on-elm-street/|title = Freddy's Going to Make You Moan in ''A Wet Dream on Elm Street''|last = Nguyen|first = Steve|publisher = Nerd Reactor|date = 6 November 2011|website = nerdreactor.com|accessdate = 17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://coolestpornreviews.com/2011/10/22/halloween-porn-a-wet-dream-on-elm-street/|title = Halloween Porn: ''A Wet Dream on Elm Street''|last = Prieto|first = Willy|publisher = Coolest Porn Reviews|date = 22 October 2011|website = coolestpornreviews.com|accessdate = 17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video Tramp had a lukewarm reaction to the film, beginning its review with "I found myself severely underwhelmed by the whole thing. This is but another in Canadian-born director Lee Roy Meyers' long resume of cheaply-made, creatively-blasé efforts." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videotramp.com/2011/10/19/wet-dream-on-elm-street/ |title=''Wet Dream on Elm Street'' |last= |first= |publisher=Video Tramp |date=19 October 2011 |website=videotramp.com |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909024939/http://videotramp.com/2011/10/19/wet-dream-on-elm-street/ |archivedate=9 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast was criticized by All Things Horror, which stated "If you are looking for something sexy, this movie is severely lacking. If you are looking for funny porn, there are a few key moments in here that I'm glad to have seen, but other parodies have certainly done better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingshorroronline.net/2011/12/flaccid-freddy-gets-fingered-in-wet.html |title=A Flaccid Freddy Gets Fingered In ''A Wet Dream On Elm Street'' |last=Snoonian |first=Mike |publisher=All Things Horror |date=19 December 2011 |website=allthingshorroronline.net/ |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529092130/http://www.allthingshorroronline.net/2011/12/flaccid-freddy-gets-fingered-in-wet.html |archivedate=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Abraham Bredius''' (18 April 1855 in [[Amsterdam]] – 13 March 1946 in [[Monaco]]) was a Dutch art collector, art historian, and museum curator.

==Life==
Bredius travelled widely, visiting various art collections in his youth, and worked at the Dutch Museum for History and Art before becoming director from 1889 to 1909 of the [[Mauritshuis]]. He became a [[Rembrandt]] expert who had many differences of opinion with [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]]. He was a regular contributor to the historical magazines ''Oud Holland'' and ''Künstler-Inventare''. In 1922, he left the Netherlands for health reasons and settled in [[Monaco]], publishing books in 1927 on [[Jan Steen]] and in 1935 a [[Rembrandt catalog raisonné, 1935|catalog]] of [[Rembrandt]] paintings, often referred to in the literature as "Bredius 1935". He bequeathed his papers to the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and his art collection lives on in the [[Museum Bredius]]. He also bequeathed several Rembrandt paintings to the National Dutch collection.

'''''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand''''' was an official [[encyclopedia]] about New Zealand, published by the [[Government of New Zealand]] in 1966. The editor was Dr [[Alexander Hare McLintock]], the [[Parliament of new zealand|parliamentary historian]], who was assisted by two others. The encyclopedia included articles written by 359 other authors. It contained over 1,800 general articles and 900 biographies.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About this site |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/ENZ-Utility/SiteInformation/AboutThisSite/en |work=Te Ara |publisher= |date= |accessdate=16 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311023435/http://www.teara.govt.nz/ENZ-Utility/SiteInformation/AboutThisSite/en |archivedate=11 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in three volumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand 1966 | url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/en | work=Te Ara | publisher= | date= | accessdate=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its print run of 30,000 copies was sold out within three months.

The encyclopaedia is more representative of [[minorities]] than previous New Zealand reference works such as the vanity press ''[[The Cyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', but not as representative as the ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]''. A number of women were present as representing firsts, including [[Kate Edger]].

The text and images have been digitised and are published online without corrections or updates,&lt;ref name=about/&gt; subsumed within its successor ''[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'' by the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]].

The '''archive bit''' is a [[file attribute]] used by [[CP/M]], [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft operating systems]], [[OS/2]], and [[AmigaOS]]. It is used to indicate whether or not the file has been [[backed up]] (archived).  

== Usage ==
In Windows and OS/2, when a file is created or modified, the archive [[bit]] is set (i.e. turned on), and when the file has been backed up, the archive bit is cleared (i.e. turned off).  Thus, the meaning of the archive bit is "this file has not been archived". 

In CP/M, the meaning is inverted: creating or modifying a file clears the archive bit, and the bit is set when the file is backed up.

An [[incremental backup]] task may use the archive bit to distinguish which files have already been backed up, and select only the new or modified files for backup.

[[Backup software]] may provide the option to do a [[full backup]] while clearing archive bits – that is, to back up all files regardless of their archive bit status, and to clear the archive bit for all files processed by the backup.  This allows for the creation of an initial full backup that will be supplemented by incremental backups in the future.

The operating system never clears the archive bit unless explicitly told to do so by the user.  Even when a user explicitly tells the operating system to copy a file for the purpose of archiving it, the archive bit will still not be cleared.  A specific command for clearing or setting the bit must be executed. In [[MS-DOS]] as well as nearly all versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], the archive bit's status can be viewed or changed with the [[attrib]] command-line utility, or by viewing the properties of a file with the [[Windows shell]] or [[Windows Explorer]].  The archive bit's status can also be viewed or changed with the GetFileAttributes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364944(v=VS.85).aspx|title=GetFileAttributes function (Windows)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; GetFileAttributesEx,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364946(v=VS.85).aspx|title=GetFileAttributesEx function (Windows)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SetFileAttributes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365535(v=VS.85).aspx|title=SetFileAttributes function (Windows)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows APIs.  The archive bit can be set or cleared with the attributes property&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5tx15443(v=vs.84).aspx|title=Attributes Property|website=msdn.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[VBScript]] or [[JScript]].

When a file with a clear archive bit is moved from one place on a file system to another, the archive bit reverts to being set.

Typically on a computer system that has never been backed up in a manner that clears archive bits, all files on that computer will have their archive bits set, as there are few applications that make use of archive bits without the user's request.

As the archive bit is a [[file attribute]] and not part of the file itself; the contents of the file remain unchanged when the status of the archive bit changes.

== Alternatives ==
Relying on the archive bit for backing up files can be unreliable if multiple backup programs are setting and clearing the archive bit on the same volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genie9.com/support/manuals/gbmpro/sett_archive.htm|title=Understanding Archive Bit and Backup Types}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is to use the [[timestamp]] of the last change to the file or directory. This is typically the technique used in [[Unix|UNIX]]-like operating systems.

The '''Atlantic bluefin tuna''' (''Thunnus thynnus'') is a [[species]] of [[tuna]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scombridae]]. It is variously known as the '''northern bluefin tuna''' (mainly when including [[Pacific bluefin tuna|Pacific bluefin]] as a subspecies), '''giant bluefin tuna''' [for individuals exceeding {{convert|150|kg|abbr=on}}] and formerly as the '''tunny'''.

Atlantic bluefins are native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, as well as the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  They have become extinct in the [[Black Sea]]. The Atlantic bluefin tuna is a close relative of the other two bluefin tuna species—the Pacific bluefin tuna and the [[southern bluefin tuna]].

Atlantic bluefin tuna may exceed {{convert|900
|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight, and rival the [[black marlin]], [[Atlantic blue marlin|blue marlin]], and [[swordfish]] as the largest [[Perciformes]]. Throughout recorded history, the Atlantic bluefin tuna has been highly prized as a [[food fish]].  Besides their commercial value as food, the great size,  speed, and power they display as [[apex predator]]s has attracted the admiration of fishermen, writers, and scientists.

The Atlantic bluefin tuna has been the foundation of one of the world's most lucrative commercial fisheries.  Medium-sized and large individuals are heavily targeted for the [[Tsukiji fish market|Japanese raw fish market]], where all bluefin species are highly prized for [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]].

This commercial importance has led to severe [[overfishing]]. The [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]] &lt;!-- (ICCAT) --&gt; affirmed in October 2009 that Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks have declined dramatically over the last 40 years, by 72% in the Eastern Atlantic, and by 82% in the Western Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In early 2010, European officials, led by the French ecology minister, increased pressure to ban the commercial fishing of bluefin tuna internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jolly, David |title=Europe Leans Toward Bluefin Trade Ban |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/world/europe/04tuna.html |work=The New York Times |date=3 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; European Union nations, which are responsible for most bluefin tuna overfishing, later abstained from voting to protect the species from international trade.&lt;ref name=DJJB&gt;

Most bluefins are captured commercially by professional fishermen using [[longline fishing|longline]]s, [[purse seine]]s, assorted hook-and-line gear, heavy [[fishing rod|rods]] and reels, and [[harpoon]]s. Recreationally, bluefins have been one of the most important big-game species sought by sports fishermen since the 1930s, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Spain, France, and Italy.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic bluefin tuna was one of the many [[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|fish species originally described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in the landmark 1758 [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', where it was given the binomial name of ''Scomber thynnus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Linnaeus |first=Carl |authorlink= Carl Linnaeus |title= Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis |publisher= (Laurentii Salvii) |location= [[Stockholm|Holmiae]] |volume= Vol. I |edition= 10th revised |language= Latin |year= 1758 |page= 297 |url= https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/727208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is most closely related to the [[Pacific bluefin tuna]] (''T. orientalis'') and the [[southern bluefin tuna]] (''T. maccoyii''), and more distantly to the other large tunas of the genus ''[[Thunnus]]'' – the [[bigeye tuna]] (''T. obesus'') and the [[yellowfin tuna]] (''T. albacares'').&lt;ref name=Collette1999&gt;Collette, B.B. (1999). ''Mackerels, molecules, and morphology.'' In: Proceedings of the 5th Indo-Pacific Fish Conference, Noumea. pp. 149–164&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna species were considered to be the same, or subspecies, and referred to as the "northern bluefin tuna".&lt;ref name=Collette1999/&gt; This name occasionally gives rise to some confusion, as the [[longtail tuna]] (''T. tonggol'') can in Australia sometimes be known under the name "northern bluefin tuna".&lt;ref name=Hutchins1986&gt;Hutchins, B. &amp; Swainston, R. (1986). ''Sea Fishes of Southern Australia.'' pp. 104 &amp; 141. {{ISBN|1-86252-661-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen1999&gt;Allen, G. (1999). ''Marine Fishes of Tropical Australia and South-East Asia.'' p. 230. {{ISBN|0-7309-8363-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in New Zealand and Fiji.

Bluefin tuna were often referred to as the common tunny, especially in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  The name "tuna", a derivative of the Spanish ''atún'', was widely adopted in California in the early 1900s and has since become accepted for all tunas, including the bluefin, throughout the English-speaking world.  In some languages, the red color of the bluefin's meat is included in its name, as in ''atún rojo'' (Spanish) and ''tonno rosso'' (Italian), amongst others.

[[File:Spawning-Behaviour-and-Post-Spawning-Migration-Patterns-of-Atlantic-Bluefin-Tuna-(Thunnus-thynnus)-pone.0076445.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Atlantic bluefin tuna migration]]
The body of the Atlantic bluefin tuna is rhomboidal in profile and robust. The head is conical and the mouth rather large. The head contains a "pineal window" that allows the fish to navigate over its multiple thousands-of-miles range.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; The color is dark blue above and gray below, with a gold coruscation covering the body and bright yellow [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] finlets. Bluefin tuna can be distinguished from other family members by the relatively short length of their [[pectoral fin]]s. Their [[liver]]s have a unique characteristic in that they are covered with blood vessels (striated). In other tunas with short pectoral fins, such vessels are either not present or present in small numbers along the edges.

The bluefin possesses enormous muscular strength, which it channels through a pair of tendons to its lunate-shaped caudal fin for propulsion. In contrast to many other fish, the body stays rigid while the tail flicks back and forth, increasing stroke efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a very efficient circulatory system. It possesses one of the highest blood hemoglobin concentrations among fish, which allows it to efficiently deliver oxygen to its tissues; this is combined with an exceptionally thin blood-water barrier to ensure rapid oxygen uptake.&lt;ref name="animalphys"/&gt;

{{Main article|Tuna#Physiology}}
To keep its core muscles warm, which are used for power and steady swimming, the Atlantic bluefin uses [[countercurrent exchange]] to prevent heat from being lost to the surrounding water. Heat in the [[venous blood]] is efficiently transferred to the cool, oxygenated [[arterial blood]] entering a ''[[rete mirabile]]''.&lt;ref name="animalphys"&gt;{{cite book

This allows them to seek food in the rich but chilly waters of the north Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|title=Tuna's End|work=The New York Times|page=28|date=27 June 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/magazine/27Tuna-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic bluefin tuna typically hunts small fish such as [[sardine]]s, [[herring]], and [[mackerel]], and invertebrates such as [[squid]] and [[crustacean]]s.

The [[tetraphyllidea]]n [[tapeworm]] ''[[Pelichnibothrium speciosum]]'' [[parasitize]]s this species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1006091102174 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251176636_Taxonomic_status_of_Pelichnibothrium_speciosum_Monticelli_1889_%28Cestoda_Tetraphyllidea%29_a_mysterious_parasite_of_Alepisaurus_ferox_Lowe_%28Teleostei_Alepisauridae%29_and_Prionace_glauca_%28L.%29_%28Euselachii_Carcharinidae%29 |title=Taxonomic status of ''Pelichnibothrium speciosum'' Monticelli, 1889 (Cestoda: Tetraphyllidea), a mysterious parasite of ''Alepisaurus ferox'' Lowe (Teleostei: Alepisauridae) and ''Prionace glauca'' (L.)

Š.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the tapeworm's [[definite host]] is the [[blue shark]], which does not generally seem to feed on tuna{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}, the Atlantic bluefin tuna likely is a [[dead-end host]] for ''P. speciosum''.

===Life history===
Female bluefin are thought to produce up to 30 million eggs. Atlantic bluefin tuna spawn in two widely separated areas.  One spawning ground exists in the western [[Mediterranean]], particularly in the area of the [[Balearic Islands]].  The other important spawning ground of the Atlantic bluefin is the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Pop-up satellite tracking results appear to confirm in large measure the belief held by many scientists and fishermen that although bluefin that were spawned in each area may forage widely across the Atlantic, they return to the same area to spawn.

Atlantic bluefin group together in large concentrations to spawn, and at such times are highly vulnerable to commercial fishing.  This is particularly so in the Mediterranean, where the groups of spawning bluefin can be spotted from the air by light aircraft and purse seines directed to set around the schools. The western and eastern populations of Atlantic bluefin tuna are thought to mature at different ages. Bluefin born in the east are thought to reach maturity a year or two earlier than those spawned in the west.&lt;ref name=mmdptb&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1061197 |pmid=11509729 |url=http://www.tunaresearch.org/reprints/migratory2001.pdf| title = Migratory Movements, Depth Preferences, and Thermal Biology of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna |journal=Science |volume=293 |issue=5533 |pages=1310–4 |year=2001 |last1=Block |first1=B.

===Aquaculture===
Tuna farming began as early as the 1970s. Canadian fishermen in [[St. Marys Bay, Nova Scotia|St Mary's Bay]] captured young fish and raised them in pens. In captivity, they grow to reach hundreds of kilos, eventually fetching premium prices in Japan. Farming enables farmers to exploit the unpredictable supply of wild-caught fish. Ranches across the Mediterranean and off South Australia grow bluefin offshore. Annual revenues are $220 million. A large proportion of juvenile and young Mediterranean fish are taken to be grown on tuna farms. Because the tuna are taken from the wild to the pens before they are old enough to reproduce, farming is one of the most serious threats to the species.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The bluefin's slow growth and late sexual maturity compound its problems. The Atlantic population has declined by nearly 90% since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Europe and Australia, scientists have used light-manipulation technology and time-release [[hormone]] implants to bring about the first large-scale captive spawning of Atlantic and southern bluefin.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; The technology involves implanting [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] in the fish to stimulate fertile egg production and may push the fish to reach sexual maturity at younger ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/4862-breeding-overfished-bluefin-tuna.html |title=Breeding the Overfished Bluefin Tuna |publisher=LiveScience |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since bluefin require so much food per pound of weight gained - up to 10 times that of salmon - if bluefin were to be farmed at the same scale as 21st-century salmon farming, many of their prey species might become depleted if farmed bluefin were fed the same diet as their wild counterparts. As of 2010, 30 million tons of small forage fish were removed from the oceans yearly, the majority to feed farmed fish.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;

Market entry by many North African Mediterranean countries, such as [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]] in the 1990s, along with the increasingly widespread practice of tuna farming in the Mediterranean and other areas, such as southern Australia (for southern bluefin tuna), depressed prices. One result is that fishermen must now catch up to twice as many fish to maintain their revenues.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Japanese began eating tuna sushi in the 1840s, when a large catch came into [[Edo]] [old Tokyo] one season. A chef marinated a few pieces in [[soy sauce]] and served it as ''nigiri sushi''.

By the 1930s, tuna sushi was commonplace in Japan. After World War II, Japanese fishermen needed more fish to eat and to export for European and U.S. canning industries. They expanded their range and perfected industrial [[long-line fishing|long-lining]], a practice that employs thousands of baited hooks on miles-long lines. In the 1970s, Japanese manufacturers developed lightweight, high-strength polymers that were spun into drift nets. Though they were banned on the high seas by the early 1990s, in the 1970s hundreds of miles of them were often deployed in a single night. At-sea freezing technology then allowed them to bring frozen sushi-ready tuna from the farthest oceans to market after as long as a year.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;

The initial target was yellowfin tuna. Japanese did not value bluefin before the 1960s. By the late 1960s, [[sportfishing]] for giant bluefin tuna was burgeoning off Nova Scotia, New England, and Long Island. North Americans, too, had little appetite for bluefin, usually discarding them after taking a picture. Bluefin sportfishing’s rise, however, coincided with Japan’s export boom. In the 1960s and ’70s, cargo planes were returning to Japan empty. A Japanese entrepreneur realized he could buy New England and Canadian bluefin cheaply, and started filling Japan-bound holds with tuna. Exposure to beef and other fatty meats during the U.S. occupation had prepared the Japanese palate for bluefin’s fatty belly (''otoro''). The Atlantic bluefin was the biggest and the favorite. The appreciation rebounded across the Pacific when Americans started to eat raw fish in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;

Prior to the 1960s, Atlantic bluefin fisheries were relatively small scale, and populations remained stable. Although some local stocks, such as those in the North Sea, were damaged by unrestricted commercial fishing, other populations were not at risk. However, in the 1960s, purse seiners catching fish for the canned tuna market in United States coastal waters removed huge numbers of juvenile and young Western Atlantic bluefin, taking out several entire year classes. Mediterranean fisheries have historically been poorly regulated and catches under-reported, with French, Spanish, and Italian fishermen competing with North African nations for a diminishing population.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} The fish's migratory habits complicate the task of regulating the fishery, because they spend time in the national waters of multiple countries, as well as the open ocean outside of any national jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Threats===

Global appetite for fish is the predominant threat to Atlantic bluefin. Bluefin aquaculture, which arose in response to declining wild stocks, has yet to achieve a sustainability, in part because it predominantly relies on harvesting and ranching juveniles rather than captive breeding.

Despite some concern, assessments from the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] estimated that the population loss would not be significant, ranging from 0.4–4.0% of juveniles, which is within the range of annual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press via Naples Daily News |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2011/dec/04/bp-oil-spill-bluefin-tuna-ok/?gulfdrilling=1 |title=Bluefin tuna probably OK after BP oil spill, fed agency says |date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Does this still hold after seven years?|?=yes|date=April 2017}}

===Conservation===
Overfishing continues despite repeated warnings of the current precipitous decline. In 2007, researchers from the [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]] (ICCAT)—the regulators of Atlantic bluefin fishing—recommended a global quota of 15,000 tonnes to maintain current stocks or 10,000 tonnes to allow the fisheries recovery. ICCAT then chose a quota of 36,000 tonnes, but surveys indicated that up to 60,000 tonnes were actually being taken (a third of the total remaining stocks) and the limit was reduced to 22,500 tonnes. Their scientists now say that 7500 tonnes are the sustainable limit.  In November 2009, ICCAT set the 2010 quota at 13,500 tonnes and said that if stocks were not rebuilt by 2022, it would consider closing some areas.&lt;ref name=DJJB/&gt;

In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] added the northern bluefin tuna to its seafood red list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |title=Greenpeace International Seafood Red list |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410205501/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |archivedate=10 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2010, the United Nations rejected a U.S.-backed effort to impose a total ban on Atlantic bluefin tuna fishing and trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black |first=Richard |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8574775.stm |title=Bluefin tuna ban proposal meets rejection |publisher=BBC News |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325134310/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8574775.stm| archivedate= 25 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES) vote was 68 to 20 with 30 European abstentions. The leading opponent, Japan, claimed that ICCAT was the proper regulatory body.&lt;ref name="DJJB"/&gt;

In 2011, the USA's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) decided not to list the Atlantic bluefin tuna as an endangered species. NOAA officials said that the more stringent international fishing rules created in November 2010 would be enough for the Atlantic bluefin tuna to recover. NOAA agreed to reconsider the species endangered status in 2013.&lt;ref name=tuna_endangered&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Richard|title=Sorry, Charlie! Better Luck Next Time Getting Endangered Species Status|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/05/27/136719390/sorry-charlie-better-luck-next-time-getting-endangered-species-status|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=NPR|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made a [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]  [[Species of Concern]], one of those species about which the U.S. government has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/concern/ Species of Concern] [[NOAA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2011, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] led a campaign against supposedly illegal bluefin tuna fishing off the coast of [[Libya]], which was under [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s regime at the time. The fishermen retaliated against Sea Shepherd's intervention by throwing various, small metal pieces at the crew. Nobody was injured due to the other side's actions during the conflict.&lt;ref name="Sea Shepherd Conservation Society Blue Rage 2011"&gt;[http://www.seashepherd.org/blue-rage-2011/ Operation Blue Rage 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102063805/http://www.seashepherd.org/blue-rage-2011/ |date=2 November 2013 }}. Seashepherd.org. Retrieved on 1 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, food critic [[Eric Asimov]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the top-ranked New York City restaurant [[Sushi Yasuda]] for offering bluefin tuna on their menu, arguing that drawing from such a threatened fishery constituted an unjustifiable risk to bluefin, and to the future of culinary traditions that depend on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov |first=Eric |url=http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/reviewing-sushi-yasuda/ |title=Sushi Yasuda — NYC |publisher=nytimes.com |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117060718/http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/reviewing-sushi-yasuda/ |archivedate=17 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, 48 countries meeting in Morocco for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas voted to keep strict fishing limits, saying the species' population is still fragile. The quota will rise only slightly, from 12,900 metric tons a year to 13,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Bluefin-tuna-quotas-remain-in-place/tabid/418/articleID/277334/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Bluefin tuna quotas remain in place| date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was reviewed in November 2014, resulting in higher allowances listed below.

The latest stock assessment for Atlantic bluefin tuna reflected an improvement in the status for both
western and eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean stocks. The Commission adopted new management measures
that are within the range of scientific advice, are consistent with the respective rebuilding plans, and allow
for continued stock growth. For the western stock, the TAC of 2,000 mt annually for 2015 and 2016 will
provide for continued growth in spawning stock biomass and allow the strong 2003 year-class to continue
to enhance the productivity of the stock. The TAC for the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean stock was set at
16,142 t for 2015; 19,296 t for 2016; and 23,155 t for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/slider_stories/2014/11/2014_iccat_meeting_highlights_11.19.14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture=== 
The American television reality show [[Wicked Tuna]] and its spinoff [[Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks]] follow commercial hook and line Atlantic bluefin tuna off the east coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenburg |first1=Stephen A. |title=Reality TV comes to Gloucester for ‘Wicked Tuna’ |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2012/03/22/reality_tv_comes_to_gloucester_for_wicked_tuna_1332346857/ |website=Boston.com |publisher=Boston Globe |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wicked Tuna premiered in 2014 and is broadcast by [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic]].

[[File:Chain Letter from Heaven.jpg|thumb|right|Top portion of an 18th-century "Letter from Heaven," produced in England.]]

A '''chain letter''' is a [[message]] that attempts to convince the recipient to make a number of copies of the [[letter (message)|letter]] and then pass them on to a certain number of recipients (either a predefined number or as many as possible). The "chain" is actually an exponentially growing pyramid (a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree graph]]) that cannot be sustained indefinitely. Common methods used in chain letters include [[Psychological manipulation|emotionally manipulative]] stories, [[Make Money Fast|get-rich-quick]] [[pyramid scheme]]s, and the exploitation of [[superstition]] to threaten the recipient with bad luck or even physical violence or death if he or she "breaks the chain" and refuses to adhere to the conditions set out in the letter. It is usually assumed that the sender of a superstitious chain letter seriously believes it to be true and is legitimately trying to convince the recipient of the literal wording, although, in theory, it could also be sarcastic.  Originally, chain letters were letters one received in the mail. Today, chain letters are often sent via email messages, postings on [[social network service|social network sites]], and text messages.

There are two main types of chain letters:

# Hoaxes – Hoaxes attempt to trick or defraud users. A hoax could be malicious, instructing users to delete a file necessary to the operating system by claiming it is a virus. It could also be a scam that convinces users to spread the letter to other people for a specific reason, or send money or personal information. [[Phishing]] attacks could fall into this.
# Urban legends – [[Urban legend]]s are designed to be redistributed and usually warn users of a threat or claim to be notifying them of important or urgent information. Another common form are the emails that promise users monetary rewards for forwarding the message or suggest that they are signing something that will be submitted to a particular group. Urban legends usually have no negative effect aside from wasted time.

In the United States, chain letters that request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants (such as the infamous ''[[Make Money Fast]]'' scheme) are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Postal Inspection Service cites Ok
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1302.html 18 USC 1302] when it asserts the illegality of chain letters:&lt;br /&gt;[https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/investigations/MailFraud/fraudschemes/sweepstakesfraud/ChainLetters.aspx ''Chain letters are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508132454/https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/investigations/MailFraud/fraudschemes/sweepstakesfraud/ChainLetters.aspx |date=2012-05-08 }} illegal if they request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants, pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges and military bases have passed regulations stating that in the private mail of college students and military personnel, respectively, chain letters are not authorized and will be thrown out. However, it is often difficult to distinguish chain letters from genuine correspondence.

==Channels==

===Print===
[[File:Chain Letter.jpg|thumb|left|Printed Australian chain letter from 2006, with a [[Australian five-cent coin|five-cent coin]] taped to it as what it calls a "financial eye-catcher"]]

The oldest known channel for chain letters is written, or printed, on letters on paper. These might be exchanged hand-to-hand or distributed through the mail. One notorious early example was the "Prosperity Club" or "Send-a-Dime" letter. This letter started in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1935, based on an earlier luck letter. It soon swamped the Denver post office with hundreds of thousands of letters before spilling into [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and other cities.&lt;ref name="VanArsdale 1998"&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel W. |last=VanArsdale |title=Chain Letter Evolution |origyear=1998|year=2002 |url=http://www.silcom.com/~barnowl/chain-letter/evolution.html |accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chain letters take religious perspectives especially relating to Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Often these letters originate from [[photocopy]] centers, claiming to have originated from the [[Pope]], with the intent of persuading people to make copies of such letters. The content usually gives one or two examples of people, sometimes public figures who obeyed and were rewarded and others who disobeyed and suffered heavily, which may even include cases of deaths and of someone becoming a millionaire overnight.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} These types of letters will flourish for some days and will die out naturally, partly based on the economic realities of the people, and maybe many would also reason that if that was truly the original letter, then it cannot contain cases of people who had broken or continued the chain.

===Email===
Some email messages sent as chain letters may seem fairly harmless, for example, a grammar school student wishing to see how many people can receive his/her email for a science project, but can grow exponentially and be hard to stop. Messages sometimes include phony promises from companies or wealthy individuals (such as [[Bill Gates]]) promising a monetary reward to everyone who receives the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson |author2=David Mikkelson |title=Thousand Dollar Bill |work=Urban Legends Reference Pages |url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/billgate.asp |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be politically motivated, such as "Save the Scouts, forward this to as many friends as possible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson |author2=David Mikkelson |title=A Boy Scout Outing |work=Urban Legends Reference Pages |url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/boyscout.asp |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a concept that a popular TV or radio show may be forced off the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last= Mikkelson |author2=David Mikkelson |title=Petition to Ban Religious Broadcasting |work=Urban Legends Reference Pages |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/fcc.asp |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like the ''"Hawaiian Good Luck Totem"'' which has spread in thousands of forms, threaten users with bad luck if not forwarded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Newton (author)|Newton, Michael]] (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sAK6_W7lLkoC The encyclopedia of high-tech crime and crime-fighting]''. pp.144.&lt;/ref&gt;'''
There are many forms of chain email that threaten death or the taking of one's soul by telling tales of others' deaths, such as the Katu Lata Kulu chain email, stating that if it is not forwarded, the receivers of the message will be killed by the [[spirit]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Platforms like [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] can host chain letters playing with users' emotions. They may also be in the form of a warning, such as stories of escaped convicts et cetera which urge the reader to pass the message on. One chain letter distributed on MSN [[Hotmail]] began, "Hey it's Tara and John the directors of MSN"... and tells you that your account will be deleted if you don't send that message to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4778046.stm |title=Thousands fall for hotmail prank |accessdate=2008-05-27 |publisher=BBC News |date=8 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common form of email chain letter is the [[virus hoax]] and a form of [[cyberbullying]].

===Web communities===
Chain letters within social media platforms became widespread on [[Myspace]] (in the form of Myspace bulletins) and [[YouTube]] (in the form of video comments) as well as on [[Facebook]] through messages or applications. For instance, the chain post/email of [[Carmen Winstead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/winstead.asp |title=MySpace Ghost of Murdered Teen |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; supposedly about a girl from [[Indiana]] who was pushed down a sewage drain in a firedrill, states that, "if you do not repost/send this to 10 people, Carmen will find you and kill you." Chain letters are often coupled with intimidating [[hoax]]es or the promise of providing the sender with "secret" information once they have forwarded the message.

==Legality==
{{globalize|date=July 2014}}
A chain letter may qualify as a fraudulent activity, as in the case of a [[pyramid scheme]] which asks recipients to funnel money up the chain while requesting the letter be distributed to multiple new recipients.

The legality of chain letters comes into question when they attempt to funnel monetary value to a single recipient. When a chain letter suggests a game of chance or a lottery with an opportunity for financial gain it is considered fraudulent under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the [[Postal Lottery Statute]]. Chain letters that ask for items of minor value such as business cards or recipes are not covered by this law.

If pyramid scheme chain letters are sent through email it may constitute [[wire fraud]]. An email chain letter may contain [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or another type of [[computer virus]] which is covered under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) [18 U.S.C. Section 1030]. This law makes it illegal to distribute computer codes or place them in the stream of commerce if their intent is to cause damage or economic loss.

The '''''Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham''''' or '''''Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham''''', sometimes the '''''Evesham Chronicle''''', is a medieval chronicle written at and about [[Evesham Abbey]] in England.

==Contents and authorship==

It covers the history of the abbey from 714 to 1539, and the early sections from 714 to 1214 were probably mostly composed by [[Thomas of Marlborough]], who was abbot from 1230 to 1236. An unknown continuator brought the work down to 1418.&lt;ref name=Graves841&gt;Graves ''Bibliography'' p. 841&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest parts of the chronicle concern [[Egwin|St. Egwin]], and were probably written by a prior of the house, [[Dominic of Evesham|Dominic]], sometime before 1125.&lt;ref name=Monastic704&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 704–705&lt;/ref&gt; Egwin was a bishop of Worcester who died in 717.&lt;ref name=Graves841/&gt; Also included in the ''Chronicon'' is a narrative of the translation of the relics of [[St Odulph]], and the life of [[Wigstan of Mercia|St Wigstan]].&lt;ref name=Textsi47/&gt;

The historian R. R. Darlington felt that the account of Abbot [[Æthelwig]] that is part of the chronicle was not written by Thomas, and instead was written shortly after Æthelwig's death,&lt;ref name=Monastic704/&gt; which occurred in 1077&lt;ref name=Heads47&gt;Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; or 1078.&lt;ref name=Heads248&gt;Knowles ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] felt that the account of Æthelwig was written instead by Dominic, but concurred with Darlington that the section was not composed by Thomas.&lt;ref name=Monastic704/&gt; Yet another continuator extended the history of the abbots until 1539.&lt;ref name=Textsi47&gt;Mullins ''Texts and Calendars I'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing history==

The ''Chronicon'' has been printed a number of times, once in 1863 in the [[Rolls Series]], edited by [[William Dunn Macray]].&lt;ref name=Graves841/&gt; This edition, number 29 in the Rolls Series, is titled ''Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham, ad annum 1418'', but it includes the continuation until 1539.&lt;ref name=Textsi47/&gt; Extracts from the period 1035 to 1236 were edited by Liebermann in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. Another version, with the continuation down to 1539, was published in 1965 by the Vale of Evesham Historical Society.&lt;ref name=Graves841/&gt; A new edition with facing translation by Jane Sayers and Leslie Watkiss was published in 2003.

'''Commonplace books''' (or '''commonplaces''') are a way to compile [[knowledge]], usually by writing information into [[book]]s. Such books are essentially [[Scrapbooking|scrapbook]]s filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests. They became significant in [[Early Modern Europe]].

"Commonplace" is a [[Calque|translation]] of the [[Latin]] term ''locus communis'' (from Greek ''tópos koinós'', see [[literary topos]]) which means "a theme or argument of general application", such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as [[John Milton]]'s commonplace book. Scholars have expanded this usage to include any manuscript that collects material along a common theme by an individual.

Commonplace books are not [[Diary|diaries]] nor
[[Travel journal#Travelogues|travelogues]], with which they can be contrasted:
English Enlightenment philosopher [[John Locke]] wrote the 1706 book ''A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books'', "in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Commonplace books, it must be stressed, are not journals, which are chronological and introspective."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas A. Basbanes]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=o4K_KMO1DWUC&amp;pg=PA82 "Every Book Its Reader: The Power of the Printed Word to Stir the World"], Harper Perennial, 2006, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early eighteenth century they had become an information management device in which a note-taker stored quotations, observations and definitions.  They were even used by influential scientists.  [[Carl Linnaeus]], for instance, used commonplacing techniques to invent and arrange the nomenclature of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (which is the basis for the system used by scientists today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=M. D.|title=Tools for Reordering: Commonplacing and the Space of Words in Linnaeus's Philosophia Botanica|journal=Intellectual History Review|date=2010|volume=20|pages=227–252|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112087/Tools_for_Reordering_Commonplacing_and_the_Space_of_Words_in_Linnaeuss_Philosophia_Botanica_Intellectual_History_Review_20_2010_227-252|doi=10.1080/17496971003783773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Zibaldone===
[[File:Zibaldone di pensieri VI.djvu|thumb|right|''Zibaldone di pensieri'', written by the Italian [[poet]] [[Giacomo Leopardi]]]]
During the course of the 15th century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the [[zibaldone]] (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Armando Petrucci, ''Writers and Readers in Medieval Italy'', trans. Charles M. Radding (New Haven: Yale UP: 1995), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai|Giovanni Rucellai]], the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a "salad of many herbs."&lt;ref&gt;Dale V. Kent, ''Cosimo de' Medici and the Florentine Renaissance: The Patron's Oeuvre'' (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2000), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Zibaldone were always paper codices of small or medium format – never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, zibaldone often incorporate the author's sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first [[chancery minuscule]] and later [[mercantile minuscule]]) and contained what [[palaeographer]] [[Armando Petrucci]] describes as "an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts."&lt;ref&gt;Petrucci, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of [[gabelle tax]]es paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes and favourite quotations from [[Augustine]] and [[Virgil]] portrays a developing secular, literate culture.&lt;ref&gt;An example is the [http://www.metafilter.com/46800/Commonplace-books Zibaldone da Canal] merchant's manual held at the Beinecke Library, which dates from 1312 and contains hand-drawn diagrams of Venetian ships and descriptions of Venice's merchant culture.&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most popular of literary selections were the works of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]: the "Three Crowns" of the Florentine vernacular traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These collections have been used by modern scholars as a source for interpreting how merchants and artisans interacted with the literature and visual arts of the Florentine Renaissance.

The best-known zibaldone is [[Giacomo Leopardi]]'s nineteenth-century ''[[Zibaldone di pensieri]]''.

===English===

By the 17th century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Victoria|title=Recent Studies in Commonplace Books.|journal=English Literary Renaissance|date=2013|volume=43|issue=1|page=154|doi=10.1111/1475-6757.12005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/04/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book.html "The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The commonplace tradition in which [[Francis Bacon]] and [[John Milton]] were educated had its roots in the pedagogy of classical [[rhetoric]], and “commonplacing” persisted as a popular study technique until the early 20th century. Commonplace books were used by many key thinkers of the Enlightenment, with authors like the philosopher and theologian [[William Paley]] using them to write books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=M. D.|title=he Science and Rhetoric of Paley’s Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|date=2004|volume=18|pages=1–22|url=https://www.academia.edu/3667401/_The_Science_and_Rhetoric_of_Paley_s_Natural_Theology_Literature_and_Theology_18_2004_1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] were taught to keep commonplace books at [[Harvard University]] (their commonplace books survive in published form).  Commonplacing was particularly attractive to authors.  Some, such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Mark Twain]] kept messy reading notes that were intermixed with other quite various material; others, such as [[Thomas Hardy]], followed a more formal reading-notes method that mirrored the original [[Renaissance]] practice more closely. The older, "clearinghouse" function of the commonplace book, to condense and centralize useful and even "model" ideas and expressions, became less popular over time.

==Contemporary evaluations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

Many of these works are not seen to have literary value to modern editors. The value of such collections is the insights they offer into the tastes, interests, personalities and concerns of their individual compilers.

Keeping notebooks is a kind of tradition among authors.  Therefore, a commonplace book of literary memoranda may serve as a symbol to the keeper, of the keeper's literary identity (or something psychologically not far removed), quite apart from its obvious value as a written record. Authors frequently treat their notebooks as quasi-works, giving them elaborate titles, compiling them neatly from rough notes, recompiling still neater revisions of them later, and preserving them with a special devotion and care that seems out of proportion to their apparent function as working materials.

==Examples in manuscript==
*[[Zibaldone da Canal]] merchant's commonplace book (New Haven, CT, Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, MS 327)
*[[Robert Reynes of Acle]], Norfolk (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 407)].
*Richard Hill, a London grocer (Oxford, Balliol College, MS 354).
*Glastonbury Miscellany. (Trinity College, Cambridge, MS 0.9.38). Originally designed as an account book.
*[[Jean Miélot]], 15th-century Burgundian translator and author. His book is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], and the main sources for his verses, many written for court occasions.

==Published examples==
*[[Francis Bacon]], ''"The Promus of Formularies and Elegancies",'' Longman, Greens and Company, London, 1883. The Promus was a rough list of elegant and useful phrases gleaned from reading and conversation that Bacon used as a source book in writing and probably also as a promptbook for oral practice in public speaking.
*[[John Milton]], "Milton’s Commonplace Book," in ''John Milton:  Complete Prose Works'', gen. ed. Don M. Wolfe (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953).  Milton kept scholarly notes from his reading, complete with page citations to use in writing his tracts and poems.
*[[E.M. Forster]], "Commonplace Book," ed. Philip Gardner (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1985).
*[[W.H. Auden]], ''[[A Certain World]]'' (New York: The Viking Press, 1970).
*{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/h-p-lovecrafts-commonplace-book/|title=Commonplace Book|last=Lovecraft|first=H.P.| authorlink = H. P. Lovecraft|date=4 July 2011|work=H.P. Lovecraft's Commonplace Book|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=5 July 2011}} Transcribed by [[Bruce Sterling]].

==Literary references to commonplacing==
* [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], 1877:  "The habit of journalizing becomes a life-long lesson in the art of composition, an informal schooling for authorship. And were the process of preparing their works for publication faithfully detailed by distinguished writers, it would appear how large were their indebtedness to their diary and commonplaces. How carefully should we peruse Shakespeare's notes used in compiling his plays—what was his, what another's—showing how these were fashioned into the shapely whole we read, how Milton composed, Montaigne, Goethe: by what happy strokes of thought, flashes of wit, apt figures, fit quotations snatched from vast fields of learning, their rich pages were wrought forth! This were to give the keys of great authorship!"  Amos Bronson Alcott,'' Table-Talk of A. Bronson Alcott'' (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1877), p.&amp;nbsp;12.
* [[Virginia Woolf]], mid-20th century: "[L]et us take down one of those old notebooks which we have all, at one time or another, had a passion for beginning. Most of the pages are blank, it is true; but at the beginning we shall find a certain number very beautifully covered with a strikingly legible hand-writing. Here we have written down the names of great writers in their order of merit; here we have copied out fine passages from the classics; here are lists of books to be read; and here, most interesting of all, lists of books that have actually been read, as the reader testifies with some youthful vanity by a dash of red ink."  Virginia Woolf, "Hours in a Library," ''Granite and Rainbow: Essays by Virginia Woolf''  (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1958), p.&amp;nbsp;25.
* In [[Lemony Snicket]]'s ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' a number of characters including Klaus Baudelaire and the Quagmire triplets keep commonplace books.
* In [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]'', Count Almásy uses his copy of [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' as a commonplace book.
* In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, Holmes keeps numerous commonplace books, which he sometimes uses when doing research.  For example, in "[[The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger]]", he researches the newspaper reports of an old murder in a commonplace book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41183">'''Dominion theology''' (also known as '''dominionism''') is a group of [[Christian politics|Christian political]] ideologies that seek to institute a nation governed by [[Christians]] based on their personal [[Religious law#Christianity|understandings of biblical law]]. Extents of rule and ways of achieving governing authority are varied. For example, dominion theology can include [[theonomy]], but does not necessarily involve advocating [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] as the basis of government. The label is applied primarily toward groups of [[Christianity in the United States|Christians in the United States]].

Prominent adherents of these ideologies are otherwise theologically diverse, including [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Christian reconstructionism]], [[Roman Catholic]]
[[Catholic Integralism|Integralism]], [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatic]]/[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Kingdom Now theology]], [[New Apostolic Reformation]], and others. Most of the contemporary movements labeled dominion theology arose in the 1970s from religious movements asserting aspects of [[Christian nationalism]].

Some have applied the term ''dominionist'' more broadly to the whole [[Christian right]]. This usage is controversial. There are concerns from members of these communities that this is a [[label (sociology)|label]] being used to [[Social exclusion|marginalize]] Christians from [[public discourse]]. Others{{who|date=November 2018}} argue this allegation can be difficult to sympathize with considering the political power already held by these groups and on account of the often verbally blatant intention of these groups to influence the political, social, financial, and cultural spectrums of society for a specific religion, often at the expense of other marginalized groups.

== Etymology ==
Dominion theology is a reference to the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]'s rendering of [[Genesis 1:28]], the passage in which God grants humanity "dominion" over the Earth.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And God blessed them, and God said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1980s, several prominent evangelical authors&lt;ref name=Hunt88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dager90/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsey90/&gt;&lt;ref name=IceHouse88/&gt; used the phrase ''dominion theology'' (and other terms such as ''dominionism'') to label a loose grouping of theological movements that made direct appeals to this passage in Genesis.&lt;ref name="McVicar 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McVicar|first=Michael J.|title='Let them have Dominion:' 'Dominion Theology' and the Construction of Religious Extremism in the US Media|journal=[[Journal of Religion and Popular Culture]]|year=2013|volume=25|issue=1|pages=120–145|doi=10.3138/jrpc.25.1.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians typically interpret this passage as meaning that [[God in Christianity|God]] gave mankind responsibility over the [[Earth]], but one of the distinctive aspects of Dominion Theology is that it is interpreted as a mandate for Christian stewardship in civil affairs, no less than in other human matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vlas, Natalia|author2= Vasile Borari|title=Religion and Politics in the 21st Century: Global and Local Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8swBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=6 December 2017|date=26 July 2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-5076-6|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
=== Christian reconstructionism ===
{{Main article|Christian reconstructionism}}
An example of dominionism in reformed theology is [[Christian reconstructionism]], which originated with the teachings of [[R. J. Rushdoony]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/01/5-facts-about-dominionism_n_945601.html|title=5 Facts About Dominionism|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rushdoony's theology focuses on [[theonomy]] (the rule of the Law of God), a belief that all of society should be ordered according to the laws that governed the [[Israelite]]s in the [[Old Testament]].  His system is strongly [[Calvinistic]], emphasizing the sovereignty of God over human freedom and action, and denying the operation of [[spiritual gifts|charismatic gifts]] in the present day ([[cessationism]]); both of these aspects are in direct opposition to Kingdom Now Theology.

Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among most Christians.&lt;ref name = "Martin1996a"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Martin|first = William|year = 1996|title = With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America|location = New York|publisher = Broadway Books}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Diamond1998p213"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Diamond|first = Sara|year = 1998|title = Not by Politics Alone: The Enduring Influence of the Christian Right| location = New York|publisher = Guilford Press|page = 213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OrtizKennedy"&gt;{{cite web|last = Ortiz|first = Chris|year = 2007|url = http://www.chalcedon.edu/blog/2007_09_01_archive.php#3737641030821242405|title = Gary North on D.

=== Integralism ===
[[Catholic Integralism]] has been characterized as a form of dominionist theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/why-should-we-read-spadaro-%E2%80%98catholic-integralism%E2%80%99|title=Why Should We Read Spadaro on ‘Catholic Integralism’? |last=Faggioli|first=Massimo|date=18 July 2017|publisher=[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]|language=English|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Spadaro]] and Marcelo Figueroa have stated that Catholic Integralists have entered into a non-traditional [[ecumenical]] alliance with Protestant reconstructionists who share "the same desire for religious influence in the political sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laciviltacattolica.it/articolo/evangelical-fundamentalism-and-catholic-integralism-in-the-usa-a-surprising-ecumenism/|title=Evangelical Fundamentalism and Catholic Integralism in the USA: A surprising ecumenism |last1=Spadaro|first1=Antonio|last2=Figueroa|first2=Marcelo|year=2017|publisher=[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]|language=English|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2017/strip-religious-garb-fundamentalist-tones-from-us-political-power.cfm|title=Journal: Strip religious garb, fundamentalist tones from political power|last=Glatz|first=Carol|date=13 July 2017|publisher=[[Catholic News Service]]|language=English|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', Joshua J. McElwee stated that Catholic Integralists, along with their Protestant counterparts, wish to achieve the goal of establishing a "theocratic type of state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/italian-jesuit-magazine-criticizes-political-attitudes-some-us-catholics|title=Italian Jesuit magazine criticizes political attitudes of some US Catholics|last=McElwee|first=Joshua J.|date=13 July 2017|publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|language=English|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kingdom Now theology ===
Kingdom Now theology is a branch of Dominion Theology  which has had a following within [[Pentecostalism]]. It attracted attention in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Gordon|title=Kingdom now theology : a look at its roots and branches|journal=Paraclete|date=Summer 1990|volume=24|issue=3|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=William A|title=Kingdom Now : New Hope or New Heresy|journal=Eastern Journal of Practical Theology|date=Spring 1988|volume=2|pages=6–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingdom Now theology states that although [[Satan]] has been in control of the world since the [[Fall of Man|Fall]], God is looking for people who will help him take back dominion. Those who yield themselves to the authority of God's apostles and prophets will take control of the kingdoms of this world, being defined as all social institutions, the "kingdom" of education, the "kingdom" of science, the "kingdom" of the arts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Examination of Kingdom Theology|url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/l04.html|publisher=Apologetics Index|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[C. Peter Wagner]], the founder of the [[New Apostolic Reformation]], writes: "The practical theology that best builds a foundation under social transformation is dominion theology, sometimes called 'Kingdom Now'. Its history can be traced back through [[Rousas John Rushdoony|R. J. Rushdoony]] and [[Abraham Kuyper]] to [[John Calvin]]."&lt;ref name = "Wagner2008"&gt;{{Cite book|last =Wagner|first =C. Peter|title =Dominion!: How Kingdom Action Can Change the World|publisher = Chosen Books|location = Grand Rapids, MI|year = 2008|page = 59|isbn = 0-8007-9435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingdom Now theology is influenced by the [[Latter Rain (post–World War II movement)|Latter Rain]] movement,&lt;ref name=Steinkamp /&gt; and critics have connected it to the [[New Apostolic Reformation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Marsha|title=Damnable Heresies Invading the Church|url=http://www.conservativecrusader.com/articles/damnable-heresies-invading-the-church|publisher=Conservative Crusader|accessdate=6 November 2010|date=25 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120231510/http://conservativecrusader.com/articles/damnable-heresies-invading-the-church|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Spiritual warfare|Spiritual Warfare Christianity]],"&lt;ref name=Steinkamp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinkamp|first=Orrel|title=The "Script" Underlying Spiritual Warfare Christianity |journal=The Plumbline|date=November–December 2003 |volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/orrel15.html|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fivefold ministry]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Robert M.|title=The Faulty Foundation of the Five-Fold Ministry|journal=[[Christian Research Institute|Christian Research Journal]]|date=Fall 1987|url=http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0009a.html|page=31|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingdom Now theology should not be confused with [[Kingdom theology]], which is related to [[inaugurated eschatology]].

== Dominionism and the Christian right ==
In the late 1980s sociologist [[Sara Diamond]]&lt;ref name = "Diamond1989a"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Diamond|first = Sara|year = 1989 | title = Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right|location = Boston|publisher = South End Press}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Diamond1995a"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Diamond|first = Sara|year = 1995|title = Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States|location = New York|page=246|publisher = Guilford Press|isbn = 0-89862-864-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; began writing about the intersection of dominion theology with the political activists of the [[Christian right]]. Diamond argued that "the primary importance of the [Christian reconstructionist] ideology is its role as a catalyst for what is loosely called 'dominion theology'". According to Diamond, "Largely through the impact of Rushdoony's and North's writings, the concept that Christians are Biblically mandated to 'occupy' all secular institutions has become the ''central unifying ideology'' for the Christian Right"&lt;ref name="Diamond1989a" /&gt;{{rp|138}}&lt;small&gt; (emphasis in original)&lt;/small&gt; in the United States.

While acknowledging the small number of actual adherents, authors such as Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have argued that postmillennial Christian reconstructionism played a major role in pushing the primarily premillennial Christian right to adopt a more aggressive dominionist stance.&lt;ref name="diamond1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Sara|author-link=Sara Diamond|title=Dominion Theology|journal=[[Z Magazine]]|date=February 1995|url=http://www.publiceye.org/diamond/sd_domin.html|accessdate=24 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515193703/http://www.publiceye.org/diamond/sd_domin.html|archivedate=15 May 2013|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misztal and Shupe concur that "Reconstructionists have many more sympathizers who fall somewhere within the dominionist framework, but who are not card-carrying members".&lt;ref name=" Misztal-Shupe-1992 "&gt;Bruce Barron and Anson Shupe, 1992, "Reasons for the Growing Popularity of Christian Reconstructionism: The Determination to Attain Dominion", in Bronislaw Misztal and Anson D. Shupe, eds. ''Religion and politics in comparative perspective: revival of religious fundamentalism in East and West.'' Westport, Conn: Praeger, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diamond, "Reconstructionism is the most intellectually grounded, though esoteric, brand of dominion theology".&lt;ref name="diamond1995"/&gt;

Journalist [[Frederick Clarkson]]&lt;ref name = "Clarkson1994a"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clarkson|first = Frederick|date=March–June 1994|url = http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisrec.html|title = Christian Reconstructionism: Theocratic Dominionism Gains Influence | publisher = [[Political Research Associates]]|journal = The Public Eye|volume = 8|issue = 1 &amp; 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clarkson1997a"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Clarkson|first = Frederick|year = 1997|title = Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy|location = Monroe, Maine|publisher = Common Courage|isbn = 1-56751-088-4}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
defined ''dominionism'' as a movement that, while including dominion theology and reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian right in the United States.

In his 1992 study of dominion theology and its influence on the Christian right, Bruce Barron writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the context of American evangelical efforts to penetrate and transform public life, the distinguishing mark of a dominionist is a commitment to defining and carrying out an approach to building society that is ''self-consciously defined as exclusively Christian,'' and dependent specifically on the work of Christians, rather than based on a broader consensus.&lt;ref name="Barron1992ap14"&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Barron |first=Bruce A. |title=Heaven on earth?: the social &amp; political agendas of dominion theology|publisher = Zondervan|location = Grand Rapids, Mich|year = 1992|page = 14|isbn = 0-310-53611-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1995, Diamond called the influence of dominion theology "prevalent on the Christian Right".&lt;ref name="Diamond1995b"&gt;Diamond, Sara. 1995. "[http://zena.secureforum.com/Znet/ZMag/articles/feb95diamond.htm Dominion Theology]." ''Z Magazine,'' February 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Chip Berlet]] added in 1998 that, although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists assert a Christian duty to take "control of a sinful secular society".&lt;ref name="Berlet1998a"&gt;Chip Berlet, "Following the Threads," in Ansell, Amy E. ''Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics,'' pp. 24,  Westview Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8133-3147-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Clarkson enumerated the following characteristics shared by all forms of dominionism:&lt;ref name="Clarkson2005a"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Clarkson |first= Frederick |authorlink= Frederick Clarkson |title= The Rise of Dominionism: Remaking America as a Christian Nation |journal= [[Political Research Associates|The Public Eye]] |date= Winter 2005 |volume=  19 |issue=  3 |url= http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v19n3/clarkson_dominionism.html |accessdate= 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Dominionists celebrate Christian nationalism, in that they believe that the United States once was, and should once again be, a Christian nation. In this way, they deny the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] roots of American democracy.
#Dominionists promote religious supremacy, insofar as they generally do not respect the equality of other religions, or even other versions of Christianity.
#Dominionists endorse theocratic visions, insofar as they believe that the Ten Commandments, or "biblical law," should be the foundation of American law, and that the U.S. Constitution should be seen as a vehicle for implementing Biblical principles.&lt;ref name="Clarkson2005a"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Retrieved May 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have applied the term to a broader spectrum of people than have Diamond, Clarkson, and Berlet.

Sarah Posner in ''Salon'' argues that there are various "iterations of dominionism that call on Christians to enter ... government, law, media and so forth ... so that they are controlled by Christians". According to Posner, "Christian right figures promoted dominionism ... and the GOP courted ... religious leaders for the votes of their followers".

{{quote|Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a commission, a holy responsibility to reclaim the land for Jesus Christ—to have dominion in civil structures, just as in every other aspect of life and godliness. ... But it is dominion we are after. Not just a voice. ... Christian politics has as its primary intent the conquest of the land—of men, families, institutions, bureaucracies, courts, and governments for the Kingdom of Christ.}}

=== A spectrum of dominionism ===

Writers including [[Chip Berlet]]&lt;ref name="Berlet2005b"&gt;Chip Berlet [http://www.publiceye.org/feeds/public/berlet/2005/12/christian-right-dominionism-and.html The Christian Right, Dominionism, and Theocracy: Part Two] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211115900/http://www.publiceye.org/feeds/public/berlet/2005/12/christian-right-dominionism-and.html |date=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Frederick Clarkson&lt;ref name="Clarkson2005a"/&gt; distinguish between what they term "hard" and "soft" dominionism. Such commentators define "soft" dominionism as the belief that "America is a Christian nation" and [[State religion|opposition]] to [[separation of church and state]], while "hard" dominionism refers to dominion theology and Christian reconstructionism.

Michelle Goldberg uses the terms ''Christian nationalism'' and ''dominionism'' for the former view.&lt;ref name = "Goldberg2006a"/&gt; According to Goldberg:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In many ways, Dominionism is more a political phenomenon than a theological one. It cuts across Christian denominations, from stern, austere sects to the signs-and-wonders culture of modern megachurches. Think of it like political Islamism, which shapes the activism of a number of antagonistic fundamentalist movements, from Sunni Wahabis in the Arab world to Shiite fundamentalists in Iran.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2011b"&gt;Michelle Goldberg, "A Christian Plot for Domination?" ''The Daily Beast,'' August 14, 2011, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/14/dominionism-michele-bachmann-and-rick-perry-s-dangerous-religious-bond.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berlet and Clarkson have agreed that "[s]oft Dominionists are Christian nationalists".&lt;ref name = "Berlet2005b"/&gt; Unlike "dominionism", the phrase "Christian nation" occurs commonly in the writings of [[leadership|leader]]s of the Christian right. Proponents of this idea (such as [[David Barton (author)|David Barton]] and [[D. James Kennedy]]) argue that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were overwhelmingly Christian, that founding documents such as the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] are based on Christian principles, and that a Christian character is fundamental to American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, David 1993. ''America's Godly Heritage.'' WallBuilder Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. James and Jim Nelson Black 1994. ''Character and Destiny: A Nation in Search of Its Soul''. Zondervan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. James and Jerry Newcombe 2003. ''What If America Were a Christian Nation Again?'' Thomas Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite, for example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s comment in 1892 that "this [the United States] is a Christian nation",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States]],'' 143 U.S. 457, 12 S.Ct. 511, 36 L.Ed. 226, 29 February 1892&lt;/ref&gt; after citing numerous historical and legal arguments in support of that statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coralridge.org/TTT/ActionSheets/1128Kennedy.html|title=Christian Roots of America|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704191400/http://www.coralridge.org/TTT/ActionSheets/1128Kennedy.html|archivedate=4 July 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. D.

Kennedy characterized his perspective on Christian political involvement as more akin to participatory democracy than to dominionism. In an interview with [[NPR]]'s [[Terry Gross]], Kennedy was asked whether he wanted all public office holders to be Christians. Kennedy answered, "We have people who are [[secular]] and [[Humanism|humanist]] and unbelievers who are constantly supporting in every way possible other people who share those views. And I don't object to that. That's their privilege. And I think that Christians should be allowed the same privilege to vote for people whom they believe share their views about life and government. And that's all I'm talking about."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4656600|title=Closing the Gap Between Church and State|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of the usage of the term ''dominionism'' ===
Those labelled dominionists rarely use the terms ''dominionist'' and ''dominionism'' for self-description, and some people have attacked the use of such words.&lt;ref name="McVicar 2013"/&gt; Journalist and conservative comentator Anthony Williams, writing for [[Frontpage Magazine]], charged that such usage aims "to smear the Republican Party as the party of domestic Theocracy, facts be damned".&lt;ref name="Williams2005a"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=17957|archive-url = https://archive.is/20121209013424/http://www.frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=17957|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2012-12-09|title = "Dominionist" Fantasies|author = Anthony Williams|date = 2005-05-04|journal = FrontPage Magazine|accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and conservative commentator [[Stanley Kurtz]], writing for the [[National Review]], labeled it "conspiratorial nonsense", "political paranoia", and "[[association fallacy|guilt by association]]",&lt;ref name="Kurtz2005b"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp|title = Dominionist Domination: The Left runs with a wild theory|author = Stanley Kurtz|date = 2005-05-02| journal = [[National Review|National Review Online]]|accessdate = 2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decried Hedges' "vague characterizations" that allow him to "paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless 'Dominionist' Christian mass".&lt;ref name = "Kurtz2005a"&gt;
{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200504280758.asp|title = Scary Stuff|author = Stanley Kurtz|date = 2005-04-28|journal = [[National Review|National Review Online]]|accessdate = 2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and [[extremism]] such as [[Christian reconstructionism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule by genocide is not just crazy, it's downright dangerous. The most disturbing part of the ''Harper's'' cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and [[fascism]]. Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside 'the old polite rules of democracy.' So wild conspiracy theories and visions of genocide are really excuses for the Left to disregard the rules of democracy and defeat conservative Christians—by any means necessary.&lt;ref name = "Kurtz2005b"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joe Carter of ''[[First Things]]'' writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]here is no "school of thought" known as "dominionism." The term was coined in the 1980s by Diamond and is never used outside liberal blogs and websites. No reputable scholars use the term for it is a meaningless neologism that Diamond concocted for her dissertation.&lt;ref name="Carter11"&gt;Carter, Joe, 2011. [http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2011/08/a-journalism-lesson-for-the-new-yorker A Journalism Lesson for the New Yorker]. ''[[First Things]].''  Published 10 August 2011.  Retrieved 19 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diamond has denied that she coined the broader sense of the term ''dominionism'',&lt;ref&gt;Chip Berlet, 2011, "How We Coined the Term 'Dominionism'" Talk to Action, August 31, [http://www.talk2action.org/story/2011/8/31/17047/5683/]&lt;/ref&gt; which appears in her dissertation and in ''Roads to Dominion'' solely to describe Dominion Theology.  Nevertheless, Diamond did originate the idea that Dominion Theology is the "central unifying ideology for the Christian Right".&lt;ref name="Diamond1989a" /&gt;{{rp|138}}

Jeremy Pierce of ''[[First Things]]'' coined the word ''dominionismist'' to describe those who promote the idea that there is a dominionist conspiracy, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It strikes me as irresponsible to lump [Rushdoony] together with Francis Schaeffer and those influenced by him, especially given Schaeffer's many recorded instances of resisting exactly the kinds of views Rushdoony developed. Indeed, it strikes me as an error of the magnitude of some of Rushdoony's own historical nonsense to consider there to be such a view called Dominionism [sic] that Rushdoony, Schaeffer, James Dobson, and all the other people in the list somehow share and that it seeks to get Christians and only Christians into all the influential positions in secular society.&lt;ref name="Pierce11"&gt;Pierce, Jeremy, 2011. [http://firstthings.com/blogs/evangel/2011/08/dominionismists/ Dominionismists]. ''[[First Things]].''  Published 14 August 2011.  Retrieved 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' writes that {{"'}}dominionism' is the paranoid ''[[wikt:mot du jour|mot du jour]]''" and that "certain journalists use 'dominionist' the way some folks on [[Fox News]] use the word ''[[sharia]]''. Its strangeness scares people. Without history or context, the word creates a [[siege mentality]] in which [[Ingroups and outgroups|'we' need to guard against 'them']]."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lisa, 2011. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/dominionism-beliefs-among-conservative-christians-overblown/2011/08/17/gIQAb5eaNJ_print.html {{"'}}Dominionism' beliefs among conservative Christians overblown."] ''[[Newsweek]].'' Published 18 August 2011. Retrieved 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ross Douthat]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "many of the people that writers like Diamond and others describe as 'dominionists' would disavow the label, many definitions of dominionism conflate several very different Christian political theologies, and there's a lively debate about whether the term is even useful at all."&lt;ref name="Douthat11b"&gt;Douthat, Ross 2011.

Retrieved 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticism has focused on the proper use of the term. Berlet wrote that "just because some critics of the Christian Right have stretched the term dominionism past its breaking point does not mean we should abandon the term",&lt;ref name="Berlet2005a"&gt;Berlet, Chip, 2005. [http://www.publiceye.org/feeds/public/berlet/2005/11/christian-right-dominionism-and.html The Christian Right, Dominionism, and Theocracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918061837/http://www.publiceye.org/feeds/public/berlet/2005/11/christian-right-dominionism-and.html |date=September 18, 2008 }}. Retrieved 25 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that, rather than labeling conservatives as extremists, it would be better to "talk to these people" and "engage them".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Henican, [http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/Conference/SpiritualOliveBranchChipBerlet_Newsday.html "A spiritual olive branch for the far-right faithful"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006070752/http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/Conference/SpiritualOliveBranchChipBerlet_Newsday.html |date=2008-10-06 }}. ''Newsday,'' May 1, 2005. Reposted at YuricaReport.com. Retrieved 23 September 2006
&lt;/ref&gt; Sara Diamond wrote that "[l]iberals' writing about the Christian Right's take-over plans has generally taken the form of conspiracy theory", and argued that instead one should "analyze the subtle ways" that ideas like Dominionism "take hold within movements and why".&lt;ref name = "Diamond1995b"/&gt;  Authors Robert Gagnon and Edith Humphrey argued strongly against the use of the term in reference to US presidential candidate [[Ted Cruz]] in a 2016 op-ed for ''[[Christianity Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/april-web-only/stop-calling-ted-cruz-dominionist.html|title=Stop Calling Ted Cruz a Dominionist|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}''' ([[Latin]] for "British Encyclopaedia"), published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], is a [[general knowledge]] [[English-language]] [[encyclopedia|encyclopaedia]]. It is written by about 100&amp;nbsp;full-time editors and more than 4,000&amp;nbsp;contributors. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes&lt;ref name="nytstop" /&gt; and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition; digital content and distribution has continued since then.

The ''Britannica'' is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia/encyclopedia still in production. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] capital of [[Edinburgh]], as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th editions]] (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the ''Britannica'' shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the [[North America]]n market. In 1933, the ''Britannica'' became the first encyclopaedia to adopt "continuous revision", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.

The 15th edition has a three-part structure: a 12-volume {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} of short articles (generally fewer than 750&amp;nbsp;words), a 17-volume {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}} of long articles (two to 310&amp;nbsp;pages), and a single {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}} volume to give a [[hierarchical]] outline of knowledge. The {{lang|la|Micropædia}} is meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the {{lang|la|Macropædia}}; readers are advised to study the {{lang|la|Propædia}} outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the ''Britannica'' has remained steady, with about 40&amp;nbsp;million words on half a million topics. Though published in the [[United States]] since 1901, the ''Britannica'' has for the most part maintained [[American and British English spelling differences|British English spelling]].

The ''Britannica'''s articles are found in the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}, which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 {{lang|la|Macropædia}} has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 {{lang|la|Micropædia}} has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors.&lt;ref name="library_association_1996" /&gt; The {{lang|la|Micropædia}} articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the {{lang|la|Macropædia}}. The {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states. The 2013 edition of ''Britannica'' contained approximately forty thousand articles.&lt;ref name="store.britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100 |title=Britannica Global Edition |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705002524/http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100 |archive-date=5 July 2014 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica Store }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information can be found in the ''Britannica'' by following the cross-references in the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page.&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the {{lang|la|Propædia}}, which organizes the ''Britannica''{{'s}} contents by topic.&lt;ref name="index_preface"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, ''Index'' preface| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the {{lang|la|Propædia}} is its "Outline of Knowledge", which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge.&lt;ref name="propedia_preface" /&gt; Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the ''Britannica'''s editors to decide which articles should be included in the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}.&lt;ref name="propedia_preface" /&gt; The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of ''Britannica'' articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth.&lt;ref name="propedia_preface" /&gt; However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia.&lt;ref name="library_association_1992"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1992 | title = Purchasing an Encyclopedia: 12 Points to Consider | edition = 4th | publisher = [[Booklist]] Publications, [[American Library Association]] | isbn = 978-0-8389-5754-7 | author = reviews by the Editorial Board of Reference Books Bulletin ; revised introduction by Sandy Whiteley.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|la|Propædia}} also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.

Taken together, the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}} comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images.&lt;ref name="index_preface" /&gt; The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the ''Britannica'', together with 474,675 subentries under those topics.&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; The ''Britannica'' generally prefers [[British English|British spelling]] over [[American English|American]];&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; for example, it uses ''colour'' (not ''color''), ''centre'' (not ''center''), and ''encyclopaedia'' (not ''encyclopedia''). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as ''defense'' rather than ''defence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Defense mechanism | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 3 | pages = 957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as "Color: ''see'' Colour."

Since 1936, the articles of the ''Britannica'' have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year.&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia_1954" /&gt; According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eb.com/library/print/eb.html |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: School &amp; Library Site, promotional materials for the 2007 ''Britannica'' |accessdate=11 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322035443/http://www.eb.com/library/print/eb.html |archivedate=22 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com.au/product.asp?prod=HLMPKG07 |title=Australian Encyclopædia Britannica, promotional materials for the 2007 ''Britannica'' |accessdate=10 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830124610/http://www.britannica.com.au/product.asp?prod=HLMPKG07 |archivedate=30 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabetization of articles in the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}} follows strict rules.&lt;ref name="micropedia_preface"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|Micropædia}} preface| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diacritic]]al marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as "[[War of 1812|1812, War of]]" are alphabetized as if the number had been written out ("Eighteen-twelve, War of"). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, [[Charles the Simple|Charles III]] of France precedes [[Charles I of England]], listed in ''Britannica'' as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were "Charles, France, 3" and "Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1".) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.

In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2012/03/change/|title=Change: It's OK.

On June 7, 2018, Britannica released a [[Google Chrome extension]], Britannica Insights, which shows snippets of information from Britannica Online in a sidebar for [[Google Search|Google search]] results.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17437816/google-britannica-insights-search-encyclopedia|title=Encyclopedia Britannica’s new Chrome extension is a simple fix to Google misinformation|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Britannica sidebar does not replace Google's sidebar and is instead placed above Google's sidebar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personnel and management ==
=== Contributors ===
The 2007 print version of the ''Britannica'' has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist [[Milton Friedman]], astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], and surgeon [[Michael DeBakey]].&lt;ref name="macropaedia_contributors"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 531–674| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 ([[Alfred North Whitehead]]), while another quarter are retired or [[emeritus]]. Most (approximately 98%{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is [[Christine Sutton]] of the [[University of Oxford]], who contributed 24 articles on [[particle physics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

While ''Britannica'''s authors have included writers such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marie Curie]], and [[Leon Trotsky]], as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as [[Isaac Asimov]], some have been criticized for lack of expertise.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In 1911 the historian [[George Lincoln Burr|George L. Burr]] wrote:

{{quote|With a temerity almost appalling, [the ''Britannica'' contributor, Mr. Philips] ranges over nearly the whole field of European history, political, social, ecclesiastical... The grievance is that &amp;#91;this work&amp;#93; lacks authority. This, too—this reliance on editorial energy instead of on ripe special learning—may, alas, be also counted an "Americanizing": for certainly nothing has so cheapened the scholarship of our American encyclopaedias.&lt;ref name="burr_1911"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Burr | first = George L. | authorlink = George Lincoln Burr | year = 1911 | title = The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 17 | pages = 103–109 | doi = 10.2307/1832843 | issue = 1 | jstor = 1832843}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{as of|2007}} in the fifteenth edition of ''Britannica'', [[Dale Hoiberg]], a [[sinology|sinologist]], was listed as ''Britannica's'' Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name="propedia_staff"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| page = 745| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were [[Hugh Chisholm]] (1902–1924), [[James Louis Garvin]] (1926–1932), [[Franklin Henry Hooper]] (1932–1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764506,00.html |title=Milestones, Aug. 26, 1940 |publisher=Time.com |date=26 Aug 1940 |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Yust]] (1938–1960), [[Harry Ashmore]] (1960–1963), [[Warren E. Preece]] (1964–1968, 1969–1975), Sir [[William Haley]] (1968–1969), [[Philip W.

Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz.

Paul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of Treasurer, Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armstrong |work=Chicago Tribune |date=20 Jan 2001 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/keyword/encyclopedia-britannica |access-date=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 editorial staff of the ''Britannica'' included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by [[Dale Hoiberg]] and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} and some sections of the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}.&lt;ref name="EB_biochemistry"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Biochemical Components of Organisms | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc]] | year = 2007 | volume = 14 | pages = 1007–1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation and publication of the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} required trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}, the staff were organized into ten departments:&lt;ref name="propedia"&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2007 |title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |journal=Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc |edition=15th edition, {{lang|la|Propædia}}|bibcode=1991neb..book.....G |last1=Goetz |first1=Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Editorial staff (19 editors and 1 executive assistant)
# Art and Cartography (9 employees)
# Compositional Technology and Design (4 employees)
# Copy Department (12 employees)
# Editorial and Publishing Technologies (5 employees)
# Information Management (9 employees)
# Media Asset Management and Production Control (4 employees)
# Reference Librarians (3 employees)
# World Data (5 employees)
# Manufacturing (1 employee)

Some of these departments were organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]. For example, the copy editors were divided into 4 copy editors, 2 senior copy editors, 4 supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department was headed by [[Dale Hoiberg]] and assisted by four others; they oversaw the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant.

=== Editorial advisors ===
The ''Britannica'' has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars:&lt;ref name="propedia_editorial advisors"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| page = 5| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Board of Editors |work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-fiction author [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]], religion scholar [[Wendy Doniger]], political economist [[Benjamin M. Friedman]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]] President Emeritus [[Leslie H. Gelb]], computer scientist [[David Gelernter]], Physics Nobel laureate [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] President [[Vartan Gregorian]], philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]], cognitive scientist [[Donald Norman]], musicologist [[Don Michael Randel]], [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood]], President of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and cultural anthropologist [[Michael Wesch]].

The {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}} and its ''Outline of Knowledge'' were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of [[Mortimer J. Adler]].&lt;ref name="propedia_other_editorial_advisors"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 524–530| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects — [[Rene Dubos]] (d. 1982), [[Loren Eiseley]] (d. 1977), [[Harold D. Lasswell]] (d. 1978), [[Mark Van Doren]] (d. 1972), [[Peter Ritchie Calder]] (d. 1982) and [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (d. 2001). The {{lang|la|Propædia}} also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} articles.&lt;ref name="micropaedia_consultants"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 675–744| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate structure ===
In January 1996, the ''Britannica'' was purchased from the [[Benton Foundation]] by billionaire Swiss financier [[Jacqui Safra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960104/britannica.shtml | title = Britannica sold by Benton Foundation | publisher = University of Chicago Chronicle | date = 4 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, [[Don Yannias]], a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html | title = Encyclopædia Britannica Announces Appointment Of Don Yannias As Chief Executive Officer | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 4 March 1997 | accessdate =15 March 2012|archivedate=9 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709103523/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a new company, [[Britannica.com Inc.]], was [[corporate spin-off|created]] to develop digital versions of the ''Britannica''; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Abramson |first=Ronna |date=9 April 2001 |title=Look Under "M" for Mess—Company Business and Marketing |magazine=The Industry Standard |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 |accessdate=26 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013183837/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Yannias was replaced by [[Ilan Yeshua]], who reunited the leadership of the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Ilan Yeshua Named Britannica CEO. Veteran Executive to Consolidate Operations of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica.com | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 16 May 2001 | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the ''Britannica''′s Board of Directors.

In 2003, former management consultant [[Jorge Aguilar-Cauz]] was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the ''Britannica's'' Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the ''Britannica'' brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="propedia_Chair_President"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| page = 2| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties, and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''Britannica'' management has eliminated employee [[401(k)]] accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the ''Britannica'' staff have gone years without pay rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cash-shy Britannica |page=6 |work=New York Post |date=11 September 2003 |url=http://www.pagesix.com/story/cash-shy+britannica |accessdate=26 March 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2017, publishing executive Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclopaedia Britannica Group. Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high-level positions in digital media, including RELX (Reed Elsevier, FT SE 100) and Rodale, in which he was responsible for “driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/encyclopaedia-britannica-group-appoints-karthik-krishnan-as-global-chief-executive-officer-300570318.html|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica Group Appoints Karthik Krishnan as Global Chief Executive Officer|last=Group|first=Encyclopaedia Britannica|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its 250&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K-12 schools, Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year.

First was Britannica Insights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-encyclopedia-britannica-fact-check-plug-in-20180608-story.html|title=Google results aren't always accurate. Encyclopaedia Britannica's new Chrome extension could help.|last=Marotti|first=Ally|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a free, downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited, fact-checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Its purpose, the company said, was to “provide trusted, verified information” in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and “fake news.”

The product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights, which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica’s online classroom solutions, and a partnership with YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/brandon-weber/new-to-youtube-a-fact-checking-collaboration-with-wikipedia-encyclopedia-brittanica|title=YouTube now displays facts below conspiracy theory videos|date=2018-08-08|work=Big Think|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user-generated video content that could be false or misleading.   

Krishnan, [http://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/karthik-krishnan himself an educator] at New York University’s Stern School of Business, believes in the “transformative power of education”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/karthik-krishnan|title=NYU Stern - Karthik Krishnan - Adjunct Assistant Professor|website=www.stern.nyu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set steering the company toward solidifying its place among leaders in educational technology and supplemental curriculum. Krishnan aimed at providing more useful and relevant solutions to customer needs, extending and renewing Britannica’s historical emphasis on “Utility,” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiaoutlookmag.com/news/exclusive-interview-encyclopdia-britannica-ceo-karthik-krishnan?topStory|title=Exclusive Interview: Encyclopædia Britannica CEO Karthik Krishnan {{!}}  Asia Outlook Magazine|website=Asia Outlook Magazine|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;which had been the watchword of its first edition in 1768.

Krishnan also is active in civic affairs, with organizations such as the Urban Enterprise Initiative and Urban Upbound, whose board he serves on.

== Competition ==
As the ''Britannica'' is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]]'' or the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the ''Britannica'''s main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of [[Ephraim Chambers]] and, soon thereafter, ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopædia Metropolitana]]''. In the 20th century, successful competitors included ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'', the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', and the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the ''Britannica'' was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia,&lt;ref name="thomas_1992" /&gt; especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; The print version of the ''Britannica'' was significantly more expensive than its competitors.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the ''Britannica'' has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of [[Web search engine|search engines]], has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as [[Google Book Search|Google Books]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[MIT OpenCourseWare|release of its educational materials]] and the open [[PubMed Central]] library of the [[National Library of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title=Accessibility of information on the web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6740/abs/400107a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6740 |year=1999 |doi=10.1038/21987 |pmid=10428673|bibcode = 1999Natur.400..107L |pages=107–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title= Searching the Web: general and scientific information access | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=739314 |journal=Communications Magazine, IEEE |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=116–122 |year=1999 |doi=10.1109/35.739314|citeseerx= 10.1.1.118.3636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electronic publishing takes journals into a new realm |publisher=American Chemical Society | url=http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/980518/elec.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117003816/http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/980518/elec.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=17 January 1999 |accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the ''Britannica'' has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor [[Walter Yust]].&lt;ref name="EB_1954" /&gt; Eventually, the Britannica turned to focus more on its online edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17362698|title=Britannica ends its print edition|date=2012-03-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print encyclopaedias ===
The {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;ref name="library_association_1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; A well-known comparison is that of [[Kenneth Kister]], who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' with two comparable encyclopaedias, ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—[[circumcision]], [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]], [[Galileo]], [[Philip Glass]], [[heart disease]], [[IQ]], [[panda bear]], [[sexual harassment]], [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Uzbekistan]]—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between [[grade conversion|B− and B+]], chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the ''Britannica'' received one "D" and seven "A"s, ''Encyclopedia Americana'' received eight "A"s, and ''Collier's'' received one "D" and seven "A"s; thus, ''Britannica'' received an average score of 92% for accuracy to ''Americana''{{'}}s 95% and ''Collier's'' 92%. In the timeliness category, ''Britannica'' averaged an 86% to ''Americana'''s 90% and ''Collier's'' 85%.

=== Digital encyclopaedias on optical media ===
The most notable competitor of the ''Britannica'' among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was ''[[Encarta]]'',&lt;ref name="seymour_2006" /&gt; now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]]'', ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia|Collier's]]'' and the ''New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia''. ''Encarta'' was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | title = Microsoft Encarta—Premium 2007: Overview | url = http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=002 | accessdate =6 April 2007}} Sales figures for January 2000&amp;nbsp;– February 2006 as provided by the [[NPD Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both occupied the same price range, with the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate]]'' CD or DVD costing US$40–50&lt;ref name="2007EncartaPrice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/27/20070327-113641-4034r/?page=all |title=Digital encyclopedia has wealth of information |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica Store"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.britannica.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=765&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=4&amp;iSubCat=14&amp;iProductID=765&amp;show=all |title=The Britannica Store |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 November 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.&lt;ref name="Encarta Store"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-FB7-00442-Encarta-Premium-2007/dp/B000FL2DQS|title= Amazon.com: Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007: Software|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Britannica'' contains 100,000 articles and ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus]]'' (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions.&lt;ref name="Britannica Store" /&gt; ''Encarta'' contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition.&lt;ref name="Encarta Store" /&gt; Like ''Encarta'', the ''Britannica'' has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary.&lt;ref name="seymour_2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=502|title= Encyclopedia face-off: Encarta vs Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2006|last= Seymour|first= Ursula|date= 9 November 2006|work= PC Advisor|publisher= IDG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Britannica'', ''Encarta'' was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/artcenter_0/Encyclopedia_Articles.html |title=Encarta's Encyclopedia Article Center |accessdate=11 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbm2bZC?url=http://encarta.msn.com/artcenter_0/Encyclopedia_Articles.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet encyclopedias ===
The dominant internet encyclopaedia and main alternative to ''Britannica'' is the multilingual, [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based, [[free-content]] encyclopaedia, [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name=Tancer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1595184,00.html |title=Look Who's Using Wikipedia |author=Bill Tancer |date=1 May 2007 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |quote=The sheer volume of content […] is partly responsible for the site's dominance as an online reference.

The 699 printed {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}} articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 printed {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a ''Britannica'' article either has known authorship &lt;!--"...identified authors" can parse as verb--&gt; or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the ''Britannica'''s contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates.&lt;ref name="macropaedia_contributors" /&gt; By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials.&lt;ref name="Giles_Nature_study_2005" /&gt; It is for this lack of institutional vetting, or certification, that former ''Britannica'' editor-in-chief Robert McHenry notes his belief that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the ''Britannica'' in accuracy.&lt;ref name="FBE"&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=McHenry | title=The Faith-Based Encyclopedia | work=TCS Daily | date=15 November 2004 | url=http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2004/11/the-faith-based-encyclopedia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the journal ''Nature'' chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called "relevant" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. ''Nature'' got back 42 usable reviews.

In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in ''Britannica'', an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for ''Britannica''.&lt;ref name="Giles_Nature_study_2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | pages = 900–1 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 438 | doi = 10.1038/438900a | year = 2005 | pmid = 16355180 | title = Internet encyclopaedias go head to head: Jimmy Wales' Wikipedia comes close to Britannica in terms of the accuracy of its science entries| issue = 7070 | last1 = Giles | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jim Giles (reporter)|bibcode = 2005Natur.438..900G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel|title=Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica|url=http://news.cnet.com/Study-Wikipedia-as-accurate-as-Britannica/2100-1038_3-5997332.html|work=Staff Writer, CNET News|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Britannica ''was revealed as the more accurate encyclopedia, with fewer errors, [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] in its detailed 20-page rebuttal called ''Nature'''s study flawed and misleading&lt;ref name="fatally_flawed"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for a "prompt" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a ''Britannica'' yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from ''Compton's Encyclopedia'' (called the ''Britannica Student Encyclopedia'' on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalized for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what ''Nature'' called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. ''Nature'' defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of ''Britannica'', it used whatever relevant material was available on ''Britannica''{{'}}s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of ''Britannica UK'' said: {{quote|Wikipedia is a fun site to use and has a lot of interesting entries on there, but their approach wouldn't work for {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}. My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind.

The tale was highlighted by the [[Lord Mayor of London]], Gilbert Inglefield, at the [[Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|bicentennial of the ''Britannica'']].&lt;ref name="EB_bicentennial" /&gt;

The ''Britannica'' has a reputation for summarising knowledge.&lt;ref name="thomas_1992"&gt;{{cite book| last = Thomas | first = Gillian | authorlink =  | year = 1992 | title = A Position to Command Respect: Women and the Eleventh Britannica | publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] | isbn = 978-0-8108-2567-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire ''Britannica'', taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; When [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar|Fat'h Ali]] became the [[Qajar dynasty|Shah of Persia]] in 1797, he was given a set of the ''Britannica's'' 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}".&lt;ref name="EB_bicentennial"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1968 | title = Banquet at Guildhall in the City of London, Tuesday 15 October 1968: Celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and the 25th Anniversary of the Honorable William Benton as its Chair and Publisher | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica International, Ltd.]] | location = United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[George Bernard Shaw]] claimed to have read the complete 9th edition—except for the science articles&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;—and [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] took the ''Britannica'' as reading material for his five-month stay at the [[South Pole]] in 1934, while [[Philip Beaver]] read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, [[A.J.

Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author [[C. S. Forester]]&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; and [[Amos Urban Shirk]], an American businessman, who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Reader |work=The New Yorker | volume = 9 | date = 3 March 1934 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several editors-in-chief of the ''Britannica'' are likely to have read their editions completely, such as [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]] (1st edition), [[William Robertson Smith]] (9th edition), and [[Walter Yust]] (14th edition).

=== Awards ===
The CD/DVD-ROM version of the ''Britannica'', ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]'', received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the [[Association of Educational Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edpress.org/awards/04tech.htm | title = 2004 Distinguished Achievement Awards Winners: Technology | date = 1 August 2003 | accessdate =11 April 2007 | publisher = [[Association of Educational Publishers]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017162810/http://www.edpress.org/awards/04tech.htm |archivedate = 17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2009, {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} was awarded a spot as one of "Top Ten Superbrands in the UK" by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8149460.stm | title = Top Ten Superbrands 2009–2010 | accessdate =15 July 2009 |publisher=BBC | date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coverage of topics ===
Topics are chosen in part by reference to the {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}} "Outline of Knowledge".&lt;ref name="propedia_preface" /&gt; The bulk of the ''Britannica'' is devoted to geography (26% of the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%).&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; A complementary study of the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%.&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the "range, depth, and [[wikt:catholicity|catholicity]] of coverage [of the ''Britannica''] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lang | first = JP | year = 1992 | title = Reference Sources for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries | edition = 5th | publisher = American Library Association | location = Chicago | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0-8389-3406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Britannica'' does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of [[Buddhism]] and most other religions is covered in a single {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}} article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles.&lt;ref name="macropaedia_2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Britannica'' has been lauded as the ''least'' biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt;

{{quote|It can be stated without fear of contradiction that the 15th edition of the ''Britannica'' accords non-Western cultural, social, and scientific developments more notice than any general English-language encyclopedia currently on the market.|[[Kenneth Kister]]|in ''Kister's Best Encyclopedias'' (1994)}}

=== Criticism of editorial decisions ===
On rare occasions, the ''Britannica ''was criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, [[military decoration]]s, and the French poet [[Joachim du Bellay]]; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies.&lt;ref name="Newsweek_1974" /&gt; Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} and {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="15th_criticism" /&gt; Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a "qualified failure...&amp;#91;that&amp;#93; cares more for juggling its format than for preserving."&lt;ref name="Newsweek_1974"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Prescott | first = Peter S. | title = The Fifteenth Britannica | magazine = Newsweek | date = 8 July 1974 | pages = 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, reviewers from the [[American Library Association]] were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 {{lang|la|Macropædia}}, along with the article on [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="library_association_1992" /&gt;

Some very few ''Britannica''-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the ''Britannica's'' early years is the rejection of [[Newtonian gravity]] by [[George Gleig]], the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the [[fire (classical element)|classical element of fire]].&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; The ''Britannica'' has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with [[William Robertson Smith]]'s articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

=== Other criticisms ===
{{See also|Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition#Notable commentary on the Eleventh Edition}}
The ''Britannica'' has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the ''Britannica,''{{efn|1=According to Kister, the initial 15th edition (1974) required over $32 million to produce.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;}} and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia_1954" /&gt; For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist [[Harvey Einbinder]] detailed its failings in his 1964 book, ''The Myth of the Britannica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Einbinder | first = Harvey | authorlink = Harvey Einbinder | year = 1964 | title = The Myth of the Britannica | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-384-14050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; It is still difficult to keep the ''Britannica'' current; one recent critic writes, "it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision", noting that the longer {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter {{lang|la|Micropædia}} articles.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; Information in the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding {{lang|la|Macropædia}} article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other.&lt;ref name="library_association_1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt; The bibliographies of the {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.&lt;ref name="library_association_1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sader_1995" /&gt;

In 2010 an inaccurate entry about the Irish civil war was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]] to pay for online access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/britannica-errors-spark-unholy-row-2045150.html |title=Britannica errors spark unholy row|work=[[Irish Independent]] |date= 3 February 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010 |first=Grainne |last=Cunningham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehy, Clodagh (4 February 2010).

It's the encyclopedia that thinks the Civil War was between the north and south"]. ''Evening Herald'' (Dublin).&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about the 3rd edition (1788–1797), ''Britannica''{{'}}s chief editor [[George Gleig]] observed that "perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supplement to the Encyclopædia or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Miscellaneous Literature|year=1803|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3YBulnow6IC&amp;pg=PR4 iv]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the ''Britannica'' wrote, "we in no way mean to imply that ''Britannica'' is error-free; we have never made such a claim."&lt;ref name="fatally_flawed" /&gt; The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]:

{{quote|{{Smallcaps|With}} regard to errors in general, whether falling under the denomination of mental, typographical or accidental, we are conscious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever. Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties attending the execution of a work of such an extensive nature will make proper allowances. To these we appeal, and shall rest satisfied with the judgment they pronounce.&lt;ref&gt;William Smellie in the [[s:Preface to the 1st edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica|Preface]] to the 1st edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, [[Jorge Cauz]] (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that "''Britannica'' […] will always be factually correct."&lt;ref name=nytstop /&gt;

[[File:Houghton Typ 705.71.363 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1771 - title page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the first edition of the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}]]
{{Main|History of the Encyclopædia Britannica}}
Past owners have included, in chronological order, the Edinburgh, Scotland printers [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], Scottish bookseller [[Archibald Constable]], Scottish publisher [[A &amp; C Black]], [[Horace Everett Hooper]], [[Sears]] Roebuck and [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]].

The present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is [[Jacqui Safra]], a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]], ''[[Encarta]]'' and [[Wikipedia]] have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias.&lt;ref name="web" /&gt; To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the ''Britannica'', reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on [[CD-ROM]], DVD, and the [[World Wide Web]]. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia_1954"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopaedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 14th}} Aside from providing an excellent summary of the ''Britannica's'' history and early spin-off products, this article also describes the life-cycle of a typical ''Britannica'' edition. A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated. When work on a new edition is begun, sales of the old edition stop, just when fiscal needs are greatest: a new editorial staff must be assembled, articles commissioned. [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] identified this fluctuation of income as a danger to any encyclopaedia, one he hoped to overcome with continuous revision.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editions ===
The ''Britannica'' has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the [[#Edition summary|Table]] below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.

Throughout history, the ''Britannica'' has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material.&lt;ref name="EB_encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge.&lt;ref name="propedia_preface"&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 5–8| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the ''Britannica'' can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organization of the dictionary.

==== 1768–1826 ====
[[File:Rosetta Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The early 19th-century editions of {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} included influential, original research such as [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's]] article on Egypt, which included the translation of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] on the [[Rosetta Stone]] (pictured).]]
In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the ''Britannica'' was managed and published by its founders, [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], by [[Archibald Constable]], and by others. The ''Britannica'' was first published between December 1768&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Encyclopaedia|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Encyclopaedia|work=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=Volume 9|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1771 in [[Edinburgh]] as the ''Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan''. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by [[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'']] (first edition 1728). It went on sale December 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |number=938490995649536000 |title=Our early history is described in our "Encyclopædia Britannica" entry: |date=&lt;!--11:31 AM - --&gt;6 December 2017 |user=Britannica |accessdate=2017-12-06}} [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-English-language-reference-work "Encyclopædia Britannica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Britannica'' of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herman | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur L. Herman | year = 2002 | title = How the Scots Invented the Modern World | publisher = Three Rivers Press | isbn = 978-0-609-80999-0| title-link = How the Scots Invented the Modern World }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the ''Britannica'' moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—[[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Krapp |first=Philip |author2=Balou, Patricia K. |year=1992 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia |volume=9 |pages=135 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Company |location=New York |lccn=91061165}} The ''Britannica's'' 1st edition is described as "deplorably inaccurate and unscientific" in places.&lt;/ref&gt;—to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities.&lt;ref name=KafkerLoveland2009/&gt; Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''Cyclopædia'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopædia Metropolitana]]'' and [[David Brewster]]'s ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]''.

==== 1827–1901 ====
During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the ''Britannica'' was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm [[A &amp; C Black]]. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably [[Macvey Napier]], others were attracted by the ''Britannica's'' reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.

Production of the 9th edition was overseen by [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the "Scholar's Edition", the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all ''Britannicas''.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kogan_1958"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = The [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | lccn = 58008379}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, Baynes was assisted by [[William Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SBDEL|wstitle=Baynes, Thomas Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; No biographies of living persons were included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Editor's Advertisement|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Thomas Huxley]] were special advisors on science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Prefatory Notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the ''Britannica'' faced financial difficulties.

==== 1901–1973 ====
[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|left|thumb|US advertisement for the 11th edition from the May 1913 issue of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'']]

In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the ''Britannica'' was managed by American businessmen who introduced [[direct marketing]] and [[door-to-door]] sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, [[Horace Everett Hooper|Horace Hooper]], lavished enormous effort on its perfection.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the ''Britannica'' was managed by [[Sears Roebuck]] for 18 years (1920–1923, 1928–1943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, [[Elkan Harrison Powell]], assumed presidency of the ''Britannica''; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia_1954" /&gt; Powell developed new educational products that built upon the ''Britannica''{{'}}s reputation.

[[File:Shipping box for the encyclopedia Britannica 2013-04-13 12-24.jpg|alt=A wooden crate reading "THE / ENCYCLOPAEDIA / BRITANNICA / STANDARD OF THE WORLD / FOURTEENTH EDITION / BLUE CLOTH / BOOKS KEEP DRY"|thumb|A wooden shipping crate for the 14th edition of the ''Britannica'']]

In 1943, Sears donated the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} to the [[University of Chicago]]. [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]], then a vice president of the University, provided the working capital for its operation.  The stock was divided between Benton and the University, with the University holding an option on the stock.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 22 February 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Benton became Chairman of the Board and managed the ''Britannica'' until his death in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 28 January 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Benton set up the [[Benton Foundation]], which managed the ''Britannica'' until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the ''Britannica'' celebrated [[Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|its bicentennial]].

==== 1974–1994 ====
In the fourth era (1974–94), the ''Britannica'' introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organized into three parts: the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}}, the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}, and the {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}. Under [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of ''Britannica'' from 1965),&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''A Guidebook to Learning: for the lifelong pursuit of wisdom''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1986. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Britannica'' sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}) provoked a "firestorm of criticism" of the initial 15th edition.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="15th_criticism"&gt;

This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the ''New Encyclopædia Britannica'', although it has also been promoted as ''Britannica 3''.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt;

On 9 March 1976 the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/commission_decision_volumes/volume-87/ftc_volume_decision_87_january_-_june_1976pages_400-541.pdf|title=In the Matter of Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. et al., pp.421-541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1994–present ====
[[File:Eb advert 1898.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the 9th edition (1898)]]
In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on [[Optical disc|optical media]] and online. In 1996, the ''Britannica'' was bought by [[Jacqui Safra]] at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, [[Britannica.com Inc.]], developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, [[Ilan Yeshua]], who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the ''Britannica'' name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, [[Jorge Cauz]], announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.&lt;ref name="nytstop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-stop"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/13/technology/encyclopedia-britannica-books/|title=Encyclopedia Britannica to stop printing books|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|date=13 March 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Britannica''{{'}}s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set.&lt;ref name="nytstop" /&gt; ''Britannica Global Edition'' was also printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller "compact" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain {{lang|la|Macro-}} and {{lang|la|Micropædia}} sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is ''Britannica''{{'}}s description of the work:&lt;ref name="store.britannica.com" /&gt;

{{quote|The editors of {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}, the world standard in reference since 1768, present the ''Britannica Global Edition''. Developed specifically to provide comprehensive and global coverage of the world around us, this unique product contains thousands of timely, relevant, and essential articles drawn from the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} itself, as well as from the ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia'', the ''Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions'', and Compton's by Britannica. Written by international experts and scholars, the articles in this collection reflect the standards that have been the hallmark of the leading English-language encyclopedia for over 240 years.}}

=== Dedications ===
The ''Britannica'' was [[Dedication (publishing)|dedicated]] to the reigning [[British monarchy|British monarch]] from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; Thus, the 11th edition is "dedicated by Permission to His Majesty [[George V of the United Kingdom|George the Fifth]], [[King of Great Britain and Ireland]] and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, [[Emperor of India]], and to [[William Howard Taft]], President of the United States of America."&lt;ref name="EB_1911"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1910 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = 11th | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is "Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight David Eisenhower]], President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth the Second]]."&lt;ref name="EB_1954"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = 14th | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was "dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, [[George W. Bush]], and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II,"&lt;ref name="propedia_3"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition = 15th edition, {{lang|la|Propædia}} | page = 3| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. | year = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is "dedicated by permission to [[Barack Obama]], President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II."&lt;ref name=propedia2010&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', ''Propædia: Outline of Knowledge and Guide to the Britannica'', 15th edition, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup id="editionnote4"&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The 10th edition included a maps volume and a cumulative index volume for the 9th and 10th edition volumes: ''the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the existing volumes of the 9th ed., the 10th ed.&amp;nbsp;... and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with recent events and developments''

&lt;sup id="editionnote5"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ''Vols. 30–32&amp;nbsp;... the New volumes constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition''

&lt;sup id="editionnote6"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; This supplement replaced the previous supplement: ''The three new supplementary volumes constituting, with the volumes of the latest standard edition, the thirteenth edition.''

&lt;sup id="editionnote7"&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; At this point Encyclopædia Britannica began almost annual revisions. New revisions of the 14th edition appeared every year between 1929 and 1973 with the exceptions of 1931, 1934 and 1935.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=15th |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2007 |at=interior flap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup id="editionnote8"&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Annual revisions were published every year between 1974 and 2007 with the exceptions of 1996, 1999, 2000, 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 15th edition (introduced as "Britannica 3") was published in three parts: a 10-volume {{lang|la|Micropædia}} (which contained short articles and served as an index), a 19-volume {{lang|la|Macropædia}}, plus the {{lang|la|Propædia}} (see text).

&lt;sup id="editionnote9"&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; In 1985, the system was modified by adding a separate two-volume index; the {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 US states were all included into the "United States of America" article), with some medium-length articles moved to the {{lang|la|Micropædia}}. The {{lang|la|Micropædia}} had 12 vols. and the {{lang|la|Macropædia}} 17.

The first CD-ROM edition was issued in 1994. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In 1999 this was offered free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended in 2001 and a new printed set was issued in 2001.

'''Enoch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|n|ə|k}}){{efn|{{Hebrew name|hebrew=חֲנוֹךְ|tiber=Ḥanōḵ|stan=H̱anōḵ}}; {{lang-ar|أَخْنُوخ}} ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʼAkhnūkh}}'', [commonly in [[Qur'ān]]ic literature]: {{lang|ar|إِدْرِيس}} ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʼIdrīs}}''}} is of the [[Antediluvian]] period in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Enoch was son of [[Jared (biblical figure)|Jared]] and fathered [[Methuselah]].
This Enoch is not to be confused with [[Cain and Abel|Cain's]] son [[Enoch (son of Cain)|Enoch]] ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:17|9}}).  

The text of the [[Book of Genesis]] says Enoch lived 365 years before he was taken by God. The text reads that Enoch "walked with God: and he was no more; for God took him" ({{Bibleref2|Gen|5:21–24|9}}), which some Christians interpret as Enoch's [[entering Heaven alive]]. 

Enoch is the subject of many Jewish and Christian traditions. He was considered the author of the ''[[Book of Enoch]]''&lt;ref&gt;August Dillmann and R. Charles (1893). ''The Book of Enoch'', translation from Geez [https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxr5mf6rwk1mv66/DILLMANN_Book.of.Enoch.pdf?dl=0 pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; and also called Enoch the scribe of judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''1Enoch'', chap. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  
The [[New Testament]] has three references to Enoch from the lineage of [[Seth]] (Luke 3:37, Hebrews 11:5, Jude 1:14–15).

==Enoch in the Book of Genesis==
[[File:William Blake Enoch Lithograph 1807.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Enoch, [[litography]] by [[William Blake]], 1807.]]
Enoch appears in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the [[Pentateuch]] as the seventh of the ten pre-[[Genesis flood narrative|Deluge]] [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]]. Genesis recounts that each of the pre-Flood Patriarchs lived for several centuries. Genesis 5 provides a genealogy of these ten figures (from Adam to Noah), providing the age at which each fathered the next, and the age of each figure at death. Enoch is considered by many to be the exception, who is said to "not see death" ({{Bibleref2|Hebrews|11:5|9}}). Furthermore, {{Bibleref2|Genesis|5:22–29|9}} states that Enoch lived 365 years, which is shorter than his peers, who are all recorded as dying at over 700 years of age. The brief account of Enoch in Genesis 5 ends with the cryptic note that "he ''[was]'' not; for God took him".&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 5:24, KJV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apocryphal Books of Enoch==
Three extensive [[Apocrypha]] are attributed to Enoch:
*[[Book of Enoch]], written in [[Ge'ez]], first time brought in Europe by [[James Bruce]] and translated in English by August Dillmann and Reverent Schoode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCHODDE – The Book of Enoch (1882)|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/6rbnsqkbyux8z0b/SCHODDE_The-Book-of-Enoch.pdf?dl=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; - recognized by the [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches and usually dated between the third century BC and the first century AD. 
*[[Second Book of Enoch]] or the Book of the Secrets of Enoch, written in Old Bulgarian, first translated in English by William Morfill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MORFILL – The Book of the Secrets of Enoch  (1896)|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/xect6zyuyhw137z/MORFILL_2Enoch_Book.of.Enoch.Secrets.pdf?dl=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; - usually dated to the first century AD.
*[[3 Enoch]], a Rabbinic text in Hebrew usually dated to the fifth century AD.
These recount how Enoch was taken up to [[Heaven]] and was appointed guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the [[archangel]]s, and the immediate attendant on the [[Throne of God]]. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and, with all the angels at his back, fulfils of his own accord whatever comes out of the mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3 Enoch identifies Enoch as the [[Metatron]], the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic [[kabbalah]] of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the [[Book of Jubilees]].

===Enoch in Book of Giants===
[[The Book of Giants]] is a  Jewish [[Pseudepigrapha]] from the third century BC and resembles the Book of Enoch. At least six and as many as eleven copies were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenman|first1=Robert|last2=Wise|first2=Michael|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered|date=1992|publisher=Element Books, Inc.|location=Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=1852303689|page=95|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Septuagint===
The third-century BC translators who produced the [[Septuagint]] in [[Koine Greek]] rendered the phrase "God took him" with the Greek verb ''metatithemi'' ({{lang|grc|μετατίθημι}})&lt;ref&gt;5:24 καὶ εὐηρέστησεν Ενωχ τῷ θεῷ καὶ οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο ὅτι μετέθηκεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεός&lt;/ref&gt; meaning moving from one place to another.&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%E1%BD%B3%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BA%CE%B5%CE%BD&amp;la=greek#lexicon metatithemi]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirach]] 44:16, from about the same period, states that "Enoch pleased God and was translated into [[paradise]] that he may give repentance to the nations." The Greek word used here for [[paradise]], ''paradeisos'' ({{lang|grc|παράδεισος}}), was derived from an ancient Persian word meaning "enclosed garden", and was used in the Septuagint to describe the garden of Eden. Later, however, the term became synonymous for heaven, as is the case here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/strongs/G3857 G3857 παράδεισος] Strong's Greek Lexicon. Retrieved 2015-08-01 &lt;br/&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/3857.htm Strong's Greek 3857_ παράδεισος (paradeisos) -- a park, a garden, a paradise] Retrieved 2015-08-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enoch in classical Rabbinical literature===
In classical Rabbinical literature, there are various views of Enoch. One view regarding Enoch that was found in the [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]], which thought of Enoch as a pious man, taken to Heaven, and receiving the title of ''Safra rabba'' (''Great scribe''). After Christendom was completely separated from Judaism, this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea of Enoch's character and exaltation.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=383&amp;letter=E |title=Jewish Encyclopedia '&amp;#39;Enoch'&amp;#39; |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rashi]]&lt;ref&gt;Rashi's Commentary on {{Bibleref2|Genesis|5:24|9}}. See also Commentary of [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]].&lt;/ref&gt; [from [[Genesis Rabbah]]&lt;ref&gt;25:1&lt;/ref&gt;], "Enoch was a righteous man, but he could easily be swayed to return to do evil. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, hastened and took him away and caused him to die before his time. For this reason, Scripture changed [the wording] in [the account of] his demise and wrote, 'and he was no longer' in the world to complete his years."

Among the minor [[Midrash]]im, esoteric attributes of Enoch are expanded upon. In the ''Sefer Hekalot'', Rabbi Ishmael is described as having visited the [[Seven Heavens|Seventh Heaven]], where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and [[Azazel]], and so Enoch was taken to Heaven to prove that God was not cruel.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite the small number of people on Earth) a vast collection of disciples, to the extent that he was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to the extent that he is summoned to Heaven to rule over the ''sons of God''.

==Enoch in Christianity==
[[File:Spas na Ilyine - Patriarch Enoch.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Patriarch Enoch, a [[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]], 14th century.]]
===New Testament===
The New Testament contains three references to Enoch.
*The first is a brief mention in one of the genealogies of the ancestors of Jesus by Luke (Luke 3:37).
*The second mention is in Hebrews 11: 5 (KJV) which says, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God." This suggests he did not experience the mortal death ascribed to Adam's other descendants which is consistent with Genesis 5:24(KJV), which says, "And Enoch walked with God: and he ''[was]'' not; for God took him."
*The third mention is in the [[Epistle of Jude]] (1:14–15) where the author attributes to "Enoch, the Seventh from Adam" a passage not found in Catholic and Protestant canons of the Old Testament. The quotation is believed by most modern scholars to be taken from [[Book of Enoch|1 Enoch]] 1:9 which exists in Greek, in Ge'ez (as part of the Ethiopian Orthodox canon), and also in Aramaic among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;4Q Enoch (4Q204[4QENAR]) COL I 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. and J., "The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh", Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p. 711, {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the same scholars recognise that 1 Enoch 1:9 itself is a [[midrash]] of the words of [[Moses]] "he came from the ten thousands of holy ones" from Deuteronomy 33:2.&lt;ref&gt;"The initial oracle in chapters 1-5 is a paraphrase of part of Deuteronomy 33,24" George W. E. Nickelsburg, The nature and function of revelation 1 Enoch, Jubilees and some Qumranic documents, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Hartman, Asking for a Meaning: A Study of 1 Enoch 1-5 ConBib NT Series 12 Lund Gleerup, 1979 22-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George WE Nickelsburg &amp; James C Vanderkam, 1 Enoch, Fortress 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.H.

Charlesworth, Doubleday 1983-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The introductory phrase "Enoch, the Seventh from Adam" is also found in 1 Enoch (1 En. 60:8), though not in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham ''Jude and the relatives of Jesus in the early church'' p206 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]] this Enoch prophesies "to"{{efn|The use of dative ''toutois'' in the Greek text (προεφήτευσεν δὲ καὶ '''τούτοις''' instead of the normal genitive with προφητεύω prophēteuō ''peri auton'', "concerning them") has occasioned discussion among commentators including: Ben Witherington,&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington, ''Letters and Homilies for Jewish Christians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on Hebrews, James and Jude'': "who might be tempted to follow the teachers' example), nonetheless, Jude says that this prophecy refers '''to''' these (toutois) false teachers in Jude 14" p624&lt;/ref&gt; John Twycross,&lt;ref&gt;John Twycross, ''The New Testament in the original Greek: with notes by C.

===Influence in Christianity===
In early Christianity, use of the Book of Enoch as a divinely inspired text was widespread, since the canon had not yet been established definitively in the Church. Church Fathers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Lactantius]] all speak highly of Enoch and contain many allusions to the Book of Enoch as well as in some instances advocating explicitly for the use of the Book of Enoch as Scripture. Because of the letter of Jude's citation of the Book of Enoch as prophetic text, this encouraged acceptance and usage of the Book of Enoch in early Christian circles. The main themes of Enoch about the Watchers corrupting humanity were commonly mentioned in early literature. This positive treatment of the Book of Enoch was associated with millennialism which was popular in the early Church. When amillennialism began to be common in Christianity, the Book of Enoch, being incompatible with amillennialism, started to be rejected widespread, and with the split of Oriental Orthodox from the Catholic Church in the 5th century, usage of the Book of Enoch was limited primarily to the Oriental Orthodox Church. Eventually, the usage of the Book of Enoch became limited to Ethiopian circles of the Oriental Orthodox Church. Another common element that some Church Fathers, like [[John of Damascus]], spoke of, was that they considered Enoch to be one of the [[two witnesses]] mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. This view still has many supporters today in Christianity.

===In LDS theology===
Among the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and particularly in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Enoch is viewed as having founded an exceptionally righteous city, named [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]], in the midst of an otherwise wicked world. This view is encountered in the [[standard works]], the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] and the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], which states that not only Enoch, but the entire peoples of the city of Zion, were [[translation (Mormonism)|taken off this earth without death]], because of their piety. (Zion is defined as "the pure in heart" and this city of Zion will return to the earth at the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]].) The Doctrine and Covenants further states that Enoch prophesied that one of his descendants, [[Noah]], and his family, would survive a Great Flood and thus carry on the human race and preserve the Scripture. The [[Book of Moses]] in the ''Pearl of Great Price'' has several chapters that give an account of Enoch's preaching, visions and conversations with God. In these same chapters are details concerning the wars, violence and natural disasters in Enoch's day, and notable miracles performed by Enoch. The Book of Moses is itself an excerpt from [[Joseph Smith]]'s translation of the Bible, which is published in full, complete with these chapters concerning Enoch, by [[Community of Christ]], in the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]], where it appears as part of the Book of Genesis.  D&amp;C 104:24 (CofC) / {{lds||dc|107|48|49}} (LDS) states that Adam ordained Enoch to the higher priesthood (now called the [[Melchizedek]], after the great high priest) at age 25, that he was 65 when Adam blessed him, and he lived 365 years ''after that'' until he was translated, so making him 430 years old when that occurred.

Additionally in LDS theology, Enoch is implied to be the scribe who recorded [[Adam]]'s blessings and prophecies at [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], as recorded in D&amp;C {{lds||dc|107|53|57}} (LDS) / D&amp;C 104:29b (CofC).

==Enoch in Islam==
{{main article|Idris (prophet)}}
In Islam, Enoch ({{lang-ar|translit=ʼAkhnūkh|أَخْنُوخ}} [commonly in Islamic literature]: ''ʼIdrīs'' إِِدْرِيس)) is identified with [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]], as for example by the ''[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|History of Al-Tabari]]''  intrepretation and the ''[[Meadows of Gold]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Philip S. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'' p.118 ed. [[Michael E. Stone]], Theodore A. Bergren 2002 p118 "twice in the Qur'an.. was commonly identified by Muslim scholars with the biblical Enoch, and that this identification opened the way for importing into Islam a substantial body of postbiblical Jewish legend about the character and ...."&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran contains two references to Idris; in Surah [[Al-Anbiya]] (The Prophets) verse number 85, and in Surah [[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]] (Mary) verses 56-57:

*(''The Prophets'', 21:85): "And the same blessing was bestowed upon Ismail and Idris and Zul-Kifl, because they all practised fortitude."
*(''Mary'' 19:56–57): "And remember Idris in the Book; he was indeed very truthful, a Prophet. And We lifted him to a lofty station".

'''''Galaxy of Fear''''' is a series of [[science fiction]] novels set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars galaxy|galaxy]] three years after ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''. The books are meant for younger readers. The books ranged from 100 pages to 200 pages in large print. The series of 12 books was written by John Whitman, and were released from February 1997 through to October 1998. The ''Galaxy of Fear'' line was created with an intent to cash in on the popularity of, and was meant to be a science fiction parody of, the ''[[Goosebumps]]'' franchise.

==Brief Synopsis==
The books are about a young brother and sister, Zak and Tash, who travel the galaxy with their mysterious Uncle Hoole. Tash and Zak are orphans; their parents were on their homeworld of [[Alderaan]] when it was destroyed by the [[Death Star]]. Tash is fascinated with the [[Jedi]], while Zak is interested in machines and technology.

The first six books form an [[story arc|arc]]. The [[protagonist]]s discover pieces of a large [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] experiment in [[biological warfare|biological weapons]], codenamed ''Project Starscream''. The first five books deal with the heroes discovering the various components of ''Project Starscream'', each dangerous in its own right The sixth book deals with their discovery of the final goal of the experiments: creating a prototype organism, simply named "Weapon".

The next six books lacked a central arc. The protagonists, now wanted fugitives, simply travel from planet to planet attempting to avoid Imperial authorities. Each book told a story of the main characters stumbling onto some danger and the resulting adventure.

In 1995, [[Mark Getty]] and Chief Executive Officer [[Jonathan Klein (Getty Images)|Jonathan Klein]] co-founded Getty Investments LLC.  Mark Getty is the company's chairman. In September 1997, Getty Communications, as it was called at the time, merged with [[PhotoDisc|PhotoDisc, Inc.]] to form Getty Images. In April 2003, Getty Images entered into a partnership with [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) to market each other's images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Getty Images and Agence France-Presse (AFP) Enter Into Partnership to Increase Breadth, Depth, Reach and Quality |date=April 1, 2003 |publisher=Getty Images |url=http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=66 |access-date=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024125740/http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=66 |archivedate=October 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getty Images acquired the [[Michael Ochs Archives]] in February 2007.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=151&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091018/http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=151&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 11, 2011 |title=Getty Images Acquires the Michael Ochs Archives |date=February 27, 2007 |publisher=Getty Images |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Michael Ochs Archives were described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the premier source of musician photography in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/28/arts/music/28schw.html |title=They Had Faces Then: An Archive Keeps Stars Ever Young |last=Schwarz |first=Alan |date=May 28, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the private equity firm [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] (H&amp;F) acquired Getty Images. In 2012, H&amp;F put Getty up for sale.&lt;ref name="Bl01" /&gt; As of the ensuing sale to [[Carlyle Group]], the company was said to have an archive that included 80 million stills and illustrations.&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/carlyle-in-3-3-billion-deal-for-getty-images/ "Carlyle in $3.3 Billion Deal for Getty Images"], ''New York Times'' Dealbook, August 15, 2012.

Since its formation, Getty Images has pursued an aggressive programme of [[takeover|acquisition]], buying up many privately owned agencies that had built up the stock photography industry, from small family-run firms to larger agencies. By 1999 it had acquired one of the largest agencies, Tony Stone Images; the online art seller Art.com; the sports photography agency [[Allsport]]; the market leader in the Benelux and Scandinavia: '''Word View''' (1996, from Mr. Bert Blokhuis, four offices, for undisclosed sum); journalistic specialists Liaison Agency; Newsmakers the first digital news photo agency; Online USA, a specialist in celebrity shots; and the [[Hulton Press Library]], the former archive of the British photojournalistic magazine ''Picture Post''. The Hulton collection was sold by the [[BBC]] to Brian Deutsch in 1988, when it was renamed Hulton Deutsch. In 1996, the Hulton collection was sold on once more, this time purchased by Getty Images and renamed Hulton Getty. With the acquisition of the Hulton library, Getty Images took ownership of the rights to some 15 million photographs from the British press archives dating back to the Nineteenth Century. Hulton Getty also included photographs from the [[Keystone View Company|Keystone Collection]], as well as images by notable photographers such as [[Bert Hardy]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Weegee]] and [[Ernst Haas]].&lt;ref name="hulton_archive"&gt;{{cite web

In 2000, Getty acquired one of its main competitors, Archive Photos of New York (a division of [[The Image Bank]]), for US$183 million.&lt;ref name="image-ethics"/&gt; The Archive Photos library was combined with the Hulton Getty collection to form a new subsidiary, Hulton Archive. Archive Photos had been formed in 1990 from the merger of Pictorial Parade (est. 1935) and Frederick Lewis Stock Photos (est. 1938), two well-established US photo agencies. Their collections included archive images from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' and [[George Eastman House]], and works by photographers such as [[Ruth Orkin]], [[Anacleto Rapping]], Deborah Feingold, Murray Garrett, [[Nat Fein]] and [[John Filo]].&lt;ref name="hulton_archive"/&gt;

The acquisition gave Getty Images control of WireImage (Entertainment, creative, and sports photography), FilmMagic (fashion and red carpet photography), and Contour Photos (portrait and studio photography). Getty Images also acquired other subsidiaries, including Master Delegates, which includes Isifa Image Service in [[Prague]] and Laura Ronchi in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Corporate ownership and management==
In February 2008, it was announced that Getty Images would be acquired by the private equity firm [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] in a transaction valued at an estimated US$2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=171 |title=Getty Images Press Release |date=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229030957/http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=171 |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2008, Getty Images announced the completion of its acquisition.  Getty Images common stock ceased trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] at the close of the acquisition and was delisted from the NYSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=179&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |title=Getty Images Announces Completion of Acquisition by Hellman &amp; Friedman |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630223723/http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=179&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |archivedate=June 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, H&amp;F engaged investment bankers to sell the company. While a price of $4 billion was initially discussed, in August when the private equity firm Carlyle Group emerged as the likely acquirer, the price under consideration was said to be $3.3–3.4 billion. [[CVC Capital Partners]] Ltd. was also said to have been bidding but had yet to top Carlyle's price.&lt;ref name=Bl01&gt;Alesci, Cristina, and Jeffrey McCracken, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/carlyle-group-said-to-be-leading-bidder-for-getty-images.html "Carlyle Group Said to Be Leading Bidder for Getty Images"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816010559/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/carlyle-group-said-to-be-leading-bidder-for-getty-images.html |date=August 16, 2012 }}, ''Bloomberg'', August 14, 2012. Retrieved August 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale to Carlyle thereafter was announced at $3.3 billion, with co-founders Getty and Klein and the Getty family all carrying their investments over into the new ownership structure. Getty continues to serve as chairman and Klein as chief executive.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

In September 2018, the Getty family announced it would acquire majority stake in the company from Carlyle Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/getty-images-ma/getty-family-to-buy-majority-stake-in-getty-images-from-carlyle-idUSL3N1VQ4JK|title=Getty family to buy majority stake in Getty Images from Carlyle|last=|first=|date=September 4, 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=September 4, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2008, Getty Images has created controversy for its methods of pursuing copyright enforcement on behalf of its photographers. Rather than pursue a policy of sending "[[cease and desist]]" notices, Getty typically mails a [[demand letter]] that claims substantial monetary damages from owners of websites it believes infringed on their photographers' copyrights. Getty commonly tries to intimidate website owners by sending collection agents, even though a demand letter does not create a debt.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

One photographer noted, "Courts don't like to be used as a means of extortion."  In one case, Getty sent a church in [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]], a £6,000 bill for photographs it used on its website, apparently placed there by a church volunteer.  In this case, the church offered to pay Getty what it thought was a reasonable amount. The [[diocese]]'s communications director said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Getty was not playing ball or following the normal litigation or [[dispute resolution]] procedures and [I advised the church] to ignore them. We don't deal with bullies; we deal with [[legal threat]]s appropriately. I told [Getty] by letter that's what [the church was] doing, that we were not going to play, and didn't hear any more.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' described other instances in which Getty or other stock photo businesses dropped a claim when a website owner refused to pay and hired a lawyer.  A law firm was quoted as saying: "Once we get involved generally Getty does back off."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Grossman, Wendy, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/nov/27/internet-photography "Is a picture really worth £1,000?"], ''The Guardian'', November 27, 2008. Retrieved November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Oscar Michelen, a New York attorney who focuses on such damages claims, said: "The damages they're requesting aren't equal to the copyright infringement," and "there's no law that says definitively what images are worth in the digital age."&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news|date=September 13, 2009|first=David |last=Lazarus |authorlink=David Lazarus |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/13/business/fi-lazarus13 |title=Controlling illegal use of copyrighted material on the Web - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called Getty's effort to assess four-figure fines "a legalized form of extortion".&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

In an effort to combat online copyright infringement, in March 2014 Getty Images made over 35 million images available free for non-commercial online use via embedding with [[Attribution (copyright)|attribution]] and a link back to the Getty Images website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laurent |first=Olivier |title=Getty Images makes 35 million images free in fight against copyright infringement |url=http://www.bjp-online.com/2014/03/getty-images-makes-35-million-images-free-in-fight-against-copyright-infringement/ |date=March 5, 2014 |work=British Journal of Photography |accessdate=March 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306090832/http://www.bjp-online.com/2014/03/getty-images-makes-35-million-images-free-in-fight-against-copyright-infringement/ |archivedate=March 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brustein|first=Joshua|title=Since It Can't Sue Us All, Getty Images Embraces Embedded Photos|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/since-it-cant-sue-us-all-getty-images-embraces-embedded-photos|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Getty Images executive Craig Peters, "The principle is to turn what's infringing use with good intentions, turning that into something that's valid licensed use with some benefits going back to the photographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brandom|first=Russell|title=The world's largest photo service just made its pictures free to use|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use|date=March 5, 2014|work=The Verge|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Getty Images entered a lawsuit with Google, taking issue with the way the search giant handled their images scraping methods. Two years later in 2018, Google removed the "View Image" button from their image search results. This led to outrage from users around the world, and a number of articles referencing this lawsuit. The button was removed as part of a settlement Google made with Getty Images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/internet-rages-after-google-removes-view-image-button-bowing-to-getty/ Internet Rages After Google Removes "View Image" Button], ''Ars Technica''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement lawsuits==
In 2009, Car-Freshner Corp. filed a lawsuit against Getty Images in [[U.S. Federal Court]], Northern District New York (Case 7:09-cv-01252-GTS -GHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 7:09-CV-1252 (GTS/GHL)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=getty+images&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40006&amp;case=3004682583920192380&amp;scilh=0|website=Google Scholar|publisher=United States District Court, N.D. New York.|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Car-Freshner claimed that Getty Images had in its catalog photos that included the famous "tree-shaped" trademarked car fresheners.  In 2011, Getty Images attempted to have the case dismissed, but its motion was denied.&lt;ref name="CourtroomStrategy2011"&gt;{{cite web |first=Oscar |last=Michelen |url=http://www.courtroomstrategy.com/2011/10/makers-of-pine-tree-deodorizers-allowed-to-proceed-with-lawsuit-against-getty-images/ |title=Makers of Pine-Tree Deodorizers Allowed to Proceed With Lawsuit Against Getty Images |publisher=Courtroomstrategy.com |date= October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Getty Images agreed to settle by paying $100,000 to Car-Freshener Corp., but admitted no wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="CourtroomStrategy2012"&gt;{{cite web |first=Oscar |last=Michelen |url= http://www.courtroomstrategy.com/2012/08/getty-images-pays-100k-to-settle-car-freshener-suit/ |title=Getty Images Pays $100K to Settle Car-Freshner Suit |publisher=Courtroomstrategy.com |date=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Avril Nolan brought a $450,000 suit against Getty Images. Nolan alleged that Getty Images improperly let her image be used in advertisements that depicted her as HIV-positive. She claimed the ad's depiction of her as HIV-positive (she is not) hurt her personal and professional relationships and caused her emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/19/woman-sues-getty-after-photo-appears-in-hiv-positive-ad/ | work=New York Post | first=Julia | last=Marsh | title = Model sues after HIV-positive ad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://observer.com/2013/09/greenpoint-model-tired-of-telling-dates-shes-hiv-free-sues-getty/ | work=The New York Observer | first= Órla | last= Ryan | date = September 20, 2013 | accessdate = April 22, 2014 | title = Greenpoint Model Tired of Telling Dates She's HIV Free Sues Getty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014 a judge ruled the lawsuit will be taken to court rather than dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://nypost.com/2014/03/10/model-wins-round-in-hiv-ad-lawsuit/ | work=New York Post | first=Julia | last=Marsh | date = March 10, 2014 | accessdate = April 22, 2014 | title = Model wins round in HIV-ad lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty Images settled with Nolan in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Office of Joy R.|title=More Lessons on How Not to Use Stock Images.

In November 2013, Getty and [[Agence France-Presse]] were ordered to pay $1.2 million compensation to freelance photojournalist Daniel Morel for using his images posted on [[Twitter]] related to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] without his permission, in violation of copyright and Twitter's terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ax|first=Joseph|title=Photographer wins $1.2 million from companies that took pictures off Twitter|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/22/us-media-copyright-twitter-idUSBRE9AL16F20131122|newspaper=Reuters|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laurent |first=Olivier |title=Getty Images disappointed at $1.2m Morel verdict |url=http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2308888/getty-images-disappointed-at-usd12m-morel-verdict |date=November 24, 2013 |work=British Journal of Photography |publisher=Incisive Media |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126170747/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2308888/getty-images-disappointed-at-usd12m-morel-verdict |archivedate=November 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Getty was sued, unsuccessfully, for over $1 billion by [[Carol Highsmith]], an American photographer notable for donating her 100,000+ image collection, royalty-free, to the [[Library of Congress]], when Highsmith found that Getty has been selling unauthorized licenses of her work (an instance of [[copyfraud]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|title=Photographer sues Getty Images for $1 billion after she's billed for her own photo|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-getty-copyright-20160729-snap-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate = August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highsmith-arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|title=Photographer sues Getty Images for selling photos she donated to public|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/photographer-sues-getty-images-for-selling-photos-she-donated-to-public/?comments=1|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol Highsmith found out about this when she received a letter from a law firm representing Getty demanding $120 for displaying her pictures on a personal website of hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|title=Getty Images will bill you thousands to use a photo that belongs to the public.

In August 2016, [[Zuma Press]], an independent press agency, filed suit against Getty for alleged copyright violations and unauthorized licensing of more than 47,000 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=hhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/getty-images-sued-again-over-alleged-misuse-of-over-47000-photos/|title=Getty Images sued again over alleged misuse of over 47,000 photos|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming copyright over public domain content ==
Getty Images has continued practice Corbis (whose license it acquired in 2016) has been criticized for, namely of claiming copyright, watermarking and selling images that are in public domain, including images related to The Holocaust like the [[Warsaw Ghetto boy]] photo&lt;ref name="Struk"&gt;{{cite book |last=Struk |first=Janina |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Photographing_the_Holocaust.html?id=P0CnKQpDIL8C |title=Photographing the Holocaust: Interpretations of the Evidence |publisher=I.B.Tauris |pages=208–209 |isbn=978-1-86064-546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/frightened-jewish-families-surrender-to-nazi-soldiers-at-news-photo/613463274|title=Nazis Arresting Jews in Warsaw Ghetto|website=Getty Images|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Polish cavalry in Sochaczew photograph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Battle of the Bzura.

==Prestige Grant==
The Getty Images Prestige Grant is awarded to two commercial photographers to realise a dream project, awarding them USD$15,000 and $7,500 respectively.

'''Glossarium Eroticum''' is a Latin-language dictionary of sexual words and phrases, and of many pertaining to the human body or considered to be obscene, by Pierre-Emmanuel Pierrugues, published in 1826. It lists definitions and excerpts Classical Latin writers such as [[Plautus]], [[Juvenal]], [[Petronius]], and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in examples, and includes some Medieval Latin as well.

'''''Gulls of Europe, Asia and North America''''' by [[Klaus Malling Olsen]] and [[Hans Larsson]] is a volume in the ''[[Helm Identification Guides]]'' series of bird identification books.

The book is intended to succeed [[Peter J. Grant|Peter J. Grant's]] ''[[Gulls: A Guide to Identification]]'' as the standard identification work on [[Northern Hemisphere]] [[gull]]s. Although the Helm series already contained a volume on [[seabird]]s, by Peter Harrison, gulls compete for space in that volume with several other seabird families; in addition, Harrison's book was published in 1983, a time when knowledge of gull identification (and taxonomy) was in a considerably more primitive state (and Harrison himself was a specialist in pelagic birds rather than gulls specifically). Malling Olsen &amp; Larsson's book equals or exceeds Grant's work in terms of its level of detail, and consolidates and synthesises the considerable amount of new information that has been discovered since then.

The first edition of Olsen and Larsson's book was released in 2003. While the book was initially generally well-received, a large number of errors soon came to light. As a result, this edition was withdrawn, and a reprint with corrections was released in 2004. Because the publishers required only the title page of the book to be returned in order for purchasers to receive the reprint free of charge, many copies of the first printing are still in circulation. (Those with a title page are identifiable by the absence of the words "Reprinted with corrections 2004" below the publisher's address on reverse of the title page.) The ISBN of the corrected reprint is {{ISBN|0-7136-7087-8}}.

The corrected reprint has 608 pages. In total, 43 species are given full treatment by this work &amp;mdash; identification text, colour plates by Larsson, and several colour photographs (the plates and photographs are placed with the species texts, not grouped together in a separate section). In addition, three Southern Hemisphere species which have occurred as [[vagrancy in birds|vagrants]] in the Northern Hemisphere ([[band-tailed gull]], [[grey gull]] and [[swallow-tailed gull]]) are covered more briefly in an appendix, with a single photograph each, and brief mention is also made here of [[silver gull]] which has occurred as an escape from captivity. Preceding the species accounts, an introduction covers the book's species-level taxonomy, and gives general advice on gull identification, including ageing and moult, hybrid and aberrant birds, and the effects of lighting conditions, and plumage wear and fading.

The book is particularly notable in that it is the first work to bring together information discovered during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 21st century on the identification of birds of the [[large white-headed gull]] complex. The book adopts a conservative approach at higher taxonomic levels, lumping all gulls (except for [[ivory gull]], [[Ross's gull]] and the two [[kittiwake]]s) in the genus ''Larus''. A revised taxonomy is adopted at the species level, however; a number of distinctive forms (mainly in the large white-headed gull complex) are regarded as separate species.

Species-level taxonomic decisions adopted in the book are as follows:
*[[American herring gull]] (''Larus smithsonianus'') is treated as a separate species from [[European herring gull]] (''L. argentatus'')
*[[Yellow-legged gull]] (''L. michahellis'') (including the form ''atlantis'') and [[Armenian gull]] (''L. armenicus'') are treated as separate species from the European herring gull
*[[Caspian gull]] (''L. cachinnans'') is treated as a separate species from European herring and yellow-legged gulls, and is defined as including the forms ''barabensis'' and ''mongolicus''
*[[Heuglin's gull]] (''L. heuglini'') (including the form ''taimyrensis'') and [[Vega gull]] (''L. vegae'') (including the form ''birulai'') are each given full species status
* [[Common gull]] (''L. canus'') (including the forms ''heinei'' and ''kamschatensis'') and [[common gull|mew gull]] (''L. brachyrhynchus'') are treated as separate species.

Olsen and Larsson had previously collaborated on two other volumes in the Helm series, on [[tern]]s and [[skua]]s.

==Errors in the second edition==

The following is a list of errors in the corrected reprint:

* On page 21, the illustration of a gull's head, with a pointer highlighting an ear-spot, shows a bird with a full hood; ear-spots are a feature which appears on hooded gulls only when the hood (a feature of breeding plumage) is lost, in winter.&lt;ref name="Adriaens"&gt;[[Peter Adriaens|Adriaens, Peter]] (2005) Recensies: Klaus Malling Olsen &amp; Hans Larsson, 2004. Gulls of Europe, Asia and North America. ''[[Dutch Birding]]'' '''27''' (4): 263-268&lt;/ref&gt;
* On page 27, the caption to figure 14 (an illustration of the spread wingtip of a [[Caspian gull]]) describes a "broad white tip" on p9 whereas the figure shows a broad white ''mirror''.&lt;ref name="Adriaens"/&gt;
* On page 496, a report of 14 [[relict gull]]s in [[Ukraine]] is dated May 2001, whereas these birds were actually seen in May 2000 in the [[Russia]]/[[Kazakhstan]] border area.&lt;ref&gt;Piskunov, Vladimir V and A N Antonchikov (2007) Flock of 14 Relict Gulls in southern Russia and north-western Kazakhstan in May 2000. ''Dutch Birding'' '''29''' (2): 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;
* On page 276, the picture number 365 is missing (it should show an "Adult summer ssp. argenteus", according to the legend).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18859">An '''Inquisition post mortem''' (abbreviated to '''Inq.p.m.''' or '''i.p.m.''', and formerly known as an '''escheat''')&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Lyte, Introduction, uses the term "inquisition post mortem" and states they were "formerly known as 'escheats'". Modern academic usage favours the term Inq.p.m., see e.g. the Winchester University project, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin, meaning "(inquisition) after death") is an English medieval record of the death, estate and heir of one of the king's [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]], made for royal fiscal purposes. The process of making such inquisition was effected by the royal escheators in each county where the deceased held land. The earliest inq.p.m. was made in 1236, in the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272), and the practice ceased c.1640, at the start of the Civil War, and was finally abolished by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], which ended the feudal system.

==Purpose==
The escheators were ordered by a writ from the king's [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] to investigate the deaths of tenants-in-chief in order to assess what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called feudal incidents, comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the [[History of the English fiscal system|mediaeval royal revenues]]. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a [[Feudal relief|relief]], from Latin ''levo, levare'' (to lift-up), plus ''re'' (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a [[lord of the manor]] and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the [[feudal land tenure]] of [[English feudal barony|barony]] had become a fixed sum under clause two of [[Magna Carta]] (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would "escheat" (i.e. revert to the [[demesne]] of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of "escheats". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which [[entail]]ed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted a significant part of the royal revenues in mediaeval times.

==Avoidance measures==
The practice arose amongst tenants-in-chief of transferring the legal title in their lands to [[feoffee|feoffees to uses]], which effectively established trusts enabling the tenant-in-chief to continue to use the land and its revenues, but to avoid being officially recognised in law as the legal holder. This exempted him from the scope of the Inquisition post mortem, as the legal holders were effectively an immortal [[corporation]] one or two of whose constituent feoffees could on occasion die, only to be replaced by others. Such avoidance devices were apparently tolerated by the crown for a considerable time, yet on the accession of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] (1485–1509)
the king's ancient right to his feudal incidents was enforced with determination and ruthlessness.

==Procedure==
For an heir to inherit his paternal lands a formal and lengthy standard procedure had to be completed, only at the end of which he could "sue out his [[livery of seisin]]" (i.e. gain physical possession of his inheritance), so it was in his best interest to get the process started as soon as possible after the death. He himself, or his relatives if a minor, would generally inform the king's chancery that the death had occurred,&lt;ref&gt;That the heir himself generally sued for a writ of ''diem clausit extremum'' is noted by Fleming, Peter &amp; Wood, Michael, in Gloucestershire's Forgotten Battle: Nibley Green 1470&lt;/ref&gt; and this would prompt the production of a writ by the chancery under the king's [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]] addressed to the various escheators of the counties in which the deceased held lands, known as a writ ''diem clausit extremum''.  This writ, the earliest identified example of which dates from 1254,&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Lyte&lt;/ref&gt; informed the escheator that the king had been informed (''quia datum est nobis intelligi'' ("because it has been given to us to know")) that the tenant-in-chief named had "closed his last day", as the Latin phrase by which the writ has become known may be translated, and that he was ordered to hold an inquisition ''post mortem'', and to send the resultant report back to the chancery, with his seal and with the writ ''diem clausit extremum'' sewn onto it. On receipt of the writ the escheator requested the sheriff of the county concerned to empanell a jury made up of local freeholders, that is to say persons of social standing, who could be relied upon to provide the standard information required in accurate form. Such information, termed 'the jurors' "verdict"' &lt;ref&gt;Called a verdict in contemporary correspondence re the Inq.p.m. of William Paston (d.1444), see Winchester University case study 2: Informing the Escheator&lt;/ref&gt; comprised:
*Date of death
*Name of heir
*Age of heir
*Name of manors held in chief
*Name of manors held from other persons
*Extent (i.e. area/size) of manors
*Annual value of manors
*Nature of [[feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]]s &amp; services due
The most immediate order in the writ however was that requiring the escheator to take control of all the deceased's [[demesne]] lands, i.e. those which had not been [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] to [[Mesne lord|mesne tenant]]s but had been managed in-hand directly by the deceased and his household officials. All revenues resulting from such lands whilst in the hands of the escheator had to be audited (i.e. accounted for before the Barons of the Exchequer) periodically at the treasury.

The end result of the inquisition would be one of the three following, depending on what the jury reported:
*If the vassal had died with an heir who was of age, then a fine was paid to the king for the right of the heir to inherit, namely his [[feudal relief|relief]].
*If the heir was underage, that is to say under 21 for a male and under 14 for a female, then the heir and the lands were placed into royal [[wardship]].
*If there was no heir, then the lands [[escheat]]ed (i.e. reverted) to the king's royal [[demesne]].

==Form of permanent record==
Inquisitions post mortem (or "escheats") were recorded on two duplicate sheets of parchment. The original return was held in the records of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], to which department the escheator had made his original return, the other by the [[treasury]], which had caused a copy to be made for fiscal purposes, in order to verify the escheator's accounts&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, op.cit., para 5&lt;/ref&gt; which were presented to the treasury periodically. Unlike some other series of records, they were not historically sewn together as rolls, but in modern times the parchment sheets have been bound in files with covers, and are today held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] in Kew. The documents formerly comprising the chancery records are classified under the initial letter "C", whilst those from the exchequer bear the class letter "E". After the establishment of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] in 1540 a copy of the Inq.p.m. was also sent to that court, and these records also survive at the National Archives classified as "WARD 7". When an Inq.p.m. had been held not as a result of a writ from chancery but under the escheator's own authority, the verdict was sent to the exchequer only.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, para.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value as historical source documents==
Inquisitions post mortem form a valuable source for historians and genealogists, as they not only detail the familial relationships of many of the English nobility and gentry, but also provide information on the history of individual [[manor]]s, including their size and forms of tenure by which they were held.&lt;ref name=Lyon478&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; They thus constitute "one of the most important sources for the social and economic history of mediaeval England".&lt;ref&gt;Winchester University, stated in several passages&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide summaries and terms of settlements made during the lifetime of the deceased, for example settlement to feoffees, the original copy of which has rarely survived.

==Example==
The following example of the abstracted Latin inq.p.m. of William Pagam (d.1422), published in 1995 as no. 932 in vol. 20, 6–10 Henry V, of the ''Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem'', illustrates many common elements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Writ 24 July 1422. Hampshire. Inquisition. Alton, 26 Aug.
He held of the king in-chief in his demesne as of fee the manor of Drayton, annual value 8 marks, for 6s. 8d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas and providing at his own expense for 15 days a hobbler to keep the castle in time of war. By an indenture of 26 Oct. 1418, shown to the jurors, William Tauk, Robert Monkeston and Thomas Welegh, who were seised in their demesne as of fee, granted the manor of Pury, a messuage, carucate and 13 acres meadow, 40 a. pasture and 20 a. wood at "la Bere juxta Southwyke" as lands and tenements in Pury, Badley, "Colvyle", "Holdmede", and "Bere", to William Pagam and his wife Agnes, who survives, for life of Agnes, remainder to William and his heirs in fee simple. The manor of Pury, annual value 6 marks, is held of the king in chief, service unknown. The messuage, carucate, arable, meadow, pasture and wood at "le Bere" annual value 40s. are held of the king in chief for 7s. 4d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas. He died on 15 July last. Philip Pagam is his son and next heir, aged 6 years and more. C 138/63, no.26A"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here the manor of Drayton is held by the [[Feudal land tenure|feudal military tenure]] of [[castle-guard]]; the manor of Pury had been transferred to feoffees to uses, and was re-granted by them in 1418 back to William and his wife for their uses under trust.

==Calendars of Inq.p.m's.==
Printed [[Calendar (archives)|calendars]] (abstracted summaries) of almost all the rolls of Inq.p.m.'s have been published in some form, with the exception of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1660. An extensive series of calendars extending from the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to that of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and with an appendix of lists to the reign of [[James VI and I]], was published in four volumes by the [[Record Commission]] between 1806 and 1828, edited by [[John Caley]] and [[John Bayley (antiquary)|John Bayley]]. However, these volumes were later judged by Sir [[Henry Maxwell Lyte]] to be of "unsatisfactory character", and to contain many omissions. In 1865 two volumes were published, covering the reigns of Henry III and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in a new series edited by Charles Roberts entitled ''Calendarium Genealogicum'', which concentrated on providing the names of heirs omitted from the previous publications, designed to be of particular use to genealogists. In 1898 the production of three volumes covering the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (1485–1509) was started, and was completed in 1955. In 1904 the first volume of a new series of Inq.p.m.'s was published, intended to be more complete and systematic, under Maxwell Lyte's editorship. It covered the reign of Henry III, from 1236, when the practice of producing inq.p.m.'s began. This "first series" continued for 26 volumes, the last volume having been published in 2009, although volumes were not published in chronological order. [[Winchester University]] and the [[Department of Digital Humanities]] at [[King's College London]] are currently working on a project to publish on-line in searchable format a revised and expanded series of all existing texts covering the years 1236–1447 and 1485–1509.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk |title=Inquisitions Post Mortem – Mapping the Medieval Countryside: properties, places &amp; people |accessdate=19 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also aims in the long-term to produce calendars for the first time of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1542. A number of county [[Text publication society|record societies]] have published calendars of Inq.p.m.'s relating to their own counties, abstracted from the chancery and exchequer rolls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">The '''Iron Fist Campaign''' was a [[compulsory sterilization]] program conducted in the summer of 2010 by family planning officials in [[Puning]], a county in [[Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"&gt;{{cite news | title = Breaking China's One-Child Law | author = Haworth, Abigail | pages = 136&amp;ndash;139 | date = December 2010 | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | publisher = Marie Claire | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/latest/chinas-one-child-law }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|One-child policy}}
In 1979, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] introduced the [[one-child policy]], which legally prevents couples from having more than one child, though there are some exemptions. The policy was created to address the country's overpopulation issue and economic problems.

By 2010, family planning efforts in [[Puning]] had diminished due to rapid economic growth in the area, as [[Guangdong]] had become the most successful manufacturing region in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"/&gt; However, local family planning officials were pressured to reduce births to meet the nationwide quotas. Chen Hong-Ping, the regional Communist Party chief, launched the Iron Fist Campaign in order to meet these demands.&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"/&gt;

== Campaign ==
In April 2010, a task force of approximately 600 local officials&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"/&gt; targeted 9,559 women who had violated the country's one-child policy.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7599440/Chinese-officials-launch-campaign-to-sterilise-10000.html | title = Chinese officials launch campaign to sterilise 10,000 | date = 16 April 2010 | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women were required to report to government clinics to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]].&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"/&gt; Family members of those women who had refused sterilization were detained indefinitely until the women complied with the procedure.&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;{{cite news | title = China To Sterilise 10,000 To Curb Births | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/China-Authorities-Plan-To-Sterilise-10000-People-To-Ensure-They-Meet-Family-Planning-Targets/Article/201004415613125? | publisher = Sky News | author = Sharp, Peter | date = 23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the women themselves were detained.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news | title = Chinese state holds parents hostage in sterilisation drive | author = Bland, Archie | date = 17 April 2010 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chinese-state-holds-parents-hostage-in-sterilisation-drive-1947236.html | publisher = Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 20-day campaign, 1,377 people were detained.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; From April to June, over 9,000 women were reported to have been sterilized as a result of the campaign.&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
News of the campaign did not make major headlines outside of local newspapers. He Yafu, an independent expert on family planning in China, suggested that the central government made an effort to conceal the results of the campaign because Chinese law specifically prohibited the means used to enforce it.&lt;ref name="MarieClaire"/&gt; Provincial officials have reported that the local Puning authorities will be investigated to determine the legality of their actions.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; [[Kate Allen (Amnesty International)|Kate Allen]] of [[Amnesty International]] described the campaign as "appalling" and voiced her opinion that "authorities must condemn this practice immediately".&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12360">'''Isaac Lampronti''' (February 3, 1679 – November 16, 1756) was an Italian rabbi and physician, best known as author of the rabbinic encyclopedia ''Paħad Yitzħak''.

Lampronti was born at [[Ferrara]].  His great-grandfather, [[Samuel Lampronti]], had emigrated from Constantinople to Ferrara in the sixteenth century. His father, a man of wealth, died when Isaac was six years of age. Isaac was sent to school in his eighth year, his teachers being [[Shabbethai Elhanan Recanati]] and [[S. E. Sanguineti]]. In his fourteenth year he went to [[Lugo]], to the school of R. [[Manoah Provençal]]; thence he went to [[Padua]] to study medicine, attending at the same time lectures on philosophy. There he enjoyed especially the intercourse and instruction of the physician R. [[Isaac Cantarini]].

On completing his medical studies he was employed as teacher for a time in various Italian cities, and on his return to his native city the ''[[yeshibah]]'' conferred upon him the title of ''[[ḥaber]]''. Shortly afterward he went to Mantua to complete his rabbinical studies under R. [[Judah Brial]] and R. [[Joseph Cases]], who also was a physician. Lampronti entered into especially close relations with R. Judah, whom he frequently mentions in his great work. When Mantua was threatened with war, in 1701, Lampronti, following the wishes of his family, returned to Ferrara, where he established himself as physician and teacher, delivering lectures for adults in his house both on week-days and on the Sabbath.

==Teacher==
[[File:0 Casa Isacco Lampronti - Ferrara - Via Vignatagliata 33 - 01.jpg|thumb|House of via Vignatagliata, [[Ferrara]].]]
In 1709 Lampronti was appointed teacher at the Italian Talmud Torah, receiving a monthly salary of twelve ''[[scudi]]'' in return for devoting the larger part of his day to teaching chiefly Hebrew grammar, arithmetic, and Italian. Lampronti gave his pupils his own homilies on the weekly sections, composed in Italian, for practise in translating into Hebrew. He also set some of his pupils to copy from the sources material which he needed for the encyclopedic work he had undertaken.

The directors of the community, who thought this interfered with his duties as teacher, forbade him, in October, 1725, to keep the material for his work in the schoolhouse. When the Spanish Talmud Torah was discontinued, in 1729, the pupils of this school also passed into the hands of Lampronti. Thus he became the teacher of most of the members of the community, and long after his death it was said in the community of Ferrara, "All the learning found among us is derived from the mouth of our father Isaac."

In addition to his duties as teacher he filled the position of preacher, from 1704, in the [[Sephardic]] community, and, beginning with 1717, in the Italian synagogue. His sermons, which were very popular, have not been preserved. He mentions one of them, on truth and untruth, in referring to his "Sefer ha-Derushim Shelli" in an article of his "Paḥad Yiẓḥaḳ" (letter מ, article ). His funeral oration ("Darke Shalom") on [[Samson Morpurgo]] he mentions in his approbation to the latter's responsa "Shemesh Ẓedaḳah." His name is connected with an [[Ark of the Law]] in the Sephardic synagogue at Ferrara, placed there by him in 1710, at his own cost.

In 1718 Lampronti was appointed a full member of the rabbinical college. His signature as the latest member, following those of [[Mordecai Zahalon]], Shabbethai Elhanan Recanati, and [[Samuel Baruch Borghi]], is found in a responsum of the ''yeshibah'' of Ferrara of the year 1727, which he quotes (letter ב, p.&amp;nbsp;20d).

In 1738 he was elected rabbi of the Spanish synagogue in place of his former teacher, Recanati; and after the death of [[Mordecai Zahalon]] he became president of the ''yeshibah'' (1749). He began immediately the printing of his great work (see below). He had then reached the age of seventy, and for the next eight years until his death, he taught continuously, although he had to be taken to the school by his pupils on account of an ailment of his feet.

Notwithstanding his other occupations, he continued to practise medicine, visiting his patients early in the morning, because, as he said, the physician has a surer eye and can judge better of the state of his patient after the night's rest. He had a great reputation as physician, and his contemporaries generally added to his name the epithet "the famous physician."

He corresponded on medical subjects with his teacher Isaac Cantarini, and he drew upon his medical knowledge in many passages of his work.

He died deeply mourned by the community and his numerous pupils. No stone was erected on his grave, for half a year before his death the tombstones of the Jewish cemetery of Ferrara had been destroyed at the instigation of the clergy (Ferrara belonged to the [[Papal States]]), and the Jews were at the same time forbidden to place stones on the graves of their dead. More than a century later, Ferrara publicly honored the memory of Lampronti; on April 19, 1872, a stone tablet, for which Jews and Christians had contributed, was placed on the house in which he had lived; it bears the following inscription: "Abitò in questa casa Isacco Lampronti, nato nel MDCLXXIX., morto nel MDCCLVI. Medico Teologo tra i dotti celebratissimo. Onorò la patria. Riverenti alla scienza alcuni cittadini posero MDCCCLXXII."

==The "Pachad Yitzchak"==

Lampronti's life-work was his rabbinical encyclopedia ''Pachad Yitzchak'' (name derived from Gen. xxxi. 42), the material for which he had begun to collect as early as his student days at Mantua, and on which he worked during his whole life. When he decided in his old age to publish this great work, he traveled together with his pupil [[Jacob Raphael Saraval]], as the latter says in the preface of the correctors (Saraval and [[Simchah Calimani]]), through the Italian cities in order to secure the approbations (''[[haskamot]]'') of the rabbinical authorities of Italy for the work.

The collection of these approbations, which were given in 1749 and 1750, is a curious monument of the Jewish scholars of northern Italy in the eighteenth century; it includes sonnets and poems in other forms in honor of Lampronti. The following cities are represented by their yeshibahs or rabbis: Venice, Leghorn, Reggio, Verona, Ancona, Padua, Mantua, Casale Monferrato, Modena, Turin, Florence, Alessandria della Paglia, Pesaro, Finale, Lugo, Rovigo. In the second volume are added the approbations of R. [[Malachi ben Jacob Kohn]] of Livorno, author of the "Yad Mal'achi," and of three Palestinian scholars stopping at Ferrara.

The work was planned to fill six volumes, as recorded in the printing permit of the Jewish communal directorate of Venice. But only the first volume and the first half of the second volume appeared during the author's lifetime. Vol. i. (1750) contains in two specially paged sections (of 124 and 76 folios respectively) the letter א; the first part of vol. ii. (1753) contains the letters ב (fol. 1-75) and ו (fol. 76-105). The second part of vol. ii. appeared forty years after the author's death (1796); it contains the letters ח (fol. 1-49), ו (fol. 50-60), ן (fol. 67-77), ח, beginning (78-110). Vol. iii. appeared in the same year; it contains: ח, end (fol. 1-61), ט (fol. 63-93). These volumes were printed at the press of [[Isaac Foa]] (formerly Bragadini) at Venice. Two other volumes appeared in 1813 (vol. iv., Reggio) and 1840 (vol. v., Leghorn); vol. iv. contains the letters י (fol. 1-41a.), ב (fol. 41a-108); ל (specially paged, 1-26); vol. v. contains the letter מ (241 fols.). This last-named volume contains additions to the text by [[Abraham Baruch Piperno]], under the title "Zechor le-Abraham."

In 1845 the autograph manuscript of the entire work was acquired by the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, in 120 volumes, 68 of which corresponded with the parts that had so far appeared. The Paris manuscript also contains the author's Italian correspondence, which was not included in the edition (see Cat. Hebr. MSS. Bibliothèque Nationale. p.&amp;nbsp;61. Nos. 458-577). The society [[Mekitze Nirdamim]], on its foundation, took as one of its first tasks the publication of those portions of Lampronti's work which had not yet been printed. The first to appear (in octavo instead of folio, the size of the previous volumes) were the letters נ (1864; 100 fols.), ס (1866; 196 fols.), ע (1868; 173 fols.), פ (1871; 74 fols.), and צ and first half of ק (1874; 200 fols.). The work was continued ten years later by the reorganized society Mekitze Nirdamim; during 1885-87 the remainder of the letter ק was published and the letters ר (148 fols.), ש (318 fols.), and ח (183 fols.). Thus the publication of the work was completed 127 years after the printing of the first volume.

===Character of the work===

Lampronti's work is an alphabetically arranged encyclopedia to the ''[[Talmud]]'' and Talmudic literature. In the censor's permit, dated June, 1749, prefixed to the first volume, it is designated as "Dizionario Rituale in Lingua Ebraica," a designation which probably originated with the author. As a matter of fact Lampronti's encyclopedia deals chiefly with the [[halakha|Halachah]], the material for the articles being taken from the entire halachic literature down to the latest responsa, which he had, in part, in manuscript. He devotes much space to discussing questions of ritual law, as found in the responsa of contemporary Italian rabbis. On some questions he gives the entire correspondence, as on fols. 9d-13a, 31d-37d, 46d-50a, 74b-76a, 79c-80b, 102b-107a, in the first volume.

The arrangement is a characteristic feature of the work. Single words are used occasionally as headings for his articles, but more frequently he uses entire sentences, either as he found them in the sources, or as propositions derived from the sources. In vol. i. thirty articles begin with the word&lt;?&gt; ; and a special article, besides, refers to about one hundred other articles of the work in which this concept is treated (see Jew. Encyc. ii. 215-218). About one hundred articles begin with the word&lt;?&gt;, and a special article refers to as many more in which the word occurs. The articles are arranged in strictly alphabetical order, this being especially important in a work of this kind. The quotations are accompanied by an exact statement of their sources. In addition to the Halakah much space is devoted to the Haggadah of the Talmuds, and the work may also be regarded as an alphabetical index of the Talmudic haggadic sentences.

It may be noted as a curious instance that in the article  (ii. 766) Lampronti refers to a work in Italian, the title of which he quotes in carefully punctuated Hebrew transcription: "Demostrazioni della Essenza di Dio dalle Opere della sua Creazione; da Guglielmo Deram [], Firenze, 1719." Lampronti's work has not yet been critically examined, nor has a list been made of the sources which he used or quoted. Addenda made by Lampronti are preserved in the library of the Talmud Torah at Ferrara; according to Rabbi [[Benedetto Isaac Levi]] of Ferrara, the author of a short biography of Lampronti ("Ha-Maggid," xix. 70), there are thirty-five folios, most of the leaves of which are, however, blank. But the addenda which are scattered through the several volumes of the work itself would if collected make a stout volume.

Lampronti's elder son, [[Samuel Ḥay]], is mentioned in the article ; his younger son, [[Solomon Lampronti]], was a physician, like his father, and versed in rabbinical lore.

'''Lion dance''' ({{zh|s=舞狮|t=舞獅|p=wǔshī}}) is a form of traditional [[dance]] in [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] and other Asian countries in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume to bring good luck and fortune. The lion dance is usually performed during the [[Chinese New Year]] and other Chinese traditional, cultural and religious festivals. It may also be performed at important occasions such as business opening events, special celebrations or wedding ceremonies, or may be used to honour special guests by the Chinese communities.

The Chinese lion dance is sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[dragon dance]] by most first timers. An easy way to tell the difference is that a lion is normally operated by just two dancers and has a tail, while a dragon is longer and is held on poles by many people. Chinese lion dance fundamental movements can be found in [[Chinese martial arts]].

There are two main forms of the Chinese lion dance, the Northern Lion and the Southern Lion. Both forms are commonly found in China, but around the world especially in South East Asia, the Southern Lion predominates as it was spread by the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]] communities who are historically mostly of Southern Chinese origin. The Southern Lion consists of three styles, Hok San, Fut San and Fut Hok. Versions of the lion dance are also found in [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Tibet]] and [[Vietnam]]. Another form of lion dance exists in [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]], but it may be of a different tradition and may be referred to as ''Singa [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]]''.

There were different versions of the dance in the Tang Dynasty.  In the Tang court, the lion dance was called the Great Peace Music (太平樂, ''Taiping yue'') or the Lion Dance of the Five Directions (五方師子舞) where five large lions of different colours and expressing different moods were each led and manipulated on rope by two persons, and accompanied by 140 singers.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E9%80%9A%E5%85%B8/%E5%8D%B7146 |title=通典/卷146 |work=[[Tongdian]] }} Original text: 太平樂，亦謂之五方師子舞。師子摯獸，出於西南夷天竺、師子等國。綴毛為衣，象其俛仰馴狎之容。二人持繩拂，為習弄之狀。五師子各依其方色，百四十人歌太平樂，舞抃以從之，服飾皆作崑崙象。&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, the 5 lions were described as each over 3 metres tall and each had 12 "lion lads", who may tease the lions with red whisks.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0U5DzTBknQC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mooncakes and Hungry Ghosts: Festivals of China |author1=Carol Stepanchuk |author2=Charles Choy Wong |page=38 |publisher=China Books &amp; Periodicals |year= 1992 |isbn=978-0835124812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E6%A8%82%E5%BA%9C%E9%9B%9C%E9%8C%84 |title=樂府雜錄 |work= Yuefu Zalu |quote=Original text: 戲有五方獅子，高丈餘，各衣五色。每一獅子有十二人，戴紅抹額，衣畫衣，執紅拂子，謂之「獅子郎」，舞《太平樂》曲。}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another version of the lion dance was described by the Tang poet [[Bai Juyi]] in his poem "[[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]] Arts" (西凉伎), where the dance was performed by two ''hu'' (胡, meaning here non-Han people from Central Asia) dancers who wore a lion costume made of a wooden head, a silk tail and furry body, with eyes gilded with gold and teeth plated with silver as well as ears that moved, a form that resembles today's Lion Dance.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shicimingju.com/baidu/list/63979.html |title=《西凉伎》 |quote=西凉伎，假面胡人假狮子。刻木为头丝作尾，金镀眼睛银贴齿。奋迅毛衣摆双耳，如从流沙来万里。紫髯深目两胡儿，鼓舞跳粱前致辞。 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ky8yCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144 |title=唐詩趣談 |author= 陳正平 |publisher=  Taiwan study published Ltd. |pages= 140 &amp;ndash;145|date= 2000 |isbn= 978-9866318580}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the eighth century, this lion dance had reached Japan.  During the [[Song Dynasty]] the lion dance was commonly performed in festivals and it was known as the Northern Lion during the [[Southern Song]].

The Southern Lion is a later development in the south of China originating in the [[Guangdong]] province. There are a number of myths associated with the origin of the Southern Lion: one story relates that the dance originated as a celebration in a village where a mythical monster called [[Nian]] was successfully driven away;&lt;ref name="asian"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcvA373XEJwC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Material Culture|editors= Marianne Hulsbosch, Elizabeth Bedford, Martha Chaiklin |pages=112–118|publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMQeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA354&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of China: History and Culture |editor= Dorothy Perkins |page=354 |publisher=Facts On File Inc |year= 1998 |isbn=978-0816026937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; another has it that the [[Qianlong Emperor]] dreamt of an auspicious animal while on a tour of Southern China, and ordered that the image of the animal be recreated and used during festivals.  However it is likely that the Southern Lion of [[Guangzhou]] is an adaptation of the Northern Lion to local myths and characteristics, perhaps during the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="china daily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/shanxi/2013-10/18/content_17044270.htm |title=Lion Dance |work=China Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_228/node_233/node_238/2009/02/13/123451693260220.shtml |title=South Lion: the Guangzhou Lion Dance |date=13 February 2009 |work=Life of Guangzhou }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional types==
The two main types of lion dance in China are the Northern and Southern Lions.  There are however also a number of local forms of lion dance in different regions of China, and some of these lions may have significantly differences in appearance, for example the Green Lion (青獅, Qing Shi) popular with the [[Hokkien people]] and Taiwanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lohanlion.com/lionsoftaiwan.htm |title=Taipei (Taiwanese Lion) |work=Shaolin Lohan Pai Dance Troupe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810043408/http://www.lohanlion.com/lionsoftaiwan.htm |archivedate=2014-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rclib.com.cn/gx/fy_qs.htm |title= 狮舞（青狮）项目简介 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ethnic minorities groups in China may also have their own lion dances, for examples the lion dance of the Muslim minority in [[Shenqiu County]] in [[Henan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henan.gov.cn/10ztzl/system/2011/11/17/010277054.shtml |title=沈丘回族文狮舞 |publisher=The People's Government of Henan Province }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wenshizi.com/wenshizi/114.html |title=沈丘槐店文狮舞1 |work=回族文狮子文化网 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204012210/http://wenshizi.com/wenshizi/114.html |archivedate=2014-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese lion dances usually involve two dancers but may also be performed by one. The larger lions manipulated by two persons may be referred to as great lions (太獅), and those manipulated by one person little lions (少獅).  The performances may also be broadly divided into civil (文獅) and martial (武獅) styles.  The civil style emphasizes the character and mimics and behaviour of the lion, while the martial style is focused on acrobatics and energetic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ky8yCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 |title=唐詩趣談 |author= 陳正平 |publisher=  Taiwan study published Ltd. |page= 146|date= 2000 |isbn= 978-9866318580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are related forms of dances with mask figures that represent mythical creatures such as the [[Qilin]]  and [[Pixiu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelionarts.com/branch.html |title=Besides The Lion |work=The Lion Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Qilin dance is most commonly performed by the [[Hakka people]] who were originally from northern China, but have largely settled in the south of China and southeast Asia in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chinesemartialstudies.com/2013/02/10/qilin-dancing-during-the-lunar-new-year-and-southern-chinese-martial-culture/ |title=Qilin Dancing During the Lunar New Year and Southern Chinese Martial Culture|work=Kung Fu Tea }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poseidonbooks.com/hakkabook.htm |title=The Hakka Chinese: Their Origin, Folk Songs And Nursery Rhymes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of lion dance are also found widely in East Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, as well as among the communities in the Himalayan region.

===Chinese Northern Lion===
[[File:ChineseVarietyart HumanLion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Northern Lion Dance in a variety show]]
The Chinese Northern Lion ({{zh|t=北獅|s=北狮|hp=Běi shī|links=no}}) Dance is often performed as a pair of male and female lions in the north of China. Northern lions may have a gold-painted wooden head, and shaggy orange and yellow hair with a red bow on its head to indicate a male lion, or a green bow (sometimes green hair) to represent a female.&lt;ref name="different lions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelionarts.com/difference.html |title=The Difference in Lion Dance |work=The Lion Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are however regional variations of the lion.

Northern lions resemble [[Pekingese]] or [[Chinese guardian lions|Fu Dogs]], and its movements are lifelike during a performance. Acrobatics are very common, with stunts like lifts, or balancing on a tiered platform or on a giant ball. Northern lions sometimes appear as a family, with two large "adult" lions and a pair of small "young lions".  There are usually two performers in one adult lion, and one in the young lion.  There may also be a "warrior" character who holds a spherical object and leads the lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AxIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT636&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Americans: An Encyclopedia of Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political History |editors=Xiaojian Zhao, Edward J.W. Park, PH.D |chapter=Chinese Lion Dance in the United States |author=Benji Chang |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=2013 |isbn=978-1598842395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance of the Northern Lion is generally more playful than the Southern Lion.  Regions with well-known lion dance troupes include [[Xushui]] in [[Hebei]] province, and [[Ninghai]] in [[Ningbo]]. There are a number of variations of the lion dance performance, for example the Heavenly Tower Lion Dance ({{zh|t=天塔獅舞|s=天塔狮舞|hp=Tiān tǎ shī wǔ|links=no}}) from [[Xiangfen County]] in [[Shanxi]] is a performance whereby a number of lions climb up a tall tower structure constructed out of wooden stools,&lt;ref name="china daily"/&gt; and there are also high-wire acts involving lions

===Chinese Southern Lion===
[[File:Chinese New Year Lion Dance.jpg|thumb|left|A Southern Lion Dance performance]]

The Chinese Southern Lion ({{zh|t=南獅|s=南狮|hp=Nán shī|links=no}}) or Cantonese Lion dance originated from [[Guangdong]]. The Southern Lion has a single horn, and is associated with the legend of a mythical monster called [[Nian]].  The lion consists of a head which is traditionally constructed using [[papier-mâché]] over a bamboo frame covered with gauze, then painted and decorated with fur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chineseliondancers.webs.com/makingalionhead.htm |title=Making a Chinese Lion Head |work=The Chinese Art of Lion Dancing |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165538/http://chineseliondancers.webs.com/makingalionhead.htm |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fom.sg/Passage/2013/03liondance.pdf |title=The Lion Dance Costume Maker |author=Lim Chey Cheng|work=Friends of the Museums }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a body made of durable layered cloth trimmed with more fur.  Newer lions however may be made with modern materials such as aluminium instead of bamboo and are lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&amp;dat=19960212&amp;id=34pOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ox8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5316,673063&amp;hl=en |title=Lion Dance King |author=Chow Ee-Tan |work=New Straits Times |date= February 12, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer versions may also apply shinier modern material over the traditional lacquer such as sequin or laser sticker but they do not last as long as those with semi-dull lacquer. Depending on the lion type (Traditional or Modern), Different types of fur can be used.

There are two main styles of [[Guangdong]] or Cantonese Lion: the ''Fut San'' or ''[[Foshan|Fo Shan]]'' ({{zh|c=佛山|hp=Fúshān|j=|l=Buddha Mountain|links=no}}), and the ''Hok San'' or ''[[Heshan, Guangdong|He Shan]]'' ({{zh|t=鶴山|s=鹤山|hp=hèshān|j=|l=Crane Mountain|links=no}}), both named after their place of origin.  Other minor styles include the Fut-Hok (a hybrid of Fut San and Hok San created in Singapore by Kong Chow Wui Koon in the 1960s), and the [[Jow Ga]] (performed by practitioners of Jow family style kung fu).&lt;ref name="different lions"/&gt;  The different lion types can be identified from the design of the lion head.

Fo Shan is the style many kung fu schools adopt. It requires power in moves and strength in posture, using kung fu stances to help with the sharp movements and emotions, and only the most advanced students are allowed to perform.  Traditionally, the Fo Shan lion has bristles instead of fur and is heavier than the modern ones now popularly used.  It also has a very long tail and eyes that swivel left and right. On the back there are gold foiled rims and a gilded area called the collar where the troupe's name may be sewn on. All the traditional style Fo Shan have pop-up teeth on the side on the head, tongue, and swiveling eyes. The underside of the tail is white; the designs of the tail are also more square and contain a diamond pattern going down the back, and often has bells attached to the tail. It has a high forehead, curved lips and a sharp horn on its head.&lt;ref name="different lions"/&gt;   Traditional Fo Shan lions are ornate in appearance, a number of regional styles however have developed around the world.  The newer styles of Fo Shan lions replace all the bristles with fur and the tails are shorter. The eyes are fixed in place, and the tongue and teeth do not pop up. The tail is more curvy in design, does not have a diamond pattern, and lacks bells.

The He Shan style lion is known for its richness of expression, unique footwork, impressive-looking appearance and vigorous drumming style. The founder of this style is thought to be the "Canton Lion King" Feng Gengzhang ({{zh|t=馮庚長|s=冯庚长|hp=Féng Gēngzhǎng|j=|links=no}}) in the early 20th century. Feng was born in a village in [[Heshan, Guangdong|He Shan county]] in Guangdong, and he was instructed in martial arts and lion dance by his father. Later, he also studied martial arts and Southern lion dance in [[Foshan]] before returning to his hometown and setting up his own training hall. He developed his unique version of lion dance, creating new techniques by studying and mimicking movement of cats, such as "catching mouse, playing, catching birds, high escape, lying low and rolling".  He and his disciples also made changes to the lion head, its forehead is lower, its horn rounded and it has a duck beak mouth with flat lips.&lt;ref name="different lions"/&gt; The body of the lion is also more powerful in structure with eye-catching colours.  Together with new dance steps and agile footwork, a unique rhythm invented by Feng called the "Seven Star Drum", Feng created a new style of lion dancing that is high in entertainment value and visual appeal. In the early 1920s, the He Shan lion dance was performed when [[Sun Yat-Sen]] assumed office in Guangzhou, and created a stir. Around 1945, He Shan lion performers were often invited to perform in many places within China and Southeast Asia during celebratory festivals.  The He Shan style became very popular in Singapore; the lion acquired the title of "Lion King of Kings", and has a "king" character ({{lang|zh-hant|王}}) on its forehead.  Further improvement had been made by the Singapore Hok San Association, for example making the lion more "cat-like" by shortening the tail of He Shan lion, and creating new drum beat for the dance.

Different colors are used to signify the age and character of the lions.  The lion with white fur is considered to be the oldest of the lions, while the lion with golden yellow fur is the middle child.  The black lion is considered the youngest lion, and the movement of this lion should be fast like a young child or a headstrong teenager.  The colors may also represent the character of the lion: the golden lion represents liveliness, the red lion courage, and the green lion friendship. There are also three lion types that represent three historical characters recorded in the classic [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] who were blood oath brothers that swore to restore the Han dynasty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lohanlion.com/southernlions.htm |title=Southern (Cantonese) Lions |work=Shaolin Lohan Pai Lion Dance Troupe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201164614/http://www.lohanlion.com/southernlions.htm |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://163.32.84.104/97group/020/ |title=醒獅的由來 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627021537/http://163.32.84.104/97group/020/ |archivedate=2008-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hok san lion dance has been adopted by many modern groups, leaving only a few traditional groups - main Jow Ga related.

[[Image:New York lion dance lion.jpg|right|thumb|A Cantonese [[Guan Yu|Guan Gong (Kwan Kung)]] lion ushers in the [[Chinese New Year]] in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], [[New York City]] ([[United States|USA]]).]]
* The ''[[Liu Bei]]'' (Cantonese: ''Lau Pei'') lion is the eldest of the three brothers and has a yellow (actually imperial yellow as he became the first emperor of the [[Shu-Han]] Kingdom) based face with white beard and fur (to denote his wisdom). It sports a multi coloured tail (with white underside) signifying the colors of the five elements. Older Liu Bei lions also have black in the tail while the new ones do not. There are three coins on the collar.  This lion is used by schools with an established Martial art master (''Sifu'') or organization and is known as the ''Rui Shi'' ({{zh|t=瑞獅|s=瑞狮|hp=Ruì Shī|j=|l=Auspicious Lion|links=no}}).
* The ''[[Guan Yu|Guan Gong]]'' (Cantonese: ''Kwan Kung'') lion has a red based face, black bristles, with a long black beard (as he was also known as the "Duke with the Beautiful Beard"). The tail is red and black with white trim and a white underside. He is known as the second brother and sports two coins on the collar. This Lion is known as the ''Xing Shi'' ({{zh|t=醒獅|s=醒狮|hp=Xǐng Shī|j=|l=Awakened Lion|links=no}}).
* The ''[[Zhang Fei]]'' (Cantonese: ''Cheung Fei'') lion has a black based face with short black beard, small ears, and black bristles. The tail is black and white with white trim and a white underside. Traditionally this lion also had bells attached to the body. Being the youngest of the three brothers, there is only a single coin on the collar. This Lion is known as the ''Dou Shi'' ({{zh|t=鬥獅|s=斗狮|hp=Dòu Shī|j=|l=Fighting Lion|links=no}}) because Zhang Fei had a quick temper and loved to fight. This lion is used by clubs that were just starting out or by those wishing to make a challenge.&lt;ref name="lion dancers"/&gt;

Later three more Lions were added to the group. The Green Faced Lion represented [[Zhao Yun]] or Zhao (Cantonese: Chiu) Zi Long. The Zhao Zi Long lion is a green lion with a green tail with black trim and a white underside, as well as a white beard and fur and an iron horn. He is often called the fourth brother, this lion is called the Heroic Lion because it is said he rode through Cao Cao’s million man army and rescued Liu Bei’s infant and fought his way back out. The Yellow (yellow/orange) face and body with white beard represented [[Huang Zhong]] (Cantonese: Wong Tsung), he was given this color when Liu Bei rose to become Emperor. The Huang Joon has a full yellow tail with white trim.  This lion is called the Righteous Lion.  The white lion is known as [[Ma Chao]] (Cantonese: Ma Chiu), he was assigned this color because he always wore a white arm band in his battle against the Emperor of Wei, Cao Cao, to signify that he was in mourning for his father and brother who had been murdered by Cao Cao. Thus this lion was known as the funeral lion. This lion is never used except for the funeral of a Master or an important head of a group, and in such cases the lion is usually burned right after use as it is symbolically inauspicious to be kept around.  This lion is sometimes confused with the silver lion which sometimes has a whitish colouring. These three along with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were known as the "Five Tiger Generals of Shun," each representing one of the colors of the five elements.&lt;ref name="lion dancers"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828021348/http://chineseliondancers.webs.com/Hidden_Meanings.htm |archivedate=28 August 2011 |url=http://chineseliondancers.webs.com:80/Hidden_Meanings.htm |title=Hidden Meanings In the Southern Cantonese Lion Dance Costume |work=Chinese Lion Dancers |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green lion===
Green Lion (青狮) is the lion dance form associated with the province of [[Fujian]] and the [[Southern Min Chinese|Hokkien]]-speaking [[Hoklo people|people]].  It is similar to the Chinese southern lion dance, except that the lion is mainly green in color and has a distinct round flat mask. It is believed to have originated in the anti-[[Manchu]] movements after the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1644. The word "green lion" in the Hokkien language sounds similar to "Qing army" (清师). During training sessions for fighters, the Green lion was fitted with blades symbolizing the Manchurian army and would become a moving target for trainees.&lt;ref name="green lion"/&gt; It is said that after the fall of [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912, martial arts expert Mr. Gan De Yuan (干德源) organized a performance in [[Quanzhou]] where the Green Lion was dismembered to represent the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. From that point onwards, the Green Lion is used without the blades and performed for cultural and ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="green lion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinatownology.com/green_lion.html |title=Green Lion 青狮 |work=Chinatownology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnamese Lion===
[[File:Múa Lân.jpg|thumb|left|Vietnamese Unicorn and Ông Địa at the 2014 Tết Parade in Little Saigon, CA]]

The lion dance is known in Vietnam as the [[Qilin|unicorn]] dance ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: {{lang|vi|múa lân}}).  Most lions in Vietnam resemble the Southern Lion – they are part of the Chinese Southern Lion tradition but have acquired local characteristics.  There are however also distinct local forms that differ significantly in appearance and performance, for example the lion dances of the [[Tay people|Tay]] and [[Nùng people|Nung]] minority people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vietnam-holidays.co.uk/travel-blogs/lion-dance-tay-nung-ethnic-culture |title=Lion Dance in Tay and Nung Ethnic Culture |work=Haivenu Travel Blogs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Nhã nhạc|court version]] of the dance is performed at the Duyet Thi Duong Theatre within the ground of the [[Imperial City, Huế|royal palace]] in [[Huế]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.vietnamdance.com/2011/04/nha-nhac-of-hue-court/ |title=Nha Nhac of Hue Court |date=April 15, 2011 |work=Vietnamese Dance }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:ThéâtreRoyal.jpg|thumb|300px|Lion dance performance at Duyet Thi Duong, [[Huế]]]]
The dance is performed primarily at traditional festivals such as [[Tết|Vietnamese lunar new year]] (''{{lang|vi|Tết}}'')  and [[Mid-Autumn Festival#Vietnam|Mid-Autumn Festival]] (''{{lang|vi|Tết trung thu}}''), as well as during other occasions such as the opening of a new business. The dance is typically accompanied by [[martial artists]] and [[acrobatics]]. A feature of the Vietnamese unicorn dance is its dance partner ''Ông Địa'' or the spirit of the earth, depicted as a large bellied, broadly grinning man holding a palm-leaf fan similar to the Chinese 'Big Head Buddha' (大头佛).  The good-hearted spirit, according to popular beliefs, has the power to summon the auspicious unicorn, and thus during the dance, takes the lead in clearing the path for the unicorn. The comical appearance of Ông Địa adds to the festive and merry-making nature of the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phatgiaohoahaotexas.org/ongdia.htm |title=Ông Địa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304105416/http://www.phatgiaohoahaotexas.org/ongdia.htm |archivedate= March 4, 2007 |work=Phật Giáo Hòa Háo Texas }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vietnamese lion heads are made differently because it's missing its horn. This is because teams used to fight each other. This resulted in the horn being kicked off constantly. To solve this problem, many Vietnamese teams have requested no horns to make it harder for the opponent to damage the lion.

===Japanese Lion===
[[File:Miyazaki Shrine Grand Festival in 2008 Lion Dance 01.jpg|thumb|Festival of Miyazaki Shrine, Japan]]
Japan has a long tradition of the lion dance and the dance is known as ''{{transl|ja|shishi-mai}}'' ({{lang|ja|獅子舞}}) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].  It is thought to have been imported from China during the Tang Dynasty, and became associated with celebration of [[Buddha's Birthday]].  The first lion dance recorded in Japan was at the inauguration ceremonies of [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in 752.&lt;ref name="matsuri"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X_7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Matsuri: The Festivals of Japan: With a Selection from P.G.

It is also performed at other festivals and celebrations.  In some of these performances, the lions may bite people on the head to bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepjapan.org/a/2587 |title=Let a Lion Bite Your Head (for Good Luck) |work=Deep Japan |date= 15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hasedera monzenmachi Sakurai Nara pref Japan06bs.jpg|thumb|left|A Japanese lion dance performed by a single person accompanied by flute and drum musicians]] 

The lion dance has been completely absorbed into Japanese tradition. There are many different lion dances in Japan and the style of dancing and design of the lion may differ by region – it is believed that as many as 9,000 variations of the dance exist in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldphotosjapan.com/photos/670/new-year-celebrations-13 |title=Kobe, 1906  New Year Celebrations 13 |work=Old Photos of Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lion dance is also used in religious [[Shinto]] festivals as part of a performing art form called ''{{lang|ja|[[kagura]]}}''.  ''{{lang|ja|Shishi kagura}}'' may be found in different forms - for example the ''{{lang|ja|daikagura}}'' which is mainly acrobatic, the ''{{lang|ja|yamabushi kagura}}'', a type of theatrical performance done by ''[[yamabushi]]'' ascetics,&lt;ref name="bocking"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 |title=The Japanese Theatre: From Shamanistic Ritual to Contemporary Pluralism |author= Benito Ortolani |pages=26–27 |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 1995 |isbn= 978-0691043333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in ''bangaku'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Japanese Theatre: From Shamanistic Ritual to Contemporary Pluralism|author= Benito Ortolani|page=16 |publisher=Princeton University Press|year= 1995 |isbn=978-0691043333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=An Introduction to Japanese Folk Performing Arts|author= Terence Lancashire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srwnPCP_oyMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=7 |publisher=Ashgate|year= 2011|isbn=978-1409431336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of ''shishi'' dances are also found in ''[[noh]]'', ''[[kabuki]]'' (where the lion dances form a group of plays termed ''shakkyōmono''),&lt;ref name="shinto encyc"/&gt; and ''[[bunraku]]'' theatres.&lt;ref name="bocking"/&gt;
[[File:蜷城の獅子舞.JPG|thumb|Lion dance of Minagi shrine in [[Asakura, Fukuoka]]]]
The Japanese lion consists of a wooden, lacquered head called a ''{{lang|ja|shishi-gashira}}'' (lit. Lion Head), often with a characteristic body of green dyed cloth with white designs. It can be manipulated by a single person, or by two or more persons, one of whom manipulates the head. The one-man variety is most often seen in eastern Japan.&lt;ref name="shinto encyc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1019 |title=Shishi-mai |author=Yonei Teruyoshi |work=Encyclopedia of Shinto }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with Chinese lions, the make of the head and designs on the body will differ from region to region, and even from school to school.  The mask however may sometimes have horns appearing to be a deer (''{{lang|ja|shika}}''), and  ''{{lang|ja|shishi}}'' written with different [[Kanji]] characters can mean beast, deer or wild boar, for example as in ''{{lang|ja|shishi-odori}}'' (鹿踊, lit. [[Deer dance (folk dance)|Deer Dance]]). Historically the word ''shishi'' may refer to any wild four-legged animal, and some of these dances with different beasts may therefore also be referred to as ''shishi-mai''.&lt;ref name="matsuri"/&gt;  The dance may also sometimes feature [[Tiger dance|tigers]] (''{{lang|ja|tora}}'') or ''[[qilin]]'' (''{{lang|ja|kirin}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0TIfrZuq_YC&amp;pg=PA134 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto |author= Brian Bocking |page=134 |publisher=Routledge |year= 1997 |isbn=978-0700710515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Okinawa]], a similar dance exists, though the lion there is considered to be a legendary ''{{lang|ja|[[shisa]]}}''. The heads, bodies and behavior of the shisa in the dance are quite different from the ''{{lang|ja|shishi}}'' on mainland Japan. Instead of dancing to the sounds of flutes and drums, the Okinawan ''shisa'' dance is often performed to folk songs played with the ''{{lang|ja|[[sanshin]]}}''.

===Korean Lion===
[[File:Korean mask dance-Eunyul talchum-07.jpg|thumb|Korean lion dance from ''[[Eunyul talchum]]'']]

Lion dance was recorded in the Korean historical work ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' as "''{{lang|ko|Sanye}}''" (狻猊, the old Chinese word for lion), one of the five poems on the dances of the [[Silla]] kingdom written by [[Choe Chiwon]]. It may have been recorded as early as the [[Jinheung of Silla|King Jinheung]]'s reign in the 6th century during which a tune titled "The Lion's Talent" was composed that could be a reference to a lion dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_tmusic_detail.htm?no=107489 |title=Sounds of Korea &gt; Lion Dance |date=April 7, 2013 |work=KBS World Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main traditions of lion dance survive in Korea, the ''{{lang|ko|saja-noreum}}'', which is performed as an exorcism drama; and the ''{{lang|ko|sajach'um}}'' which is performed in association with masked dramas.&lt;ref name="korea"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r15cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary |editor1=Keith Pratt |editor2=Richard Rutt |page=271 |publisher=Routledge |year= 1999|isbn=978-0700704637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many of the traditional masked dance dramas, the lion dance appears as one part of a number of acts.

===Tibetan Lion===
[[File:Snow Lion Dance at the "Karma Temple" Bodhgaya 2 trimmed.jpg|thumb|Tibetan Snow Lion Dance, [[Bodhgaya]], India]]
In the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] and Tibetan area, there is also a lion dance called the snow lion dance.  This dance may be found in [[Tibet]] and also among [[Tibetan diaspora]] communities where it is called ''{{lang|bo|Senggeh Garcham}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tibetviews.com/?p=2431 |title=Tibetan Snow Lion Dance |work=Tibet Views }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nepal]], and parts of Northeastern [[India]] – among the [[Monpa people]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiatravelite.com/discoverindia/tawangfestival.htm |title=Tawang Festival |work=India Travel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125013331/http://indiatravelite.com/discoverindia/tawangfestival.htm |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sikkim]] where it is called ''[[Singhi Chham]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KeAES9dsUcC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dances of India |author= Shobhna Gupta |page=76 |publisher=Har-Anand |date=2007 |isbn=978-8124108666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some parts of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Ladakh]]. The name ''seng ge'' and its related forms come from [[Sanskrit]] ''siṅha'',&lt;ref name="snow lion"/&gt; and ''[[cham dance|cham]]'' is a Buddhist ritual dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tibetanmaterialhistory.wikischolars.columbia.edu/cham+dances |title=Cham dances |work=Material Tibet }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samyedharma.org/wisdom/gar-cham-meditative-dance-lama-dance/ |title=Gar Cham – Meditative Dance – "Lama Dance" |work=Samye }}&lt;/ref&gt; The snow lion has white fur, and in Tibet, it may also have a green mane or green fringes, while in Sikkim, the mane may be blue.

The [[Snow Lion]] is regarded as an emblem of Tibet and the Snow Lion Dance is popular dance in Tibetan communities and it is performed during festivals such as during the ritual dance ([[Cham dance|cham]]) festival and the New Year.  Ths snow lion represents the snowy mountain ranges and glaciers of Tibet and is considered highly auspicious, and it may also symbolize a number of characteristics, such as power and strength,&lt;ref name="snow lion"/&gt; and fearlessness and joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snowliontours.com/welcome/legend_of_the_snowlion |title=Legend of the SnowLion |work= Snow Lion Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://viewonbuddhism.org/symbols_tibet_buddhism.htm |title= Tibetan Buddhist Symbols |work= A view on Buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snow lion may have a long history in Tibet, but some local versions of the dance may also have been influenced by Chinese Lion Dance in the Sino-Tibetan borderland – for example, it was recording that the local chief in [[Songpan County|Songpan]], [[Sichuan]] gave a lion costume to the [[Jamyang Zhépa]] II of the [[Amdo]] region in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="snow lion"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/documents/Theearth-oxandthesnowlion.pdf |title=Amdo Tibetans in Transition: Society and Culture in the Post-Mao Era |editor=Toni Huber |author=Mona Schrempf |pages=147–169 |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |isbn=9004125965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The snow lion dance may be performed as a secular dance, or as a ritual dance performed by [[bon|bon po]] monks.&lt;ref name="snow lion"/&gt;

===Indonesian Lion===
[[File:Baron.JPG|thumb|left|Barong of [[Bali]], Indonesia]]
{{main article|Reog|Barong (mythology)}}
The Chinese lion dance is referred to as ''barongsai'' in Indonesia, often performed by [[Chinese Indonesian]] during ''[[Chinese new year|Imlek]]''. Indonesians however, have developed their own style of lion dances. The lion dance ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''{{lang|id|barong}}'') in [[Indonesia]] has different forms that are distinct to the local cultures in Indonesia, and it is not known if it has any relation to the Chinese lion.&lt;ref name="picken"/&gt; The best known lion dances are performed in [[Bali]] and [[Java]].

[[File:US Navy 100526-N-8539M-019 Capt. Rich Clemmons, left, Commodore of Destroyer Squadron 31, stands with officers of the Indonesian navy as they watch dancers perform a traditional welcome for the amphibious dock landing ship USS.jpg|thumb|[[Reog]] [[Ponorogo]], [[Indonesia]]]]

In [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu Balinese]] culture, the [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] is the king of good spirits, and the enemy of the demon queen [[Rangda]]. Like the Chinese lion, it requires more dancers than in the Javanese [[Reog]].

The [[Reog]] dance of [[Ponorogo]] in Java involves a [[lion]] figure known as the ''{{lang|id|singa barong}}''. It is held on special occasions such as the ''[[Lebaran]]'' ([[Eid al-Fitr]]), City or Regency anniversary, or Independence day carnival. A single dancer, or ''{{lang|id|warok}}'', carries the heavy lion mask about 30 – 40&amp;nbsp;kg weight by his teeth. He is credited with exceptional strength. The ''{{lang|id|warok}}'' may also carry an adolescent boy or girl on its head. When holding an adolescent boy or girl on his head, the Reog dancer holds the weight up to total 100 kilograms. The great mask that spans over 2.5 meters with genuine tiger or leopard skin and real peacock feathers. It has gained international recognition as the world's largest mask.

[[File:Earplugs are used during drumming for Dragon dance.jpg|thumb|upright|Drummer at a lion dance]]

The Chinese Lion Dance is performed accompanied by the music of beating of [[tanggu (drum)]] (in [[Singapore]], datanggu), [[cymbal]]s, and [[gong]]s. Instruments synchronise to the lion dance movements and actions. Fut San, Hok San, Fut Hok, Chow Gar, etc. all play their beat differently. Each style plays a unique beat.
Developments in electronic devices have allowed music to be played via phone/tablet/computer/mp3 player. This has contributed to the evolution of how people can play lion dance music - which eliminates the need to carry around instruments (which can be quite large).

The most common style is Sar Ping lion dance beats. This has more than 22 different testings that you can use to show the lion's movement, whereas fut san has only around 7.

==Costumes==
The lion dance costumes used in these performances can only be custom made in specialty craft shops in rural parts of Asia and have to be imported at considerable expense for most foreign countries outside Asia. For groups in Western countries, this is made possible through funds raised through subscriptions and pledges made by members of local cultural and business societies. For countries like Malaysia with a substantial Chinese population, local expertise may be available in making the "lion" costumes and musical instruments without having to import them from [[China]].  Most modern Southern Lion dance costumes comes with a set of matching pants, however some practitioners use black kung fu pants to appear more traditional.  Modern lion dance costumes are made to be very durable and some are waterproof.

==Association with wushu/kung fu==
The Chinese lion dance has close relations to [[kung fu]] or [[martial arts|Wǔshù]] (武術) and the dancers are usually martial art members of the local kung fu [[Club (organization)|club]] or school. They practice in their club and some train hard to master the skill as one of the disciplines of the martial art.  In general, it is seen that if a school has a capable troupe with many 'lions', it demonstrates the success of the school. It is also generally practised together with [[Dragon dance]] in some area.

==During Chinese New Years and festivals==
[[File:ChineseNewYearBoston07.jpg|thumb|left|Lettuce being offered to a lion, and a Big Head Buddha at the start of a Lion Dance during a [[Chinese New Year]] festival in [[Chinatown, Boston|Boston's Chinatown]].]]
During the [[Chinese New Year]], lion dance troupes will visit the houses and shops of the Asian community to perform the traditional custom of "''cai qing''" (採青), literally meaning "plucking the greens", whereby the lion plucks the auspicious green lettuce either hung on a pole or placed on a table in front of the premises.  The "greens" (''qing'') is tied together with a "[[red envelope]]" containing money and may also include auspicious fruit like oranges.  In Chinese  ''cǎi'' (採, pluck) also sounds like ''cài'' (菜, meaning vegetable) and ''cái'' (财, meaning fortune).  The "lion" will dance and approach the "green" and "red envelope" like a curious cat, to "eat the green" and "spit" it out but keep the "red envelope" which is the reward for the lion troupe.  The lion dance is believed to bring good luck and fortune to the business.  During the [[Qing Dynasty]], there may be additional hidden meanings in the performances, for example the green vegetables (''qing'') eaten by the lion may represent the Qing Manchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcvA373XEJwC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Material Culture|editors= Marianne Hulsbosch, Elizabeth Bedford, Martha Chaiklin |page=117|publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;In modern Hok San lion dance, they will use one of the many testings to approach the food, each one with a specific beat and movement sequence.

[[File:Toronto Lion Dance - Wushu Project.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Toronto Lion Dance team, Wushu Project pouring [[Chinese Tea]] to person(s) who've requested it]]

Different types of vegetables, fruits, foods or utensils with auspicious and good symbolic meanings; for instance pineapples, pomelos, bananas, oranges, sugar cane shoots, coconuts, beer, clay pots or even crabs can be used to be the "greens" (青) to be "plucked" to give different difficulty and challenge for the lion dance performers. But the difficulties of the challenge should comes with the bigger the rewards of the "red envelope" given.

In the old days, the lettuce was hung 5 to 6 metres above ground and only a well-trained martial artist could reach the money while dancing with a heavy lion head. These events became a public challenge. A large sum of money was rewarded, and the audience expected a good show. Sometimes, if lions from multiple martial arts schools approached the lettuce at the same time, the lions are supposed to fight to decide a winner. The lions had to fight with stylistic lion moves instead of chaotic street fighting styles. The audience would judge the quality of the martial art schools according to how the lions fought. Since the schools' reputation were at stake, the fights were usually fierce but civilized. The winner lion would then use creative methods and martial art skills to reach the high-hanging reward. Some lions may dance on bamboo stilts and some may step on human pyramids formed by fellow students of the school. The performers and the schools would gain praise and respect on top of the large monetary reward when they did well.  The lion dance troupes are sometimes accompanied by various characters such as the Big Head Buddha,

[[File:ChinNewYr-dragon2.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese lion dance performing a "cai qing" where the "greens" are hung high above for the lion to pluck.]]

During the 1950s-60s, in some areas with high population of Chinese and Asian communities especially the Chinatown in many foreign countries abroad [[China]] in the world, people who joined lion dance troupes were "gangster-like" and there was a lot of fighting between lion dance troupes and kung fu schools. Parents were afraid to let their children join lion dance troupes because of the "gangster" association with the members. During festivals and performances, when lion dance troupes met, there may be fights between groups. Some lifts and acrobatic tricks are designed for the lion to "fight" and knock over other rival lions. Performers even hid daggers in their shoes and clothes, which could be used to injure other lion dancers’ legs, or even attached a metal horn on their lion’s forehead, which could be used to slash other lion heads. The violence became so extreme that at one point the Hong Kong government banned lion dance completely. Now, as with many other countries, lion dance troupes must attain a permit from the government in order to perform lion dance. Although there is still a certain degree of competitiveness, troupes are a lot less violent and aggressive. Now days, whenever teams meet each other, they'll shake hands through the mouth of the lion to show sportsmanship.

In a traditional performance, when the dancing lion enters a village or township, it is supposed to pay its respects first at the local temple(s), then to the ancestors at the [[ancestral hall]], and finally through the streets to bring happiness to all the people.

==Evolution and competition==
[[File:Lion dance in Foshang.jpg|thumb|Lion dance in competition may be performed on a series of small circular platforms on poles similar to the ones shown here.]]
Lion dance has spread across the world due to the worldwide presence of the diaspora Chinese communities and immigrant settlers in many countries in the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], Pacific [[Polynesia]], and in particular, in [[South East Asia]] where there is a large [[overseas Chinese]] presence.

The dance has evolved considerably since the early days when it was perform as a skill part of [[Chinese martial arts]], and has grown into a more artistic art that takes into accounts the lion's expression and the natural movements, as well as the development of a more elaborate acrobatic styles and skills during performances. This evolution and development has produced the modern form of lion dances, and competition are held to find the best lion dance performances. 

International Lion Dance championships are held in many countries, for example in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19940211&amp;id=he8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1xMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4101,189769 Malaysia Muar Lion Dance Troupe is World Champion|New Straits Times |11  February 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; The competition may be performed on a series of small circular platforms raised on poles called "Jongs", and there are a total of 21 poles in the traditional set. These can reach 3m for normal heights, but championship poles can go up to 6m.  The competition is judged based on the skill and liveliness of the "lion" together with the creativity of the stunts and choreographed moves, as well as the difficulty of the acrobatics, and rhythmic and pulsating live instrumental accompaniment that can captivate the spectators and the judges of the competition. The main judging rubric is developed by international dragon and lion dance federation. Their rubric is used in many professional competitions including Genting. World championships are held every 2 years in Malaysia called genting lion dance championship. The current champion is consecutive winner KSK from Malaysia. Winning almost every world championships.

==In politics==
The lion dance is seen as a representative part of Chinese culture in many overseas Chinese communities,&lt;ref name="malaysia"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DfhMs0tD8IC&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Histories, Cultures, Identities: Studies in Malaysian Chinese Worlds|author= Sharon A.

==In popular culture==
In the 1960s and 1970s, during the era when the [[Hong Kong]]'s Chinese classic and martial arts movies are very popular, [[kung fu]] movies including [[Jet Li]]'s ''[[Wong Fei Hung]]'' has actually indirectly shows and indicates how lion dance was practised with the [[kung fu]] close co-relation and kung fu during that time. In those days the lion dance was mostly practised and performed as Wushu or kung fu skills, with the challenge for the 'lion' built of chairs and tables stacked up together for the 'lion' to perform its stunts and accomplish its challenge.

Several 1990s movies, including a remade version of ''[[Wong Fei Hung]]'', and the sequels of ''[[Once Upon a Time in China]]'', involve plots centered on lion dancing, especially ''[[Once Upon a Time in China III]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in China IV|IV]]''. The series' main actor, [[Jet Li]], has performed as a lion dancer in several of his films, including Southern style lion dancing in ''[[Once Upon a Time in China III]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in China and America]]'' and Northern style lion dancing in ''[[Shaolin Temple 2: Kids from Shaolin|Shaolin Temple 2]]'' and ''[[Shaolin Temple 3: North and South Shaolin|Shaolin Temple 3]]''.

The '''Major Seminary of Tunis''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Grand Séminaire de Tunis''), previously known as the '''Major Seminary of Carthage''', was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[major seminary]] and the [[Diocese|diocesan]] seminary for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis|Archdiocese of Tunis]]. Established in 1881 by Bishop [[Charles Lavigerie]], the seminary was founded for the education of [[White Fathers]] missionaries in [[Africa]]. It educated both religious and diocesan priests until its closure in 1964. The seminary building, known as La Marsa, also held an extensive museum containing relics from Tunisia's history.

== History ==
The seminary was founded in 1881 by Bishop [[Charles Lavigerie]].

In 1882, the White Fathers' scholasticate was added to the seminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africamission-mafr.org/carthagegb.htm|title=Carthage and the White Fathers|website=www.africamission-mafr.org|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It closed in 1964 and the building became the [[National School of Administration (Tunisia)|National School of Administration]].

== Campus ==
The seminary was located in a building called La Marsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebay.fr/itm/CPA-Tunisie-La-Marsa-Le-Grand-Seminaire-26366-/310719434766?hash=item485852500e:g:xbEAAOxyDLZSAQ2J|title=CPA Tunisie La Marsa Le Grand Seminaire  (26366)|website=eBay|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 1879 and the building was completed in 1881.

The '''''Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing All the Words in the Chinese Imperial Dictionary, Arranged According to the Radicals''''' (1842), compiled by the English [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] missionary [[Walter Henry Medhurst]] (1796-1857), is the second major Chinese-English dictionary after [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]'s pioneering (1815-1823) ''[[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]''. Medhurst's intention was to publish an abridged and cheaper dictionary that still contained all the 47,035 [[Headword|head]] [[Chinese character|characters]] from the (1716) ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', which Morrison's huge dictionary included. Medhurst reversed and revised into his Chinese-English dictionary in compiling the (1847-1848) '''''English and Chinese Dictionary in Two Volumes'''''.

==History==
{{For|author's background|Walter Henry Medhurst}}  
[[File:Walter Medhurst.jpeg|thumb|Walter Henry Medhurst with Choo Tih Lang and a Malay student]]
[[Walter Henry Medhurst]] and [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] were [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) colleagues and friends. Both were professional printers, missionaries in China, and amateur lexicographers. In an 1817 letter, Morrison told the LMS directors that Medhurst had sent a promising specimen of small metal types, intended for magazines and tracts, and said the "qualifications and attention of Mr. M. give us great satisfaction" (Morrison 1839: 477). When Morrison was returning to China in 1826, he met with Medhurst in [[Java]] and they discussed their common work (Broomhall 1927: 172).

Medhurst began compiling his dictionary in 1838, and wrote the LMS missionary printer William Ellis in Tahiti that he planned for his English-Chinese dictionary to include about 15,000 entry words and be "fit for every purpose of religion and science" (Su 1996: 227).

As Medhurst explained in an 1841 letter to the LMS directors, his motivation to produce a Chinese and English dictionary came from Morrison's expensive one, which the missionary school's students could not afford. He said his "compendious and cheap" dictionary would contain "every character in Morrison's with all of the useful phrases, in one volume at the moderate cost of a few dollars" (Su 1996: 227-228).

Medhurst's preface (1842: iii) says his purpose was to compile a "commodious, uniform, and comprehensive Dictionary" for English students of the Chinese language, comprising the 47,035 [[Headword|head]] [[Chinese character|characters]] in the (1716) ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' ("Imperial Dictionary of Kang-he"), with the exception of those that supposedly have "either no sound or no meaning attached to them". Medhurst initially intended to compile a complete English-Chinese dictionary, but he found that the available materials were insufficient, and it was necessary for him to first create a Chinese-English dictionary, after which the work would be "comparatively easy to reverse the whole", and then add further English terms. Medhurst acknowledges taking phrases from Morrison's Chinese-English Dictionary and elsewhere, and adopting Morrison's widely used [[orthography]], with the addition of [[aspirated consonant]]s and [[pitch accent]]s or tones, "as far as they were ascertainable".

Medhurst printed, at his own expense, the ''Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing all the words in the Chinese imperial dictionary, arranged according to the radicals'' in 1842, at Parapattan [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]].

The 648-page Volume I was completed by October 1842, and the 838-page Volume II was finished in May 1843, both were published in 600 copies. Its inexpensive printing enabled Medhurst to sell this bulky dictionary at only 10 [[Spanish dollars]].

As the title says, Medhurst collated his bilingual dictionary by [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke_sorting|radical-and-stroke sorting]] according to the 214 [[List of Kangxi radicals|Kangxi radicals]]—the same collation method used in Morrison's (1815-1823) Part I Chinese-English dictionary.

Volume I comprises 648 pages of dictionary entries, from [[Radical 1]] 一 "one" to [[Radical 111]] 矢 "arrow", and 50 pages of supplementary materials. The front matter includes an 11-page preface, 3-page list of the radicals, and the 5-page "Directions for discovering under what Radical any given character may be found"; the postface is a 29-page "List of Obsolete, Contracted, and Vulgar Characters, Not occurring in the foregoing Dictionary Volume I". Volume II comprises 838 pages of dictionary entries, from [[Radical 112]] 石 "stone" to [[Radical 214]] 龠 "flute", and a 28-page postface list of uncommon characters not in the volume.

The preface briefly explains to dictionary users, particularly English-speaking students of the Chinese language, Medhurst's [[orthography]] for [[Standard Chinese phonology]].

The dictionary includes 20 [[initial (linguistics)|initials]], and Medhurst adopted Morrison's method of using [[apostrophe]]s to represent the [[Aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated-aspirated]] [[stop consonant]] pairs (listen to examples [[Aspirated consonant#Chinese|here]]). For instance (1842: v-vi), this description of the [[denti-alveolar consonant]]s of unaspirated [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA link|t}}/ and aspirated /{{IPA link|tʰ}}/ ([[Wade-Giles]] ''t'' and ''t'''; [[pinyin]] ''d'' and ''t''): "''T'', as in ''top''; and ''t'h'' like the former, only with an aspirate between the ''t'', and following vowel; not as the ''th'' in ''though'', or in ''thing'', but at the same letters in the words ''at home'', supposing the initial ''a'' to be left out".

The 55 [[syllable coda|finals]] are also explained, for example (1842: viii-ix), the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Rhotic coda|rhotic coda]] or [[r-colored vowel]] /{{IPA link|ɚ}}/, which is difficult for many non-native speakers. "''Urh'', is a peculiar sound, something between the ''r'' and ''I'', produced by a vibration of the lower part of the tongue against the inward region of the palate, near the entrance of the throat; it is something similar to the smooth sound of the ''r'', heard in end of English words, as in ''liar''."

Medhurst's dictionary annotates tones in terms of the classical [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation used in [[rime dictionaries]], instead of the [[four tones]] of [[Mandarin Chinese]] spoken by Medhurst (1 "high-level", 2 "rising", 3 "dipping", and 4 "falling") (1842: xiv-xv). Medhurst indicated ''píng'' 平 "level" tone as unmarked (a), ''shǎng'' 上 "rising" tone with [[circumflex]] accent (â), ''qù'' 去 "departing" tone with [[grave accent]] (à), and ''rù'' 入"entering" tone with [[acute accent]] (á). As a result of using 17th-century ''Wufang yuanyin'' pronunciations, early Chinese-English dictionaries were much concerned with the "entering" tone, which had already ceased to exist in 19th-century Beijing pronunciation (Norman 1988: 173).

Medhurst adopted Morrison's dictionary page layout with the page number centered between the character radical number and stroke number: [[Radical 162]] 辵 or 辶 "walk" and the 9 additional strokes in ''shǒu'' 首 "head" (animated 12-[[stroke order]] for 道 is shown [[wikt:道#Etymology|here]]).

[[File:Medhurst 1848 1396.jpg|thumb|Sample page from Medhurst's ''English and Chinese Dictionary'' (1848: 1396)]]
The Mission Press in Shanghai published Medhurst's ''English and Chinese dictionary in two volumes'' in 1847 and 1848, respectively. Publishing 600 copies of this 1,436-page dictionary was the largest work of the mission in its hand-press period.

Owing to Medhurst's disappointment with the low quality results from combining typography and lithography to print Chinese characters for the ''Chinese and English Dictionary'', he decided to use [[letterpress printing]] for the ''English and Chinese Dictionary'', which required the cutting of small type. The LMS had previously used small type to print Christian translations and tracts that were smuggled into China, where they were forbidden. In Shanghai, Medhurst employed Chinese workers to [[punchcutting|punchcut]] [[Movable type|moveable-type]] Chinese characters on blank shanks, "about 15,000 sorts, and nearly 100,000 individual types" that were required for the dictionary (Medhurst 1847: v).

For the bilingual sources of his English-Chinese dictionary, Medhurst says he extracted "all that he thought serviceable from Morrison" and an anonymous Latin-Chinese manuscript dictionary—presumably the Italian Franciscan Basilio Brollo's (1698) ''Dictionarium Sino-Latinum''—"while he flatters himself that he has gone far beyond either of his predecessors, in the amount of foreign words adduced, and of expressions brought together to elucidate them." (1847: iv).

Volume I (1847) has a 6-page preface, 2-page summary of orthographic conventions, and the 766-page dictionary proper. The entries begin with "'''A''', the letter a; the broad and open sound of this letter is expressed by 亞 a [''yà''], or 阿 a [''ā'']." and end with "'''KORAN''', the Mahomedans, call the Koran 天經 ''t'hëen king'' [''tiānjīng'']."

Volume II (1848) of Medhurst's English-Chinese dictionary comprises 669 pages. The entries go from "'''LABEL''', 帖  ''t'ëĕ'' [''tiè'']; the label of a book, 檢 ''këen'' [''jiǎn'']." To "'''ZONE''', 帶 taé [''dài''], 束腰之帶 shǔ yaou che taé [''shùyāo zhī dài''], 腰帶 yaou taé [''yāodài''], 地球道 té k'hêu taóu [''dìqiúdào'']."

The sample page (to the right) contains Medhurst's dictionary entry for '''WAY'''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Way'''. 道 Taóu, 路 loó, 庚 käng, 康 k'hang, 彭 p'hang, 疏 sоо, 略路 lëǒ loó, 繇道 yaòu taóu, 道術途 taóu shǔh t'hoô, 街 keae, 街路 keae loó, 迪 teĭh, 逕 king, 途 t'hoô, 坻閣 te kǒ, 道路 taóu loó; in the way, 途間 t'hoô këen, 路中 loó chung, 街上 keae sháng; do not go in the way of death, 死路莫行 szè loó mǒ hing; leave the right way, 離開正路 lê k'hae chíng loó; public way, 大路 tá loó, 官路 kwan loó; a great way off, 離遠 lê yuèn; the way of Providence, 天步 t'ёеп poó; way to effect an object, 方法 fang fǎ; manner, 般 pwan, 術 shǔh; method, 樣法 yang fǎ, 計策 ké tsĭh, 法子 fǎ tszè; way-marks, 旌節 tsing tsëĕ; a wayfaring man, 羇旅 ke leù, 路人 loó jin. (1848: 1396)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first part of the '''WAY''' headword gives 16 translation equivalents of Chinese words meaning "way". This illustrates how one single English headword can have ten or more Chinese translation equivalents, which Medhurst ascribes to either "the richness of the Chinese language, in certain particulars", or to "the inability of the compiler (from want of time and skill) to discover the slight shades of meaning that exist among them" (1847: iii). Most of these equivalents are common terms, such as 道 ''taóu'' (''dào'' "way; road; path), 路 ''loó'' (''lù'' "road; path; way"), and 途 ''t'hoô'' (''tú'' "road; route; way") (given in Morrison's dictionary. 1822b: 369), but some are obscure [[classical Chinese]] terms, such as ''dǐgé'' 坻閣, which the ''Kangxi zidian'' ([[s.v.]], 閣) notes was the name of a road mentioned in commentaries to the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' (野廬氏). The second part of the '''WAY''' headword gives translations of 11 usage examples, for instance, "public way, 大路 ''tá loó'' , 官路 ''kwan loó''" (''dàlù'' "big street; main road; highway" and ''guānlù'' "government-financed road; public road", respectively).

==Reception==
Scholars have expressed diverse opinions of Walter Henry Medhurst's Chinese-English and English-Chinese dictionaries.

The first published evaluation of the (1842-1843) ''Chinese and English Dictionary'' was an anonymous 1843 review in ''[[The Chinese Repository]]'', which was a Protestant missionary periodical published in [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. On the one hand, the reviewer praises the dictionary's portability and price, "two [[octavo]] volumes containing 1500 pages for ten dollars", but on the other, expresses regret that Medhurst "has said so little on the subject of ''tones''" other than "that he considers them of paramount importance" (Anon 1843: 499).

Based upon comparison of the entries under [[Radical 46]] 山 "mountain" in Morrison's and Medhurst's Chinese-English dictionaries, the reviewer said, "If Mr. Medhurst does not improve upon himself, he improves vastly upon Dr. Morrison" (Anon 1943: 497).

The next major Chinese-English dictionary after Medhurst's was the American sinologist and missionary [[Samuel Wells Williams]]'s (1874) ''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]''. The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst, [[Elijah Coleman Bridgman]], and others were published in small numbers, they became "very scarce, while the number of students has increased tenfold", and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison's dictionary (1874: v). Williams explicitly identified "Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien" as a more important source for his own work than Morrison's dictionary (1874: vi). 

The preface to the British diplomat and sinologist [[Herbert Giles]]'s ''A Chinese-English Dictionary'' (1892: vii-viii) praised Morrison as "the great pioneer" of Chinese and English lexicography, but criticized his failure to mark aspiration. He said Medhurst "attempted aspirates, but omitted many and wrongly inserted others". 

Huiling Yang, a researcher at [[Beijing Foreign Studies University]], expresses surprise that the ''Chinese and English Dictionary'', which Medhurst claimed to be his translation based on ''Kangxi zidian'', "is in fact just an abbreviated and edited copy of Morrison’s, a plagiarism rather than an original compilation" (2014: 317-318).

This expands the domain beyond a single storage device to span all devices within its [[namespace]].

The main use of a metadata engine is to enable flexible IT infrastructure or environments, by making [[Application_software|applications]] more storage aware and conversely, a storage device application—or data—aware.

==Purpose==

Metadata engines virtualize the view of data. Combined with client access protocols such as [[Network_File_System#NFSv4|NFS v4.2]] and [[Server_Message_Block|SMB]] 2.1 or SMB 3.0 (Samba), a metadata engine can create a global namespace to allow applications to see a logical view of their data, and can orchestrate data movement between different types or tiers of storage without disrupting the application’s access to its data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=David|title=Supercharge Your Existing Storage with a Metadata Engine|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2017/03/16/supercharge-existing-storage-metadata-engine/|website=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Gates Letter to Hobbyists.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Gates]]'s Open Letter to Hobbyists from the Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter, January 1976]]
An '''open letter''' is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] that is intended to be read by a wide audience, or a letter intended for an individual, but that is nonetheless widely distributed intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/open+letter |title=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open letters usually take the form of a [[letter (message)|letter]] addressed to an individual but provided to the public through [[newspaper]]s and other media, such as a [[letter to the editor]] or [[blog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/open-letter |title=Macmillan Online Dictionary |publisher=Macmillandictionary.com |date=2014-07-22 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially common are critical open letters addressed to political leaders.

Currently there are very few sites solely specialising in publishing open letters. However, there are community sites where visitors can publish their own letters and promote them to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opnlttr.com/ |title=Opnlttr community site for people to publish open letters |publisher=Opnlttr.com |date=2014-07-04 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological or historical research on open letters are also not found, although sociologists, anthropologists and historians have written open letters.&lt;ref&gt;http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/Open%20Letter%20to%20Mills.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opnlttr.com/letter/open-letter-emile-durkheim|title=An Open Letter to Emile Durkheim|author=|date=|website=opnlttr.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Letters patent]] are another form of open letter in which a legal document is both mailed to a person by the government and publicized so that all are made aware of it.  Open letters can also be addressed directly to a group rather than any individual.

==Motivations for writing==
There are a number of reasons why an individual would choose the form of an open letter, including the following reasons:
* As a last resort to ask the public to judge the letter's recipient or others involved, often but not always, in a critical light
* To state the author's position on a particular issue&lt;ref&gt;https://vidyasagar.academia.edu/AbhijitGuha/OPEN-LETTERS&lt;/ref&gt;
* As an attempt to start or end a wider dialogue around an issue
* As an attempt to focus broad attention on the letter's recipient, prompting them to some action
* For [[humor]] value
* Simply to make public a communication that must take place as a letter for reasons of [[formality]]

==Examples==

'''Operation Murambatsvina''' ('''''Move the Rubbish'''''), also officially known as '''Operation Restore Order''', was a large-scale [[Zimbabwe]]an government campaign to [[slum clearance|forcibly clear slum]] areas across the country. The campaign started in 2005 and according to [[United Nations]] estimates has affected at least 700,000 people directly through loss of their homes or livelihood and thus could have indirectly affected around 2.4 million people.&lt;ref name=slams&gt;[ww2.unhabitat.org/documents/ZimbabweReport.pdf "UN report on Zim. government"], ''Report'', 17 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Mugabe]] and other government officials characterised the operation as a crackdown against [[illegal housing]] and commercial activities, and as an effort to reduce the risk of the spread of infectious disease in these areas.

However, the campaign was met with harsh condemnation from Zimbabwean opposition parties, church groups, non-governmental organisations, and the wider [[international community]]. The United Nations described the campaign as an effort to drive out and make [[homelessness|homeless]] large sections of the urban and rural poor, who make up much of the internal opposition to the Mugabe administration.

==Etymology of the word  "Murambatsvina" ==
The word was initially used to refer to a communal village worker by the Shona who lived in "reserves". These people were employed by the ministry of health to improve levels of sanitation in these areas, to communicate health information, etc. Police Inspector John Tupiri of Operations Manicaland decided on the name "Murambatsvina". The Zimbabwean police were ruthless in executing their duties with the result that they were dreaded by the local populace. The sense behind the word therefore mirrors the alleged purpose of the operation as asserted by the government of Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimcrisis.blogspot.com&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Zimbabweans refer to the operation as "Zimbabwe's [[tsunami]]", in reference to the devastation which followed the tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. The crackdown has affected most of the major cities in the country, and the Zimbabwean government has stated its intention to widen the operation to include rural farming areas. Estimates of the number of people affected vary considerably. The latest United Nations figures estimate that it has led to the unemployment of 700,000 people and affected a further 2.4 million people countrywide.&lt;ref name=slams/&gt; Earlier, the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum estimated that 64,677 families had been displaced, representing a total of approximately 323,385 people&lt;ref name="orderoutofchaos"&gt;[http://www.hrforumzim.com/special_hrru/order_out_of_chaos_or_chaos_out_of_order.htm "Order out of Chaos, or Chaos out of Order?: A Preliminary Report on Operation 'Murambatsvina'"], Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, June 2005 ([http://www.swradioafrica.com/Documents/ZHRNGOFOrderoutofchaos.htm secondary link])&lt;/ref&gt; (this estimate was based on figures from 45 locations). However, according to the police only 120,000 people have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/homes-smashed-by-zimbabwe-paramilitary-police/2005/07/05/1120329447181.html "Homes 'smashed' by Zimbabwe paramilitary police"], smh.com.au, 5 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever figures are correct, large numbers of people have been affected, all of whom are in need of emergency relief and resettlement following the loss of their homes and livelihood. The clearances have been condemned both internally and internationally. A report written by [[Anna Tibaijuka]], the Executive Director of the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme]], was handed to the Zimbabwean government on 21 July 2005.&lt;ref name="factfindingreport"&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/zimbabwe_rpt.pdf "Report of the Fact-Finding Mission to Zimbabwe to assess the Scope and Impact of Operation Murambatsvina"], UN Special Envoy on Human Settlements Issues in Zimbabwe, 18 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from the report, which calls for all demolitions to be stopped immediately,&lt;ref name=slams/&gt; were made public the following day and describe the operation as a "disastrous venture" which has violated [[international law]] and led to a serious [[humanitarian crisis]]. The actions of the government are described as indiscriminate, unjustified and conducted without regard for human suffering. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' on 7 February 2008, described how some men and women displaced from [[Harare]] are now walking {{convert|28|km|mi|abbr=on}} – 5 hours round-trip every day to work (furthermore without breakfast), because the individual bus fare for one day now costs nearly a week's wages – [[Zimbabwe|ZW]]$10 million.

==Background==
Overall responsibility for the clearances rests with the ruling party, [[ZANU-PF]]. The previous Chairperson of the [[Harare Commission]], Dr. Jameson Kurasha, initiated Operation Murambatsvina weeks after the disputed [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005|elections]] were held there. The Harare Commission led by Sekesai Makwavarara is currently running the affairs of the City of [[Harare]] despite the fact that there is a pending application to the High Court questioning its authority to do so. The Commission itself was appointed by [[Ignatious Chombo]], the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and Urban Development, leading one Zimbabwean newspaper to comment that "President Mugabe, through the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Ignatious Chombo, is now effectively in control of the City of Harare".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.co.zw/skinned/comment_reader.asp?st_id=3688 Harare MDC Councillors should resign] The Standard&lt;/ref&gt;

Mugabe said the clearances are needed to carry out "a vigorous clean-up campaign to restore sanity" and he has described the program as an "urban renewal campaign." Chombo has described the operation in terms of 'restoring order': "It is these people who have been making the country ungovernable by their criminal activities actually."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimonline.co.za/printme.asp?ID=9809 Police to use live ammo, army rolls into suburbs] ZimOnline, 28 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Zimbabwean Police Commissioner, [[Augustine Chihuri]], said that Operation Murambatsvina was meant to "clean the country of the crawling mass of maggots bent on destroying the economy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1660059,00.html "Priests told: don't aid filth"], ''Times Online'' UK, 17 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While police have carried out most of the demolitions, they have been supported by the army and the [[National Youth Service (Zimbabwe)|National Youth Service]]. Many inhabitants have been forced to destroy their own homes, sometimes at gunpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/demgg/050623parlzim.asp?sector=LOCGOV&amp;range_start=1 "Operation Murambatsvina Restore Order"], Kubatana.&lt;/ref&gt;

People whose homes have been demolished are being told to return to the rural areas or face further action from the [[Zimbabwe Republic Police]] and the dreaded [[Central Intelligence Organization]]. Education Minister [[Aeneas Chigwedere]] claimed that there is "nobody in Zimbabwe who does not have a rural home".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=243162 "Teachers decry Mugabe's 'clean-up' plan"], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 15 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative reasons for the clearances==
{{Weasel|section|date=June 2008}}
The Zimbabwean government has argued that Operation Murambatsvina is about restoring order (see section above). However, the timing of the clearances, so soon after the disputed parliamentary elections on 31 March 2005, combined with the contradictory nature of the operation, has prompted commentators to state that there are alternative reasons for the demolitions, although most say a combination of many of these.

===Political retribution===
The opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) has argued that the government's main reason for Murambatsvina is to punish the urban poor for voting for the opposition during the March parliamentary elections. The cities are traditionally MDC strongholds, and, in fact, the Harare Commission that initiated the campaign was set up to override the governing powers of the elected MDC City Council. However, the [[Retributive justice|retribution]] as a rationale is somewhat undermined by the fact that some Zanu-PF supporters, including [[history of Zimbabwe|liberation war]]-veterans, have also been caught up in the [[squatter camp]] clearances.

===Weaken the political opposition===
Commentators such as Tererai Karimakwenda have noted the similarity between the name of this operation and the [[Gukurahundi]] campaign conducted as part of Mugabe's struggle against the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] tribe in the early 1980s. The Gukurahundi campaign ultimately resulted in the demise of [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) when it merged with Robert Mugabe's party in 1987. There has been speculation that the government is aiming to create a situation where the MDC has no choice but to merge with the ruling party.&lt;ref name="zimbabwesituation.com"&gt;Karimakwenda, Tererai (29 January 2008), "[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/jan30_2008.html "Govt opening 'people’s shops' to control food ahead of elections"], The Zimbabwe Station. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karimakwenda also argued that by forcing urban voters out into the rural areas the cities will be de-populated of MDC supporters thus enabling the government to re-populate the [[shanty town]] areas with Zanu-PF supporters. Further, MDC supporters will be forced to return to live in areas traditionally viewed as Zanu-PF strongholds.&lt;ref name="zimbabwesituation.com"/&gt;

Science and Technology Deputy Minister [[Patrick Zhuwawo]] used state media to say that the government had demarcated nearly 10,000 [[residential]] stands at Whitecliff Farm for allocation to what he called "deserving people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/media/050616mmpz2.asp?sector=URBDEV&amp;range_start=1 "Purge of the urban poor"], ''Kubatana''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Independent'', a Zimbabwe newspaper, has interpreted this to mean "Zanu-PF supporters" and supports the view by identifying the presence of "Zanu-PF sharks" at the centre where people were meant to sign up for new stands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051127010429/http://www.theindependent.co.zw/news/2005/June/Friday9/comment.html "Spreading tentacles of patronage"], ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt; A different source reported that, in [[Bulawayo]], a Zanu-PF representative was tasked with compiling a list of future stand beneficiaries and that the resulting list was dominated by the names of known Zanu-PF supporters. One opposition supporter, whose name was not on the list, alleges that he was bluntly told that he supported the wrong party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swradioafrica.com/news220705/victimscry220705.htm "Victims cry foul over stand allocations"], SW Radio Africa, 22 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlling political protest===
There were many reports in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 parliamentary elections, widely viewed by the west as neither free nor fair, of potential mass [[Rebellion|uprisings]] against the government. In fact, Catholic Archbishop [[Pius Ncube]], a respected human rights activist and outspoken critic of the government, publicly called for a peaceful uprising before the elections took place, claiming that the elections had already been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4386343.stm "Zimbabwe cleric urges 'uprising'"], BBC News, 27 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that, by dispersing MDC supporters to remote rural locations, the Zanu-PF government would find it easier to control an angry population in the event of possible riots or mass protests. [[David Coltart]], the MDC's legal affairs spokesperson, described the operation as a sinister [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive]] strike designed to remove the maximum possible number of people from urban areas to rural areas where they are easier to control".&lt;ref name=polpot&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1641558,00.html "Mugabes regime lays waste to buildings in new terror tactic"], ''Times Online'', 5 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources suggest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=264747 "Mengistu 'brains behind Zim clean-up'"], ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; that former Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], who fled to Harare in 1991, may have given Robert Mugabe the idea in the form of a security advise, warning the Zimbabwean leader that the swelling slum and backyard population in Zimbabwe was creating a fertile ground for a mass uprising.

===Risk management as part of future government reform===
The [[Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum]] has advanced another reason for pre-emptively dispersing citizens living in opposition party strongholds. They point to the fact that the government faces an unprecedented economic crisis characterised by fuel and food shortages, rampant [[hyperinflation]], and virtually no foreign currency. To resolve the crisis, they argue that the Zanu-PF government will be forced, against its will, to re-engage with the international community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This means a reversal of its whole style of governing, adherence to the rule of law, an end to political violence and repression, opening of the press and media space, and a cessation of all interference with citizens basic freedoms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The suggestion therefore is that if [[totalitarian]] controls were relaxed – to satisfy international principles and standards – the government would suddenly be exposed to protest and [[civic engagement|civic]] pressure. In other words, Operation Murambatsvina may be less to do with fear of protests immediately following the elections (which could be controlled using current methods which rely on a politicised police and army), and more to do with controlling the population ''after'' heavy-handed measures were dispensed with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is predicated on the observation that the greatest risk to repressive governments comes when they seek to [[liberalise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/hr/050630hrf.asp?sector=LOCGOV&amp;range_start=1 Preliminary report on operation "Murambatsvina"], ''Kubatana''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zimbabwean 2005 election experiences give some credence to this view. Anticipating electoral [[delegate|observers]] coming to the country, the government eased up on a few of its repressive tactics in the months immediately preceding the parliamentary elections. The immediate effect was that MDC supporters felt confident and suddenly openly showed their support for their party in a way they hadn't been able to before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0331/p06s03-woaf.html "Zimbabwe's opposition hopeful"], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 31 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regain control of foreign currency dealings===
In the early 2000s, Zimbabwe fought to keep control of the [[foreign currency]] market by adopting a range of measures, usually spearheaded by Reserve Bank Governor [[Gideon Gono]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.saiia.org.za/opinion-analysis/too-many-holes-in-the-hull-currency-auctions-and-other-emergency-measures-fail-to-keep-zimbabwes-economy-afloat "Too Many Holes in the Hull – Currency auctions and other emergency measures fail to keep Zimbabwes economy afloat"], SAIIA, 6 May 2008. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sokwanele]], a Zimbabwean civic action support group, describes Gideon Gono as having played a major role in Operation Murambatsvina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/insheepsclothing_8june2005.html "Gideon Gono in Sheep's Clothing: The Role of the RBZ Governor in Murambatsvina"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112200507/http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/insheepsclothing_8june2005.html |date=12 November 2007 }}, ''Sokwanele''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Gideon Gono's appointment to Governor coincided with the beginning of a crackdown on illegal foreign currency dealings prompting one popular source of independent news to report that "one of his key areas of focus is the illegal foreign currency market".&lt;ref name=forex&gt;[http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/forex.html "End of era for forex dealers as Mugabe gets tough"], ''ZimOnline'', 10 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sokwanele]], in a different article, explains that the foreign currency market in Zimbabwe is broadly characterised by the [[formal market]], the [[parallel market]] and the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/forexmarket_5july2005.html "The Forex Market: A laymans guide to how it works, and why it does what it does"], ''Sokwanele'', 5 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the black market as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Black market transactions happen on the streets, in the flea markets, and in back-rooms; sometimes for small sums of money like 20 US dollars; and the deals often take place between individuals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commentators believe the government is specifically targeting the small-scale black market traders through Operation Murambatsvina. ''[[The Age]]'', an Australian newspaper, reported on how informal vendors at one market, dubbed "The World Bank", maintains a façade of trading goods when their real business is dealing in hard cash, albeit very small amounts at a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/High-finance-behind-Zimbabwes-market-stalls/2005/04/29/1114635749416.html "High finance behind Zimbabwe's market stalls"], ''The Age'', 30 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, Bulawayo's "The World Bank" was one of the markets targeted when Gono first become Governor of the Reserve Bank in [2003].&lt;ref name=forex/&gt;)

Few analysts believe that the small amounts seized from vendors in one operation could begin to meet the country's massive foreign currency shortfall. This has led to some describing the government's action as indicative of their extreme desperation.

===Supporting the "Look East" policy===
Zanu-PF's drive towards resolving its economic crisis has included strengthening its historical ties with China.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham McLaughlin, [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0330/p01s01-woaf.html "A rising China counters US clout in Africa"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 30 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The state-controlled newspaper ''The Herald'' reported on [[Robert Mugabe]]'s support for Operation Murambastvina, and on his view that the economy was beginning to receive serious and significant investments from the Far East:{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;We should not look back, for, looking back, means back to our political enemies and detractors. Industry must recognise this new direction (Look East policy). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has led some to speculate that the destruction of the [[shanty towns]] are partly in support of Chinese business interests in Zimbabwe. A report co-authored by Archbishop Ncube stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speculation over the motives behind Operation Murambatsvina has pointed to the removal of local competition threatening newly arrived Chinese businessmen whose stores sell cheap and often poor quality goods. It is estimated that, as a result of the government's aggressive "Look East" policy, up to 10,000 Chinese citizens have moved into the country, and some have moved onto farms taken from highly skilled [[commercial farmers]], notably to grow tobacco for China's 300 million smokers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2005/afm-zwe-06jul.pdf "'State in Fear' report"], ''Reliefweb''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.co.za/zones/sundaytimesNEW/basket17st/basket17st1121318192.aspx "Mugabe's Chinese puzzle"], ''Sunday Times'', 14 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As well as practical support of Chinese business interests, many have suggested that Operation Murambatsvina also demonstrates an adherence to a 'Look East' ideology and is evidence that Zanu-PF has embraced an Asian model of government where individual rights are often subverted for the good of the masses, or the [[regime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0705/p06s02-woaf.html "Africa looks East for political role models"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 5 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Mugabe's approach to governance has prompted regular comparisons between him and [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref name=polpot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0503/p11s01-coop.html "A cry against the Pol Pot of Africa"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 3 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=243694 "Mugabe: Shades of Pol Pot"], ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', 24 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condemnation==

===Zimbabwean responses===
Operation Murambatsvina has been widely condemned by Zimbabwean non-governmental organisations,&lt;ref name="orderoutofchaos"/&gt; churches,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092339/http://www.genocidewatch.org/ZimbabweDiscardingtheFilth27June2005.htm "Discarding the Filth"], The Solidarity Peace Trust, 27 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; legal organisations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/hr/050630zlhr.asp?sector=URBDEV "The legal implications of Operation ''Murambatsvina'' and Operation Restore Order"], Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, 30 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/bmarket9.12699.html "Full text of MDC statement on flea market raids"], MDC National Council, 3 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many other groups in Zimbabwe.

The operation also made topics for those in the literature world with [[Valerie Tagwira]] with her book ''The Uncertainty of Hope'', which vivified mostly the effects of Operation Murambatsvina on the ordinary female citizens of Zimbabwe and other difficulties faced by that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanbookscollective.com/books/the-uncertainty-of-hope "The Uncertainty of Hope"], African Books Collective.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatanablogs.net/kubatana/the-uncertainty-of-hope-a-book-that-reminds-us-who-women-are-in-zimbabwe/ "The Uncertainty of Hope: A book that reminds us who women are in Zimbabwe"], ''Kubatana.&lt;/ref&gt; The other known literature figure who hand penned the happenings of the era is a young poet and script writer, Poseidon Tsautsau who wrote his poem:The Uncaring father, who should care.&lt;ref&gt;Poseidon Tsautsau, [http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-opinion-sc-columnist-byo-111484.html "The uncaring father, who should care"], Bulawayo24.com, 2 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem it seems like Tsautsau is blasting Mugabe the Zimbabwean father for not caring for his children, by "cleaning the mess through adding trash" as he writes in his piece.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poetry.com/poems/1687704-The-uncaring-father-who-should-care&lt;/ref&gt;

===International responses===
The international community has also condemned the operation with nations and international organisations strongly attacking the Zimbabwean government's policy.

[[Kate Hoey]] MP called on former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to encourage South Africa to use its regional influence to put pressure on Zimbabwean authorities to cease the crackdown.

The New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Phil Goff]] expressed his condemnation of the operation by suggesting in a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sol/ukfs_sport/hi/av/nb_wm_fs.stm?checkedBandwidth=nb&amp;nbram=1&amp;checkedMedia=asx&amp;news=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;nol_storyid=4123450 radio interview] a boycott of the planned tour by the [[Zimbabwean cricket team]] of New Zealand in 2005–06.

[[Condoleezza Rice]], then [[United States Secretary of State]], called upon African leaders to speak out against the Operation and to increase pressure on the Zimbabwean authorities to end the evictions. The [[African Union]] has rejected these calls stating it has 'more serious concerns'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4618341.stm "Africa rejects action on Zimbabwe"], BBC News, 24 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, then South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] questioned why Western leaders were so concerned about Zimbabwe while not paying the same amount of attention to far more dire African emergencies, such as civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

===United Nations===
[[Kofi Annan]], then UN [[Secretary-General]], dispatched special [[envoy (title)|envoy]] [[Anna Tibaijuka]] to Zimbabwe to study the effects of the campaign and report back her findings. The report&lt;ref name="factfindingreport"/&gt; is highly critical of the government, prompting one news source to say that the report used "language unusually harsh for the United Nations".&lt;ref name="slams"/&gt; Excerpts of the report describe the operation as disastrous and inhumane, representing a clear violation of [[international law]]. The executive summary stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Operation Restore Order, while purporting to target illegal dwellings and structures and to clamp down on alleged illicit activities, was carried out in an indiscriminate and unjustified manner, with indifference to human suffering, and, in repeated cases, with disregard to several provisions of national and international legal frameworks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 23 May 2007 the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and another group, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, sought independent legal opinion. This concluded that the evictions in Zimbabwe were a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, as part of state policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6683619.stm "Zimbabwe slum evictions 'a crime'"], BBC, 23 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zimbabwe Government response to UN report==
In a 45-page response to the highly critical report by UN envoy Anna Tibaijuka, President Robert Mugabe's government says it acted in the public interest, and denied that it was responsible for the deaths of several people during clean-up operation, and was carried out in compliance with the government's laws, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported on 17 August 2005.

The government said Tibaijuka had used ''value-laden and judgemental language, which clearly demonstrated in-built bias'' against it and the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=7676&amp;page=2|title=Angry reaction to barring of The Elders|date=20 November 2008|work=The Zimbabwe Times|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Osman v United Kingdom''''' [1998] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/101.html ECRR 101] is a leading and controversial case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on [[human rights]] law in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christiankhan.co.uk/ViewCaseStudy.asp?CaseID=10&lt;/ref&gt; Judgment was given on 28 October 1998.

==Facts==
The applicants were British citizens resident in London. The first applicant, Mrs. Mulkiye Osman, is the widow of Mr. Ali Osman who was shot dead by Paul Paget-Lewis on 7 March 1988. The second applicant, Ahmet Osman, is her son, born in 1972. He was a former pupil of Paget-Lewis at Homerton House School. Ahmet Osman was wounded in the shooting incident which led to the death of his father.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights, [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=696134&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 CASE OF OSMAN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM], 28 October 1998, para 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

The applicants' complaints are directed at the failure of the authorities to appreciate and act on what they claim was a series of clear warning signs that Paget-Lewis represented a serious threat to the physical safety of Ahmet Osman and his family. The applicants argued that the police had been given information which should have made it clear that the individual posed a danger.

==Judgment==

The English courts all agreed that the police owed no [[duty of care]] to the applicants, confirming the law in ''Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'' where it was ruled that the police owed no duty of care to one of the victims of the [[Yorkshire Ripper]].

On appeal to Strasbourg, the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights was that such blanket immunity would be a breach of article 6 of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], but that there was no breach of articles 2 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights, [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=696134&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 CASE OF OSMAN v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">A '''personal information manager''' (often referred to as a '''PIM tool''' or, more simply, a '''PIM''') is a type of [[application software]] that functions as a [[personal organizer]]. The acronym '''PIM''' is now, more commonly, used in reference to [[personal information management]] as a field of study.&lt;ref name="pimjones"&gt;{{cite book |title=Personal Information Management |editor1-first=William |editor1-last=Jones |editor2-first=Jaime |editor2-last=Teevan | year=2007 |publisher=Univ of Washington Pr |location=WA |isbn=978-0295987378}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[information management]] tool, a PIM tool's purpose is to facilitate the recording, tracking, and management of certain types of "personal information".

==Scope==
Personal information can include any of the following:{{fact|date=December 2014}}
* Personal file collections (digital and physical): documents, music, photos, videos and similar
* Personal notes/[[Diary|journal]]
* Legal documents
* Education records
* [[Address book]]s
* Lists (including [[task list]]s)
* Significant [[calendar date]]s
** [[Birthday]]s
** [[Anniversary|Anniversaries]]
** [[wikt:appointment|Appointment]]s and [[meeting]]s
* [[Tickler file|Reminders]]
* [[Email]], [[Messaging spam|instant message]] archives
* [[Fax]] communications, [[voicemail]]
* [[Project management]] features
* [[RSS (file format)|RSS]]/[[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds
* [[Alerts]]
* References (including scientific references, websites of interest)

==Synchronization with a computer==
Some PIM/PDM software products are capable of synchronizing data over a [[computer network]], including [[mobile ad hoc network]]s, or MANETs. This feature typically stores the personal data on Cloud drives allowing for continuous concurrent data updates/access, on the users computers, including [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]] computers, and Smart devices [[personal digital assistant]]s.

==History==
Prior to the introduction of the term "[[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]" by Apple in 1992, handheld personal organizers such as the [[Sharp Wizard]] and the [[Psion Organiser]] were also referred to as "PIMs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memex.org/thereturnofthepda.html |title=The Return of the PDA |publisher=Marketing Computers |date=February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2284229 |title=History of the Personal Data Assistant (PDA) |publisher=H2G2 |date=March 31, 2004 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time management and communications functions of PIMs largely migrated from PDAs to smartphones, with RIM (Research In Motion, now [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]]), Apple and others all manufacturing smartphones that offer most if not all of the functions of earlier PDAs. The convergence of many communications technologies, including telephone, email, social media, news and journalism, and radio transmission, in a compact, ubiquitous device, along with the ability of these devices to create, transmit and publish voice, text, photos and video almost instantaneously is a development that many social commentators expect will revolutionize the way humans interact with each other, and with government and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-565207/Modern-technology-changing-way-brains-work-says-neuroscientist.html#ixzz0il3hnpib |title=Modern technology is changing the way our brains work, says neuroscientist |newspaper=Mail Online |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virgil Solis - Tereus Philomela.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rape of Philomela by Tereus, engraved by Virgil Solis for a 1562 edition of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' (Book VI, 519–562).]]
'''Philomela''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|m|iː|l|ə}}) or '''Philomel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ə|ˌ|m|ɛ|l}}; {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|Φιλομήλη}}}}, ''Philomēlē'') is a minor figure in [[Greek mythology]] and is frequently invoked as a direct and figurative [[symbol]] in literary, artistic, and musical works in the [[Western canon]].

She is identified as being the "princess of Athens" and the younger of two daughters of [[Pandion I]], [[King of Athens]], and [[Zeuxippe]]. Her sister, [[Procne]], was the wife of King [[Tereus]] of [[Thrace]]. While the myth has several variations, the general depiction is that Philomela, after being [[rape]]d and [[Mutilation|mutilated]] by her sister's husband, [[Tereus]], obtains her revenge and is transformed into a [[nightingale]] (''Luscinia megarhynchos''), a [[Bird migration|migratory]] [[passerine]] [[bird]] native to Europe and southwest Asia and noted for its song. Because of the violence associated with the myth, the song of the nightingale is often depicted or interpreted as a sorrowful [[lament]]. Coincidentally, in nature, the female nightingale is mute and only the male of the species sings.&lt;ref name="birdsong1"&gt;Kaplan, Matt. [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/090304-nightingale-night-singing.html "Male Nightingales Explore by Day, Seduce by Night"] in National Geographic News (4 March 2009). (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="birdsong2"&gt;PHYS.ORG. "And a nightingale sang... experienced males 'show off' to protect their territories" (9 November 2011). (found online [http://phys.org/news/2011-11-nightingale-sang-experienced-males-territories.html here]). (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] and other writers have made the association (either fancifully or mistakenly) that the [[etymology]] of her name was "lover of song," derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|φιλο-}} and {{lang|grc|μέλος}} ("song") instead of {{lang|grc|μῆλον}} ("fruit" or "sheep"). The name means "lover of fruit," "lover of apples,"&lt;ref&gt;Defining φιλόμηλος as "fond of apples or fruit", see Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert; and Jones, Henry Stuart. ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1st Ed. 1843, 9th Ed. 1925, 1996).

(Retrieved 7 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; or "lover of sheep."&lt;ref&gt;Defining it as "lover of sheep", see White, J. T. ''Virgil: Georgics IV'' (London, 1884) (vocabulary), found online [https://books.google.com/books?id=OTL4lFhc1wIC&amp;dq=philomela%20%22lover%20of%20sheep%22&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=philomela%20%22lover%20of%20sheep%22&amp;f=false here] (Retrieved 7 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story of Philomela in myth==
The most complete and extant rendering of the story of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus can be found in Book VI of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (Publius Ovidius Naso) (43 BC – AD 17/18), where the story reaches its full development during antiquity.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela"&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'' Book VI, lines 424–674. (*Note that the line numbers vary among translations).&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus]] (2nd century BC),&lt;ref name="FrazerBiblioNote2"&gt;Frazer, Sir James George (translator/editor). Apollodorus, ''Library'' in 2 volumes (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; London: William Heinemann, Ltd., 1921). See note 2 to section 3.14.8, citing Pearson, A. C. (editor) ''The Fragments of Sophocles'', II:221ff. (found online [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D8 here] - retrieved 23 November 2012), where Frazer points to several other ancient source materials regarding the myth.&lt;/ref&gt; or sources that are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments—especially [[Sophocles]]' tragic drama ''[[Tereus (Sophocles)|Tereus]]'' (5th century BC).&lt;ref name="LloydFragments"&gt;Sophocles.

According to Ovid, in the fifth year of Procne's marriage to [[Tereus]], King of [[Thrace]] and son of [[Ares]], she asked her husband to "Let me at Athens my dear sister see / Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me."&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; Tereus agreed to travel to [[Athens]] and escort her sister, Philomela, to Thrace.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; King Pandion of Athens, the father of Philomela and Procne, was apprehensive about letting his one remaining daughter leave his home and protection and asks Tereus to protect her as if he were her father.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus (Book III, chapter 14, section 8), in the translation by Sir James George Frazer, Pandion fought a war with Labdacus, King of Thebes and married his daughter Procne to Tereus to secure and alliance and obtain his assistance in fighting Thebes.&lt;/ref&gt; Tereus agrees. However, Tereus [[lust]]ed for Philomela when he first saw her, and that lust grew during the course of the return voyage to Thrace.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt;

[[File:Tereus Philomelam violavit et reclusit.jpg|thumb|300px|"The Rape of Philomela by Tereus", book 6, plate 59. Engraved by [[Johann Wilhelm Baur]] for a 1703 edition of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']]
Arriving in Thrace, he forced her to a cabin or lodge in the woods and [[rape]]d her.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; After the assault, Tereus threatened her and advised her to keep silent.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; Philomela was defiant and angered Tereus. In his rage, he cut out her tongue and abandoned her in the cabin.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' Philomela's defiant speech is rendered (in an 18th-century English translation) as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Still my revenge shall take its proper time,
And suit the baseness of your hellish crime.
My self, abandon'd, and devoid of shame,
Thro' the wide world your actions will proclaim;
Or tho' I'm prison'd in this lonely den,
Obscur'd, and bury'd from the sight of men,
My mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move,
And my complainings echo thro' the grove.
Hear me, o Heav'n! and, if a God be there,
Let him regard me, and accept my pray'r.&lt;ref name="OvidDrydenGarth1717"&gt;Dryden, John; Addison, Joseph; Eusden, Laurence; Garth, Sir Samuel (translators). Ovid. ''Ovid's Metamorphoses in Fifteen Books, translated by the most eminent hands'' (London: Jacob Tonson, 1717) Volume II, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Rendered unable to speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a [[tapestry]] (or a [[robe]]&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer"&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'', 3.14.8; in Frazer, Sir James George (translator/editor).

Notes on this passage include references several variations on the myth.&lt;/ref&gt;) that told her story and had it sent to Procne.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and he became aware of their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; He snatched up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; The gods transformed Procne into a [[Swallow (bird)|swallow]] and Philomela into a [[nightingale]].&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note though that earlier Greek accounts say the opposite (Procne as the nightingale, the "tongueless" Philomela as the silent swallow) and are more consistent with the facts of the myth. Frazer in his translation of the ''Bibliotheca'' [Frazer, Sir James George (translator/editor). Apollodorus, ''Library'' in 2 volumes (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; London: William Heinemann, Ltd., 1921), in note 2 to section 3.14.8] comments that the Roman mythographers "somewhat absurdly inverted the transformation of the two sisters."&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a [[hoopoe]].&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt;

===Variations on the myth===
[[File:Bauer - Tereus Philomela Procne.jpg|thumb|300px|Depiction of Philomela and Procne showing the severed head of Itys to his father Tereus, engraved by Baur for a 1703 edition of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' (Book VI:621–647)]]
It is typical for myths from antiquity to have been altered over the passage of time or for competing variations of the myth to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Magoulick, Mary (folklorist and Professor of English &amp; Interdisciplinary Studies at Georgia College &amp; State University). [http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm What is myth?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807181158/http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm |date=7 August 2007 }} .

"The Problem of Defining Myth" in Dundes, Alan (editor) ''Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984), 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt; With the story of Philomela, most of the variations concern which sister became the nightingale or the swallow, and into what type of bird Tereus was transformed. Since Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', it has been generally accepted that Procne was transformed into a nightingale, and Philomela into a swallow.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; The description of Tereus as an "epops" has generally been translated as a hoopoe (scientific name: ''Upupa epops'').&lt;ref name="ArrowsmithAristophanes"&gt;Arrowsmith, William (editor).

Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many of the earlier sources are no longer extant, or remain only fragments, Ovid's version of the myth has been the most lasting and influenced most later works.

Early Greek sources have it that Philomela was turned into a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a beautiful but sad song in remorse.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; Later sources, among them Ovid, [[Hyginus]], and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like [[John Keats|Keats]] write that although she was tongueless, Philomela was turned into a nightingale, and Procne into a swallow.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FieldsKeatsTongueless"&gt;Fields, Beverly. "Keats and the Tongueless Nightingale: Some Unheard Melodies in 'The Eve of Saint Agnes'". ''Wordsworth Circle'' 19 (1983), 246–250.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]]' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.&lt;ref&gt;For the comparison between Homer's version and Eusthathius' version of the myth, see: [https://books.google.com/books?id=SyAOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Notes to Book XIX (regarding line 605&amp;c.)] in Pope, Alexander. ''The Odyssey of Homer, translated by A. Pope'', Volume V. (London: F. J. DuRoveray, 1806), 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is salient to note that in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[binomial nomenclature]], the [[genus]] name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is ''[[Progne]]'', a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins ''[[Ptyonoprogne]]'', and Saw-wings ''[[Psalidoprocne]]''. Coincidentally, although most of the depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.&lt;ref name="birdsong1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="birdsong2" /&gt;

In an early account, [[Sophocles]] wrote that Tereus was turned into a large-beaked bird whom some scholars translate as a [[hawk]]&lt;ref name="FitzgeraldSophTereus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halmamann, Carolin.

Smyth, Herbert Weir (translator); Aeschylus. ''Aeschylus, with an English translation by Herbert Weir Smyth, Ph. D. in two volumes.'' in ''Volume 2. Suppliant Women.'' (Cambridge, MA. Harvard University Press. 1926).&lt;/ref&gt; while a number of retellings and other works (including [[Aristophanes]]' ancient comedy, ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'') hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe.&lt;ref name="ArrowsmithAristophanes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeLucaDeconstrTereus" /&gt; Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the [[lapwing]].&lt;ref name="OvidDrydenGarth1717" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gower, John. ''Confessio Amantis'' Book V, Lines 6041–6046, refer to a "lappewincke" or "lappewinge"&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers omit key details of the story. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Tereus was so remorseful for his actions against Philomela and Itys (the nature of the actions is not described) that he kills himself. Then two birds appear as the women lament his death.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 1:41 section 8 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many later sources omit the Tereus' tongue-cutting mutilation of Philomela altogether.&lt;ref&gt;According to Delany, Chaucer barely mentions it and the Chretien de Troyes omits the "grotesquerie" entirely. Delany, Sheila. ''The Naked Text: Chaucer's Legend Of Good Women''. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 216-217, and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thucydides]], Tereus was not King of Thrace, but rather from the city of [[Daulia]] in [[Phocis]], a city inhabited by Thracians. He cites in proof of this that poets who mention the nightingale refer to it as a "Daulian bird."&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''History of the Peloponnesian War''. 2.29. In the version translated by Thomas Hobbes (London: Bohn, 1843). (found online [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.2.29&amp;lang=original here] – retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Thucydides commented on the myth in his famous work on the [[Peloponnesian War]] because Sophocles' play confused the mythical Tereus with contemporary ruler [[Teres I]] of Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Thomas B. L. ''An Introduction to Sophocles'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1936), 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements borrowed from other myths and stories===
The story of Philomela, Procne and Tereus is largely influenced by the lost tragedy ''Tereus'' of Sophocles. Scholar Jenny Marsh claims that Sophocles borrowed certain plot elements from [[Euripides]] drama ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''—notably a wife killing her child in an act of revenge against her husband—and incorporated them in his tragedy ''Tereus''. She implies that the infanticide of Itys did not appear in the Tereus myth until Sophocles' play and that it was introduced because of what was borrowed from Euripides.&lt;ref name="MarshVases"&gt;Marsh, Jenny. "Vases and Tragic Drama" in Rutter, N.K. and Sparkes, B.A. (editors) ''Word and Image in Ancient Greece'' (Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh, 2000) 121–123, 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that social and political themes have woven their way into the story as a contrast between Athenians who believed themselves to be the hegemonic power in Greece and the more civilized of the Greek peoples, and the Thracians who were considered to be a "barbaric race."&lt;ref name="LloydFragments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickTereus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, A. P. ''Revenge in Attic and later tragedy'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998) 180–189.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these elements were woven into Sophocles' play ''Tereus'' and other works of the period.

==Appearances in the Western canon==
The material of the Philomela myth has been used in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Salisury, Joyce E. ''Women in the Ancient World'' (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandlerPoetry"&gt;Chandler, Albert R. "The Nightingale in Greek and Latin Poetry," in ''The Classic Journal'' XXX:2:78–84 (The Classical Association of Middle West and South, 1934). (found online [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3289944 here]) (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the myth has been associated with the image of the nightingale and its song described as both exceedingly beautiful and sorrowful. The continued use of the image in artistic, literary, and musical works has reinforced this association.

===From antiquity and the influence of Ovid===
[[File:Philomela Procne preparing to kill Itys.jpg|thumb|300px|Image from an Attic wine cup, circa 490 BC, depicting Philomela and Procne preparing to kill Itys. (Musée du Louvre, Paris)]]
Beginning with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Odyssey'' Book XIX, lines 518–523.&lt;/ref&gt; ancient dramatists and poets evoked the story of Philomela and the nightingale in their works.&lt;ref name="ChandlerPoetry" /&gt; Most notably, it was the core of the tragedy ''[[Tereus (Sophocles)|Tereus]]'' by [[Sophocles]] (lost, extant only in fragments), and later in a set of plays by [[Philocles]], the nephew of the great playwright [[Aeschylus]]. In Aeschylus's ''[[Agamemnon]]'', the prophetess [[Cassandra]] has a visionary premonition of her own death in which she mentioned the nightingale and Itys, lamenting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah for thy fate, O shrill-voiced nightingale!
Some solace for thy woes did Heaven afford,
Clothed thee with soft brown plumes, and life apart from wail(ing)—&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, ''Agamemnon" (found online [http://www.greektexts.com/library/Aeschylus/Agamemnon/eng/print/25.html here]). (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] points to the ″voice of the shuttle″ in [[Sophocles]]′ tragedy ''Tereus'' as an example of a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has happened earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Poetics, 54b.&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by [[Aristophanes]] in his comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' and in the poetry of [[Callimachus]]. Roman poet [[Virgil]] compares the mourning of [[Orpheus]] for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, Frank. "Romanticism's Singing Bird" in ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900'' XIV:4:568 (Houston, Texas: Rice University, 1974) (found online [https://www.jstor.org/stable/449753 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ovid's retelling of the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he finished the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8.&lt;ref name="FrazerBiblioNote2" /&gt; Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version of the myth, it is the basis for many later works.

In the 12th century, French [[trouvère]] (troubadour) [[Chrétien de Troyes]]&lt;!-- it's still under debate if Chrétien was truly the author of Philomela, this should be noted. Here the reference, one of many possible ones: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/831/831-h/831-h.htm --&gt;, adapted many of the myths recounted in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' into [[Old French]]. However, de Troyes was not alone in making use of Ovid's material. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] recounted the story in his unfinished work ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gila Aloni, "Palimpsestic Philomela: Reinscription in Chaucer's 'Legend of Good Women'", in ''Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England'', eds. Leo Carruthers, Raeleen Chai-Elsholz, Tatjana Silec. New York: Palgrave, 2011. 157–73.&lt;/ref&gt; and briefly alluded to the myth in his ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chaucer, Geoffrey. ''Troilus and Criseyde'' Book II, lines 64–70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gower]] included the tale in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, John. ''Confessio Amantis'' Book VIII, lines 5545 - 6075.&lt;/ref&gt; References to Philomela are common in the [[motet]]s of the [[ars nova]], [[ars subtilior]], and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Eva Leach]], ''Sung Birds: Music, Nature, and Poetry in the Later Middle Ages'' (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Elizabethean and Jacobean England===
Throughout the late Renaissance and Elizabethean eras, the image of Philomela and the nightingale incorporated elements of mourning and beauty after being subjected to an act of [[violence]]. In the long poem "The Steele Glas" (1576), poet [[George Gascoigne]] (1535–1577) depicts "Philomel" as the representative of poetry (Poesys), her sister Progne as satire (Satyra), and Tereus as "vayne Delight."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Rebecca. ''Behind the Arras: Tapestry Ekphrasis in Spenser and Shakespeare'' (ProQuest, 2008), 164&lt;/ref&gt; The characterization of Philomela and the nightingale was that of a woman choosing to exercise her will in recovering her voice and resisting those forces which attempts to silence her. Critics have pointed to Gascoigne's use of the Philomela myth as a personal appeal and that he was fighting in verse a battle with his enemies who violently opposed his poems.&lt;ref&gt;Maslen, R. W. “Myths Exploited: the Metamorphoses of Ovid in Early Elizabethan England” in Taylor, A. B. (editor). ''Shakespeare’s Ovid: The Metamorphoses in the Plays and Poems''.

(University of Illinois Press, 1995), 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem "The complaynt of Philomene" (1576), the myth is employed to depict punishment and control.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lynette, and Lichtenfels, Peter. ''Negotiating Shakespeare's Language in Romeo and Juliet: Reading Strategies from Criticism, Editing and the Theatre''. (Farnham, England and Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009), 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd]]", Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1554–1618) relays consolation regarding the [[nymph]]'s harsh rejection of the shepherd's romantic advances in the spirit of "time heals all wounds," by citing in the second stanza (among several examples) that eventually with the passage of time Philomel would become "dumb" to her own pain and that her attention would be drawn away from the pain by the events of life to come.&lt;ref&gt;Lourenco, Alexander. [http://www.helum.com/items/879551-poetry-analysis-the-nymphs-reply-to-the-shepherd-by-william-raleigh Poetry analysis: The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd, by William Raleigh] (''sic''). Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raleigh, Sir Walter "The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd" (1600), lines 5-8: "Time drives the flocks from field to fold / When rivers rage and rocks grow cold, / And Philomel becometh dumb; / The rest complains of cares to come."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s (1554–1586) [[courtly love]] poem "The Nightingale", Sydney's narrator who is in love with a woman he cannot have compares his own romantic situation to that of Philomela's plight and claims that he has more reason to be sad. However, recent literary criticism has labelled this claim as [[Sexism|sexist]] and an unfortunate marginalization of the traumatic rape of Philomela. Sydney argues that the rape was an "excess of love" and less severe than being deprived of love as attested by the line, "Since wanting is more woe than too much having."&lt;ref&gt;Addison, Catherine. "‘Darkling I Listen’: The Nightingale’s Song In and Out of Poetry". ''[http://alternation.ukzn.ac.za/docs/16.2/13%20Addison%20F.PDF Alternation'' 16:2 (2009) 190–220], at 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] (1564–1616) makes frequent use of the Philomela myth—most notably in his tragedy ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c. 1588–1593) where characters directly reference Tereus and Philomela in commenting on rape and mutilation of Lavinia by Aaron, Chiron, and Demetrius.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley-Brown, Liz. ''Ovid And the Cultural Politics of Translation in Early Modern England''. (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2006), 26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent allusions to Philomela also occur in the depiction of Lucrece in ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See: Newman, Jane O.

''Women in the Age of Shakespeare'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010), 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Titania]]'s lullaby in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' where she asks Philomel to "sing in our sweet lullaby".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Nicole.

Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sonnet 102]], Shakespeare addresses his lover (the "fair youth") and compares his love poetry to the song of the nightingale, noting that "her mournful hymns did hush the night" (line 10), and that as a poet would "hold his tongue" (line 13) in deference to the more beautiful nightingale's song so that he "not dull you with my song" (line 14).&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Patrick.

''Shakespeare and the Question of Theory'' (New York: Methuen, 1985), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emilia Lanyer]] (1569–1645), a poet who is considered by some scholars to be the woman referred to in the poetry of William Shakespeare as "[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]", makes several references to Philomela in her patronage poem "The Description of Cookeham" in ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' (1611). Lanyer's poem, dedicated to [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]] and her daughter [[Lady Anne Clifford]] refers to Philomela's "sundry layes"(line 31) and later to her "mournful ditty" (line 189).&lt;ref&gt;Lanyer, Emilia. "The Description of Cookeham" in ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' (1611).&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the nightingale appears frequently in poetry of the period with it and its song described by poets as an example of "joyance" and gaiety or as an example of melancholy, sad, sorrowful, and mourning. However, many use the nightingale as a symbol of sorrow but without a direct reference to the Philomela myth.&lt;ref&gt;Addison cites examples including William Drummond of Hawthornden, Charlotte Smith and Robert Southey, Mary Robinson. However, cites later examples like Robert Bridges where an indirect reference to the myth may be called a "dark nocturnal secret"; in Addison, Catherine. "‘Darkling I Listen’: The Nightingale’s Song In and Out of Poetry". ''Alternation'' 16:2 (2009) 190–220&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Classical and Romantic works===
[[File:Tereo.jpg|thumb|300px|''Tereus Confronted with the Head of his Son Itylus'' (oil on canvas, painted 1636–1638), one of the late works of Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) (Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain)]]
Poets in the [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]] recast the myth and adapted the image of the nightingale with its song to be a poet and “master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet”.&lt;ref&gt;Shippey, Thomas. "Listening to the Nightingale" in ''Comparative Literature'' XXII:1 (1970), 46–60 (found online [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1769299 here] – retrieved 24 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, Frank. "Romanticism's Singing Bird" in ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900'' XIV:4 (1974), 570 (found online [https://www.jstor.org/stable/449753 here] – retrieved 24 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. [[John Keats]] (1795–1821), in "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" (1819) idealizes the nightingale as a poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats himself longs to write.  Keats directly employs the Philomel myth in "[[The Eve of St. Agnes]]" (1820) where the rape of Madeline by Porphyro mirrors the rape of Philomela by Tereus.&lt;ref name="FieldsKeatsTongueless" /&gt; Keats' contemporary, poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822) invoked a similar image of the nightingale, writing in his ''[[A Defence of Poetry]]'' that "a poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.”&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe. ''A Defense of Poetry'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Company, 1903), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, ''[[Philomèle]]'' was an [[French opera|operatic]] stage production of the story, produced by [[Louis Lacoste (composer)|Louis Lacoste]] during the reign of [[Louis XIV]].

First published in the collection ''Lyrical Ballads'', "The Nightingale" (1798) is an effort by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] (1772–1834) to move away from associations that the nightingale's song was one of melancholy and identified it with the joyous experience of nature. He remarked that "in nature there is nothing melancholy," (line 15) expressing hope "we may not thus profane / Nature’s sweet voices, always full of love / And joyance!" (lines 40–42).&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Rosemary. ''The Life of Samuel Taylor Coleridge''. (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 136-139; Mays, J. C. C. (editor). ''The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Poetical Works I'' (Volume I). (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001), 518.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the poem's conclusion, Coleridge writes of a father taking his crying son outside in the night:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
And he beheld the moon, and, hushed at once,
Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,
While his fair eyes, that swam with undropped tears,'
Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well!—
It is a father’s tale: But if that Heaven
Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up
Familiar with these songs, that with the night
He may associate joy.—&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. "Philomela" (1798), lines 102–109 in Volume I of ''Lyrical Ballads with a few other poems'' (with William Wordsworth) (London: J. &amp; A. Arch, 1798)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Coleridge, and his friend William Wordsworth (1770–1850) who called the nightingale a "fiery heart,"&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth, William. "O Nightingale, thou surely art" (1807), line 2.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted the bird "as an instance of natural poetic creation," and as the "voice of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Rana, Sujata; Dhankhar, Pooja. [http://www.languageinindia.com/dec2011/sujatabirdimagery.pdf "Bird Imagery in Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale” and Yeats’s “The Wild Swans at Coole”: A Comparative Study"] in ''Language in India'' Volume 11 (12 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable mentions include:
* In [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s 1847–8 [[serial novel|serial]] ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] performs [[charades]] of [[Clytemnestra]] (kingslayer) and Philomela (the ravished mute of king, who prompted his slaying) before the [[George IV of England|Prince Regent]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]]. Further, her performance of Philomela is styled after [[Philomèle|the play]] from the era of [[Louis XIV]], alluding to the possibility of her becoming another [[Marquise de Maintenon]].
* In the poem "Philomela" (1853) by English poet [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888), the poet asks upon hearing the crying of a fleeing nightingale if it can find peace and healing in the English countryside far away from Greece, although lamenting its pain and passion "eternal."
* In his 1881 poem "[[s:The Burden of Itys|The Burden of Itys]]", [[Oscar Wilde]] describes Itys as the symbol of Greek art and pleasure is contrasted with Christ. The landscape of Greece is also compared to the landscape of England, specifically Kent and Oxford. 
* [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] (1837–1909) wrote a poem called "Itylus" based on the story in which Philomela and Procne, after being transformed into the nightingale and swallow, ask when they will be able to forget the grief of having slain Itylus—the answer being they will forget when the world ends.
* English poet [[Ann Yearsley]] (1753–1806) in lamenting the sufferings of African slaves invokes the myth and challenges that her song "''shall teach sad Philomel a louder note,''" in her abolitionist poem "A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave-Trade" (1788)&lt;ref&gt;Yearsley, Ann. "A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave-Trade" (1788) lines 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "A la Juventud Filipina", Filipino national hero [[José Rizal]] (1861–1896), used the image of Philomel as inspiration for young Filipinos to use their voices to speak of Spanish injustice and colonial oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Zaide, Gregorio. ''Jose Rizal: Life, Works, and Writings of a Genius, Writer, Scientist, and National Hero'' (Manila, Philippines: All Nations Publishing Co., 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern works===
[[File:Thomas Stearns Eliot by Lady Ottoline Morrell (1934).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Poet T. S. Eliot's poem "The Waste Land", published in 1922, incorporates elements of the Philomela myth]]
The Philomela myth is perpetuated largely through its appearance as a powerful device in poetry. In the 20th century, American-British poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888–1965) directly referenced the myth in his most famous poem, "[[The Waste Land]]" (1922), where he describes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
"Jug Jug" to dirty ears.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T(homas) S(tearns). "The Waste Land" (New York: Horace Liveright, 1922), lines 98–103. See also lines 203–206, 428.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliot employs the myth to depict themes of sorrow, pain, and that the only recovery or regeneration possible is through revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Donnell, Sean M. [http://www.elcamino.edu/faculty/sdonnell/waste_land.htm Notes on T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land] (retrieved 24 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these mentions reference other poets' renderings of the myth, including those of Ovid and Gascoigne. Eliot's references to the nightingales singing by the convent in "Sweeney and the Nightingales" (1919–1920) is a direct reference the murder of [[Agamemnon]] in the tragedy by Aeschylus—wherein the Greek dramatist directly evoked the Philomela myth. The poem describes Sweeney as a brute and that two women in the poem are conspiring against him for his mistreatment of them. This mirrors not only the elements of Agamemnon's death in Aeschylus' play but the sister's revenge against Tereus in the myth.

In the poem "To the Nightingale", Argentine poet and fabulist, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899–1986), who compares his efforts as a poet to the bird's lament though never having heard it. He describes its song as "encrusted with mythology" and that the evolution of the myth has distorted it—that the opinions of other poets and writers have kept both poet and reader from actually hearing the original sound and knowing the essence of the song.

Several artists have applied Ovid's account to new translations or reworkings, or adapted the story for the stage. British poet [[Ted Hughes]] (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work ''[[Tales from Ovid]]'' (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. Both Israeli dramatist [[Hanoch Levin]] (in ''The Great Whore of Babylon'') and English playwright [[Joanna Laurens]] (in ''The Three Birds'') wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer [[James Dillon (composer)|James Dillon]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Stating that it was adapted from Sophocles, Thales, Eva Hesse, R. Buckminster Fuller, see [http://composers21.com/compdocs/dillonj.htm The Living Composers Project: James Dillon]. (Retrieved 22 December 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1964 [[Philomel (Babbitt)|vocal composition]] by American composer [[Milton Babbitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Hair, Graham, and Stephen Arnold. "Some Works of Milton Babbitt, Reviewed", ''Tempo'' new series, no. 90 (1969): 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; with text by [[John Hollander]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, John. "A Poem for Music: Remarks on the Composition of ''Philomel''", pp. 289–306 in ''Vision and Resonance: Two Senses of Poetic Form'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several female writers have used the Philomela myth as a vehicle for exploring the subject of rape, women and power ([[Empowerment#Empowerment of women|empowerment]]), and [[Feminism|feminist]] themes, including novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] in her novella ''Nightingale'' published in ''The Tent'' (2006), [[Emma Tennant]] in her story "Philomela", [[Jeannine Hall Gailey]] who uses the myth in several poems published in ''[[Becoming the Villainess]]'' (2006), and [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]] in her play ''[[The Love of the Nightingale]]'' (1989) (later adapted into an [[The Love of the Nightingale (opera)|opera of the same name]] composed by [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]]).

'''Polythematic structured-subject heading system''' (abbreviated as '''PSH''' from the [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Polytematický Strukturovaný Heslář'') is a bilingual Czech–English [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[Index term|subject headings]] developed and maintained by the National Technical Library (the former State Technical Library) in [[Prague]]. It was designed for describing and searching information resources according to their subject. PSH contains more than 13,900 terms, which cover the main fields of human knowledge.

[[Image:Lod-datasets 2010-09-22 colored.png|thumb|The Linking Open Data cloud diagram]]
Thanks to its release in [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS]], PSH can be used not only for describing documents in a library, but also for [[Web indexing|indexing web pages]]. Everyone can use PSH for free. PSH is a part of the Linking Open Data cloud diagram (LOD cloud diagaram). The image of the LOD cloud diagram shows datasets that have been published in [[Linked Data]] format, by contributors to the Linking Open Data community project and other individuals and organisations.

== History and development ==
The PSH preparation project started in 1993, supported by several grants from the Czech Ministry of Culture and Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. Since 1995, PSH has been used for indexing the State Technical Library's documents. Starting 1997,&lt;ref&gt;KLOUČKOVÁ, Zdenka. Polytematický strukturovaný heslář Státní technické knihovny. Čtenář. 1997, vol. 49, no. 4, p. 128-129. ISSN 0011-2321.&lt;/ref&gt; PSH has been distributed to other libraries and companies, originally as a commercial, paid product; since 2009&lt;ref&gt;MYNARZ, Jindřich; KAMRÁDKOVÁ, Kateřina; KOŽUCHOVÁ, Kristýna. [http://www.techlib.cz/files/download/id/649/psh-cc.pdf Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System &amp; Creative Commons]. In Seminář ke zpřístupňování šedé literatury [online]. 2008– [retrieved 2010-05-28]. Praha : Státní technická knihovna, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; for free. In 2000, the State Technical Library received a grant from the Ministry of Culture to translate PSH into English. The next milestone in its development was its releasing in the [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS]] format, in 2009.&lt;ref name="mynarz"&gt;MYNARZ, Jindřich; KOŽUCHOVÁ, Kristýna; KAMRÁDKOVÁ, Kateřina. [http://www.ikaros.cz/node/5591 Novinky z oblasti Polytematického strukturovaného hesláře]. Ikaros [online]. 2009, vol. 13, no. 7 [retrieved 2010-05-28]. URN-NBN:cz-ik5591. ISSN 1212-5075.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of new subject headings is suggested and approved by the indexing experts from the National Technical Library. However, the users and public can also make suggestions, using an online form, which are then assessed by the experts. The main decisions about the development and the future of PSH are done by the Committee for Coordination of Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System. The Committee consists of specialists from the National Technical Library and cooperating institutions, and representatives from the libraries and companies which use PSH. The Committee meets once a year in the National Technical Library; in the meantime, the members communicate using an [[electronic mailing list]].&lt;ref name="mynarz" /&gt;

== Browsing PSH ==
PSH Browser was released in June 2009. It serves for browsing the PSH system and its distribution in SKOS format. This tool navigates users through PSH from general to specific terms. Users can also use the Search field. PSH manager tool was released in 2012. It serves as an indexing tool especially to catalogers. Catalogers can easy orient in its clear structure. All the terms in PSH manager contain link to the catalogue of NTK. There can be also viewed the record in MARC21 format.

== Autoindexing ==
In 2012 was released beta version of autoindexing application. It is accessible on Autoindexing. Users enter chosen text into indexing field and activate indexing. In few seconds the terms describing content are displayed.

== PSH structure ==
PSH is a [[tree structure]] with 44 thematic sections. Subject headings are included in a hierarchy of six (or seven) levels according to their [[Semantics|semantic]] content and specificity. There are hierarchical, associative ("see also") and [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] ("see") relations in PSH. Hierarchical relations are represented by broader and narrower terms (e.g. ''physical diagnostic methods'' is broader term to ''electrocardiography'', and on the other hand, ''electrocardiography'' is narrower term to ''physical diagnostic methods''). Equivalence relations link subject headings with their nonpreferred versions (e.g. ''electrocardiography'' and ''ECG''). Moreover, associative relations are used to link related subject headings from different parts of PSH, regardless their affiliation to a section, (e.g. ''electrocardiography'': see also ''cardiology''). Every subject heading belongs to just one section, which has its own two-character abbreviation, assigned to every subject heading of the section. This enables users to recognize affiliation of subject headings from lower levels to the thematic sections. The 44 thematic sections have following [[Tree (data structure)|root nodes]]:

== PSH formats ==
The main format for storage, maintenance and sharing PSH is the [[MARC standards|MARC 21 Format for Authority Data]], which is implemented in [[integrated library system|library automated systems]]. PSH is also available in [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS]], using [[RDF/XML]] syntax, which is a version suitable for web distribution. Single headings can be accessed on the PSH website through [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] links. Alternatively, the whole vocabulary can be downloaded in one file. It is possible to display tags from PSH ([[metadata]] snippets – [[Dublin Core]] and CommonTag), which can be embedded in an HTML document to provide its semantic description in a machine-readable way.

== New subject headings ==
New subject headings are primarily obtained through the log analysis in the National Technical Library's on-line catalogue of documents, which are the terms used by end-users when searching various documents. Google Analytics service is now used for gaining search queries used by users. Within the data analysis, users queries are divided into seven categories that contain the title of the document, person, subject, action, institution, geographical terms and others. Then the candidates for new preferred terms and non-preferred terms are identified in the subject category.

Users can suggest preferred or non-preferred terms through the web form or via e-mail psh(@)techlib.cz.

== PSH and Creative Commons ==
PSH/SKOS has been available under the Creative Commons License CC BY 3.0 CZ (Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Czech Republic)since 2011. Users are free to copy, distribute, display and perform the work and make derivative works, but they must give the original author credit and if they alter, transform, or build upon this work, they have to distribute the resulting work only under a licence identical to this one.

The '''preorbital gland''' is a paired [[exocrine gland]] found in many species of [[even-toed ungulate|hoofed animals]], which is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the [[lacrimal gland]] found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial [[canthus]] of each eye. They are lined by a combination of [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] and [[Sweat gland|sudoriferous]] [[gland]]s, and they produce [[secretion]]s which contain [[pheromone]]s and other [[semiochemical]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Rue2004/&gt; Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a [[Animal communication|means of communication]] with other animals.&lt;ref name=Albone1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt;

The preorbital gland serves different roles in different species. Pheromone-containing secretions from the preorbital gland may serve to establish an animal's [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] (especially in preparation for [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|breeding]]),&lt;ref name=Kile1977/&gt; mark its [[Territory (animal)|territory]], or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal.&lt;ref name=deerglands/&gt; Because of its critical role in scent marking, the preorbital gland is usually considered as a type of [[scent gland]]. A further function of these glands may be to produce [[antimicrobial]] compounds to fight against skin [[pathogen]]s. Antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by the animal itself, or by [[microorganism]]s that live in these glands.&lt;ref name=Wood2010/&gt;

==In cervids==
[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a male [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), taken during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|mating season]]. Note the prominent preorbital gland, which is [[Hypertrophy|enlarged]] and dilated.]]

[[Deer]] have seven major external [[scent gland]]s, distributed throughout their bodies. These glands are the [[forehead gland]]s (located on the forehead), the preorbital glands (located below the eyes), the [[nasal glands]] (located inside the nostrils), the [[interdigital gland]]s (located between the toes), the [[preputial gland]] (located inside the foreskin of the [[deer's penis]]), the [[metatarsal gland]]s (located outside of the hind legs), and the [[tarsal gland (ungulate)|tarsal glands]] (located inside of the hind legs).&lt;ref name=Nickens2009/&gt; Though it is not their primary function, the [[salivary gland]]s also function as scent glands. Deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species, and possibly even with members of other species. A deer may rub its preorbital gland (e.g., on a branch) purely for pleasure.&lt;ref name=deerglands/&gt;

===North American deer===
The two major species of deer found in [[North America]] are the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus'') and the [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''). The most important [[sense]] in these animals is [[olfaction]] (the sense of smell)—so much so that they have an [[Olfaction#Accessory olfactory system|accessory olfaction system]].
The [[vomeronasal organ]], located at the base of the [[nasal cavity]], is the sensory organ for this system. Besides locating food and water, deer rely on their two separate olfactory systems to detect the presence of predators, as well as to supply them with information about the identity, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of other deer.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

The preorbital gland of ''O. virginianus'' is about {{convert|22|mm|in|sp=us}} in length, while that of ''O. hemionus'' is roughly {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} in length. In [[black-tailed deer]] (''O. h. columbianus''), a subspecies of ''O. hemionus'', the preorbital gland measures about {{convert|32|mm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Rue2004/&gt; In all of these animals, the preorbital glands are surrounded by muscle which is under voluntary control, at least to some extent.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

It is not entirely clear whether the preorbital gland secretions of North American deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the closed position, but they are capable of opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

===Other deer===
[[File:Elaphurus davidianus 02.JPG|thumb|A male [[Père David's Deer|Père David's deer]] (''Elaphurus davidianus''). Note the large preorbital gland extending from just below the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].]]
[[File:Sambhar deer.jpg|thumb|A male [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor'') in [[Pench National Park]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. These animals are often referred to as "four-eyed deer", due to their large preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Leslie2011/&gt;]]

In juvenile [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), the preorbital gland appears to play a role in the response to stress. The preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf, whereas it is opened in a stressed calf.&lt;ref name=Bartosova2007/&gt; One example of this is the signalling of hunger and satiety. Fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they are hungry, and close the gland after feeding, when they are no longer hungry.&lt;ref name=Bartos2005/&gt;

Other than during the rut (mating season) and for the first six months after giving birth, the adult [[Indian muntjac]] (''Muntiacus muntjac'') is a solitary animal. Adult males in particular are well spaced and marking grass and bushes with secretions from their preorbital glands appears to be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of territory.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg1974/&gt;

==In bovids==
[[File:Hirola2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') are often referred to as the "four-eyed antelope", due to their large preorbital glands&lt;ref name=Frommer2010/&gt;]]

The [[bovid]]s ([[family (biology)|family]] Bovidae) comprise some 140 species of [[ruminant]]s in which at least the males bear unbranched, hollow [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] covered in a permanent sheath of [[keratin]]. Most species of bovids have means of spacing themselves across their habitat; territorial behavior is the most consistent type of spacing behavior.&lt;ref name=Bergerud1974/&gt;

[[Goat-antelope|Caprids]] (dwarf antelope, such as the [[sheep]], [[Capra (genus)|goats]], [[muskox]], [[serow]]s, [[goral]]s, and several similar species) use their preorbital glands to establish [[Dominance hierarchy|social rank]]. For example, when competition arises between two grazing sheep (''Ovis aries''), they have been observed to nuzzle each other's preorbital glands. By sending and receiving olfactory cues, this behavior appears to be a means of establishing dominance and of avoiding a fight, which would otherwise involve potentially injurious butting or clashing with the forehead.&lt;ref name=Baskin1974/&gt;

The [[Antilopinae|antilopine]] bovids (dwarf antelope, such as the [[springbok]], [[blackbuck]], [[gazelle]]s, [[dik-dik]]s, [[oribi]], and several similar species) have well-developed preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt;

Among the [[Duiker|cephalophines]], members of the ''Philantomba'' and ''Sylvicapra'' genera are all solitary animals which display territorial behavior and have well developed preorbital glands. [[Maxwell's duiker]] (''Philantomba maxwellii'') is a solitary animal which utilizes preorbital gland secretions to mark its territory. This behavior is observed most in adult males, less frequently in females, and less still in subadults of this species.&lt;ref name=Bigalke1974/&gt; Secretions from the preorbital gland of the common duiker contain at least 33 different [[chemical compound]]s. Two [[thiazole]] compounds and an [[epoxy]] [[ketone]] are present in significantly higher concentrations in male than in female secretions, suggesting that they could serve as sex recognition cues.&lt;ref name=Burger1990/&gt;

The [[Alcelaphinae|alcephine]] bovids ([[wildebeest]]s, [[hartebeest]]s, [[hirola]], [[bontebok]], [[blesbok]], and several similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex mixtures of chemical compounds.&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt; The preorbital glands of the [[bontebok]] (''Damaliscus pygargus pygarus'') are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at the borders of their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the head from side to side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes.&lt;ref name=Damaliscus/&gt; In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the [[klipspringer]] (''Oreotragus oreotragus'') is a semi-[[Herd|gregarious]] species, while the [[hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Bigalke1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beatragus/&gt;

Differences in the social structure and marking behavior among different species may lead to a different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, [[Günther's dik-dik]] (''Madoqua guentheri'') is a [[monogamy|monogamous]] species of [[antelope]] that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large [[Antorbital fenestra|preorbital pits]] in the [[lacrimal bone]], and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the [[Saiga Antelope|saiga antelope]] (''Saiga tatarica'') is a [[polygamy|polygamous]] and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory at any time during the year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.&lt;ref name=Frey1997/&gt;

==Research directions==
The recent identification of several antimicrobial compounds from the secretions of animal [[Dermis|dermal]] scent glands may be the beginning of a promising new area of [[drug development]]. Assuming [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]]s of these [[lead compound]]s can be [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] and [[Structure–activity relationship|found to be effective]] ''in vivo'', the potential exists for producing new antimicrobial agents against pathogenic skin microorganisms.&lt;ref name=Wood2010/&gt;

In [[standardization]], a '''profile''' is a subset internal to a [[specification]]. Aspects of a complex technical specification may necessarily have more than one interpretation, and there are probably many optional features. These aspects constitute a profile of the standard. Two implementations engineered from the same description may not interoperate due to having a different profile of the standard.  Vendors can even ignore features that they view as unimportant, yet prevail in the long run.  

The use of profiles in these ways can force one interpretation, or create de facto standards from official standards. Engineers can design or procure by using a profile to ensure interoperability.  For example, the International Standard Profile, ISP, is used by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in their ISO ISP series of standards; in the context of [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI networking]], Britain uses the UK-GOSIP profile and the US uses US-[[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile|GOSIP]]; there are also various mobile profiles adopted by the [[W3C]] for web standards. In particular, implementations of standards on mobile devices often have significant limitations compared to their traditional desktop implementations, even if the standard which governs both permits such limitations. 

In [[structural engineering]] a '''profile''' means a [[Hot rolling|hot rolled]] [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|structural steel]] shape like an [[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]].

In [[civil engineering]], a '''profile''' consists of a plotted line which indicates grades and distances (and typically depths of cut and/or elevations of fill) for excavation and grading work. Constructors of [[road]]ways, [[Rail transport|railways]] (and similar works) normally chart the profile along the centerline. A profile can also indicate the vertical slope(s) (changes in elevation) in a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] or similar structure. Civil engineers always depict profile as a side ([[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]) view (as opposed to an overhead ([[Plan view|plan]]) view).

== Material fabrication ==
In [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]], a '''profile''' consists of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or [[steel]] [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|plate]]. In modern practice, a drawing office determines the shape and dimensions required to fit the sheet into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a [[profile cutter]]. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a rotating cutter like that of a [[Wood router#Similar tools|spindle router]] or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns [[oxyacetylene|oxy-acetylene]] or other oxy-gas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6320">'''Robert Jowitt Whitwell''' B.Litt. (31 August 1859 &amp;ndash; 15 May 1928) was a British [[Medieval studies|medievalist]] who made significant contributions to [[lexicography]].

== Personal ==

Robert Jowitt Whitwell was born in August 1859 to Mary Ann Jowitt and Edward Whitwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pease|first=Charles|title=Whitwell of Kendal|url=http://www.pennyghael.org.uk/gedcom.htm|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whitwell family were based in [[Kendal]], where Edward's brother [[John Whitwell|John]] was the local [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] from 1868 to 1880. In April 1884, Robert married Louisa Crommelin Brown, a [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]], with whom he had two daughters and one son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=R. Seymour|title=Photographic pedigree of the descendants of Isaac and Rachel Wilson|year=1912|publisher=W. Appleyard &amp; Sons|location=Middlesbrough|page=34|url=https://archive.org/stream/photographicpedi00bens#page/34/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1898, they had moved to [[Oxford]], where they lived at 70 [[Banbury Road]], a few doors away from the [[James Murray (lexicographer)|editor of the OED]]. In 1914 their younger daughter, Louisa Crommelin Roberta Jowitt Whitwell, married [[Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford|Hastings Russell]], the then [[Duke of Bedford|Marquess of Tavistock]], who had studied history at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffiths|first=Richard|title=Russell, Hastings William Sackville, twelfth duke of Bedford (1888–1953)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58844|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 November 2011|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert died in May 1928, and his wife Louisa died in January 1945.

== Academic ==

In his twenties, while he was still living in Kendal, Whitwell became a prolific voluntary contributor to the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]], submitting some 17,000 quotation slips between 1879 and 1884;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=James|title=List of Readers and Works Read for the Dictionary 1879-1884|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|year=1884|volume=19|pages=641}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the time the first volume was published in 1888, his slip total was the 7th highest at 33,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (A&amp;ndash;B)|year=1888|url=https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/n12/mode/1up|last=Murray|first=James|page=xv|chapter=Appendix to Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic life was, however, based at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], where he received a [[Degrees of the University of Oxford#Postgraduate degrees|B.Litt.]] from [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] before becoming associated with [[New College, Oxford|New College]]. In 1901, he was Honorary Secretary of the [[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society|Oxford Architectural and Historical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pantin|first=W. A.|title=The Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, 1839-1939|journal=Oxoniensia|year=1939|volume=4|pages=193|url=http://www.oxoniensia.org/volumes/1939/pantin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1907 he was listed as a tutor in [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Modern History]] with colleagues including [[Henry William Carless Davis|H. W. C. Davis]], [[Geoffrey Baskerville|G. Baskerville]], [[Falconer Madan|F. Madan]], [[Reginald Lane Poole|R. L. Poole]], [[Robert Rait|R. Rait]], and [[Arthur Lionel Smith|A. L. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholz|first=R. F.|title=Oxford and the Rhodes Scholarships|year=1907|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitwell made his greatest contribution to scholarship in 1913. Frustrated with the standard dictionary of [[medieval Latin]], [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]]'s ''Glossarium'' (1678), he petitioned the [[British Academy]] to use the third 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies to propose "an adequate and complete dictionary of the language, based on the best authorities and compiled on modern scientific principles" with the collaboration of "historical scholars of all countries".&lt;ref&gt;Whitwell, Robert Jowitt (1 February 1913). "Mediaeval Latin", letter to ''The Spectator''. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was signed by 82 British scholars, including the editors of the OED, and Whitwell was duly allowed to put the proposal to the first plenary session of the Congress, held in the Great Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn#Great Hall|Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Charles|title=British Work on the Mediaeval Latin Dictionary|journal=Bulletin du Cange|year=1928|volume=4|hdl=2042/2528|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American historian [[J. Franklin Jameson|J. F. Jameson]], reporting on the Congress, warned that the task that Whitwell envisaged "could not be hopefully undertaken with resources less formidable than those of the [[Union Académique Internationale|International Union of Academies]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jameson|first=J. Franklin|title=The International Congress of Historical Studies, Held at London|journal=American Historical Review|date=July 1913|volume=18|issue=4|page=685|jstor=1834765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World War I|First World War]] made cooperation on such a scale impossible, but it was indeed the IUA who revived Whitwell's suggestion in 1920, and by the time he died in May 1928 a coordinated effort from over ten countries was well under way. His death was noted with regret at the sixth 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies by [[Charles Johnson (historian)|Charles Johnson]], who said that Whitwell "not only actively promoted the whole [international] scheme but was a zealous member of the committee [on [[Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources|British medieval Latin]] after [[Norman conquest of England|1066]]] and a generous contributor of excerpts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Charles|title=British Work on the Mediaeval Latin Dictionary|journal=Bulletin du Cange|year=1928|volume=4|hdl=2042/2528|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Sexism''' is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] based on a person's [[Sex and gender distinction|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects women and girls.&lt;!--NOTE: Consensus among WP:Reliable sources, assessed via WP:Due weight, is that sexism is typically against women. Before removing this text, raise the issue on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
*{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |access-date= |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex".
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls". Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls. It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that {{"'}}Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls". Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination". 
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2|year=2005|publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assumes women's inferiority to men".
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims".
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women. Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Foster |first=Carly Hayden |editor-last=Kurlan|editor-first=George Thomas|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Political Science |title=Sexism |year=2011 |publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781608712434}} Notes that "both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive".
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell}} Suggests that "the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females."
*{{cite book |last=Lorber |first=Judith |year=2011 |title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=5}} Notes that "although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men".
*{{cite book |last1=Wortman |first1=Camille B. |last2=Loftus |first2=Elizabeth S. |last3=Weaver |first3=Charles A |title=Psychology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1999}} "As throughout history, today women are the primary victims of sexism, prejudice directed at one sex, even in the United States."

Theoretically, gender discrimination has been described as (1) the unequal rewards that men and women receive in the workplace or academic environment because of their gender or sex difference (DiThomaso, 1989); (2) a process occurring in work or educational settings in which an individual is overtly or covertly limited access to an opportunity or a resource because of a sex or is given the opportunity or the resource reluctantly and may face harassment for picking it (Roeske &amp; Pleck, 1983); or (3) both.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender discrimination is especially defined in terms of [[workplace inequality]].&lt;ref name="Lenhart"/&gt;

== Etymology and definitions ==
According to [[Fred R. Shapiro]], the term "sexism" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by Pauline M. Leet during a "Student-Faculty Forum" at [[Franklin and Marshall College]].&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/feminism-friday-the-origins-of-the-word-sexism/ |title=Feminism Friday: The origins of the word "sexism" |website=Finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Daniel J.|title=The Wise Legacy: How One Professor Transformed the Nation|date=February 16, 2015|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781507625590|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjbGBgAAQBAJ|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the word sexism appears in Leet's forum contribution "Women and the Undergraduate", and she defines it by comparing it to racism, stating in part (on page 3): "When you argue ... that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist—I might call you in this case a 'sexist' ... Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone's value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant."&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

Also according to Shapiro, the first time the term "sexism" appeared in print was in [[Caroline Bird (American author)|Caroline Bird]]'s speech "On Being Born Female", which was published on November 15, 1968, in ''Vital Speeches of the Day'' (p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt; In this speech she said in part: "There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn't matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism."&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

Sexism may be defined as an [[ideology]] based on the belief that one sex is superior to another.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663953971|title=Sociology in modules|last=T.|first=Schaefer, Richard|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=9780078026775|location=New York, NY|pages=525|oclc=663953971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468109511|title=Sociology|last=J.|first=Macionis, John|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|year=|isbn=9780205749898|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=330|oclc=468109511}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is discrimination, prejudice, or stereotyping on the basis of gender, and is most often expressed toward girls and women.&lt;ref name="Sexism"/&gt; It has been characterized as the "hatred of women" and "entrenched prejudice against women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM's sexism rant prompts Australian dictionary rewrite |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/19/world/asia/australia-macquarie-misogyny/|publisher=CNN|date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Witch hunts and trials ===
{{Main|Witch hunt}}
[[File:Malleus maleficarum, Köln 1520, Titelseite.jpg|thumb|Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520 (from the [[University of Sydney Library]]). The Latin title is "''MALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Maleficas, &amp; earum hæresim, ut phramea potentissima conterens''". (Generally translated into English as ''The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword'').&lt;ref&gt;The English translation is from [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html this note] to [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html Summers' 1928 introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225301/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Sexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the 15th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern Europe]], and in the European colonies in North America, claims were made that [[witch]]es were a threat to [[Christendom]]. The [[misogyny]] of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'', the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the authors argue that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and write that:

: All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman&amp;nbsp;... What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colours!&lt;ref&gt;Kramer and Sprenger. Malleus Malificarum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is [[punishable by death]]. In 2011, a woman was beheaded in that country for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=CNN | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' - CNN.com | date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world; for example, in [[Tanzania]], about 500 elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;The World Health Organization.

When women are targeted for accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence, it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact - for example, discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on [[caste]], as is the case in India and Nepal, where such crimes are relatively common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7241937/Witch-hunts-of-low-caste-women-in-Nepal.html|title=Witch-hunts of low-caste women in Nepal|first=By Deepesh Shrestha, in Pyutar for|last=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/witch-hunting-india-poor-low-caste-widows-main-targets-1457809|title=Witch Hunting in India: Poor, Low Caste and Widows Main Targets|first=Ludovica|last=Iaccino|date=22 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws, regulations, and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world, and to contribute to the mistreatment of women, in particular in areas related to [[sexual violence]] and to self-determination in regard to [[sexuality]], the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of [[women's rights]]; in 2012, [[Navi Pillay]], then [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], has stated that:

:"Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception ... Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues—such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children—are at the heart of living a life in dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pillay |first=N. |date=2012 |title=Valuing women as autonomous beings: Women's sexual reproductive health rights |website=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner |accessdate=18 April 2015 |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313210726/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf# |archive-date=2017-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suffrage and politics ===
[[File:Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Annie Kenney]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]].]]

Gender has been used, at times, as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. [[Women's suffrage]] was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia was the most recent country, as of August 2015, to extend the right to vote to women in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Women's Suffrage Granted, by Country|url=https://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently: [[Switzerland|Swiss]] women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971,&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] became the last [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] to grant women the right to vote on local issues (in 1991, when it was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; French women were granted the right to vote in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Pierre Maury |url=http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1944-2.htm |title=Ordonnance du 21 avril 1944 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics en France après la Libération |publisher=Mjp.univ-perp.fr |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/femmes/citoyennete_politique_de-Gaulle.asp |title=La citoyenneté politique des femmes&amp;nbsp;– La décision du Général de Gaulle |author=Assemblée nationale |accessdate=2007-12-19 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, women obtained the right to vote in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Greece.htm|title=European Database: Women in Decision-making - Country Report Greece|author=Kerstin Teske: teske@fczb.de|website=db-decision.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women obtained the right to vote in 1984, through the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1066106.stm|title=BBC News - Timeline: Liechtenstein|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/world/around-the-world-liechtenstein-women-win-right-to-vote.html|title=Liechtenstein Women Win Right to Vote|date=2 July 1984|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada and the United States, women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=4|issue=3|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are nonetheless still present. Certain issues (e.g., education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g., taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/&gt; In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates' personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/&gt;

Sexism in politics can also be shown in the imbalance of law making power between men and women. Lanyan Chen stated that men hold more political power than women, serving as the gatekeepers of policy making. It is possible that this leads to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality of law making power also causes the gender discrimination in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Lanyan|title=The Gendered Reality of Migrant Workers in Globalizing China|date=2009|publisher=The University of Ottawa|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0-7766-0709-2|pages=186–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the [[United Nations|UN]] created [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] and its newer incarnation the [[Gender Inequality Index]].

Thoman and others (2008) hypothesize that "[t]he socio-cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender-math stereotype may impact women pursuing math". Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women’s math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component. As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals' academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thoman | first1=Dustin B. | last2=White | first2=Paul H. | last3=Yamawaki | first3=Niwako | last4=Koishi | first4=Hirofumi | year=2008 | title=Variations of Gender–math Stereotype Content Affect Women's Vulnerability to Stereotype Threat | url=| journal=Sex Roles | volume=58 | issue=9–10| pages=702–12 | doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9390-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:

*The use of generic masculine terms to reference a group of mixed gender, such as "mankind", "man" (referring to humanity), "guys", or "officers and men"
*The use of the singular masculine pronoun (he, his, him) as the default to refer to a person of unknown gender 
*Terms ending in "-man" that may be performed by those of non-male genders, such as businessman, chairman, or policeman
*The use of unnecessary gender markers, such as "male nurse" implying that simply a "nurse" is by default assumed to be female.&lt;ref name="Kennison &amp; Trofe 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kennison| first1=S. |last2=Trofe |first2=J. |title=Comprehending Pronouns: A Role for Word-Specific Gender Stereotype Information |journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research| volume=32| issue=3| year=2003| pages=355–378 |doi=10.1023/A:1023599719948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist and gender-neutral language ===
{{See also|Gender-neutral language}}
Various feminist movements in the 20th century, from [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]] to [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]] and [[queer theory]] have all considered language in their theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Mille, Katherine Wyly and Paul McIlvenny. "Gender and Spoken Interaction: A Survey of Feminist Theories and Sociolinguistic Research in the United States and Britain." {{cite web|url=http://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309145105/https://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf |archivedate=2005-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language.

One of the most common calls is for gender-neutral language. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language isn't inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but rather the way it is used becomes sexist and gender-neutral language could thus be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthven, K.K. "Feminist literary studies: an introduction." http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam034/90034404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other opposed critiques of sexism in language with explanations that language is a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and attempts to control it can be fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/language.htm |title=Against the Theory of "Sexist Language" |publisher=Friesian.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism in languages other than English ===
[[Romanic languages]] such as [[French language|French]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sayare, S. (2012) 'Mademoiselle' exits official France. The New York Times. Retrieved 18 April 2015 from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/europe/france-drops-mademoiselle-from-official-use.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12843948 |title=Mexico advises workers on sexist language - BBC News |publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen as reinforcing sexism, in that the masculine form is the default form. The word "[[wikt:mademoiselle|mademoiselle]]", meaning "[[miss]]", was declared banished from French administrative forms in 2012 by Prime Minister [[François Fillon]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed-sex group to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40545648|title=Attacking a Legacy of Sexist Grammar in the French Class: A Modest Beginning|first=Culley Jane|last=Carson|date=1 January 1993|journal=Feminist Teacher|volume=7|issue=2|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to Spanish, Mexico's Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[German language|German]] speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nandi |first=Jacinta |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/05/grappling-with-language-sexism/ |title=Grappling with language sexism |publisher=blogs.reuters.com |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, gerund nouns are sometimes used instead, as this completely eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of ''die Studenten'' ("the men students") or ''die Studentinnen'' ("the women students"), one writes ''die Studierenden'' ("the [people who are] studying").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/gleichberechtigung-im-studium-studenten-aeh-aeh-studierende-1.2355340|title=Gleichberechtigung im Studium: Studenten, äh, Studierende|first=Johann|last=Osel|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Osel, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4316075|title=Sexism in the Chinese Language|first=Dali|last=Tan|date=1 January 1990|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=2|issue=4|pages=635–639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender-specific pejorative terms ===
Gender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/media/7480/sst-guidance-quick-guide.pdf|title=Guidance for schools on preventing and responding to sexist, sexual and transphobic bullying : quick guide|last=|first=|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Great Britain Department for Children, Schools and Families|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|oclc=663427461|quote=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716122907/http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/media/7480/sst-guidance-quick-guide.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Disdain|condescension]]. For example, one may refer to a female as a "girl" rather than a "woman", implying that they are subordinate or not fully mature. Other examples include obscene language. &lt;!-- Do not list swear words here. --&gt;Some words are offensive to transgender people, including "tranny", "she-male", or "he-she". Intentional [[Transphobia#Misgendering and exclusion|misgendering]] (assigning the wrong gender to someone) and the pronoun "it" are also considered pejorative.&lt;ref name="Mills College Report on Inclusion of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Students Best Practices, Assessment and Recommendations"&gt;Mills College Transgender Best Practices Taskforce &amp; Gender Identity and Expression Sub-Committee of the Diversity and Social Justice Committee.

Occupational sexism refers to [[discriminatory]] practices, statements or actions, based on a person's [[sex]], occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is [[wage discrimination]]. In 2008, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; The report stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;[In] many countries, labour market [[discrimination]]—i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group—is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' suggests that about 8 percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30 percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labour market.&lt;ref name="oecd1"&gt;[[OECD]].

=== Gap in hiring ===
Research has repeatedly shown that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally-qualified fathers and, if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children.&lt;ref name="Folbre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Correll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;

One study found that female applicants were favored; however, its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers, since it contradicts most other studies on the issue. Joan C. Williams, a distinguished professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, raised issues with its methodology, pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well-qualified. Studies using more moderately-qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired, offered better salaries, and offered mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|author=Wendy M.

In Europe, studies based on field experiments in the labour market, provide evidence for no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender.

=== Earnings gap ===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
[[File:EU 27 Gender Pay Gap 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Bar graph showing the gender pay gap in European countries|Gender pay gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2014.&lt;ref name="EC stats" /&gt;]]
Studies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide. Some people argue that this is the result of widespread gender discrimination in the workplace. Others argue that the wage gap is a result of different choices by men and women, such as women placing more value than men on having children, and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business, engineering and technology.

[[Eurostat]] found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 27.5% in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="EC stats"&gt;[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the OECD found that female full-time employees earned 27% less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"/&gt;

In the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (56.7–54.2%), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (54.2–67.6%), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (67.6–71.2%) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (71.2–77.0%).&lt;ref name="census 2009"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau. [https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf ''Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009.''] Current Population Reports, P60-238, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 2010, pp. 7 and 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Women's Policy Research. [http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-2009 ''The Gender Wage Gap: 2009''.] Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the first [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] was passed in 1963, female full-time workers earned 48.9% as much as male full-time workers.&lt;ref name="census 2009"/&gt;

Research conducted in the Czech and Slovak Republics shows that, even after the governments passed anti-discrimination legislation, two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to "represent a major source of the gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Štěpán |last=Jurajda |year=2005 |title=Gender Segregation and Wage Gap: An East-West Comparison |journal=[[Journal of the European Economic Association]] |volume=3 |issue=2–3 |pages=598–607 |doi=10.1162/jeea.2005.3.2-3.598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender gap can also vary across-occupation and within occupation. In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joseph E., Jr. |last=Zveglich |first2=Yana van der Meulen |last2=Rodgers |title=Occupational Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap in a Dynamic East Asian Economy |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |volume=70 |issue=4 |year=2004 |pages=850–875 |doi=10.2307/4135276 |jstor=4135276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christopher J. |last=Gerry |first2=Byung-Yeon |last2=Kim |first3=Carmen A. |last3=Li |title=The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Arrears in Russia: Evidence from the RLMS |journal=[[Journal of Population Economics]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=267–288 |doi=10.1007/s00148-003-0160-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research also found that "wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias). Women currently take significantly more time off to raise children than men.&lt;ref&gt;The Open University: Learning Space.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-8.2.1.pdf "Economics Explains Discrimination in the Labour Market."] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In certain countries such as South Korea, it has also been a long-established practice to lay-off female employees upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gyeongjoon |last=Yoo |year=2003 |title=Quality of Life Across Population Groups: Women in the Workplace: Gender and Wage Differentials |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=62 |issue=1–3 |pages=367–385 |doi=10.1023/A:1022661604653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by professor Linda Babcock in her book ''Women Don't Ask'' shows that men are eight times more likely to ask for a pay raise, suggesting that pay inequality may be partly a result of behavioral differences between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Women Don't Ask |title=Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide |first=Linda |last=Babcock |first2=Sara |last2=Laschever |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |chapterurl=https://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7575.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies generally find that a portion of the gender pay gap remains unexplained after accounting for factors assumed to influence earnings; the unexplained portion of the wage gap is attributed to gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]].

Estimates of the discriminatory component of the gender pay gap vary. The OECD estimated that approximately 30% of the gender pay gap across OECD countries is due to discrimination.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; Australian research shows that discrimination accounts for approximately 60% of the wage differential between men and women.&lt;ref name="natsem"&gt;National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling.

Wage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of [[supply and demand]], which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a [[competitive advantage]]. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/ |title=Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics: The Wage Gap |publisher=Swift Economics |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705013033/http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Proposed Explanations}} Possible causes for wage discrimination ====
According to Denise Venable at the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]], the "wage gap" in the United States is not the result of discrimination but of differences in lifestyle choices. Venable's report found that women are less likely than men to sacrifice personal happiness for increases in income or to choose full-time work. She found that among American adults working between one and thirty-five hours a week and part-time workers who have never been married, women earn more than men. Venable also found that among people aged 27 to 33 who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 98% of men's and "women who hold positions and have skills and experience similar to those of men face wage disparities of less than 10 percent, and many are within a couple of points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba392 |title=The Wage Gap Myth |publisher=NCPA |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venable concluded that women and men with equal skills and opportunities in the same positions face little or no wage discrimination: "Claims of unequal pay almost always involve comparing apples and oranges".

There is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, however, when it comes to estimating its magnitude, significant discrepancies are visible. A meta-regression analysis concludes that "the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining" and that the wage rate calculation is proven to be crucial in estimating the wage gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. D. |last=Stanley |first2=Stephen B. |last2=Jarrell |title=Gender Wage Discrimination Bias? A Meta-Regression Analysis |journal=Journal of Human Resources |volume=33 |issue=4 |year=1998 |pages=947–973 |doi=10.2307/146404 |jstor=146404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis further notes that excluding experience and failing to correct for selection bias from analysis might also lead to incorrect conclusions.

=== Glass ceiling effect ===
{{Main|Glass ceiling}}
"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David A. |last=Cotter |first2=Joan M. |last2=Hermsen |first3=Seth |last3=Ovadia |first4=Reeve |last4=Vanneman |year=2001 |title=The Glass Ceiling Effect |journal=Social Forces |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=655–681 |doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, women account for 52% of the overall labor force, but only make up 3% of corporate CEOs and top executives.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David A. |last=Matsa |first2=Amalia R. |last2=Miller |year=2011 |title=Chipping away at the Glass Ceiling: Gender Spillovers in Corporate Leadership |journal=American Economic Review |series=Papers and Proceedings |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=635–639 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), as well as "the historic absence of women in top positions", which "may lead to hysteresis, preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors".&lt;ref name="David A 2011" /&gt; The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color (according to a report, "women of colour perceive a 'concrete ceiling' and not simply a glass ceiling").&lt;ref name="David A 2011" /&gt;

In the economics profession, it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, "the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John M. |last=McDowell |first2=Larry D., Jr. |last2=Singell |first3=James P. |last3=Ziliak |year=1999 |title=Cracks in the Glass Ceiling: Gender and Promotion in the Economics Profession |journal=American Economic Review |volume=89 |issue=2 |series=Papers and Proceedings |pages=392–396 |jstor=117142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, "extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steven C. |last=McKay |year=2006 |title=Hard Drives and Glass Ceilings: Gender Stratification in High-Tech Production |journal=Gender and Society |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=207–235 |doi=10.1177/0891243205285371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] asserts that "progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow".&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women still struggle to break through glass ceiling in government, business, academia|publisher=United Nations|date=2006-03-08|url=https://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2006/PressReleaseIWD8March.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential remedies ====
Research by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a possible remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could subsequently lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"/&gt; The same research suggests that this could also result in a "feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives".&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006" /&gt;

=== Weight-based sexism ===
A 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. [[Overweight]] women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses, making up between 5% and 22% of female CEOs. However, the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between 45% and 61%, over-representing overweight men. On the other hand, approximately 5% of CEOs were obese among both genders. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that "the '[[glass ceiling]] effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women, but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women".&lt;ref&gt;Roehling, Patricia V., Mark V.

In August 1995, Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] against Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter. Nixon, a [[trans woman]], had been interested in volunteering as a counselor with the shelter. When the shelter learned that she was [[transsexual]], they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization. Nixon argued that this constituted illegal [[discrimination]] under Section 41 of the [[British Columbia Human Rights Code]]. Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the [[socialization]] and experiences of their formative years, and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up, and that, therefore, Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counseling to the female born women that the shelter served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2007/02/03/Nixon/|title=Transsexual Loses Fight with Women's Shelter {{!}} The Tyee|last=Rupp|first=Shannon|date=2007-02-03|website=The Tyee|language=English|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification ==
[[File:Menu.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of [[sexual objectification]] of women on a wine menu.]]
In [[social philosophy]], [[objectification]] is the act of treating a person as an object or thing. Objectification plays a central role in feminist theory, especially [[sexual objectification]].&lt;ref name=Stanfordfeminism-objectification &gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/|title=Feminist Perspectives on Objectification|website=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist writer and gender equality activist Joy Goh-Mah argues that by being objectified, a person is denied agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goh-Mah|first=Joy|title=The Objectification of Women - It Goes Much Further Than Sexy Pictures|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/joy-goh-mah/objectification-women-sexy-pictures_b_3403251.html|publisher=Huffpost Lifestyle|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], a person might be objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Objectification|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|year=1995|volume=24|issue=4|pages=249–291|doi=10.1111/j.1088-4963.1995.tb00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Instrumentality''' – treating the object as a [[tool]] for another's purposes: "The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes."
# '''Denial of [[Autonomy]]''' – treating the object as lacking in autonomy or [[self-determination]]: "The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination."
# '''Inertness''' – treating the object as lacking in [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] or [[Action (philosophy)|activity]]: "The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity."
# '''[[Fungibility]]''' – treating the object as interchangeable with other objects: "The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types."
# '''Violability''' – treating the object as lacking in boundary integrity and violable: "The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into."
# '''[[Ownership]]''' – treating the object as if it can be owned, bought, or sold: "The objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc."
# '''Denial of [[Subjectivity]]''' – treating the object as if there is no need for concern for its experiences or feelings: "The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account."
[[Rae Helen Langton]], in ''Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification'', proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum's list:&lt;ref name="Stanfordfeminism-objectification" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langdon228–229"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rae Langton|authorlink1=Rae Helen Langton|title=Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification, 1st Edition|date=February 15, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199551453|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Reduction to Body''' – the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;
# '''Reduction to Appearance''' – the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;
# '''Silencing''' – the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.
According to objectification theory, objectification can have important repercussions on women, particularly young women, as it can negatively impact their psychological health and lead to the development of mental disorders, such as [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar depression]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="FredricksonRoberts1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=Objectification Theory |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In advertising ===
[[File:Two girls examining a bulletin board posted on a fence. An advertisement painted above them asks "Are You a Woman?".jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement aimed at women.]]

While advertising used to portray women and men in obviously stereotypical roles (e.g., as a housewife, breadwinner), in modern advertisements, they are no longer solely confined to their traditional roles. However, advertising today nonetheless still stereotypes men and women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zimmerman | first1=Amanda | last2=Dahlberg | first2=John | year=2008 | title=The sexual objectification of women in advertising: A contemporary cultural perspective | url=| journal=Journal of Advertising Research | volume=48 | issue=1| pages=71–79 | doi=10.2501/s0021849908080094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are most often targets of sexism in advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed|date=April 2018}} When in advertisements with men they are often shorter and put in the background of images, shown in more 'feminine' poses, and generally present a higher degree of 'body display'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zotos|first=Yorgos|last2=Tsichla|first2=Eirini|date=October 2014|title=Snapshots of Men and Women in Interaction:  An Investigation of Stereotypes in Print Advertisement Relationship Portrayals|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267842958|journal=Journal of Euromarketing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=35–58|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.9768/0023.03.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, some countries (for example [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]) have laws against [[Sex in advertising|sexual objectification in advertising]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7365722.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scandinavian split on sexist ads | date=25 April 2008 | accessdate= 6 April 2010 | first=Stephanie | last=Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nudity is not banned, and nude people can be used to advertise a product if they are relevant to the product advertised. Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum (an association of the country's top advertising agencies) explained, "You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car".&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Other countries continue to ban nudity (on traditional obscenity grounds), but also make explicit reference to sexual objectification, such as [[Israel]]'s ban of [[billboard]]s that "depicts sexual humiliation or abasement, or presents a
human being as an object available for sexual use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Israeli Penal Law 5737 - 1977: Obscene publication and display|publisher=OECD|pages=70–71|edition=6th |ref=Article 214 | format=PDF | url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/43289694.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2015}} (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography ===
{{See also|Feminist views on pornography}}
Anti-pornography feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin, argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools, and is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papadaki|first=Evangelia|title=Feminist Perspectives on Objectification|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/feminism-objectification/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating:

"We define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts—including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks—are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or (viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual."&lt;ref name="DworkinMacKinnon1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Dworkin|author2=Catharine A.

[[Robin Morgan]] and Catharine MacKinnon suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to [[violence against women]] by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated, coerced, humiliated or [[sexually assault]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). Random House. 333 p. {{ISBN|0-394-48227-1}}.

Some people opposed to pornography, including MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it.&lt;ref name="stanford-shrage"&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"].

"Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title=A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series=[[Think Tank (TV series)|Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate=2009-09-01| year=1995| url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of pornography charge that it presents a distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sexual myths; it shows women as continually available and willing to engage in sex at any time, with any person, on their terms, responding positively to any requests.

MacKinnon writes:
{{quote|Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says "I didn't consent" and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitizes people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon | date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Defenders of pornography and anti-censorship activists (including [[sex-positive feminists]]) argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual, since the viewer can distinguish between fantasy and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Bader |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/104863/the_great_porn_misunderstanding%3A_pornography_is_mostly_about_fantasy,_not_reality |title=The Great Porn Misunderstanding: Pornography Is Mostly About Fantasy, Not Reality |publisher=Alternet |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that men and women are objectified in pornography (particularly [[Sadomasochism|sadistic or masochistic]] pornography, in which men are objectified and sexually used by women).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123115712/http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prostitution ===
[[Prostitution]] is the business or practice of engaging in [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] in exchange for [[payment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prostitution|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prostitution|publisher=US Legal|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are often objectified and are seen as existing only to serve clients, thus calling their sense of agency into question. There is a prevailing notion that because they sell sex professionally, prostitutes automatically consent to all sexual contact.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://anj.sagepub.com/content/40/2/127.abstract | title=Rape, Prostitution and Consent | author=Sullivan, Barbara | journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology | year=2007 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=127–142 | quote=In common law jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, some of the evidentiary jurisprudence clearly linked chastity with veracity. So women who were or had been sex workers, those who were ‘rumoured’ to be prostitutes or who were simply promiscuous and behaving ‘like a prostitute’ lacked credibility as complainants, which made it difficult for the prosecution to prove the sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt. Women in any of these categories were seen at law as ‘commonly available’ to men, as always consenting to sexual activity and thus, as  not able to be raped. Men accused of sexual assault were therefore able to use evidence of prostitution to defend themselves, to undermine the credibility of rape complainants and to successfully avoid conviction. | doi=10.1375/acri.40.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, sex workers face higher [[violence against prostitutes|rates of violence]] and sexual assault. This is often dismissed, ignored and not taken seriously by authorities.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt;

In many countries, prostitution is dominated by brothels or pimps, who often claim ownership over sex workers. This sense of ownership furthers the concept that sex workers are void of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walnet.org/csis/papers/redefining.html |title=Redefining Prostitution as Sex Work on the International Agenda |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is literally the case in instances of [[sexual slavery]].

Various authors have argued that female prostitution is based on male sexism that condones the idea that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable, that men's desires must be satisfied, and that women are coerced into and exist to serve men sexually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/Prostitution.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903143328/http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/Prostitution.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2006-09-03 | title=Readings on Prostitution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/18/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation|title=Julie Bindel: Eradicate the oldest oppression - UK news - The Guardian|author=Julie Bindel|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/endingatradeinmisery|title=Ending a trade in misery|author=Julie Bindel|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mlFgjEBYWYC |title=The Industrial Vagina |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2015-03-31|isbn=9780203698303 |author1=Jeffreys |first1=Sheila |date=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Women's Lobby]] condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472|title=European Women's Lobby  :  Prostitution in Europe : 60 Years of Reluctance|website=womenslobby.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carole Pateman]] writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH2KPvZF1L0C |title=The Sexual Contract |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2015-03-31|isbn=9780804714778 |author1=Pateman |first1=Carole |year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Prostitution is the use of a woman's body by a man for his own satisfaction. There is no desire or satisfaction on the part of the prostitute. Prostitution is not mutual, pleasurable exchange of the use of bodies, but the unilateral use of a woman's body by a man in exchange for money."

=== Media portrayals ===
Some scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, E., &amp; Henderson Daniel, J. (Eds.). (2005). ''Featuring females: Feminist analyses of media.'' Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/11213-000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Halliwell | first1=E. | last2=Malson | first2=H. | last3=Tischner | first3=I. | year=2011 | title=Are contemporary media images which seem to display women as sexually empowering actually harmful to women? | url=| journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume=35 | issue=| pages=34–45 | doi=10.1177/0361684310385217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Entman |first=R. |last2=Rojecki |first2=A. |year=2000 |title=The Black image in the White mind: Media and race in America |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-21075-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} According to Susan Douglas: "Since the early 1990s, much of the media have come to overrepresent women as having made it-completely-in the professions, as having gained sexual equality with men, and having achieved a level of financial success and comfort enjoyed primarily by Tiffany's-encrusted doyennes of Laguna Beach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Susan J. |year=2010 |title=The Rise of Enlightened Sexism |location=New York, NY |publisher=St. Martins Press |isbn=978-0-312-67392-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These images may be harmful, particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of African American women often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Watson | first1=L.

In an attempt to study the effect of [[media consumption]] on males, Samantha and Bridges found an effect on body shame, though not through self-objectification as it was found in comparable studies of women. The authors conclude that the current measures of objectification were designed for women and do not measure men accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daniel | first1=Samantha | last2=Bridges | first2=Sara K. | year=2010 | title=The drive for muscularity in men: Media influences and objectification theory | url=| journal=Body Image | volume=7 | issue=1| pages=32–38 | doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.08.003| pmid=19815476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study also found a negative effect on eating attitudes and body satisfaction of consumption of beauty and fitness magazines for women and men respectively, but again with different mechanisms, namely self-objectification for women and internalization for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magazine exposure: Internalization, self-objectification, eating attitudes, and body satisfaction in male and female university students |last=Morry |first=Marian M. |last2=Staska |first2=Sandra L. |journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science/Revue Canadienne des Sciences du Comportement |volume=33 |issue=4 |year=2001 |pages=269–279 |doi=10.1037/h0087148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist jokes ===
[[Frederick T. Attenborough|Frederick Attenborough]] argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduce the butt of the joke to an object.

Gender discrimination is discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Gender identity is "the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth".&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Feder, Jody  |author2=Cynthia Brougher |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Employment: A Legal Analysis of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) |date=July 15, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40934.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S. |year=2004 |title=The Gendered Society |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514975-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas sexism is prejudice based on biological sex, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards gender identities, including [[third gender]], [[genderqueer]], and other non-binary identified people.&lt;ref name="Macklem"/&gt; It is especially attributed to how people are treated in the workplace,&lt;ref name="Lenhart"/&gt; and banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system.&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |title=Employment Non-Discrimination Act &amp;#124; Resources &amp;#124; Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Hrc.org |date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520071809/http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |archivedate=2014-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, "although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion".&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Hurst states that "[c]ourts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurst |first=C. |title=Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences |edition=Sixth |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |year=2007 |pages=131, 139–142 |isbn=978-0-205-48436-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oppositional sexism===
Oppositional sexism is a term coined by [[Transfeminism|transfeminist]] author [[Julia Serano]], who defined oppositional sexism as "the belief that male and female are rigid, mutually exclusive categories".&lt;ref name=":439"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last=Serano|first=Julia|publisher=Seal Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-786-74791-7|location=Emeryville, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of [[social norm]]s, such as [[cissexism]], [[heteronormativity]], and traditional sexism.

Oppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females. This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism, the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people.&lt;ref name=":889"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Counseling Across Cultures|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2015|isbn=9781452217529|location=United States of America|pages=|edition=7th|editor-first2=Walter|editor-last=Pedersen|editor-first=Paul|editor-last2=Lonner|editor-last3=Draguns|editor-first3=Juris|editor-last4=Trimble|editor-first4=Joseph|editor-last5=Scharrón-del Río|editor-first5=María}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of having two, totally opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what [[Gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Judith Butler]] calls a "compulsory practice of heterosexuality".&lt;ref name=":889" /&gt; Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.&lt;ref name=":889" /&gt;

The concept of opposite genders sets a "dangerous precedent", according to Serano, where "if men are big then women must be small; and if men are strong then women must be weak".&lt;ref name=":439" /&gt; The [[gender binary]] and oppositional norms work together to support "traditional sexism", the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity.&lt;ref name=":889" /&gt;

Serano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with "traditional sexism". This ensures that "those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine, and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine".&lt;ref name=":439" /&gt;

=== Transgender discrimination ===
{{See also|Transphobia|Healthcare and the LGBT community}}

Transgender discrimination is discrimination towards peoples whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the biological sex they were born with.&lt;ref&gt;10. "Transgender." UC Berkekely Online. Available (online): https://geneq.berkeley.edu/lgbt_resources_definiton_of_terms#transgender&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of discrimination include but are not limited to identity documents not reflecting one's gender, sex-segregated public restrooms and other facilities, dress codes according to binary gender codes, and lack of access to and existence of appropriate health care services.&lt;ref name="verdict.justia.com"&gt;8. "The EEOC Rules that Transgender Discrimination Is Sex Discrimination." Justia.com: Available (online): https://verdict.justia.com/2012/05/01/the-eeoc-rules-that-transgender-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination#sthash.OzR6wVcG.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent adjudication, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) concluded that discrimination against a transgender person is sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="verdict.justia.com"/&gt;

The 2008-09 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS)—a U.S. study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition that was, at its time, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination—showed that Black [[transgender people in the United States]] suffer "the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism" and that "black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate 9% and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Injustice at every turn: A look at Black respondents in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://nbjc.org/sites/default/files/trans-adjustment-web.pdf|website=National Black Justice Coalition|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, due to displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between 8% and 15% high rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that "gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Miller | first1=Lisa R. | last2=Grollman | first2=Eric Anthony | year=2015 | title=The Social Costs of Gender Nonconformity for Transgender Adults: Implications for Discrimination and Health | journal=Sociological Forum | volume=30 | issue=3| pages=809–831 | doi=10.1111/socf.12193| pmid=27708501 | pmc=5044929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino/a transgender people who were non-citizens were most vulnerable to harassment, abuse and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html |title=the Survey |publisher=End Trans Discrimination |date= |accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world. For instance, in 2010, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE)'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children if he does not leave visible marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |date=October 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143850/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=March 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Equality Now]] drew attention a section of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria, titled ''Correction of Child, Pupil, Servant or Wife'' which reads: "(1) Nothing is an offence which does not amount to the infliction of grievous hurt upon any persons which is done: (...) (d) by a husband for the purpose of correcting his wife, such husband and wife being subject to any native law or custom in which such correction is recognized as lawful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_penal_code_of_northern_nigeria |title=The Penal Code of Northern Nigeria |publisher=Equalitynow.org |date=2015-02-06 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123608/http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_penal_code_of_northern_nigeria |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honor killings]] are another form of domestic violence practiced in several parts of the world, and their victims are predominantly women.&lt;ref name=Maris2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maris|first=Cees|author2=Sawitri Saharso |title=Honour Killing: A Case for Cultural Defense?|journal=Pluralism and Law: Proceedings of the 20th IVR World Congress, Amsterdam, 2001|year=2001|volume=3|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honor killings can occur because of refusal to enter into an arranged marriage, maintaining a relationship relatives disapprove of, extramarital sex, becoming the victim of rape, dress seen as inappropriate, or homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3|title=BBC - Ethics - Honour crimes|website=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing | work=CNN | title=Shocking gay honor killing inspires movie - CNN.com | date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html | work=CNN | title=Iraqi immigrant convicted in Arizona 'honor killing' awaits sentence | date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] states that, "[h]onour crimes, including killing, are one of history's oldest forms of gender-based violence".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2010) Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women. Retrieved 18 April 2015 from http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women:

{{quote|The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Peru, Syria, Venezuela, and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;''Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour: Report of the Secretary-General''. 2 July 2002. United Nations General Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In Pakistan, after the 2008 [[Balochistan honour killings]] in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the [[Umrani|Umrani Tribe]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], Pakistani Federal Minister for Postal Services [[Israr Ullah Zehri]] defended the practice:&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4678530.ece |title=Three teenagers buried alive in 'honour killings' |accessdate=2008-09-05 |work=Times Online | location=London | first=Zahid | last=Hussain | date=2008-09-05}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.

[[Dowry deaths]] are the result of the killing women who are unable to pay the high [[dowry]] price for their marriage. According to Amnesty International, "the ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|website=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female infanticide]] is the killing of newborn female children, while female [[sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] is the terminating of a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus.

[[Sex-selective abortion]] involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the baby. The abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where the culture values male children over females,&lt;ref name="Goodkind" /&gt; such as parts of [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (China, India, Pakistan, Korea, Taiwan), the [[Caucasus]] (Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia), and [[Western Balkans]] (Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo).

Female genital mutilation is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons". WHO further state that, "the procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "[p]rocedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn death,"&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO - Female genital mutilation|website=Who.int|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women" and "constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women".&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; The [[European Parliament]] stated in a resolution that the practice "clearly goes against the European founding value of equality between women and men and maintains traditional values according to which women are seen as the objects and properties of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2014-0105 |title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 6 February 2014 - Elimination of female genital mutilation - P7_TA(2014)0105 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminalization of [[marital rape]] is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades; and in many countries it is still legal. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970; other European countries and some of the English-speaking countries outside Europe outlawed it later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VWttAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=The+Routledge+Handbook+of+European+Criminology#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Routledge%20Handbook%20of%20European%20Criminology&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology|website=Google.ro|accessdate=2015-03-31|isbn=9781136185496|last1=Body-Gendrot|first1=Sophie|last2=Hough|first2=Mike|last3=Kerezsi|first3=Klara|last4=Lévy|first4=René|last5=Snacken|first5=Sonja|date=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; some countries outlawed it in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6225872.stm|title=Thailand passes marital rape bill|date=21 June 2007|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO wrote that: "Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice—legal in many countries—is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent".&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt;

In countries where [[fornication]] or [[adultery]] are illegal, victims of rape can be charged criminally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21595814|title=BBC News - Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex|website=BBC News|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War rape ===
{{Main|War rape}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexism is manifested by the crime of rape targeting women civilians and soldiers, committed by soldiers, combatants or civilians during armed conflict, war or military occupation. This arises from the long tradition of women being seen as sexual booty and from the misogynistic culture of military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570|title=The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers|date=6 May 2009|website=NPR.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/|title=Why Soldiers Rape|website=Inthesetimes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence and rape are also committed against men during war and are often under-reported. Sexism plays a significant part in the difficulty that the survivors face coping with their victimization, especially in patriarchal cultures, and in the lack of support provided to men who have been raped.&lt;ref name=MaleRapeWar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|title=The rape of men|last1=Storr|first1=Will|date=16 July 2011|work=The Observer|accessdate=8 March 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Marrying girls under 18 years old is rooted in [[gender discrimination]], encouraging premature and continuous child bearing and giving preference to boys' education.

Such laws have been criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Equality Now]] as being discriminatory towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/zh-hans/node/109622/section/11 |title=Codifying Repression &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_islamic_penal_code_of_2013_books_i_ii_and_v |title=The Islamic Penal Code of 2013, Books I, II and V |publisher=Equalitynow.org |date=2015-02-06 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163041/http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_islamic_penal_code_of_2013_books_i_ii_and_v |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice system in many [[common law countries]] has also been accused of discriminating against women. [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]] is, in many common law countries, a partial defense to [[murder]], which converts what would have been murder into [[manslaughter]]. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the "heat of passion" upon being "provoked" by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, due to it being used disproportionately in cases of [[adultery]], and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners. As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/$File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623052433/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/%24File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate Fitz-Gibbon |url=http://anj.sagepub.com/content/45/2/194.abstract |title=Provocation in New South Wales: The need for abolition |publisher=Anj.sagepub.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional leniently towards [[crimes of passion]] in [[Latin America]]n countries has been deemed to have its origin in the view that women are property.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, stated that, "[S]o-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable."&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; The [[OHCHR]] has called for "the elimination of discriminatory provisions in the legislation, including mitigating factors for 'crimes of passion{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/OnePagers/Gender_motivated_killings.pdf | title=Gender-Related Killings of Women and Girls | publisher=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some studies have shown that for identical crimes, men are given harsher sentences than women. Controlling for arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge variables, sentences are over 60% heavier for men. Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html |title=Men Sentenced To Longer Prison Terms Than Women For Same Crimes, Study Says |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |first=Simon |last=McCormack |date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx|title=Study finds large gender disparities in federal criminal cases|publisher=Law.umich.edu|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case. For example, the gender gap is less pronounced in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms. This disparity occurs in US federal courts, despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"&gt;[http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630184354/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038|date=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty in may also suffer from gender bias. According to Shatz and Shatz, "[t]he present study confirms what earlier studies have shown: that the death penalty is imposed on women relatively infrequently and that it is disproportionately imposed for the killing of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-gender-bias-death-sentencing|title=STUDIES: Gender Bias in Death Sentencing|website=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States. One of the most common is expectation that women are predominantly care-givers.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/&gt; Other possible reasons include the "girlfriend theory" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends),&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as [[postpartum depression]] or [[battered wife syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|title=When She Was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away With Murder|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0140243888|pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these theories account for the total disparity,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Miscellaneous/15_Year_Study/chap4.pdf|title=Chapter Four: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities In Federal Sentencing Today|publisher=Ussc.gov|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barron|first1=Phillip|title=Gender Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty System|journal=Radical Philosophy Review|date=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=89–96|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BARGDI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated. They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex, rather than their [[gender identity]]. Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment. They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/real-life-sophia-bursets-transgender-women-face-a-nightmare-in-mens-prisons-186876/|title=Real life Sophia Bursets Transgender Women face a nightmare in Men's Prisons|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries use [[stoning]] as a form of capital punishment. According to [[Amnesty International]], the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|title=Amnesty International - Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|date=15 January 2008|website=amnesty.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that "on average, women receive lighter sentences in comparison with men... roughly 30% of the gender differences in incarceration cannot be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender. We also find evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male offenders. There is little evidence, however, that tastes for gender discrimination are driving the mean gender disparity or the variance in treatment between judges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butcher |first=Kristin F. |last2=Park |first2=Kyung H. |first3=Anne |last3=Morrison Piehl|title=Comparing Apples to Oranges: Differences in Women's and Men's Incarceration and Sentencing Outcomes |journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]] |volume=35 |issue=S1 |year=2017 |pages=S201–S234 |doi=10.1086/691276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study by Knepper found that "female plaintiffs filing workplace sex discrimination claims are substantially more likely to settle and win compensation whenever a female judge is assigned to the case. Additionally, female judges are 15 percentage points less likely than male judges to grant motions filed by defendants, which suggests that final negotiations are shaped by the emergence of the bias."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knepper |first=Matthew |date=2017 |title=When the Shadow is the Substance: Judge Gender and the Outcomes of Workplace Sex Discrimination Cases |journal=Journal of Labor Economics |volume=Forthcoming |issue=3 |pages=623-664 |doi=10.1086/696150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World [[literacy#Gender disparities|literacy]] is lower for females than for males.

Educational opportunities and outcomes for women have greatly improved in the West. Since 1991, the proportion of women enrolled in college in the United States has exceeded the enrollment rate for men, and the gap has widened over time.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005028.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2007}}, women made up the majority—54%—of the 10.8&amp;nbsp;million college students enrolled in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2007/CrossoverinFemaleMaleCollegeEnrollmentRates.aspx |title=The Crossover in Female-Male College Enrollment Rates |publisher=Prb.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527135418/http://www.prb.org/Articles/2007/CrossoverinFemaleMaleCollegeEnrollmentRates.aspx |archive-date=May 27, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research by Diane Halpern has indicated that boys receive more attention, praise, blame and punishment in the grammar-school classroom,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Diane F. ''Sex differences in cognitive abilities.'' Laurence Erlbaum Associates, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8058-2792-7}}.

Writer Gerry Garibaldi has argued that the educational system has become "feminized", allowing girls more of a chance at success with a more "girl-friendly" environment in the classroom;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gerry |last=Garibaldi |url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-schools-shortchange-boys-12949.html |title=How the Schools Shortchange Boys |publisher=City-journal.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is seen to hinder boys by punishing "masculine" behavior and diagnosing boys with [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioral disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Carolyn |last=Abraham |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/failing-boys/part-3-are-we-medicating-a-disorder-or-treating-boyhood-as-a-disease/article1762859/ |title=Part 3: Are we medicating a disorder or treating boyhood as a disease? |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |location=Toronto |date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study by the OECD in over 60 countries found that teachers give boys lower grades for the same work.

Feminists argue that clothing and footwear fashion has been oppressive to women, restricting their movements, increasing their vulnerability, and endangering their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Sheila|title=Beauty and Misogyny:Harmful cultural practices in the west|url=http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Jeffreys_Beauty_and_Misogyny_Harmful_Cultural_Practices_in_the_West__Women_and_Psychology_1.pdf|accessdate=March 8, 2013|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library|location=East Sussex|isbn=978-0-203-69856-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of thin models within the fashion industry has encouraged the development of [[bulimia]] and [[anorexia nervosa]], as well as locking female consumers into false feminine identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hollows|first=Joanne|title=Feminism, Femininity and Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sXWjnG5LWO0C&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Oppressive%20fashions%20feminism&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Oppressive%20fashions%20feminism&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 11, 2013|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|isbn=978-0-7190-4394-9|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assignment of gender-specific baby clothes can instill in children a belief in negative gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/julie-bindel-boys-arent-born-wanting-to-wear-blue-6293688.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julie | last=Bindel | title=Julie Bindel: Boys aren't born wanting to wear blue | date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the assignment in some countries of the color pink to girls and blue to boys. The fashion is a recent one; at the beginning of the 20th century the trend was the opposite: blue for girls and pink for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/ | title=When Did Girls Start Wearing Pink? | publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] | date=7 April 2011 | accessdate=16 March 2015 | author=Maglaty, Jeanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, ''The Women's Journal'' wrote that "pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl". ''DressMaker'' magazine also explained that "[t]he preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7817496.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should we not dress girls in pink? | date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in many countries, it is considered inappropriate for boys to wear dresses and skirts, but this is also a relatively recent view. From the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Scheussler suggests a date of post-1540 for England, France, and the Low Countries; see Scheussler, {{"'}}She Hath Over Grown All that She Ever Hath': Children's Clothing in the Lisle Letters, 1533–40", in Netherton, Robin, and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'', Volume 3, p. 185. Before roughly this date various styles of long robes were in any case commonly worn by adult males of various sorts, so boys wearing them could probably not be said to form a distinct phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the [[Western world]] were [[Breeches|unbreeched]] and wore [[gown]]s or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, Linda: ''What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws that dictate how women must dress are seen by many international human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], as a form of gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="doc.es.amnesty.org"&gt;[https://doc.es.amnesty.org/cgi-bin/ai/BRSCGI/WOMENS%20RIGHT%20TO%20CHOOSE%20THEIR%20DRESS%20FREE%20OF%20COERCION?CMD=VEROBJ&amp;MLKOB=29309215959 Women’s right to choose their dress, free of coercion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927134431/https://doc.es.amnesty.org/cgi-bin/ai/BRSCGI/WOMENS%20RIGHT%20TO%20CHOOSE%20THEIR%20DRESS%20FREE%20OF%20COERCION?CMD=VEROBJ&amp;MLKOB=29309215959 |date=2013-09-27 }}, Amnesty International, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, women are faced with violence for failing to adhere to certain dress codes, whether by the authorities (such as the [[religious police]]), family members, or the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6900111.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iran to intensify dress crackdown | date=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1874471.stm | work=BBC News | title=Saudi police 'stopped' fire rescue | date=March 15, 2002|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International states:

The production process also faces criticism for sexist practices. In the garment industry, approximately 80 percent of workers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleanclothes.org/issues/gender|title=Gender: Women workers mistreated — Clean Clothes Campaign|last=Davelaar|first=Geertjan|website=cleanclothes.org|language=en|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much garment production is located in Asia because of the low labor cost.

In his book ''The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys'' (2012), philosopher [[David Benatar]] states that "[t]he prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary, it is only men who should be conscripted and, similarly, that only males should be forced into combat".

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}

The '''South African National Front''', also known as the '''National Front of South Africa''' (SANF) was a neo-fascist organisation in South Africa formed in 1977. It was an initiative of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] of the [[British National Front]]; sister organisations were also formed in Australia and New Zealand at the same time.

SANF's first Chairman was Jack Noble, with the party being organised during the 1970s by [[Ray Hill]]. SANF channelled funds to the NF as part of an international network of [[neo-fascism]]. It moved beyond a mere gathering of [[expatriate]]s when it linked up with Italian and Portuguese neo-fascists and the South African [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ray and Bell, Andrew ''The Other Face of Terror'' Grafton (1988) p56, pp67-68&lt;/ref&gt; It also tried to link with the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging|Afrikaner Resistance Movement]] (AWB) and the [[Herstigte Nasionale Party]] (HNP) (from whom it received funding) with the ultimate aim of a single united [[racist]]/neo-fascist party in South Africa but this 'embryonic’ &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~springbk/speech4.html Term used by former member]&lt;/ref&gt; party never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ray and Bell, Andrew ''The Other Face of Terror'' Grafton (1988) p56, pp70&lt;/ref&gt;

SANF published its own magazine ''Hitback''. It also "published a number of anti-black and ‘[[Zionist Occupation Government|anti-Zionist]]’ pamphlets which led to calls for it to be prosecuted for incitement to [[racial hatred]]", SANF’s policies would have led to a "massive increase in the death rate of black infants".&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Alexander ''Jew-Haters, Black-Haters, violent Criminals, hypocrites and liars condemned out of their own mouths'' 2nd edition  Anglo-Hebrew Publishing p9 {{ISBN|1-898318-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979 SANF's [[anti-semitism]] led Jewish youths to threaten to take matters into their own hands; [[Harry Schwarz]] and Alf Widman of the [[Progressive Federal Party]] called on the government to do something about the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchlightarchive.com/s_a_hill_jewish_youth.pdf Article from (Johannesburg) Sunday Express 4 February 1979] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007153101/http://www.searchlightarchive.com/s_a_hill_jewish_youth.pdf |date=7 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the HNP replaced Noble as leader with Alan Fotheringham, a former HNP candidate,&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ray and Bell, Andrew ''The Other Face of Terror'' Grafton (1988) p70&lt;/ref&gt; and Ray Hill returned to England.

SANF formed its own paramilitary wing Wit Kommando/White Commando, a not unusual development in the context of [[right wing]] South African politics.&lt;ref&gt;It is listed as among the most "notorious" of paramilitary organisations in Johann van Rooyen ''Hard Right: The New White Power in South Africa'' IB Tauris (1994) p91-92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the Wit Kommando/White Commando began a campaign of [[terrorism]] mainly against blacks. A number of bombings took place, notably against the offices of the [[South African Institute of Race Relations]] and the [[University of South Africa]]. In 1981 they planned to also attack whites whom they regarded as "white kaffirs" or [[Miscegenation|race mixers]]. The South African police made arrests and discovered a hitlist of targets which included Bishop [[Desmond Tutu]],&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ray and Bell, Andrew ''The Other Face of Terror'' Grafton (1988)p72&lt;/ref&gt; the White Commando having previously "threatened him repeatedly".&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John ''Rabble-Rouser for Peace: The Authorised Biography of Desmond Tutu'' Rider 2006 p207&lt;/ref&gt; Fotheringham was not charged but Max (Massimo) Bollo from SANF's national directorate, and leader of the Italian associated grouping UNIDO, received a lengthy jail sentence, as did two other fellow Italians.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconcilliation Commission of South Africa]]'' Report Volume 2 p654&lt;/ref&gt; SANF disbanded in the early 1980s.

'''''The Adventures of Nero''''' or '''''Nero''''' was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[comic strip]] drawn by [[Marc Sleen]] and the name of [[Nero (comic book character)|its main character]]. The original title ranged from ''De Avonturen van [[Detective Van Zwam|Detectief Van Zwam]]'' in 1947 to ''De Avonturen van Nero en zijn Hoed'' in 1950, and finally ''De Avonturen van Nero &amp; Co'' from 1951.&lt;ref name=lambiek-sleen&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Marc Sleen|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran in continuous syndication until 2002. From 1947 until 1993 it was all drawn by Sleen himself. From 1992 until 2002 [[Dirk Stallaert]] took over the drawing while Sleen kept inventing the stories.

Together with ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' and ''[[Jommeke]]'', "Nero" is regarded as the Big Three of [[Flanders|Flemish]] comics. The stories were noted for their [[satire|satirical]] content, with references to politicians and celebrities of the day. With ''Nero'', Marc Sleen holds the [[world record]] of issues of a comic book series title drawn by the same author. He drew "The Adventures of Nero" singlehandedly from 1947 to 1992 without any assistance from other artists. This feat is even more remarkable considering he also drew other comic strip series from 1947 to 1965.

==History==

The series debuted in the newspaper ''De Nieuwe Gids'' in the autumn of 1947 and was written and drawn by [[Marc Sleen]] from the start. Originally the central character was [[Detective Van Zwam]], but halfway through the first story "Het Geheim van Matsuoka" ("The Secret of Matsuoka") (1947), Van Zwam meets a man who has drunk from a serum that makes people go insane and thinks he is the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The character was also dressed in a [[toga]] with some [[laurel wreath|laurel]] leaves behind his ears. Near the end of the story the character regained his senses and revealed his real name was "Schoonpaard" (in reprints this was changed to "Heiremans", in both cases [[inside joke]] references to colleagues of Sleen).&lt;ref&gt;Sleen, Marc, "Het Geheim van Matsuoka", Uitgeverij Het Volk, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; The character proved popular and remained a friend of Van Zwam in the next stories, though everyone kept referring to him as "Nero" rather than by his real name. After nine stories, the series was renamed after "Nero" and Van Zwam became a side character instead.&lt;ref name="AUWERA, Fernand 1985"&gt;AUWERA, Fernand, en SMET, Jan, Marc Sleen, Uitgeverij Edicon/Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Sleen left "De Nieuwe Gids" and joined the newspaper "[[Het Volk (newspaper)|Het Volk]]". During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960 "The Adventures of Nero" was popular enough to rival [[Willy Vandersteen]]'s ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' which was published in ''[[De Standaard]]''. In 1965 Sleen joined ''De Standaard'' too, following a legal dispute with his publishers. The first 53 "Nero" stories, which were published in black-and-white, remained property of Uitgeverij Het Volk. From "Het Bobobeeldje" ("The Bobo Statue") (1965) on all new "Nero" stories were published in ''[[De Standaard]]'' and ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'', after which they were released as colour albums.&lt;ref name=lambiek-sleen/&gt;

Sleen continued drawing "Nero" for many decades. Only in 1992 did he finally hire an assistant, [[Dirk Stallaert]], to do the drawing for him, because his eyesight had become too poor. Stallaert was promoted as Sleen's successor but in 2002 he decided to leave the series in favour of [[Studio Vandersteen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/stallaert_dirk.htm?lan=dutch&lt;/ref&gt; Sleen then terminated the series for good. Stallaert still draws "Nero"-related publicity images and merchandise.

The early stories had a random length, often around 240 strips, while the latter ones (from 1965 on) had a length of 32 pages of 4 strips each. Every day, two strips appeared in the newspaper.

==Concept==

"The Adventures of Nero" is a humorous adventure comic strip about Nero, an unemployed man who describes himself as "newspaper appearance" and prefers reading his newspaper on his sofa. He and his wife, named "Madam Nero" ("Madam Nero") by everyone, have one son, [[Adhemar (comic book character)|Adhemar]], who is a [[child prodigy]]. Nero has an eccentric group of friends, who often help him out or force him to set out on an adventure. Many stories display a love for nature and the animal world, which mirrors the creator's own frequent [[safari]] trips. Since the album "Het Groene Vuur" ("The Green Fire") (1965) nearly all "Nero" albums end with a traditional [[waffle]] feast, where Madam Nero and [[Madam Pheip]] bake waffles for the entire cast.&lt;ref name="AUWERA, Fernand 1985"/&gt;

With two strips published a day, six days a week, the comic strip followed daily news events quite closely and often made references to real life news events. In the story "De IJzeren Kolonel" ("The Iron Colonel") (1956), for instance, the then-current [[Suez Crisis]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] are incorporated into the plot. The series also had [[cameo appearance|cameos]] by several Belgian and internationally famous politicians, such as [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Achiel Van Acker]], [[Paul Vanden Boeynants]], [[Wilfried Martens]], [[Jean-Pierre Van Rossem]], [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], [[Jozef Stalin]], [[Mobutu]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], [[Hirohito]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Khomeini]] , [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]. Media celebrities, such as [[The Beatles]], [[Pablo Escobar]], [[Urbanus]], [[Paul Newman]] and [[Frank Zappa]] were also frequently caricatured. Sleen also gave himself cameos in several stories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Toppers/Nero/Biografie.html&lt;/ref&gt; Very exceptional was the fact that all these jokes about past politics were not removed when the newspaper episodes were published in album format. This is the major reason why "Nero" provides readers with an overview of almost 60 years of post-war history in Belgium.

Since Sleen worked without assistance for the majority of his career, he kept his drawing style simple and efficient. He had no time for elaborate detailed drawings and as a result many of his stories are filled to the brim with [[continuity error]]s or [[off-model]] drawing mistakes. Contrary to other comics, many readers accept this as part of "Nero"'s charm.&lt;ref name="AUWERA, Fernand 1985"/&gt; Only when [[Dirk Stallaert]] took over the drawings did the art work become more technically detailed, with more attention towards space and perspective.

==Main characters==
During its 55-year course, a lot of regular characters joined the original duo of Nero and Van Zwam.

* '''[[Nero (comic book character)|Nero]]''' is the main protagonist. Essentially good-hearted, he can also be a selfish, lazy man, who does not know how to keep his money and always gets himself into trouble. Nero is one of the very few anti-hero's to lead a comic strip.
* His wife (often called '''Madam Nero''', or in some stories Bea) stays mainly at home and tries to keep a semblance of a household while her husband is off to some far-flung corner of the earth. If needs be, she knows how to defend herself.
* '''[[Detective Van Zwam]]''' is a private detective. Driving a Porsche 911 (which seems to crash at least once every comic), he is always at the place of the crime extremely quickly, and can make the most brilliant deductions out of the smallest clues (often a cigarette stub).
* '''[[Adhemar (comic book character)|Adhemar]]''' is Nero's son. He is a [[child prodigy]]. He is only a few years old, but has received numerous Nobel prizes and Ph.D.'s. His major hobby is the building of rockets, called Adhemar I, II, ... These as well tend to crash somewhere in every story, but are a major means to get to the exotic countries where the stories often take place.
* '''[[Meneer Pheip]]''' is the [[bourgeois]] friend of Nero. In initial albums it appears he can only speak a broken, French-sounding kind of Flemish due to his French-speaking background. Later, he is portrayed as an old-fashioned Flemish nouveau riche, who thinks it is fitting that he speaks some poor kind of French instead of Dutch (a reference to the language battle between the Flemish and the French-speaking communities).
* '''[[Madam Pheip]]''' is his wife. She is a pipe-smoking bully, loyal to her kids, herself, her husband, and  her friends (in that order). When necessary, she can make a smoke curtain with her pipe.
* '''Petatje''' is the adopted daughter of the Pheips. Her father and mother died when she was very young. Initially, she was adopted by Nero, but soon got to live with the Pheips. Her name "Petatje" is a reference to the Flemish word for potato being "patat" (in dialect pronounced as "petat"). 
* '''Petoetje''' is their adoptive son. He is actually the son of a Papua king, and is extremely bright. Petoetje and Petatje get treated like children (which they are, around 10 years old) by their stepparents, even though they act more mature most of the time.
* '''Clo-Clo''' is the younger son of the Pheips. His main characteristic is wearing a large moustache as a toddler. He weeps for the smallest reason.
* '''[[Abraham Tuizentfloot]]''' is "the last pirate still alive", or in any case, so he believes. Armed with a dagger or sometimes a cannon, he is very easily irritated and chases everyone around. He can pop up in a story at any given time and it can never be predicted what he might do next. His name is a conundrum of "duizendpoot" (jack of all trades), combined with "vloot" (fleet). 
* '''Captain Oliepul''' is the captain of the [[tugboat]] named 'His Majesty's Pull'. He is a good friend of Nero, and has saved him many times. He's Marc Sleen's "deus ex machina": whenever characters seem to be drowning, at the very last moment captain Oliepul coincidentally passes by and saves them just in time.
* '''Jan Spier''' is an extremely strong guy, who is said to be the last descendant of [[Jan Breydel]]. His last name means "muscle" in Dutch. He makes a living selling French fries or chips. He disappeared for many years in the middle part of the series, but readers convinced Sleen to let Jan Spier reappear. During the run of the series, he was married to at least two different women, Minoetje and Isabella. No divorce or other explanation was ever given.
* '''Officer Gaston''' was the last character to become a regular in the comic, and he appeared very late, in 1995, twenty years after the birth of Clo-Clo (at that point the last regular to be added to the cast). Gaston is fat, not too bright, and at times incredibly incompetent. However, somehow he manages to save Nero a few times.
* Nero's worst enemies are the Maltese (see: "De Spekschieter") bandit '''[[Ricardo (comic book character)|Ricardo]]''' and a devil, called '''Geraard de Duivel''' ("Gerard the Devil", named after the medieval building, [[Geeraard de Duivelsteen]], in [[Ghent]]).

==Popularity and influence==

During its heyday "Nero" was the most popular Flemish comic strip, second only to ''[[Suske en Wiske]]''. The albums sold well, also because they were a lot cheaper than their main rival. From the late 1940s until the early 1960s all the stories were published on cheap paper and often smelt of fresh ink. During the 1960s [[Jef Nys]]' ''[[Jommeke]]'' overshadowed "Nero"'s sales among children.&lt;ref name="Marc Sleen 1993"&gt;Marc Sleen: een uitgave van de Bronzen Adhemar Stichting, v.z.w., Turnhout, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have been made to translate "Nero" to the Dutch, British, French, German and South African market. Except for in [[Wallonia]] and the [[Netherlands]], the translated versions of Nero never caught on.&lt;ref name="AUWERA, Fernand 1985"/&gt; Sleen has very rarely used his characters for [[merchandising]] or other commercializations.

"Nero" was very influential for the development of comics in Flanders. Its loose drawing style and story lines replete with [[folly]] were an inspiration for ''[[Urbanus (comics)|Urbanus]]'', ''[[Biebel]]'', ''[[Cowboy Henk]]'', among others. Dutch artists like [[Martin Lodewijk]] (''[[Agent 327]]'') and René Windig and Eric De Jong ("Heinz") are also notable fans.&lt;ref name="Marc Sleen 1993"/&gt;

==In popular culture==

The Flemish comics prize [[Bronzen Adhemar]] is named and sculpted after the character [[Adhemar (comic book character)|Adhemar]]. In [[Turnhout]], where the award ceremony is traditionally held, a huge statue of Adhemar can be seen in the Warande park since June 15, 1991. It was created by Frank-Ivo Van Damme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standbeelden.be/standbeeld/1764&lt;/ref&gt;

Several characters from the series also have their own statues. [[Nero (comic book character)|Nero]] has a bronze statue in [[Hoeilaart]], sculpted by Luc Cauwenberghs, which was erected in 1994 in front of the old tram station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoeilaart.be/nero&lt;/ref&gt; In the series this building is Nero's house since the story "De Verschrikkelijke Tweeling" ("The Horrible Twin") (1992). The station has been redecorated as a "Nero"-themed [[café]]. Nero has another statue in front of the casino in [[Middelkerke]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.focus-wtv.be/nieuws/standbeeld-van-nero-terug-op-de-zeedijk&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meneer Pheip]] has a statue in the Statiestraat in [[Moerbeke-Waas]], the village of which he supposedly is the major. It was sculpted by Guy Du Cheyne on August 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moerbeke.be/website/3269-www.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dorpsstraat in [[Wuustwezel]] sculptor Gilbert Uitdenhouwen made a statue of [[Abraham Tuizentfloot]], which was revealed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/oid82135/archief-stripfiguur-tuizentfloot-uit-nero-krijgt-standbeeld-in-wuustwezel|title=Stripfiguur Tuizentfloot uit Nero krijgt standbeeld in Wuust... - Gazet van Antwerpen|author=Kathleen Brughmans|work=Gazet van Antwerpen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation "Nero-Harmonie" in Hoeilaart and a [[mountain bike]] route have been named after "Nero".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gva.be/cnt/oid308869/archief-nero-standbeeld-in-hoeilaart-nu-in-het-brons&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 composer [[Johan De Smet]], conductor [[Vincent D'Hondt]] and director [[Arne Sierens]] chose upon the "Nero" story "[[Het Rattenkasteel]]" ("The Rats' Castle") (1947) for an [[opera]] adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matrix-new-music.be/componist/de-smet-johan-1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belgiumishappening.net/home/interviews/arne-sierens&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered as ''[[Het Rattenkasteel (opera)|Het Rattenkasteel]]''. 

The entire cast of the series was sculpted on a [[bas-relief]] in [[Sint-Niklaas]], made by sculptor Paul Dekker in 1988 to commemorate [[Marc Sleen]]'s appointment as an honorary citizen of the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standbeelden.be/standbeeld/1440&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] in [[Brussels]] the permanent exhibition pays homage to the pioneers of [[Belgian comics]], among them Marc Sleen. In the room dedicated to his work everything is designed to look like Nero's cosy home, complete with a tower of [[Belgian waffle]]s and [[champagne]] nearby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero is among the many Belgian comics characters to have, facetiously, a Brussels street named after them. The Rue de la Fourche/ Greepstraat has a [[commemorative plaque]] with the name ''Rue Néron/ Nerostraat'' placed under the actual street sign. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebru.be/Other/Strips/bruxelles-1000-noms-de-rue-bd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a wall was dedicated to "Nero" at the Sint-Goriksplein/Place Saint-Géry in [[Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brussel.be/dwnld/68642088/P1010935.JPG{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is part of the [[Brussels' Comic Book Route]]. Between 1996 and 2011 [[Hasselt]] also had a wall. In 2014 a wall was dedicated to "Nero" in the Kloosterstraat in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], depicting a scene from the album "De Oliespuiter" ("The Oil Injector").&lt;ref name="hln.be"&gt;http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-antwerpen/nero-prijkt-op-stripmuur-a1937681/&lt;/ref&gt; depicting Nero, Petoetje and Petatje.&lt;ref name="hln.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stripmuren.be/stripmuren-comic-murals-antwerp/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marc Sleen Museum]] in the Zandstraat in Brussels is dedicated to Sleen and his creations.

'''''The Western Australian Flora – A Descriptive Catalogue''''' was published by the [[Wildflower Society of Western Australia]], the [[Western Australian Herbarium]], 
[[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|CALM]], and the [[Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority]] of [[Perth, Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Paczkowska, Grazyna | author2=Chapman, Alex R | author3=Western Australian Herbarium | author4=Wildflower Society of Western Australia | author5=Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority (W.A.) | author6=Western Australian Herbarium | title=The Western Australian flora : a descriptive catalogue | publication-date=2000 | publisher=Wildflower Society of Western Australia : Western Australian Herbarium : CALM : Western Australian Botanic Gardens &amp; Parks Authority | isbn=978-0-646-40243-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
At the time of publication in 2000 the number of published vascular plant species recognised had reached 9640 - almost double since the work of [[John Stanley Beard|Beard]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;https://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/statistics/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the book was an important stage of the cataloguing of details of flora in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/80568/20080118-0945/florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/publications/descat/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
        
The introduction of the book by Alex R. Chapman is available as a PDF file, at the external link at FloraBase.&lt;ref&gt;http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/80568/20080118-0945/florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/publications/descat/fullintro.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floristic regions==
The front inside cover has an important distinctive map of ''Western Australian Biogeographic Regions and Botanical Provinces'', after Creswell and Thackray 1995 - the authors of the [[IBRA]] system.

After Beard's summary of Diels, Burbidge and Gardner in 1980 he established the three phytogeographic provinces - Northern, Eremaean, and [[Southwest Australia|South West]], and the map links in the relationship of these with the IBRA regions and sub regions.

{{Dutch Grammar}}

'''''Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal''''' ({{lang-nl|Dictionary of the Dutch language}}, commonly abbreviated ''WNT'') is a [[dictionary]] of the [[Dutch language]]. It contains between 350,000 to 400,000 entries for Dutch words from 1500 to 1921. The paper edition consists of 43 volumes (including three supplements), almost 50,000 pages. The dictionary was almost 150 years in the making; the first volume was published in 1864, and the final volume was presented to [[Albert II of Belgium]] and [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] in 1998.

==Background==
[[File:Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal.jpg|thumb|3 metres WNT]]
The ''WNT'' follows the formula of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]''&lt;ref name="willemyns"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willemyns|first=Roland|title=Dutch: Biography of a Language|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199858712|pages=124–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in being a [[Historical linguistics|historical dictionary]] whose entries are based on primary sources of actual usage.

Its impetus was the inaugural 1849 ''Nederlandsch Congres'' ("Dutch Congress"), a conference of linguists from the Netherlands and Belgium. The conference, which was held alternately south and north of the border, ran from 1849 to 1912; its goal was to (re-)establish contacts between Netherlanders and Belgians (after Belgium split off from the Netherlands in 1830) and to lend strength to the Flemish movement in Belgium (which was up against the widespread influence of French). At that first conference, in August 1849 at [[Ghent University]], it was proposed that a dictionary be written "for our common tongue". Dutch linguist [[Matthias de Vries]] (1820–1892) was given the task of writing it.&lt;ref name="willemyns"/&gt;

Financial support for the project came from the Dutch and Belgian governments. Also part of the project was spelling reform; De Vries's coauthor [[Lammert Allard te Winkel]] (1809–1868) designed the new orthography, though the system is named for both. Another project related to the ''WNT'' was the development of a dictionary of [[Middle Dutch]], the ''[[Middelnederlandsch Woordenboek]]'' (1885–1927), by two students of De Vries, [[Jacob Verdam]] and [[Eelco Verwijs]].&lt;ref name="willemyns"/&gt;

De Vries published the first [[Fascicle (book)|fascicle]] (''A-Aanhaling'') in 1864; the first volume (''A-Ajuin'') in 1882. The last (''Zuid''-''Zythum'') was published in 1998; afterward, three supplements to the original dictionary text containing modern-day Dutch words were published, in 2001. It is published by the ''Instituut voor Nederlandse Lexicologie'' ("Institute for Dutch Lexicology"), which works under the supervision of the [[Dutch Language Union]], and is available for free online.

==Importance==
Besides its sheer size and its historical value, the ''WNT'' is credited with supporting the "integrationist" movement in Flanders, that is, those who sought a rapprochement between the speakers of Dutch in the Netherlands and Belgium. The De Vries-Te Winkel orthography was made mandatory by the Belgian government in 1864, and shortly thereafter by the Dutch government. It still underlies the rules for orthography and has thus contributed to orthographic unity between the two countries.&lt;ref name="willemyns"/&gt;

'''''The World Book Dictionary''''' is a two-volume English dictionary published as a supplement to the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''. It was originally published in 1963 under the editorship of [[Clarence Barnhart]], who wrote definitions for the [[Thorndike-Barnhart]] graded dictionary series for children, based on the educational works of [[Edward Thorndike]] whom Clarence Barnhart had known and worked with decades before. In some editions it was called the ''World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary''. The writing and editing of special articles was carried out by the staff of the World Book Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia staff also reviewed the work for consistency with the encyclopedia and appropriateness of its users. 

Like the encyclopedia, it is designed to be user friendly to young people, yet comprehensive enough to be useful to adults. The definitions are designed with consideration for the age at which a person usually encounters the word. Quotations or sample sentences are offered with many words. Most proper names are excluded, leaving their treatment to the encyclopedia.

The word list is based on a formula for calculating frequency of use. Originally covering about 180,000 words, it has expanded to over 225,000 words with over 3,000 illustrations, making it considerably larger than most dictionaries, though not of "unabridged" scope. Its vocabulary has largely been drawn from the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'', the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', and Barnhart's own extensive quotation file begun in the 1940s.

From 1963 the ''World Book Dictionary'' was updated annually and received a major revision in 1976. With the decline of traditional lexicography and the death of Clarence Barnhart in 1993, the work appears to have fallen almost into obscurity having been overshadowed by the ''World Book Encyclopedia'', which also includes the dictionaries as part of the set. As a standalone work, the ''World Book Dictionary'' has faded from use and public recognition. The ''World Book Dictionary'' was last edited and updated by Robert and Cynthia Barnhart in 1996. Robert Barnhart died in 2007, and Cynthia Barnhart went on to produce the ''Facts on File Student’s Dictionary of American English'' (2008). David Barnhart continues to edit the ''Barnhart Dictionary Companion'' and the ''Barnhart New-Words Concordance''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rulon.com/Catpages/barnhart.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zayed National Museum''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: متحف زايد الوطني) is a planned museum, to be located in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[UAE]]. It is designed as a memorial to the late [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], the founding president of the UAE.&lt;ref name=architect /&gt; The museum is planned to be the centrepiece of the [[Saadiyat Island#Saadiyat Cultural District|Saadiyat Island Cultural District]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-21199-tdic-floats-zayed-national-museum-tender/|title=TDIC floats Zayed National Museum tender {{!}} ConstructionWeekOnline.com|last=Zendera|first=Yamurai|website=www.constructionweekonline.com|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will showcase the history, culture, and economic transformation of the Emirates.&lt;ref name=earchitect&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-architect.co.uk/dubai/zayed-national-museum|title=Zayed National Museum, Abu Dhabi Building - e-architect|date=2010-11-25|work=e-architect|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has been designed by [[Foster + Partners]] with five solar thermal towers that will act as chimneys to draw cool air through the building.&lt;ref name=architect&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/zayed-national-museum/|title=Zayed National Museum {{!}} Foster + Partners|last=www.fosterandpartners.com|first=Foster + Partners /|website=www.fosterandpartners.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towers are shaped like falcon wings to commemorate Zayed's love of [[falconry]].&lt;ref name=earchitect /&gt; 

In 2009, the Zayed Museum signed a ten-year contract with the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/10585/british-museum-help-launch-zayed-national-museum-abu-dhabi|title=British Museum to help launch Zayed National Museum in Abu Dhabi|date=July 25, 2009|publisher=eTurboNews|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The British Museum would assist with curation and loan about 500 of its treasures to the Zayed Museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The museum was projected for completion in 2016, however, as of November 2017, construction has not yet begun.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/design/british-museum-abu-dhabi-zayed-national-museum.html|title=Construction Delays Sink British Museum’s Deal With Abu Dhabi|date=October 30, 2017|publisher=NYT|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the British Museum thinks that it is unlikely that any items will be loaned under the current contract, which ends in 2019.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
