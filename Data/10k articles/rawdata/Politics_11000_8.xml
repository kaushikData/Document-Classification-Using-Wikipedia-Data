'''''A Home on the Range: The Jewish Chicken Ranchers of Petaluma''''' is a 2002 [[Documentary film|documentary]] by [[Bonnie Burt]] and [[Judith Montell]] about a group of [[Jews]] who fled from [[pogroms]] in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[prejudice]] in [[United States|America]] to organized a [[socialist]] society in [[rural]] [[Northern California]], where they relied on raising [[chickens]] to support themselves.

==Summary==
“Who said Jews could not be farmers? Spit in his eye, who would so harm us?” Scott Gerber, a former resident of Petaluma, belts out the lyrics to his [[acoustic guitar]]. Although the chicken ranches in Petaluma have more recently been abandoned, Scott has maintained his Jewish culture and his love for the land, working as a cowboy and singing [[Yiddish]] folk songs.

''A Home on the Range'' shows old photographs and archival color footage of [[Petaluma]] that bring the town to life. These visuals, along with interviews of former residents, reconstruct an idealistic society that put in hard work collecting and cleaning eggs but enjoyed lectures given by top notch Jewish [[poets]] and [[philosophers]] given at the Community Hall. United by their [[culture]], the Jews of Petaluma cared for one another as extended family and survived the [[antisemitism]] of pre-[[World War II]] and [[anticommunist]] sentiments of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era. But with time and assimilation, the quirky community dwindled, and, today, their chicken ranches have been replaced by [[telecommunication]], dairy farms and vineyards.

For many of the Jews in Petaluma, [[Judaism]] was more of a culture than a religion. One former resident says that people kept the holidays for the social attachment, and another spouts, “Judaism—there wasn't any!” In fact, when they were building their meeting hall it was almost unanimously decided to not build a [[synagogue]]—until they learned it could be a tax write off. For them, Judaism had nothing to do with God. Instead, it meant that they spoke Yiddish, ate [[matzah]], and wanted to form a [[kibbutz]]. But most of all, it meant they were outsiders to [[United States|American]] society. They were second rate citizens, called names, and not allowed in Country Clubs.

They had fled pogroms in [[Russia]] and antisemitism in urban America to live in a rural Jewish community, but still they faced antisemitism from their surrounding neighbors. One woman remembers, “they used to call us dirty Jew.” And another woman remembers a particularly frightening night when an [[antisemitic]] neighbor threw a barn party and the drunk and rowdy crowd terrified her parents so much that they couldn't sleep that night. These incidents ingrained the Jews with a painful feeling of being “lesser” than other Americans. But nothing can compare to the violent night that [[Gentile]] leaders in the neighboring community took out their antisemitism and anticommunist fears through brute force against the men of Petaluma.

It wasn't prejudice that destroyed their community, but acceptance. Once [[Jewish Americans]] were no longer looked down on, they assimilated into society, and the vibrant community of chicken ranchers in Petaluma dwindled. One former resident who grew up on a ranch and raised her children on a ranch expresses her mixed feelings about assimilation. She pines that she lost, “the core” sense of attachment, but in exchange, “we were accepted as Americans.”

==Production==
For the past twenty years, Bonnie Burt has been making documentaries about Jewish life. Her films have screened at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name="AHomeontheRangewebsite"&gt;{{cite web

Bonnie says she'd heard about Petaluma before she moved to California from the East Coast. It wasn't until 1992 at the [[Madrid]] Jewish Film Festival that she teamed up with Judy Montell, and the two began to work on the project together.

==Reception==
''A Home on the Range'' was well received. The [[San Diego]] Jewish [[Film Festival]] called it a modest film that "reads almost like an epic myth."&lt;ref name= "SanDiegoFilmFestival"&gt;{{cite web

'''Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الملك ابن مروان}} ''‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwān'', 646{{snd}}8 October 705) was the 5th [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]]. He was born in [[Medina]], [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;but there is uncertainty as to when his actual birth occurred. Sources say 646 or 647.&lt;/ref&gt; Abd al-Malik was a well-educated man and capable ruler who was able to solve many political problems that impeded his rule. The 14th-century Arab historian and philosopher [[Ibn Khaldun]] stated that "`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was one of the greatest Arab and Muslim Caliphs. He followed in the footsteps of [[`Umar ibn al-Khattab]], the Commander of the Believers, in regulating state affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QCZ1NRlVgYkC&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;dq=Abd+al-Malik+ibn+Marwan+is+one+of+the+greatest+Arab+and+Muslim+Caliphs.+He+followed+in+the+footsteps+of+%5B%5B%60Umar+ibn+al-Khattab%5D%5D,+the+Commander+of+the+Believers,+in+regulating+state+affairs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nihKUZJzga&amp;sig=R69IlSW9k6yOALHW6AuuYRbttKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp1qy4i9LPAhUH64MKHaQPAAoQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Abd%20al-Malik%20ibn%20Marwan%20is%20one%20of%20the%20greatest%20Arab%20and%20Muslim%20Caliphs.%20He%20followed%20in%20the%20footsteps%20of%20%5B%5B%60Umar%20ibn%20al-Khattab%5D%5D,%20the%20Commander%20of%20the%20Believers,%20in%20regulating%20state%20affairs&amp;f=false|title=Titans of the Middle East|last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|date=2012-05-17|publisher=Quercus Publishing|isbn=9781743511237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his reign, all important records were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and for the first time, a special currency for the Muslim world was minted, which led to war with the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Justinian II]]. The Byzantines were led by [[Leontios]] at the [[Battle of Sebastopolis]] in 692 in Asia Minor and were decisively defeated by al-Malik after the defection of a large contingent of Slavs. The [[Gold dinar|Islamic currency]] was then made the only currency of exchange in the Muslim world. Also, many reforms happened in his time relating to agriculture and commerce. Al-Malik extended and consolidated Muslim rule, made [[Arabic]] the state language and organised a regular postal service.&lt;ref&gt;Classical Islam G.Gunebam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Abd al-Malik spent most of his early life in [[Medina]] with his father. There, he developed useful relationships with the religious circles of the city. He studied [[Islamic jurisprudence]] under [[Umm Darda as Sughra]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suleman|first1=Mehrunisha|last2=Rajbee|first2=Afaaf|title=The Lost Female Scholars of Islam|url=http://www.emel.com/article?id&amp;a_id=828|website=Emel magazine|publisher=Emel magazine|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 16, he was given limited responsibilities by [[Muawiya II]]. In 683, he and his father were driven out of Medina by local rebels. On the way to Damascus, he crossed paths with the Syrian army, entailed with the task of ending the rebellion.

He was responsible for the giving of useful advice and information that helped to end that problem.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His father was appointed to be caliph in 684 but only created a feud between the northern and southern Arab tribes.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

== Campaigns in Iraq and Hejaz ==
Abd al-Malik became caliph after the death of his father [[Marwan I]] in 685, amidst the ongoing [[Second Fitna]]. Within a few years, he dispatched armies on a campaign to reassert Umayyad control over the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic empire]]. He first [[Battle of Maskin|defeated]] the governor of [[Basra]], Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr. In Iraq, he was facing three distinct groups (the [[Kharijites]], [[Shi'a]], and [[Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr]] and his followers) that were fighting amongst themselves and against Umayyad control. Al-Zubayr was the more dangerous of the three, as he had been named caliph in [[Mecca]] and other provinces were getting behind him.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Abd al-Malik bided his time for three years while they weakened themselves. During this hiatus, al-Zubayr's brother, Mus'ab, defeated the Shi'a in 687, which allowed them to commit a large force against the Kharijites.

Abd al-Malik then appointed one of his most able generals and administrators who would later change the face of the [[Umayyad Empire]], [[al-Hajjaj bin Yousef]] to march against al-Zubayr, the now-governor of [[Hejaz]]. He was initially unsuccessful in 689, as he needed to return to Damascus to help quell a rebellion. Again, in 690, he met with failure. Only after the northern tribes had finally capitulated in 691 did success start. He defeated the weakened army of Mus'ab by bribing many of his soldiers to switch sides and kill their leader.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

He then turned his attention to the caliph, al-Zubayr. It should be noted that al-Zubayr controlled a large majority of the empire outside Umayyad core in Syria and Egypt, and more importantly, controlled Mecca and Medina. Ibn-al Zubayr was a living [[sahabah]] of Muhammad who stood opposed to Umayyad rule.&lt;ref&gt;(cite web|title=Islamic History, Part 16: the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik (685-705)|url=https://attwiw.com/2014/01/22/islamic-history-part-16-the-caliphate-of-abd-al-malik-685-705/)&lt;/ref&gt; Hajjaj besieged Mecca in 692 with almost 12,000 Syrian troops. He advanced unopposed as far as his native [[Taif]], which he took without any fighting and used as a base. The caliph had charged him first to negotiate with al-Zubayr and to assure him of freedom from punishment if he capitulated or, if opposition continued, to starve him out by siege, but on no account to let the affair result in bloodshed in Mecca. Since the negotiations failed and al-Hajjaj lost patience, he sent a courier to ask Abd al-Malik for reinforcements and also for permission to take Mecca by force. He received both and thereupon bombarded the Holy City using [[catapults]] from the mountain of [[Abu Qubays]]. The bombardment continued during the month of the Pilgrimage or [[Hajj]].

After the siege had lasted for seven months and 10,000 men, among them two of Abdullah Ibn al-Zubair's sons, had gone over to Hajjaj, [[Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr]] with a few loyal followers, including his youngest son, were killed in the fighting around the [[Kaaba]] (Jumadah I 73/October 692).

Hajjaj's success led Abd al-Malik to assign him the role of governor of [[Iraq]] and give him free rein in the territories he controlled. Hajjaj arrived when there were many deserters in [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]]. He continually faced rebellions from the Kharijites but was always able to put them down.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He promptly and forcefully impelled them to return to combat. Hajjaj, after years of serious fighting, quelled religious disturbances, including the rebellion launched by Salih ibn Musarrih and continued after Salih's death by Shabib. The rebels repeatedly defeated more numerous forces and at their height entered [[Kufa]]h. However, Abd al-Malik's Syrian reinforcements enabled Hajjaj to turn the tide.

By 697, the Kharijites were no longer much of a problem.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Under Hajjaj, Arab armies put down the revolt of [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath]] in Iraq and Afghanistan from 699 to 704&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and also took most of [[Turkestan]]. Abd al-Rahman rebelled after Hajjaj's repeated orders to push further into the lands of Zundil. After his defeat in Iraq, again achieved through Abd al-Malik's dispatch of Syrian reinforcements to Hajjaj, Abd al-Rahman returned east. There, one city closed its gates to him, and in another, he was seized. However, Zundil's army arrived and secured his release. Later, Abd al-Rahman died and Zundil sent his head to Hajjaj, who sent it to Abd al-Malik. These victories paved the way for greater expansions under Abd al-Malik's son Al-Walid.

Hajjaj decided that the best way to rule Iraq was to treat them as enemy territory. He built a new city, [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]], which he used as a garrison city for his Syrian troops and also as his private residence.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

== Campaigns in North Africa ==
He was effective in increasing the size of the empire. In [[Maghreb]] (western North Africa) in 686, a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qais won the [[Battle of Mamma]] over [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Berber people|Berbers]] led by [[Kusaila]], on the [[Qairawan]] plain, retaking [[Ifriqiya]] and its capital [[Kairouan]].

In 695, [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] captured [[Carthage]] with the help of the [[Berber people|Berbers]],&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and advanced into the [[Atlas Mountains]]. A [[Byzantine]] fleet arrived, retaking Carthage, but in 698 al-Nu'man returned and defeated [[Tiberios III]] at the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|Battle of Carthage]]. The Byzantines withdrew from all of Africa except [[Ceuta]].

Hasan met trouble from the Zenata tribe of [[Berber people|Berbers]] under [[al-Kahina]]. It inflicted a serious defeat on him and drove him back to [[Barqa]]. However, in 702, Abd al-Malik strongly reinforced Hasan. Now with a large army and the support of the settled population of [[North Africa]], Hasan pushed forward. He decisively defeated the Zenata in a battle at [[Tabarka]], 85 miles west of Carthage. He then developed the village of [[Tunis]], 10&amp;nbsp;mi from the destroyed Carthage. Around 705, [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] replaced Hasan. He had pacified much of Northern Africa despite his failure to take Ceuta.

==Byzantines and Anatolia==

Relations between the Arabs and the Byzatines along their border in Anatolia had been calm since 680, with a truce largely holding up. Emboldened by success in his European provinces, however, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian II]] managed by threat to augment the sum paid by the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]]s as an annual tribute, and to regain control of part of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

Initially looking like a defeat, thousands of the Byzantine Emperor's [[Slavs|Slavic]] troops defected, changing the tide of the fight. It was a crushing victory for Abd al-Malik, and ended the peace that had existed between the two powers since 680.

== Reforms ==
Abd al-Malik instituted many reforms such as:
# Making [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the sole [[official language]] of government across the entire caliphate.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;
# Instituting a mint that produced a uniform set of Islamic currency&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; which resulted in war with [[Byzantine Empire]] and defeat of the Romans at the [[Battle of Sebastopolis]];
# Expansion and reorganization of postal service,
# Repairing the damaged [[Kaaba]] and beginning the tradition of weaving a silk cover for the Kaaba in [[Damascus]].

== Art and Architecture ==
[[File:Exterior of the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem3.jpg|thumb|The Dome of the Rock]]
He also built the [[Dome of the Rock]]&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; in [[Jerusalem]]. The Muslim scholar al-Wasiti reports this event:

{{quote|text=When Abd al-Malik intended to construct the Dome of the Rock, he came from [[Damascus]] to [[Jerusalem]]. He wrote, "Abd al-Malik intends to build a dome (''qubba'') over the [[Foundation Stone|Rock]] to house the Muslims from cold and heat, and to construct the [[mosque]] (''masjid''). But before he starts he wants to know his subjects' opinion."  With their approval, the deputies wrote back, "May Allah permit the completion of this enterprise, and may He count the building of the dome and the masjid a good deed for Abd al-Malik and his predecessors." He then gathered craftsmen from all his dominions and asked them to provide him with the description and form of the planned dome before he engaged in its construction. So, it was marked for him in the ''[[sahn]]'' of the masjid. He then ordered the building of the treasury (''bayt al-mal'') to the east of the Rock, which is on the edge of the Rock, and filled it with money. He then appointed [[Raja Ibn Haywah|Raja' ibn Hayweh]] and Yazid ibn Salam to supervise the construction and ordered them to spend generously on its construction. He then returned to [[Damascus]]. When the two men satisfactorily completed the house, they wrote to Abd al-Malik to inform him that they had completed the construction of the dome and al-Masjid al-Aqsa. They said to him "There is nothing in the building that leaves room for criticism." They wrote him that a hundred thousand dinars was left from the budget he allocated. He offered the money to them as a reward, but they declined, indicating that they had already been generously compensated. Abd al-Malik ordered the gold coins to be melted and cast on the Dome's exterior, which at the time had such a strong glitter that no eye could look straight at it.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Bakr al-Wasiti, Fada'il Bayt al-Maqdis, pp. 80-81, vol 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasser Rabbat, The Dome of the Rock Rvisited: Some Remarks on al-Wasiti's Accounts, Muqaranas, Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar, pp. 66-75, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The two engineers [[Raja Ibn Haywah|Raja' ibn Hayweh]], from [[Baysan]], and Yazid ibn Salam, a Jerusalemite, were ordered to spend generously on the construction. In his ''Book of the Geography'', [[Al-Muqaddasi]] reported that seven times the revenue of [[Egypt]] was used to build the Dome. During a discussion with his uncle on why the Caliph spent lavishly on building the mosques in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Damascus]], al-Maqdisi writes:

{{quote|text=O, my little son, thou hast no understanding. Verily he was right, and he was prompted to a worthy work. For he beheld [[Syria]] to be a country that had long been occupied by the [[Christians]], and he noted there are beautiful churches still belonging to them, so enchantingly fair, and so renowned for their splendour, as are the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and the churches of Lydda and Edessa. So he sought to build for the Muslims a mosque that should be unique and a wonder to the world. And in like manner is it not evident that Caliph Abd al-Malik, seeing the greatness of the martyrium of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]] and its magnificence was moved lest it should dazzle the minds of Muslims and hence erected above the [[Foundation Stone|Rock]] the dome which is now seen there.&lt;ref&gt;Shams al-Din al-Maqdisi, Ahsan al-Taqasim fi Mar'rifat al-Aqalim, 2nd ed. (Leiden, 1967) pp. 159-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;le Strange, 1890, [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/117/mode/1up p.117]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Abd al-Malik's first issue of coins replaced images with words, to appease [[Aniconism in Islam|aniconistic]] clerics. After this, the style became predominant on Islamic coins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/g/gold_coin_of_abd_al-malik.aspx Gold coin of Abd al-Malik profile, from the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Abbasid Caliphate==
The [[Abbasid]] and [[Umayyad]] Caliphates were strong adversaries and fought on multiple occasions for control of the region. There existed a strong animosity between the two dynasties, which can be traced back to tribal ancestral relations.

[[Al Masudi]] narrates an event where [[Al Mansur]], the second [[Abbasid]] Caliph, describes Abd al-Malik as "an arrogant tyrant who did not care what he did."&lt;ref&gt;Al Masudi, Meadows of Gold, A Conversation with the King of Nubia, pg.24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salih ibn Ali]], a famous [[Abbasid]] general, mentions to [[Al Mansur]], the second Abbasid Caliph, that Abd Allah (Abd Al-Malik), the son of [[Marwan]], fled to the land of the Christian [[Nubians]] with a small following where he was questioned by the King as to their current situation and what had befallen them.

Salih ibn Ali is unable to recall the rest of the narration and Abd Allah, a prisoner in Al Mansur's court at the time, is brought before Mansur and prompted to relay the event. Abd Allah claims that "I was in Nubia three days when the King came to visit me" and although  "I had spread out a valuable carpet" to welcome the King, he chose to sit on the ground stating that a king must humble himself. The Nubian king criticized Abd Allah for drinking alcohol and wearing brocade and silk and gold "in spite of the prohibitions of your Book and your religion." Abd Allah replied saying, "as power fled from us, we have adopted support from alien races...and we have adopted these clothes from them."

The King bowed his head in silence, then lifted his head and replied, "It is not the way you tell it! No! Your people permitted themselves what God forbade. You broke God's commandments and oppressed those you ruled. Then God stripped you of your power and dressed you in the ignominy of your crimes." The King feared that divine punishment would follow to his land, inadvertently striking him as well. Thus, the King explains that the rights of the guest lasts for three days, Abd Allah's visit was over, and that he should "take the provisions you need and ride out of my country." Upon hearing this, [[Al Mansur]] was greatly moved and elected to release Abd Allah out of pity. However, Isa ibn Ali, his uncle, reminded Mansur that Abd Allah had already received the oath of allegiance as Marwan's heir, so they had him escorted back to prison.&lt;ref&gt;Al Masudi, Meadows of Gold, A Conversation with the King of Nubia, pg.24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:Tomb of Abdul Malek.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Caliph Abd al-Malik at Bab Al-Saghir Cemetery, Damascus]] The last years of his reign were generally peaceful. He wanted his son [[al-Walid I]] to succeed him, ignoring his father's decree that Abd al-Malik should be succeeded by his brother, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan|Abd al-Aziz]]. However, al-Malik accepted advice not to create disturbances and so changed his mind. In the event, Abd al-Aziz died before Abd al-Malik, who then had his sons [[Al-Walid I|Al-Walid]] and [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]], in that order, accepted as heirs to the throne. To history, Abd al-Malik is known as the "Father of Kings": his four sons succeeded him as the caliph one after another&lt;ref&gt;Masudul Hasa, ''History of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; though with [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz|Umar II]], son of [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan|Abd al-Aziz]] succeeding Sulayman. Abd al-Malik died at [[al-Sinnabra]] in 705.&lt;ref name=Gulrup38&gt;Bacharach in Necipogulu, 1996, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Algeria}}
'''Algerian nationalism''' is the [[nationalism]] of [[Algeria]]ns and [[Culture of Algeria|Algerian culture]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;James McDougall. History and the Culture of Nationalism in Algeria. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Algerian nationalism was inspired by [[Ben Badis]] who opposed French colonial rule in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Algerian nationalism==
A new generation of [[Muslim]] leadership emerged in Algeria at the time of World War I and grew to maturity during the 1920s and 1930s. It consisted of a small but influential class of ''[[évolué]]s'', other Algerians whose perception of themselves and their country had been shaped by wartime experiences, and a body of religious reformers and teachers. Some of these people were members of the few wealthy Muslim families that had managed to insinuate themselves into the colonial system in the 1890s and had with difficulty succeeded in obtaining for their sons the French education coveted by progressive Algerians. Others were among the about 173,000 Algerians who had served in the [[French army]] during World War I or the several hundred thousand more who had assisted the French war effort by working in factories. Many Algerians stayed on in France after 1918, and sent the money they earned there to their relatives in Algeria. In France they became aware of a standard of living higher than any they had known at home and of democratic political concepts, taken for granted by Frenchmen in France, which ''[[colon (Algeria)|colons]]'', soldiers, and bureaucrats had refused to apply to the Muslim majority in Algeria. Some Algerians also became acquainted with the [[pan-Arab nationalism]] growing in the Middle East.

===Political movements===
One of the earliest movements for political reform was an integrationist group, the [[Young Algerians]] (''Jeunese Algérienne''). Its members were drawn from the small, liberal elite of well-educated, middle-class ''évolués'' who demanded an opportunity to prove that they were French as well as Muslim. In 1908 they delivered to France's Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] a petition that expressed opposition under the [[status quo]] to a proposed policy to conscript Muslim Algerians into the [[French army]]. If, however, the state granted the Muslims full citizenship, the petition went on, opposition to conscription would be dropped. In 1911, in addition to demanding preferential treatment for "the intellectual elements of the country", the group called for an end to unequal taxation, broadening of the franchise, more schools, and protection of indigenous property. The Young Algerians added a significant voice to the reformist movement against French colonial policy that began in 1892 and continued until the outbreak of World War I. In part to reward Muslims who fought and died for France, Clemenceau appointed reform-minded Charles Jonnart as governor general. Reforms promulgated in 1919 and known as the [[Jonnart Law]] expanded the number of Muslims permitted to vote to about 425,000. The legislation also removed all voters from the jurisdiction of the humiliating ''[[Indigénat|Code de l'indigénat]]''.

The most popular Muslim leader in Algeria after the war was Khalid ibn Hashim, grandson of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] and a member of the Young Algerians, although he differed with some members of the group over acceptance of the Jonnart Law. Some Young Algerians were willing to work within the framework set out by the reforms, but Emir Khalid, as he was known, continued to press for the complete Young Algerian program. He was able to win electoral victories in Algiers and to enliven political discourse with his calls for reform and full assimilation, but by 1923 he tired of the struggle and left Algeria, eventually retiring to Damascus.

Some of the Young Algerians in 1926 formed the [[Federation of Elected Natives]] (''Fédération des Élus Indigènes'', FEI), as many of the former group's members had joined the circle of Muslims eligible to hold public office. The federation's objectives were the assimilation of the ''[[évolué]]s'' into the French community, with full citizenship but without surrendering their personal status as Muslims, and the eventual integration of Algeria as a full province of France. Other objectives included equal pay for equal work for government employees, abolition of travel restrictions to and from France, abolition of the ''[[Indigénat|Code de l'indigénat]]'' (which had been reinstituted earlier), and electoral reform.

The first group to call for Algerian independence was the [[Star of North Africa]] (''Étoile Nord-Africain'', known as Star). The group was originally a solidarity group formed in 1926 in Paris to coordinate political activity among North African workers in France and to defend "the material, moral, and social interests of North African Muslims". The leaders included members of the [[French Communist Party]] and its labor confederation, and in the early years of the struggle for independence the party provided material and moral support. [[Ahmed Messali Hadj]], the Star's secretary general, enunciated the groups demands in 1927. In addition to independence from France, the Star called for freedom of press and association, a parliament chosen through universal suffrage, confiscation of large estates, and the institution of Arabic schools. The Star was first banned in 1929 and operated underground until 1933 when reconstituted with [[Messali Hadj]] President, [[Imache Amar]] General Secretary and [[Belkacem Radjef]] Treasurer. Its newspaper, El Ouma, reached a circulation of 43,500. Influenced by the Arab nationalist ideas of Lebanese Druze Shakib Arslan, Messali turned away from communist support to a more nationalist outlook, for which the French Communist Party attacked the Star. He returned to Algeria to organize urban workers and peasant farmers and in 1937 founded the [[Algerian People's Party]] (''Parti du Peuple Algérien'', PPA) to mobilize the Algerian working class at home and in France to improve its situation through political action. For Messali Hadj, who ruled the PPA with an iron hand, these aims were inseparable from the struggle for an independent Algeria in which socialist and Islamic values would be fused.

Algeria's Islamic reform movement took inspiration from Egyptian reformers [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Rashid Rida|Muhammad Rashid Rida]] and stressed the Arab and Islamic roots of the country. Starting in the 1920s, the reform [[ulema]], religious scholars, promoted a purification of Islam in Algeria and a return to the Qur'an and the ''sunna'', or tradition of the Prophet. The reformers favored the adoption of modern methods of inquiry and rejected the superstitions and folk practices of the countryside, actions that brought them into confrontation with the ''marabouts''. The reformers published their own periodicals and books, and established free modern Islamic schools that stressed Arabic language and culture as an alternative to the schools for Muslims operated for many years by the French. Under the dynamic leadership of [[Shaykh Abd al Hamid Ben Badis]], the reformist ulama organized the [[Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema]] (''Association des Uléma Musulmans Algériens'', AUMA) in 1931. Although their support was concentrated in the Constantine area, the AUMA struck a responsive chord among the Muslim masses, with whom it had closer ties than did the other nationalist organizations. As the Islamic reformers gained popularity and influence, the colonial authorities responded in 1933 by refusing them permission to preach in official [[mosque]]s. This move and similar ones sparked several years of sporadic religious unrest.

European influences had some impact on indigenous Muslim political movements because [[Ferhat Abbas]] and Messali Hadj even with opposite views, essentially looked to France for their more secular ideological models. [[Ben Badis]], however, believed that "Islam is our religion, Arabic our language, Algeria our fatherland." Abbas went as far as summing up the philosophy of the liberal integrationists to oppose the claims of the nationalists by denying in 1936 that Algeria had a separate identity. However, Ben Badis responded that he, too, had looked to the past and found "that this Algerian nation is not France, cannot be France, and does not want to be France … [but] has its culture, its traditions and its characteristics, good or bad, like every other nation of the earth." He was opposed to French colonial rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;James McDougall. History and the Culture of Nationalism in Algeria. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''colons'', for their part, rejected any movement toward reform, whether instigated by integrationist or nationalist organizations. Reaction in Paris to the nationalists was divided. In the 1930s, French liberals saw only the ''évolués'' as a possible channel for diffusing political power in Algeria, denigrating Messali Hadj for demagoguery and the AUMA for religious obscurantism. At all times, however, the French government was confronted by the monolithic intransigence of the leaders of the European community in Algeria in opposing any devolution of power to Muslims, even to basically pro-French ''évolués''. The ''colons'' also had powerful allies in the [[French National Assembly]], the bureaucracy, the armed forces, and the business community, and were strengthened in their resistance by their almost total control of the Algerian administration and police.

===Viollette Plan===
The mounting social, political, and economic crises in Algeria for the first time induced older and newly emerged classes of indigenous society to engage from 1933 to 1936 in numerous acts of political protest. The government responded with more restrictive laws governing public order and security. In 1936, French socialist [[Léon Blum]] became premier in a [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government and appointed [[Maurice Viollette]] his minister of state. The Ulemas and in June 1936 the Star of Messali, sensing a new attitude in Paris that would favor their agenda, cautiously joined forces with the FEI.

Representatives of these groups and members of the [[Algerian Communist Party]] (''Parti Communiste Algérien'', PCA) met in [[Algiers]] in 1936 at the first [[Algerian Muslim Congress]]. The congress drew up an extensive Charter of Demands, which called for the abolition of laws permitting imposition of the ''[[régime d'exception]]'', political integration of Algeria and France, maintenance of personal legal status by Muslims acquiring French citizenship, fusion of European and Muslim education systems in Algeria, freedom to use Arabic in education and the press, equal wages for equal work, land reform, establishment of a single electoral college, and universal suffrage.

Blum and Viollette gave a warm reception to a congress delegation in Paris and indicated that many of their demands could be met. Meanwhile, Violettee drew up for the Blum government a proposal to extend French citizenship with full political equality to certain classes of the Muslim "elite", including university graduates, elected officials, army officers, and professionals. [[Messali Hadj]] saw in the Viollette Plan a new "instrument of colonialism … to split the Algerian people by separating the elite from the masses". The components of the congress—the ulema, the FEI, and communists—were heartened by the proposal and gave it varying measures of support. [[Mohamed Bendjelloul]] and Abbas, as spokesmen for the ''évolués'', who would have the most to gain from the measure, considered this plan a major step toward achieving their aims and redoubled their efforts through the liberal FEI to gain broad support for the policy of Algerian integration with France. Not unexpectedly, however, the colons had taken uncompromising exception to the [[Blum-Viollette proposal]]. Although the project would have granted immediate French citizenship and voting rights to only about 21,000 Muslims, with provision for adding a few thousand more each year, spokesmen for the ''colons'' raised the specter of the European electorate's being submerged by a Muslim majority. ''Colon'' administrators and their supporters threw procedural obstacles in the path of the legislation, and the government gave it only lukewarm support, resulting in its ultimate failure.

While the Viollette Plan was still a live issue, however, Messali Hadj made a dramatic comeback to Algeria and had significant local success in attracting people to the Star. A mark of his success was the fact that in 1937 the government dissolved the Star. The same year Messali Hadj formed the PPA, which had a more moderate program, but he and other PPA leaders were arrested following a large demonstration in Algiers. Although Messali Hadj spent many years in jail, his party had the most widespread support of all opposition groups until it was banned in 1939.

Disillusioned by the failure of the Viollette Plan to win acceptance in Paris, Abbas shifted from a position of favoring assimilation of the ''évolués'' and full integration with France to calling for the development of a Muslim Algeria in close association with France but retaining "her own physiognomy, her language, her customs, her traditions". His more immediate goal was greater political, social, and economic equality for Muslims with the ''colons''. By 1938 the cooperation among the parties that made up the congress began to break up.

==Polarization and politicization==
Algerian Muslims rallied to the French side at the start of World War II as they had done in World War I. [[Nazi Germany]]'s quick defeat of France, however, and the establishment of the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]], to which the ''colons'' were generally sympathetic, not only increased the difficulties of the Muslims but also posed an ominous threat to the [[Jews in Algeria]]. The Algerian administration vigorously enforced the anti-Semitic laws imposed by Vichy, which stripped Algerian Jews of their French citizenship. Potential opposition leaders in both the European and the Muslim communities were arrested.

Allied landings were made at [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] by 70,000 British and United States troops on November 8, 1942, in coordination with landings in Morocco. As part of [[Operation Torch]] under the overall command of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Algiers and Oran were secured two days later after a determined resistance by French defenders. On November 11, Admiral [[François Darlan]], commander in chief of Vichy French forces, ordered a ceasefire in North Africa. Algeria provided a base for the subsequent [[Tunisian Campaign|Allied campaign in Tunisia]].

After the fall of the Vichy regime in Algeria, General [[Henri Giraud]], [[Free French forces|Free French]] commander in chief in North Africa, slowly rescinded repressive Vichy laws despite opposition by ''colon'' extremists. He also called on the Muslim population to supply troops for the Allied war effort. Ferhat Abbas and twenty-four other Muslim leaders replied that Algerians were ready to fight with the Allies in freeing their homeland but demanded the right to call a conference of Muslim representatives to develop political, economic, and social institutions for the indigenous population "within an essentially French framework".  Giraud, who succeeded in raising an army of 250,000 men to fight in the Italian campaign, refused to consider this proposal, explaining that "politics" must wait until the end of the war.

In March 1943, Abbas, who had abandoned assimilation as a viable alternative to self-determination, presented the French administration with the Manifesto of the Algerian People, signed by fifty-six Algerian nationalist and international leaders. Outlining the perceived past and present problems of colonial rule, the manifesto demanded specifically an Algerian constitution that would guarantee immediate and effective political participation and legal equality for Muslims.  It called for agrarian reform, recognition of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as an official language on equal terms with [[French language|French]], recognition of a full range of civil liberties, and the freeing of political prisoners of all parties.

The French governor general created a commission composed of prominent Muslims and Europeans to study the manifesto. This commission produced a supplementary reform program, which was forwarded to General [[Charles de Gaulle]], leader of the Free French movement. De Gaulle and his newly appointed governor general in Algeria, General [[Georges Catroux]], a recognized liberal, viewed the manifesto as evidence of a need to develop a mutually advantageous relationship between the European and Muslim communities. Catroux was reportedly shocked by the "blinded spirit of social conservatism" of the colons, but he did not regard the manifesto as a satisfactory basis for cooperation because he felt it would submerge the European minority in a Muslim state. Instead, the French administration in 1944 instituted a reform package, based on the 1936 Viollette Plan, that granted full French citizenship to certain categories of "meritorious" Algerian Muslims—military officers and decorated veterans, university graduates, government officials, and members of the [[Legion of Honor]]—who numbered about 60,000.

A new factor influencing Muslim reaction to the reintroduction of the Viollette Plan—which by that date even many moderates had rejected as inadequate—was the shift in Abbas's position from support for integration to the demand for an autonomous state federated with France. Abbas gained the support of the AUMA and formed [[Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty]] (''Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté'', AML) to work for Algerian autonomie with equal rights for both Europeans and Muslims. Within a short time, the AML's newspaper, ''Égalité'', claimed 500,000 subscribers, indicating unprecedented interest in independence. By this time, over 350,000 Algerian Muslims (out of a total Algerian Muslim population of nine million) were working in France to support their relatives in Algeria, and many thousands more worked in towns. Messali and his PPA still rejected anything short of independence.

Social unrest grew in the winter of 1944–45, fueled in part by a poor wheat harvest, shortages of manufactured goods, and severe unemployment. On [[May Day]], the clandestine PPA organized demonstrations in twenty-one towns across the country, with marchers demanding freedom for Messali Hadj and independence for Algeria. Violence erupted in some locations, including Algiers and Oran, leaving many wounded and three dead.

Nationalist leaders were resolving to mark the approaching liberation of Europe with demonstrations calling for their own liberation, and it was clear that a clash with the authorities was imminent. The tensions between the Muslim and ''colon'' communities exploded on May 8, 1945, [[V-E Day]], in an outburst of such violence as to make their polarization complete, if not irreparable. Police had told local organizers they could march in [[Sétif]] only if they did not display nationalist flags or placards. They ignored the warnings, the march began, and gunfire resulted in which a number of police and demonstrators were killed. Marchers rampaged, leading to the killing of 103 Europeans. Word spread to the countryside, and villagers attacked colon settlements and government buildings.

The army and police [[Setif massacre|responded]] by conducting a prolonged and systematic [[ratissage]] (literally, raking over) of suspected centers of dissidence. In addition, military airplanes and ships attacked Muslim population centers. According to official French figures, 1,500 Muslims died as a result of these countermeasures. Other estimates vary from 6,000 to as high as 45,000 killed.

In the aftermath of the Sétif violence, the AML was outlawed, and 5,460 Muslims, including Abbas and many PPA members, were arrested. Abbas deplored the uprising but charged that its repression had taken Algeria "back to the days of the Crusades". In April 1946, Abbas once again asserted the demands of the manifesto and founded the [[Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto]] (''Union Démocratique du Manifeste Algérien'', UDMA Abbas called for a free, secular, and republican Algeria loosely federated with France. Upon his release from five-year house arrest, Messali Hadj returned to Algeria and formed the [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]] (''Mouvement pour le Triomphe des Libertés Démocratiques'', MTLD), which quickly drew supporters from a broad cross-section of society. Committed to unequivocal independence, the MTLD firmly opposed Abbas's proposal for federation. However some ex-PPA members convinced that independence could only be obtained by military means, continued to operate clandestinely and maintain cells in the Aures Mountains and Kabylie while maintaining membership in the MTLD. In 1947, they formed the (''[[Organisation Spéciale]]'', OS) operating loosely within the MTLD and led by [[Hocine Ait Ahmed]]. Their goal was to conduct terrorist operations since political protest through legal channels had been suppressed by the colonial authorities. Ait Ahmed was later succeeded as chief of the OS by [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], one of the early Algerian nationalist leaders.

The National Assembly approved the government-proposed [[Organic Statute of Algeria]] in August 1947. This law called for the creation of an [[Algerian Assembly]] with one house representing Europeans and "meritorious" Muslims, and the other representing the remaining more than 8 million Muslims. The statute also replaced mixed communes with elected local councils, abolished military government in the Algerian Sahara, recognized Arabic as an official language with French, and proposed enfranchising Muslim women. Muslim and ''colon'' deputies alike abstained or voted against the statute but for diametrically opposed reasons: the Muslims because it fell short of their expectations and the ''colons'' because it went too far.

The sweeping victory of Messali Hadj's MTLD in the 1947 municipal elections frightened the ''colons'', whose political leaders, through fraud and intimidation, attempted to obtain a result more favorable to them in the following year's first Algerian Assembly voting. The term ''élection algérienne'' became a synonym for rigged election. The MTLD was allowed nine seats, Abbas's UDMA was given eight, and government-approved "independents" were awarded fifty-five seats. These results may have reassured some of the ''colons'' that the nationalists had been rejected by the Muslim community, but the elections suggested to many Muslims that a peaceful solution to Algeria's problems was not possible.

At the first session of the ''colon''-controlled Algerian Assembly, an MTLD delegate was arrested at the door, prompting other Muslim representatives to walk out in protest. A request by Abbas to gain the floor was refused. Frustrated by these events, the nationalist parties, joined by the PCA, formed a common political front that undertook to have the results of the election voided. French socialists and moderates tried to initiate a formal inquiry into the reports of vote fraud but were prevented from doing so by the assembly's European delegates, who persuaded the [[governor general]] that an investigation would disturb the peace. New elections in 1951 were subject to the same sort of rigging that had characterized the 1948 voting.

In 1952 anti-French demonstrations precipitated by the OS led to Messali Hadj's arrest and deportation to France. Internal divisions and attacks by the authorities severely weakened the MTLD, draining its energies. Colon extremists took every opportunity to persuade the French government of the need for draconian measures against the emergent independence movement.

Ben Bella created a new underground action committee to replace the OS, which had been broken up by the French police in 1950. The new group, the [[Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action]] (''Comité Révolutionnaire d'Unité et d'Action'', CRUA), was based in [[Cairo]], where Ben Bella had fled in 1952. Known as the ''chefs historiques'' (historical chiefs), the group's nine original leaders—[[Hocine Ait Ahmed]], [[Mohamed Boudiaf]], [[Belkacem Krim]], [[Rabah Bitat]], [[Larbi Ben M'Hidi]], [[Mourad Didouch]], [[Moustafa Ben Boulaid]], [[Mohamed Khider]], and Ben Bella—were considered the leaders of the Algerian War of Independence.

Between March and October 1954, the CRUA organized a military network in Algeria comprising six military regions (referred to at the time as ''[[wilayat]]''; singular: ''wilaya''). The leaders of these regions and their followers became known as the "internals". Ben Bella, Khider, and Ait Ahmed formed the [[External Delegation in Cairo]]. Encouraged by Egypt's President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] (r. 1954–71), their role was to gain foreign support for the rebellion and to acquire arms, supplies, and funds for the wilaya commanders. In October the CRUA renamed itself the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (''Front de Libération Nationale'', FLN), which assumed responsibility for the political direction of the revolution. The National Liberation Army (''Armée de Libération Nationale'', ALN), the FLN's military arm, was to conduct the War of Independence within Algeria.

==Algerianism==
The term '''Algerianism''' has had two meanings in history, one during the French colonial era, and another one after the independence of [[Algeria]].

During the French era, ''algérianisme'' was a literary genre with political overtones, born among French Algerian writers (see ''[[Algerian literature]]'') who hoped for a common Algerian future culture, uniting French settlers and native Algerians. The term ''algérianiste'' was used for the first time in a 1911 novel by Robert Randau, "Les Algérianistes".&lt;ref&gt;reedited by Tchou éditeur, coll. « L’Algérie heureuse », 1979 {{ISBN|2-7107-0195-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Cercle algérianiste'' was created in France in 1973 by [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], with several local chapters. It has for "purpose to safeguard the cultural heritage born from the French presence in Algeria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Lang-fr|Le Cercle algérianiste, créé en 1973, a pour objectif de sauvegarder le patrimoine culturel né de la présence française en Algérie.}}, [http://www.cerclealgerianiste.asso.fr/ Site du Cercle Algérianiste, Sauver une culture en péril] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130113933/http://www.cerclealgerianiste.asso.fr/ |date=2012-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Algerian contemporary politics, ''algerianist'' is a political label given to Algerian nationalists whose policies focus more on the unity of Algeria's [[nation-state]] beyond regional idiosyncrasies.

The modern [[Arabic language]] actually has two distinct words which can be translated into English as "[[nationalism]]": ''qawmiyya'' قومية, derived from the word ''qawm'' (meaning "tribe, ethnic nationality"), and ''wataniyya'' وطنية, derived from the word ''watan'' (meaning "homeland, native country"). The word ''qawmiyya'' has been used to refer to pan-Arab nationalism, while ''wataniyya'' has been used to refer to patriotism at a more local level (sometimes disparaged as "regionalism" by those who consider [[pan-Arabism]] the only true form of [[Arab nationalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  "Arab Nationalism."  ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 151-155&lt;/ref&gt; '''Algerianism''' is the Algerian patriotism, against pan-Arabist nationalism and different forms of regionalisms.

:''Not to be confused with [[America at a Crossroads]], a PBS television miniseries about the [[War on Terrorism]]''

'''''America at the Crossroads: Democracy, Power, and the Neoconservative Legacy''''' is a 2006 book by [[Francis Fukuyama]].

This book briefly discusses the history of [[neoconservatism]], with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. Fukuyama outlines his rationale for supporting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.  Fukuyama argues that the [[Iraq invasion]] was poorly planned and orchestrated, and that the George W. Bush administration underestimated the social construction that would be necessary to create a new [[democracy]] after the war.

Fukuyama highlights the controversies that surround neoconservatism, describing how it has evolved into something he can no longer support.{{ref|1|1}} He suggests that neoconservativism can be described as having four common principles through the end of the Cold War:

* a concern with democracy, human rights, and more generally the internal politics of states; 
* a belief that U.S. power can be used for moral purposes; 
* a skepticism about the ability of international law and institutions to solve serious security problems; and finally, 
* a view that ambitious social engineering often leads to unexpected consequences and often undermines its own ends.

At the conclusion of the book, Fukuyama proposes a new order in [[international politics]], stating the world needs a change in its actual institutions, advocating what he calls multi-multilateralism.

'''Audience segmentation''' is a process of dividing people into homogeneous [[subgroup]]s based upon defined criterion such as [[product usage]], [[demographics]], [[psychographics]], [[communication behavior]]s and [[media use]].&lt;ref&gt;Cirksena, M.K., &amp; Flora, J.A. (1995). Audience segmentation in worksite health promotion: A procedure using social marketing concepts. Health Education Research, 10, 211–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J.E., &amp; Flora, J.A. (1995). Health behavior segmentation and campaign planning to reduce cardiovascular disease risk among Hispanics. Health Education Quarterly, 22, 36–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Audience segmentation is used in [[commercial marketing]] so [[advertiser]]s can design and tailor products and services that satisfy the targeted groups. In [[social marketing]], audiences are segmented into subgroups and assumed to have similar interests, needs and behavioral patterns and this assumption allows social marketers to design relevant health or social messages that influence the people to adopt recommended behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R.N. &amp; Adkins, A.D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In Thompson T.L., Dorsey, A., Miller, K.I., Parrott, R. (Eds), Handbook of health communication (pp. 498–499). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Audience segmentation is widely accepted as a fundamental strategy in [[communication]] campaigns to influence [[health]] and [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M.D. (1996). Theory and method in health audience segmentation. Journal of Health Communication, 1, 267–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Audience segmentation makes campaign efforts more effective when messages are tailored to the distinct subgroups and more efficient when the [[target audience]] is selected based on their [[wikt:susceptibility|susceptibility]] and [[wikt:receptivity|receptivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkin, C. &amp; Freimuth, V. (2001). Formative evaluation research in campaign design. In R.E. Rice &amp; C.K. Atkin (Eds.), Public communication campaigns (3rd ed., pp. 125–145). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dervin, B. &amp; Frenette, M. (2001). Applying sense-making methodology: Communicating communicatively with audiences as listeners, learners, teachers, confidantes. In R.E. Rice &amp; C.K. Atkin (Eds.), Public communication campaigns (3rd ed., pp. 69–87). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for audience segmentation strategy==
Audience segmentation strategy is driven by the goal of developing criteria that can be used to form [[homogeneous]] clusters. The most common criteria used are demographics (age, level of [[education]], [[income]], [[ethnicity]] and [[gender]]) and geography (region, county, [[census tract]]). Since an audience segment that is derived exclusively from demographics such as [[Asian-American]] youths constitutes a large group that still has varied beliefs, values and behavior, demographics may not be sufficient as segmentation criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M.D. (1996). Theory and method in health audience segmentation. Journal of Health Communication, 1, 267–283.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated segmentation strategies use [[psychosocial]], behavioral and psychographics (personality, values, attitudes, interests, level of readiness for change and lifestyles) as variables to categorize audience subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A. (1994). Market segmentation: Using demographics, psychographics and other niche marketing techniques to predict and model customer behavior. Chicago, IL: Probus.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the audience has been divided into segments based on selected criteria, campaigns are then designed and communication channels are selected to reach their intended audience effectively.

Grunig's model of segmentation
Grunig proposed a [[Theory|theory-based model]] of segmentation which comprises a series of inner and outer nests.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, J.E. (1989). Publics, audiences, and market segments: Segmentation principles for campaigns. In C.T. Salmon (Ed.) Information campaigns: Balancing social values and social change (pp. 199–228). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The inner nests contain (a) individuals (individual communication behaviors and effects) and (b) publics (groups of people sharing common interests and issues). The outer nests consist of (c) communities, (d) psychographics, lifestyles and subcultures, and [[social relationship]]s, (e) [[geodemographics]], (f) demographics/social categories and (g) mass audience. The nests display increasing specificity instead of generality as they move towards the inner center; more specificity provides more audience details and insights that allow communication campaigns to create more precise messages for the target audience.

==Ethical issues==
Audience segmentation is employed in [[health intervention]]s as a strategy to effectively utilize limited resources to reach the intended population. [[Health equity|Equity]] and [[utility]] are often the prominent ethical issues in audience segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Guttman, N. (1997). Ethical dilemmas in health communication interventions. Health Communication, 9, 155–190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J.G., (1996). The cost effectiveness of HIV prevention targeting: How much more bang for the buck? American Journal of Public Health, 86, 1709–1712.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, M.L. (2001). Ethical considerations in the use of marketing for the management of public health and social issues. In A.R. Andreasen (Ed.), Ethics in social marketing (pp. 36–69). Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some campaigns target people who are most inclined to accept suggested messages while other campaigns aim at those with highest risk, despite the fact that they are hard to reach or least likely to adopt recommended behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Des Jarlais, D.C., Padian, N.S., &amp; Winkelstein, W. (1994). Targeted HIV-prevention programs. New England Journal of Medicine, 331, 1451–1453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freimuth, V.S., &amp; Mettger, W. (1990). Is there a hard-to-reach audience? Public Health Reports, 105, 232–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical [[dilemma]] occurs when [[health communicator]]s have to identify audience segments and plan health interventions for these groups, depriving those not targeted in the process. 

[[Public health]] campaigns often target large segments of population who have low to moderate risk as small changes can create visible impact on [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. (1985). Sick individuals and sick populations. International Journal of Epidemiology, 14, 32–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Health campaigns aim to decrease [[alcoholic beverage]] consumption focus on moderate users who are larger in number and have higher likelihood to respond positively to the interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Guttman, N. (2003). Ethics in health communication interventions. In Thompson T.L., Dorsey, A., Miller, K.I., Parrott, R. (Eds), Handbook of health communication (pp. 657–658). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, targeting small segments of the high risk population (e.g. heavy smokers) in quit [[smoking]] campaigns may be inefficient as they are less likely to stop the risky behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, E.B. (1995). Editorial: The results of the COMMIT Trial. American Journal of Public Health, 83, 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience segmentation can also cause conflicts within the community. The [[Nigeria]] STD/HIV Management Project, funded by the UK [[Department of International Development]] (DFID) in 1999 stirred intense conflicts after non-targeted community members felt resources had been unfairly allocated to the "unworthy" audience segment, people living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. As a result, HIV-infected victims were turned away from attending [[health center]]s, excluded and discriminated by the community and 25 people with HIV/AIDS in the project eventually died by the end of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, J. &amp; Caffrey, M. (2005). HIV/AIDS and community conflict in Nigeria: implications and challenges. Social Science &amp; Medicine, 60, 1209–1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in international health campaigns==
Slater and Flora's 1991 study on the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] among central [[California]]ns utilized health behaviors to segment the audience into seven subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The health behaviors criteria included (a) cognitive (health knowledge, attitudes, [[issue involvement]], perceived response efficacy, perceived risk, and perceived [[self-efficacy]]); (b) social influence (community, [[reference group]] and family norms, expectations from family and friends, and social visibility of behavior); and (c) individual norms obtained from personal history. The study yielded two distinctive subgroups, despite their demographic similarities (White and middle [[socioeconomic status]]). The group with moderate level of good diets and physical activity and low [[tobacco]] consumption was more likely to seek health information and believed that cardiovascular disease was preventable by changing their health behavior. On the other hand, the group with poor diets, high level of [[alcohol]] and tobacco consumption and high perception of susceptibility to cardiovascular disease did not plan to mitigate those risks and refrained from seeking health information.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The disparities between these two segments were crucial for health communicators to design and tailor different messages to influence their [[health behavior]]s.

Rimal, Brown, Mkandawire, Folda, Bose and Creel identified risk perceptions and [[efficacy]] beliefs as the main audience segmentation criteria for the HIV-prevention project in [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R.N., Brown, J., Mkandawire, G., Folda, L., Bose, K. &amp; Creel, A.H. (2009). Audience segmentation as a social-marketing tool in health promotion: Use of the risk perception attitude framework in HIV Prevention in Malawi. American Journal of Public Health, 99 (12), 2224–2229.&lt;/ref&gt; Four subgroups created were responsive (high risk, high efficacy), avoidance (high risk, low efficacy), proactive (low risk, high efficacy) and indifference (low risk, low efficacy). The study found different levels of HIV knowledge, [[HIV testing]] and [[condom]] use among the four segments. Responsive and proactive groups were most responsive to preventive behaviors whereas avoidance and indifference groups were less inclined to practice preventive behaviors. Audience segmentation could be utilized in Malawi to target different segments with tailored messages in [[risk perception]]s and efficacy beliefs in order to influence them to adopt recommended HIV prevention behaviors.

[[Image:Bundschuhfahne Holzschnitt 1539 Petrarcas Trostspiegel.jpg|thumb|right|Rebellious peasants surrounding a knight. The ''Bundschuh'' ("tied shoe") emblem is displayed on their banner]]
The '''Bundschuh movement''' (German: ''Bundschuh-Bewegung'') refers to a series of localized [[peasant]] rebellions in southwestern [[Germany]] from 1493 to 1517. They were one of the causes of the [[German Peasants' War]] (1524–1526). The Bundschuh movement was not a [[Political movement|movement]] in the proper sense, but a number of loosely linked local conspiracies and planned uprisings. It was so called because of the peasant shoe (''Bundschuh'') the peasants displayed on their flag. Under this flag, peasants and city dwellers had defeated the troops of the French [[John IV, Count of Armagnac|count of Armagnac]] along the upper Rhine in 1439, 1443 and 1444.

Individual uprisings &amp;ndash; seeking relief from oppressive taxes, arbitrary justice systems, high debts, costly ecclesiastic privileges, [[serf]]dom, prohibitions on hunting and fishing, and the like &amp;ndash; occurred in 1476 in Niklashausen ([[Tauber]] valley), 1493 in Schlettstadt (now [[Sélestat]])/[[Alsace]] (for the first time under the Bundschuh banner), 1502 in [[Bruchsal]] and Untergrombach, 1513 in Lehen ([[Breisgau]]), and 1517 along the upper [[Rhine]].  Each of these was defeated very quickly, and the leaders, such as [[Joss Fritz|Joß Fritz]], were generally executed.

== ''Bundschuh'' ==
As a sign displayed on their flag the peasants chose the ''Bundschuh'' (= tied shoe), a shoe typical for peasants made of leather. It was to symbolise the joint rising and advance of the peasants against their lords. It also contrasted the boots born by [[Knight|knights]] with their [[Spur|spurs]].

'''Care2''' is a [[social network services|social networking]] website that was founded by Randy Paynter in 1998. The goal of the site is to connect activists from around the world with other individuals, organizations and responsible businesses making an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Lee | last = Roberts | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/business/businessspecial2/07sustain.html | title=Spreading Their Gospel on the Web | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | website=nytimes.com | date=March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Care2 members create an [[online identity]] by filling out a [[User profile|profile]] with personal information, as in most social networking sites, but Care2 also asks for more information about its members' personal lives and involvement in [[activism]]. The social interactions on Care2 revolve around groups that connect people who care about similar political and environmental issues. Members also often participate in [[internet petitions]] and news articles posted by others.

==History==
Care2 has been used throughout the years to combat, through petitions, political, environmental and civil rights issues. Recently, Care2 was used by [[Broadway theatre]] playwrights and actors to petition Indiana's [[Indiana SB 101|Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Mark | last = Kennedy | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/broadway-takes-aim-contested-indiana-law-petition-30086493 | title=Broadway Takes Aim at Contested Indiana Law With a Petition | publisher=[[ABC News]] | website=abcnews.go.com| date=Apr 2, 2015|accessdate=Apr 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care2 is regularly used to promote Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care2.com/news/member/124335883/3899433 | title=Reviewing Trashy Hasbara Against BDS| date=Aug 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christina Gyllenstierna relief 2009 West Aros (crop).jpg|thumb|Kristina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna (1494–1559), 16th century sculpture by the altar of [[Västerås Cathedral]].]]
'''Christina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna''' of '''Fogelvik''' (Swedish: ''Kristina'' or ''Kerstin'': 1494 &amp;ndash; January 1559, [[Hörningsholm Castle]]) was a Swedish noble and a heroine. She was married to the [[Sweden|Swedish]] regent [[Sten Sture the Younger]], and famously led the Swedish resistance against [[Christian II of Denmark]] after the death of her spouse. In her own lifetime she was simply referred to as ''Fru Kristina'' ('Lady Christina'), but she has become known in history as "Kristina '''Gyllenstierna'''" because of the house of [[nobility]] to which she belonged.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"&gt;Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi över Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Christina Gyllenstierna was born to ''[[riksråd]]'' Nils Eriksson (Gyllenstierna), Lord of Tullgarn (also written with the Danish spelling Niels Eriksen, and surnamed "Gyllenstjerna" by later historians) and [[Sigrid Eskilsdotter (Banér)]] of Venngarn, Heir of Lindholm. She was a great-granddaughter of King [[Charles VIII of Sweden]] through her paternal grandmother princess Christina Karlsdotter Bonde (1432-1493/1500), heir of Fogelvik, after whom she was named. Her grandfather Erik Eriksen of Demstrup ("Gyldenstjerne") originated from Denmark, but during the power struggle between Denmark and Sweden, two formally united parts of the [[Kalmar Union]], he allied with the Swedish claimant, Charles VIII, who made him his son-in-law and High Steward of Charles' court. By the second marriage of her mother, Christina became the half-sister of [[Cecilia Månsdotter]] of Eka and thereby the maternal aunt of the future king [[Gustav I]].

Christina was first engaged to Nils Gädda (d. 1508), governor of Kalmar and Lycka, but the marriage never took place due to his death. On 16 November 1511 in Stockholm, she married the son of the Swedish regent [[Svante Nilsson (regent of Sweden)|Svante]] and the nephew of her former betrothed, [[Sten Sture the Younger]]. She had five children during her marriage: Nils (1516-1528), Iliana (1514), Magdalena (1516-1521), [[Svante Stensson Sture]] (1517-1567) and Anna (1518), and Gustav (1520-1520).

===Reign of Sten Sture===
In 1512, Sten Sture succeeded his father as elected regent of Sweden upon his death. During this period, Denmark, Norway and Sweden were formally part of the [[Kalmar Union]] through a personal union under the king of Denmark, but in reality, Sweden had been a [[de facto]] independent kingdom under "Regents" (Sw. ''riksföreståndare'') native high nobles elected to rule the country.

Sten Sture's election as regent was not without opposition. At the death of his father, Sten was 18 years old, and High Councillor [[Eric Trolle]], who supported the union with Denmark, was initially chosen as regent by the council. However, Sten utilized the castles and troops granted to him by his late father and took power in a coup: after having promised to continue negotiations with Denmark, the High Council accepted him as regent instead of Trolle. 
In reality, lord Sten's purpose was to keep Sweden independent of Denmark. He took the Sture name, heritage from his great-grandmother, because it symbolized independence of Sweden as a reminder of [[Sten Sture the Elder]], his father's third cousin.

Regent Sten had already in 1504 been proposed as a candidate in the election of a new king of Sweden as a replacement for [[John, King of Denmark]], who had been elected king of Sweden in 1497 but who was ousted from there in 1502. Upon the death of John in 1513, it was again proposed to elect regent Sten as king of Sweden rather than the son of John, [[Christian II of Denmark]], and Sten was making preparations to arrange an election, including seeking support for it from the pope.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"&gt;Kristina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna, urn:sbl:13412, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art. by Hans Gillingstam), hämtad 2015-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered likely that Christina participated in state affairs and acted as the political adviser to her spouse, given her later role. In reality, Sten and Christina already functioned as king and queen of Sweden: by 1519, Peder Månsson, Bishop of Västerås, expressed his surprise in a letter from Rome to Abbess [[Anna Germundsdotter]] of [[Vadstena Abbey]] that Sten had not yet been crowned,&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; and in the contemporary Stockholm chronicle, Christina is referred to as "Our Gracious Princess."&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;
By their ambitions, they became the natural enemies of king Christian II of Denmark, whose ambition it was to be elected king of Sweden and thereby again make Sweden a part of the Kalmar union in practice and not only in name.

Sten became involved in a conflict with archbishop [[Gustav Trolle]], son of his previous rival [[Eric Trolle]]. The archbishop claimed more autonomy for the church. In 1516, Sten besieged Staket, the fortress of archbishop Trolle, and when Staket was taken the following year, Sten had the fortress dismantled, Trolle taken captive, imprisoned and deposed as archbishop. The deposition of an archbishop resulted in the [[excommunication]] of Sten Sture by the pope, who gave Christian II support in his designs against Sten Sture. On the New Year of 1520, Christian II invaded Sweden.

===Defender of Stockholm===
On 19 January 1520, Regent Sten was mortally wounded at the [[battle of Bogesund]].

Lady Christina emerged as the leader of the Sture party and defender of her son's rights, took command of the city and Castle of Stockholm in the name of her underage sons, secured support from the majority of the peasantry and burgher classes, and received the loyalty from the commanders of the most important fortresses of the realm: Västerås Castle, Nyköping Castle, Kalmar Castle as well as the province of Finland.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; However, she did not manage to secure enough support from the nobility: "Some stated their will to fight for the children of Lord Sten, while one party gave a stern now to Lady Christina the widow of Lord Sten, with the city of Stockholm and those of her followers, and often wrote to them that they should unite and resist the enemy, although such letters were not considered."&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; On 6 March 1520, several members of the [[Privy Council of Sweden]] submitted to Christian II, electing him king of Sweden in Uppsala. 
The peasantry of central Sweden roused by her patriotism, flew to arms and defeated the Danish invaders at Balundsås on March 19, and were only with the utmost difficulty finally defeated at the bloody battle of [[Uppsala]], on 6 April.

In late May, the Danish fleet arrived and the city of Stockholm was besieged by land and sea by the Danes under Christian II. Shortly before, Christina managed to send her eldest son, the seven year old [[Nils Stensson Sture]] to safety in Danzig in Poland with an envoy headed by the chancellor of the Sture family, Peder Jakobsson (Sunnanväder),&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; to issue negotiations with [[Sigismund I the Old]] and the [[Hanseatic League]] for support against Denmark. In her embassy to Danzig, she stated that she governed the realm until her sons had reached the age of majority and could take over the regency.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; She had the support from the burghers of Stockholm, who referred to her as their Princess.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; 
Lady Christina took command and held out stoutly at [[Stockholm]], while the second stronghold of Sweden, [[Kalmar]], was commanded and defended and by the widow of its governor, [[Anna Eriksdotter (Bielke)]], in the same fashion.

On 7 September 1520, after four months of siege, Christina was persuaded to capitulate in exchange for a letter of amnesty. In the letter of amnesty issued by Christian II, an amnesty of the most explicit and absolute character was extracted for Christina herself, her dead spouse and all their followers for all acts of resistance against Christian II himself, his father king John and his grandfather Christian II before him, regardless of all acts against bishop Trolle.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; Personally, Christina were granted [[Häme Castle]] and county, Kuhmo state in Finland, Hörningsholm Castle in Södermanland and Eksjö estate in Småland.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

===Stockholm Bloodbath===
On November 1, Christian II was proclaimed king Christian I of Sweden, followed by his coronation in [[Storkyrkan]] by the reinstated arch bishop [[Gustav Trolle]] on 4 September. The coronation was followed by three days of festivities attended by the Swedish nobility, during which he danced with Christina on a ball.

On 7 November, king Christian summoned the Swedish nobility to a meeting in the throne hall at Stockholm Castle. When the meeting was opened, the doors were closed and guarded, and archbishop Trolle accused her, her mother, her late spouse and the followers of Sture for his deposition and demanded compensation and punishment.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;
Lady Christina stepped forward and pointed out the fact that the deposition of bishop Trolle had been a decision taken by a united parliament: everyone had signed the bill of deposition, placing the responsibility on the entire realm and making it impossible to accuse and punish a particular individual for the act.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; Further more, the amnesty granted by the king as a term for her surrender made it impossible for the king to punish them for their actions against him and his followers.
She stated that there was proof as the protocol from the meeting of 1517, when the removal of Trolle was decided upon, was there: the document with signatures was then presented to the king.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; Because of the amnesty, the Swedes now considered the matter solved. However, Christian had found a loophole, which the Swedes had overlooked. Previously advised by [[Didrik Slagheck]] and [[Jens Andersen Beldenak]] not to keep his word to heretics, he stated that the deposition of an archbishop was a crime against the church, and that a monarch had no jurisdiction to pardon anyone for [[heresy]]. In effect, this meant that the king could in fact execute the participators in the rebellion against him despite the amnesty, by having them judged by the church for heresy rather than accused of treason by a secular court.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Lars-Olof (2003). Kalmarunionens tid. Stockholm: Prisma. {{ISBN|91-518-4217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the infamous [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] upon the followers of Sten Sture.

Christina's brothers Erik Nilsson, Lord of Tullgarn and Eskil Nilsson, her maternal uncle and her brother-in-law was executed by beheading, as were many other Swedish Sture party followers. Her husband's remains were exhumed and burned publicly at the stake as a heretic, as was those of her youngest son Gustav. Her mother Sigrid became the only woman sentenced to be executed: she was sentenced to be drowned, but avoided execution by ceding her property to the king. Christina herself was not executed. King Christian called upon her and asked her to choose which method of execution she preferred and asked her to choose between being burned at the stake or being buried alive. Confronted with this choice, she was unable to reply and fainted with horror. Christian was advised to spare her life and none of these alternatives were carried out. To save her life, she ceded a large part of her property to Christian. 
The king stated that she "is now dead to the world, for she is judged as the others for heresy".&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt;

However, Danish rule in Sweden was threatened by her nephew [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]], who soon became the leader of the [[Swedish War of Liberation]]. In the spring of 1521, Christina and her half-sister Cecilia (Gustav's mother) was forced to write to Gustav Vasa in an attempt to persuade him to surrender to Denmark.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

===Denmark===
Christina was held captive at [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Stockholm Castle]] until August 1521,&lt;ref&gt;Ohlmarks, Åke (1973). Alla Sveriges drottningar, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell Förlag, Stockholm. {{ISBN|91-20-04795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which her children, mother and finally herself was transferred to the infamous ''[[Blåtårn]]'' ("Blue Tower") of [[Christiansborg Palace|Copenhagen Castle]] along with a large number of other women and children related to the executed of the Stockholm Bloodbath, among them her half sister Cecilia and nieces Emerentia and [[Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa|Margareta]]. Christina herself and her daughters joined them there in September.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

In the chronicle of [[Per Brahe the Elder]], the captivity of the Swedish noblewomen in Denmark were described: "They were much deprived of food and drink [...]. Hardly given enough each day to keep their lives but they worked to be fed":&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; king Gustav I of Sweden used their treatment in captivity in his propaganda against Christian II and claimed that the Danish monarch starved the women and children who only survived by the mercy showed them by the queen of Denmark, [[Isabella of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; Whatever the truth of this, it is confirmed that many of the imprisoned women and children died, among them Christina's daughter Magdalena, half sister Cecilia and niece Emerentia, though the cause of death are given as the plague, at that point used to classify a number of different illnesses.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; However, one source claims that Christina, in contrast to the other hostages, were not kept prisoner at Blue Tower but in [[Kalundborg]], where she is confirmed to have been at least when the Swedish king later negotiated for her release.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

After about two years imprisonment, the political situation changed. In January 1523 Christian II was deposed by [[Frederick I of Denmark]] and Christina's nephew [[Gustav I of Sweden]] took Stockholm from the Danes as the leader of the [[Swedish War of Liberation]] and was elected king of an independent kingdom of Sweden. In the summer of 1523, king Gustav applied for her release to Frederick I through the Hanseatic League. At that point, Christina reconciled with bishop [[Gustav Trolle]] in [[Roskilde]].&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

===Power struggle with Gustav I===
[[File:Kristina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna (ur Svenska Familj-Journalen).png|thumb|A 19th-century drawing of Gyllenstierna, known from a popular Swedish magazine published around 1880, though not an authenticated likeness of her]]

In January 1524 Frederick I of Denmark agreed to release the Swedish noblewomen imprisoned at Blue Tower. Christina Gyllenstierna was released and is confirmed to have been in Sweden 28 January the same year: she returned in the company of her mother and her eldest son Nils, while her younger son Svante remained in Denmark to finish his education.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; On a meeting in [[Linköping]], she reconciled with her former political advisory, bishop [[Hans Brask]].&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

In summer 1524, King Gustav was informed by the mayor of Rostock and the Danish council that Christina planned to marry [[Søren Norby]], Grand Admiral of Denmark and a follower of the deposed Danish king Christian II, in exchange for Norby using his fleet and military knowledge to help her conquer the Swedish throne for her son.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; These plans were regarded as a threat both by the new Danish monarch, Frederick I, as well as by king Gustav, and Gustav suspected that she had been led to believe that "she and her children would com to govern the realm" by the help of such a marriage, and that "Lady Christina and her party and followers who attempts to reward, with such evil plots and treason, all the kindness and good acts that we have [...] shown them."&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt;

In March, the first of the [[Dalecarlian rebellions]] took place organized by Knut Mickelsson and Christina's former chancellor Peder Jakobsson (Sunnanväder), who glorified the reign of the Sture family in contrast to that of Gustav Vasa.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; The rebels reportedly contacted Søren Norby, who was the same month promised by Christian II to be his governor in Sweden should he deposed king Gustav. In April, Norby was rumored to be on his way to Blekinge with a fleet, after which he launched attacks with his fleet from his base in Gotland.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; King Gustav sent [[Berend von Melen]], married to his relative [[Margareta von Melen|Margareta]] and governor of [[Kalmar Castle]], to fight Norby. However, von Melen broke his loyalty to the king and allied with Søren Norby, a treason for which the king blamed his relative Margareta von Melen.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; Shortly after, Christina sent her son Nils to von Melen at Kalmar Castle,&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; and it was evidently believed, that von Melen would help Nils to unite with Norby.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; It was speculated abroad, that Søren Norby and Berend von Melen would conquer Sweden together as they were "through their wives highly connected" in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; 
At this point, the von Melen couple left for Germany, leaving Nils and a garrison in Kalmar, which was sieged by the troops of Gustav I, while Christina herself seems to have been placed in arrest. In May, the Dalecarlian rebels reproached King Gustav for having imprisoned Christina and having driven her son Nils out of the country&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; and demanded the freedom of Christina.&lt;ref&gt;Daluppror i Nordisk familjebok (andra upplagan, 1906)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 20 July 1525, however, the rebellion was crushed when Nils, the son of Christina, was taken prisoner by king Gustav after his victory at the Siege of Kalmar.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; 
When Norby negotiated to submit his loyalty to the new king of Denmark, Frederick I, one of his demands were to secure help from Frederick I to secure Christina's release from the prison of Gustav.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;

In November 1525, Christina and king Gustav I was reconciled in a meeting in [[Vadstena]], were Christina stated that she had never contemplated to marry Søren Norby and that the engagement gifts she sent him was merely gifts of gratitude because he had assisted her and her children from the captivity in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; In a letter from Vadstena on 29 December, she denied ever having contemplated a marriage with Søren Norby.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt; The same month, king Gustav I stated that Christina was to marry his cousin ''[[riksråd]]'' Johan Turesson Tre Rosor, Lord of Falun, riksråd and governor of [[Nyköping]] 
(149?-1556): they were officially engaged at Christmans 1526 and married at [[Lindholmen Castle, Västergötland]], in the summer of 1527. Her second marriage was likely arranged by the king to neutralize Christina politically, as which she would no longer have the prestige of being "The widow of Sten Sture" and leader of the Sture party, but the wife of a loyal relative of the king.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; From her second marriage, she had a son, Gustaf Johansson. [[Eric XIV of Sweden|Eric XIV]] made Svante Count of Vestervik and Stegeholm, and at the same time made Gustaf Count of Enköping (later changed to county of Bogesund).

In the official chronicle of the king, the elder son of Christina, Nils, is claimed to have died the year of his mother's remarriage. In 1527, however, the second of the [[Dalecarlian Rebellions]] broke out in opposition to Gustav's introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]] to Sweden, and the leader of the rebellion was the so-called ''Daljunkern'' ('The youngster from Dalarna'), who claimed to be [[Nils Stensson Sture|Nils Sture]], the 15-year-old elder son of Christina. Modern research indicate that ''Daljunkern'' was indeed Nils, the son of Christina.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Lars-Olof (2002). Gustav Vasa – landsfader eller tyrann?. Stockholm: Prisma. {{ISBN|91-518-3904-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gustav defeated the rebels, and Daljunkern fled to [[Norway]] and then [[Germany]], where he was arrested in [[Rostock]]. In August 1528, king Gustav had Christina issue an official statement that Daljunkern was not her son.&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;
In order to have the Daljunkern executed, Gustav I had Christina write a statement in which she stated that of all the sons she had with regent Sten, the only son alive was Svante.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna, urn:sbl:13412, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hans Gillingstam), hämtad 2015-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved documents show that the first version of Christina's letter was written carefully and only asked the authorities in Rostock to send the person claiming to be Nils to Sweden for questioning: in the final version of the letter, which was eventually sent, however, she called him a thief and impostor and demanded that he be executed on the spot.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; It is considered likely that she wrote the letter under pressure.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt;

===Later life===
The relationship between Christina and king Gustav was described as somewhat tense. After the death of her mother in 1527, Christina and Gustav came to be involved in a conflict over her inheritance after her mother, which was not solved until 1550.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; 
During the [[Westrogothian rebellion]] in 1529, Christina was given the task by the king to negotiate with her rebellious brother-in-law Jöran Turesson (Tre Rosor).&lt;ref name="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon"/&gt;
During the [[Dacke War]], the king ordered her that she should prevent any rebels who reached [[Nyköping]] to acquire supplies and imprison them.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt;

Her second son Svante was, according to tradition, engaged to her relative [[Margaret Leijonhufvud]], who however was arranged to marry the king in 1536. After the marriage of Margaret to the king Christina, as the other relatives of the new queen, were granted some privileges such as the right to some of the money from the fines paid to the crown.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; It is noted that she evidently attended court during the tenure of Margaret as queen, as she, alongside Margaret's mother [[Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa]], is often listed to have occupied the best rooms next to the queen, but whether she was ever given a court office is unknown.&lt;ref name="Tegenborg Falkdalen"/&gt; It is confirmed that she was briefly made responsible for the court of the royal children between the death of queen Margaret in 1551 and the king's marriage to queen [[Katarina Stenbock]] in 1552. Christina died in January 1559 at [[Hörningsholm Castle]].

'''Control system security''' is the prevention of intentional or unintentional interference with the proper operation of [[automation|industrial automation]] and [[industrial control systems|control systems]]. These control systems manage essential services including electricity, petroleum production, water, transportation, manufacturing, and communications. They rely on computers, networks, operating systems, applications, and [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]], each of which could contain [[vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]]. The 2010 discovery of the [[Stuxnet|Stuxnet worm]] demonstrated the vulnerability of these systems to cyber incidents.&lt;ref name="tofinoexida201202"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exida.com/index.php/News/new_whitepaper_the_7_steps_to_ics_and_scada_security/ | title=The 7 Steps to ICS Security | accessdate=March 3, 2011 | author1=Byres, Eric | author2=Cusimano, John | date=February 2012 | publisher=Tofino Security and exida Consulting LLC | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123141949/http://www.exida.com/index.php/News/new_whitepaper_the_7_steps_to_ics_and_scada_security/ | archivedate=January 23, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and other governments have passed [[cyber-security regulation]]s requiring enhanced  protection for control systems operating critical infrastructure.

Control system security is known by several other names such as ''[[SCADA]] security'', ''PCN security'', ''industrial [[network security]]'', and ''control system cyber security''.

== Risks ==
Insecurity of, or vulnerabilities inherent in industrial automation and control systems (IACS) can lead to severe consequences in categories such as safety, loss of life, personal injury, environmental impact, lost production, equipment damage, information theft, and company image.
Guidance to assess, evaluate and mitigate these potential risks is provided through the application of many Governmental, regulatory, industry documents and Global Standards, addressed below.

== Vulnerability of control systems ==
Industrial automation and control systems have become far more vulnerable to security incidents due to the following trends that have occurred over the last 10 to 15 years.  
* Heavy use of Commercial Off-the Shelf Technology (COTS) and protocols.  Integration of technology such as MS Windows, SQL, and Ethernet means that process control systems are now vulnerable to the same viruses, worms and trojans that affect IT systems 
* Enterprise integration (using plant, corporate and even public networks) means that process control systems (legacy) are now being subjected to stresses they were not designed for
* Demand for Remote Access - 24/7 access for engineering, operations or technical support means more insecure or rogue connections to control system
* Public Information - Manuals on how to use control system are publicly available to would be attackers as well as to legitimate users

The cyber threats and attack strategies on automation systems are changing rapidly.  Fortunately, regulation of control system security is rare as regulation is a slow moving process. The United States, for example, only does so for the [[nuclear power in the United States|nuclear power]] and the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]].&lt;ref name="gross201104"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104|title=A Declaration of Cyber-War|author=Gross, Michael Joseph|first=|date=2011-04-01|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Condé Nast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713082739/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104|archivedate=2017-11-29|accessdate=2017-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government efforts ==
The U.S. Government [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]] (US-CERT) originally instituted a [[control systems security program]] (CSSP) now the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Industrial Control Systems, which has made available a large set of free National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards documents regarding control system security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/csstandards.html|title=Standards and References - NCCIC / ICS-CERT|website=ics-cert.us-cert.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automation &amp; control system security standards ==

===ISA/IEC-62443 (Formerly ISA-99)===
ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and control systems.

These documents were originally referred to as '''ANSI/ISA-99''' or '''ISA99''' standards, as they were created by the [[International Society of Automation|International Society for Automation (ISA)]] 99 committee, accredited by and publicly released as [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the '''ANSI/ISA-62443''' series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the corresponding [[International Electrotechnical Commission|International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)]] standards.

All ISA work products are now numbered using the convention “ISA-62443-x-y” and previous ISA99 nomenclature is maintained for continuity purposes only. 

ISA99 remains the name of the Industrial Automation and Control System Security Committee of the ISA. Since 2002, the committee has been developing a multi-part series of standards and technical reports on the subject of IACS security. These work products are then submitted to the ISA approval and then publishing under ANSI. They are also submitted to IEC for consideration as standards and specifications in the IEC 62443 series following the IEC standards development process.

[[File:ISA-62443_Standard_Series_2012.png|thumb|right|alt=The numbering and organization of ISA62443 work products into categories.|Planned and published ISA62443 work products for IACS Security.]] All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories called ''General'', ''Policies and Procedures'', ''System'' and ''Component''.&lt;ref&gt;More information about the activities and plans of the ISA99 committee is available on the committee Wiki site ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110402180044/http://isa99.isa.org/ISA99%20Wiki/Home.aspx])&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts, models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and security life cycles for IACS.
# The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.
# The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model.
# The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the procurement of secure products.

=== IEC-62443 ===
The IEC-62443 cybersecurity standards are the result of the IEC standards creation process where ANSI/ISA-62443 proposals are submitted to country committees where review is done and comments regarding changes are submitted.  The comments are reviewed by various IEC 62443 committees where comments are discussed and changes are made as agreed upon. Many members of the IEC committees are the same persons from the ISA S99 committees.  To date, the fundamental concepts from the original ANSI/ISA 62443 documents have been utilized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7033|title=Standards and References - IEC-62443|website=www.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;


These standards are being used by practitioners in several industries to design and evaluate automation systems for cybersecurity resilience. Several of the standards are being used in personnel, engineering process, product, and system cybersecurity certification programs (also called conformity assessment programs).  

Certifications are awarded by accredited Certification Bodies (CB) who operate following ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies.  ABs are typically members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.

== Control system security certification ==

=== The ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) Conformity Assessment Program  ===
ISCI created the first conformity assessment scheme (commonly known as a certification scheme) for the ISA S99 IACS cybersecurity standards. This program certifies Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) IACS products and systems, addressing securing the IACS supply chain. 
exida from the United States was the first organization accredited for the ISCI scheme by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) followed by the Control Systems Security Center – Certification Laboratory (CSSC-CL) accredited by the Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) and TÜV Rheinland accredited by Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS).  All of these AB organizations are members of the IAF.

==== ISCI Certification Offerings====
Two COTS product certifications are available under the ISASecure® brand: ISASecure-EDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certifying IACS products to the 62443-4-1 / 62443-4-2 IACS cybersecurity standards and ISASecure-SSA (System Security Assurance), certifying IACS systems to the same standards.

A third certification, SDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) is available from ISCI which certifies IACS development organizations to the 62443-4-1 cybersecurity standard, providing assurances that a supplier organization has institutionalized cybersecurity into their product development practices.

====ISO 17065 and Global Accreditation====
The ISASecure 62443 conformity assessment scheme is an ISO 17065 program whose labs (certification bodies or CB) are independently accredited by ANSI/ANAB, JAB and other global ISO 17011 accreditation bodies (AB).  The certification labs must also meet ISO 17025 lab accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of certification requirements and recognized tools.

Through Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) with IAF, ILAC and others, the accreditation of the ISASecure labs by the ISA 17011 accreditation bodies ensures that certificates issued by any of the ISASecure labs are globally recognized.

====Test Tool Recognition====
The ISASecure scheme includes a process for recognizing test tools to ensure the tools meet functional requirements necessary and sufficient to execute all required product tests and that test results will be consistent among the recognized tools.

====Chemicals, Oil and Gas Industries====
ISCI development processes include maintenance policies to ensure that the ISASecure certifications remain in alignment with the IEC 62443 standards as they evolve. While the IEC 62443 standards are designed to horizontally address technical cybersecurity requirements of a cross-section of industries, the ISASecure scheme’s certification requirements working groups include subject matter experts from the chemical and oil and gas industries and are reflective of their cybersecurity needs.

=== IEC 62443 Certification Programs===
IEC 62443 certification schemes have also been established by several global Certification Bodies.  Each has defined their own scheme based upon the referenced standards and procedures.  Programs are being offered globally by several recognized CBs including exida, TÜV Rheinland, TÜV Sud, TÜV Nord, and SGS-TÜV Saar.

The '''Council on Education for Public Health''' ('''CEPH''') is an independent agency recognized by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to accredit [[schools of public health]] and public health programs offered in settings other than schools of public health. These schools and programs prepare students for entry into careers in public health. The primary professional degree is the [[Master of Public Health]] (M.P.H.) but other master's and doctoral degrees are offered as well such as the [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH).

The Council is a private, nonprofit corporation directed by a 10-member board. As an independent body, the board is solely responsible for adopting criteria by which schools and programs are evaluated, for establishing policies and procedures, for making accreditation decisions and for managing the business of the corporation.

The '''Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska narodna stranka – Liberalni demokrati}} or '''HNS – LD''') is a [[liberalism in Croatia|liberal]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="expat"/&gt; [[list of political parties in Croatia|political party]] in [[Croatia]].

As of April 2015 HNS forms a parliamentary club with 5 members in the [[Croatian Parliament]], making them the fourth largest party in Croatia in terms of parliament representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=5160|title=Hrvatski sabor - Klub zastupnika Hrvatske narodne stranke - liberalnih demokrata|website=www.sabor.hr|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; HNS is an observing member of the [[Liberal International]] and a full member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]]. Since 17 December 2017 the party's leader is [[Ivan Vrdoljak]].

==Origins==
The [[People's Party (Kingdom of Croatia)|People's Party in Croatia]] was originally formed in 1841, during the period of Croatian [[romantic nationalism]]. The Croatian People's Party describes the events of the [[Illyrian movement]] since 1835 as its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hns.hr/index.php/dokumenti/povijest-hns-a/povijest-21-stoljece-3?start=12 | title = Povijest - 19 stoljeće |trans-title=History - 19th century | work = hns.hr | publisher = Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats | language = Croatian | accessdate = 2015-01-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150104023232/http://www.hns.hr/index.php/dokumenti/povijest-hns-a/povijest-21-stoljece-3?start=12 | archivedate = 2015-01-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2014}}. After 1861 the People's Party was known as the People's Liberal Party, its main splinter party was the Independent People's Party (1880–1903) which became more pro-autonomist, while the "old" People's Party developed into "party of the [[Croatian-Hungarian Settlement|Settlement]]" having collaborated with the pro-Hungarian [[Croatian-Hungarian Party|Unionist Party]] (known as the [[Croatian-Hungarian Party|People's Constitutional Party]]). The Progressive Party (1904–1906) and the Croatian People's Progressive Party (1906–1910) were also liberal parties in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] as an autonomous part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

In 1860 the national liberals formed in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]] (Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) the [[People's Party (Dalmatia)|National party]] known also as the [[People's Party (Dalmatia)|People's Party in Dalmatia]]. The party developed into a conservative party around 1889 (the National Croatian Party).

In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|first Yugoslavia]] (1918–1941), main liberal party was the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]] composed by the Serbs from former Austro-Hungarian parts of the new state and Slovene centralist liberals. 

During [[Communism]] in the [[SFRY|second Yugoslavia]] (the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], SRH), the liberal leaders of the [[League of Communists of Croatia]] were [[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]] and [[Miko Tripalo]], who participated in the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1971.

==Modern party==
The modern Croatian People's Party was formed in late 1990 by members of the [[Coalition of People's Accord]] ({{lang-hr|Koalicija narodnog sporazuma}}) which had participated on the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first multi-party election of 1990]], led by Savka Dabčević-Kučar, Miko Tripalo, [[Dragutin Haramija]] and others.

The HNS remained a small opposition party. In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 election]] they won 6.7% of the vote and attained 6 seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]]. In 1994, construction entrepreneur [[Radimir Čačić]] became party chairman. In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1995|1995 election]] they won 2 seats as part of an election alliance.

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|January 2000 election]] they formed a four-party coalition with [[Croatian Peasant Party|HSS]], [[Liberal Party (Croatia)|LS]] and [[Istrian Democratic Congress|IDS]], which together won 25 seats in the [[Croatian Parliament|Parliament]], two of whom were HNS representatives. As a result, the party participated in the 2000–2003 government of [[Ivica Račan]] through the minister of public works, construction and reconstruction Radimir Čačić. A few weeks later, the coalition's candidate and HNS member [[Stjepan Mesić]] was [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|elected]] [[President of the Republic of Croatia|President of the Republic]].

Also in 2000, HNS elected a new party chair, [[Zagreb University]] professor of [[sociology of politics]] [[Vesna Pusić]].

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|November 2003 elections]], their alliance with the [[Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar]] and the [[Slavonia-Baranja Croatian Party]] won 8% of the vote and 11 out of 151 seats, 10 of them HNS representatives. However, despite significantly improved results, the party moved to the opposition.

A second element of today's People's Party, the [[Party of Liberal Democrats]] or Libra, originated in time of the Račan government when in 2002 [[Dražen Budiša]], the leader of the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS), pulled out of the coalition. Ten members of parliament from Budiša's party, led by [[Jozo Radoš]], refused to bring down the government and instead split from the HSLS, forming Libra, the Party of Liberal Democrats. That party won 3 seats in the 2003 election. On 6 February 2005, most of the 1,250 representatives of HNS on its seventh convention voted to merge with Libra as the ''Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats''. The total number of parliamentary seats for the party increased to 13.

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|November 2007 elections]] the party ran on its own and got around 7% of the vote and 7 seats in the [[Croatian Sabor]]. It remained in the opposition. In April 2008 [[Radimir Čačić]] was elected as party chair after defeating [[Dragutin Lesar]] (MP). Lesar left the party, first acting as an independent MP, but then founded a splinter party, [[Croatian Labourists – Labour Party|Croatian Laburists]] in March 2010. Zlatko Horvat MP left the party as well.

In [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 elections]], HNS participated in centre-left ''[[Kukuriku coalition]]'' spearheaded by SDP. After the coalition won, HNS entered the [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović|cabinet]] and held posts of foreign relations, commerce, culture etc. Čačić was reelected as a party chairman again in March 2012. After he was sentenced to a prison term due to a traffic accident in which two people died, he resigned from the cabinet and was forced to leave the party. [[Vesna Pusić]] was elected as party president in 2013. On 21 September 2014 about 200 members from HNS [[Zagreb]] and [[Varaždin]] branches each left the party in order to form [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[centrism|centrist]] [[People's Party - Reformists]] under Radimir Čačić's leadership. 

HNS held the same alliance in the parliamentary elections of 2015 and 2016 as a part of SDP-led ''People's coalition'', switching to opposition. After the party chairman [[Ivan Vrdoljak]] and the party's general board decided to enter the government with centre-right [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and support [[Cabinet of Andrej Plenković|Andrej Plenkovic's cabinet]] in the [[Croatian Parliament|parliament]] (overriding the opposition of party's Presidency), in June 2017 four MPs and the only MEP ([[Jozo Radoš]]) left the party to create [[centre-left|left of the centre]] [[Civic Liberal Alliance]]. This splinter also resulted in numerous party members and branch leaders leaving the party, either to join Civic Liberal Alliance or other parties. In October 2018, MP Marija Puh left the party fraction in the parliament to join [[Bandić Milan 365 - Labour and Solidarity Party|Milan Bandic's party]], reducing the fraction further down to just 4 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.24sata.hr/news/bivsa-hns-ovka-prelazi-mikiju-sad-ce-imati-cak-10-zastupnika-595402|title=Bivša HNS-ovka prelazi Mikiju, sad će imati čak 10 zastupnika|access-date=2018-10-18|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born in [[Elgin, Illinois]], Meadows was educated in science, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[chemistry]] from [[Carleton College]] in 1963 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[biophysics]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1968. After a yearlong trip from England to Sri Lanka and back, she became a research fellow at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], as a member of a team in the department created by [[Jay Forrester]], the inventor of [[system dynamics]] as well as the principle of magnetic data storage for computers. She taught at [[Dartmouth College]] for 29 years, beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name = "meadows2008"&gt;Meadows, Donella H. 2008, ''Thinking in Systems: A Primer'', Chelsea Green Publishing, Vermont, p. 213 (About the Author), {{ISBN|978-1-60358-055-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2001 of a bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/171610/limits-growth-book-launched-movement 'The Limits to Growth': A Book That Launched a Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meadows was honored both as a Pew Scholar in Conservation and Environment (1991) and as a [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellow]] (1994).&lt;ref name = "meadows2008" /&gt; She received the Walter C. Paine Science Education Award in 1990. Posthumously, she received the [[John H. Chafee]] Excellence in Environmental Affairs Award for 2001, presented by the [[Conservation Law Foundation]].

Meadows wrote "The Global Citizen,"&lt;ref name = "meadows2008" /&gt; a weekly column on world events from a systems point of view. Many of these columns were compiled and published as a book by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yE5PzCacXoC&amp;dq=global+citizen&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nP7JSAhIS&amp;sig=EutjsehkGNfPYVkpJzzLTGvwapk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cPxNSp_eCYXk7AOu4KyKBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 The Global Citizen Donella H. Meadows, 1991; 300 pp. Island Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is recognized as a formative influence on hundreds of other academic studies, government policy initiatives, and international agreements.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Meadows was a longtime member of the United States Association for the [[Club of Rome]], which instituted an award in her memory, the US Association for the Club of Rome Donella Meadows Award in Sustainable Global Actions. The award is given to an outstanding individual who has created actions in a global framework toward the sustainability goals Meadows expressed in her writings.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Work ==

=== ''The Limits to Growth'' ===
{{main article|The Limits to Growth}}

In 1972, she was on the MIT team that produced the global [[computer simulation|computer model]] "[[World3]]" for the [[Club of Rome]], providing the basis for ''The Limits to Growth.'' The book reported a study of long-term global trends in population, economics, and the environment. The book made headlines around the world and began a debate about the limits of [[Earth]]'s capacity to support human economic expansion—a debate that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"To Grow or not to Grow", Newsweek, March 13, 1972, pages 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Meadows was the book's lead author, and it had three coauthors: her husband [[Dennis Meadows]], [[Jørgen Randers]], and William W. Behrens III.

===The Balaton Group===
In 1982, Donella and Dennis Meadows created an international "network of networks" for leading researchers on resource use, environmental conservation, systems modeling, and sustainability. Since its foundation, the members have met at [[Lake Balaton]], Hungary, every autumn. While the formal name for the network was the International Network of Resource Information Centres (INRIC), it became more popularly known as the [[Balaton Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Balaton Group History |url=http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205175146/http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the location of its meetings.

=== Sustainability Institute and Related Organizations ===
Meadows founded the Sustainability Institute, which combined research in global systems with practical demonstrations of [[sustainable development|sustainable]] living, including the development of a [[cohousing]] (or [[ecovillage]]) and organic farm at [[Cobb Hill]] in [[Hartland, Vermont]]. In 2011, the Sustainability Institute, originally adjacent to Cobb Hill, was renamed the Donella Meadows Institute and moved to Norwich, Vermont. Additional organizations that sprang from the Sustainability Institute include Sustainable Food Lab, Climate Interactive, and Sustainability Leaders Network.

=== State of the Village report ===
In 1990, Meadows published the State of the Village report under the title, "Who lives in the 'Global Village'?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empowermentresources.com/info2/theglobalvillage.html Meadows, Donnella. (1990, May 31). "Who lives in the 'Global Village'?" ''The Global Citizen'']&lt;/ref&gt; which likened the world to a village of 1,000 people. Since then, "If the world were a village of 100 people", derived from her work but further reducing the numbers to those of a village of 100 people, has been published by others in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

=== Twelve leverage points ===
{{Main article|Twelve leverage points}}
Meadows published ''Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System'', one of her best-known essays, in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |title=Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System |date=1999 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |website=The Sustainability Institute |publisher= |last=Meadows |first=Donella |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008160618/http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the most and least effective types of interventions in a system (of any kind).

{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}
'''Election day''' or '''polling day''' is the day on which [[general election]]s are held. In many countries, general elections are always held on a Saturday or Sunday, to enable as many [[voter]]s as possible to participate; while in other countries elections are always held on a [[Week-day names|weekday]]. However, some countries, or regions within a country, which hold elections on a weekday declare election day a [[public holiday]]. Countries which permit [[absentee ballots]], early ballots or [[postal vote]]s to be cast by mail prior to the election avoiding the problem altogether by enabling voters to vote on a day that is more convenient to them.

An election day usually culminates in an '''election night''' when the results of the election are tallied and winners are announced.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Orr, ''Ritual and Rhythm in Electoral Systems: A Comparative Legal Account'' (2016), Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia''' (''Party for the Basque Revolution'') or '''EIA''' was a [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]/[[Spain|Spanish]] [[political party]] between 1977 and 1982.

==History==
The party was founded in April 1977 in [[Gallarta]] ([[Biscay]]) after the 7th general assembly of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. Its ideology was based on a blend of [[independence|"independentism"]] and [[socialism]] - originally, they tended to be rather [[Marxism-Leninism]], but subsequently moved towards [[Eurocommunism]]. 

EIA made a coalition with the [[Communist Movement of Euskadi|Basque section]] of the [[Communist Movement of Spain]] (''Movimiento Comunista de España''), creating a coalition named [[Euskadiko Ezkerra]]. They won a seat in the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies]], occupied by [[Francisco Letamendia]] (also known as "Ortzi") and another in the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]], occupied by [[Juan María Bandrés]]. It campaigned for the "no" in the [[Referendum on the Constitution, 1978|1978 referendum]] to approve the [[Spanish constitution]], but in favour of the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country|Basque Statute of Autonomy]] in the referendum held in 1979. EIA disappeared in 1982, when Euskadiko Ezkerra became a political party.

The '''Federation of International Bandy''' ('''FIB'''; {{lang-fr|Fédération internationale de bandy}}, {{lang-ru|Международная федерация хоккея с мячом}}, {{lang-sv|Internationella Bandyförbundet}}) is the international [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for the sport of [[bandy]], including the variant called [[rink bandy]].

==History==
Bandy as we know it today has been played since the later half of the 19th Century. Rules were set up in the 1890s by the [[National Bandy Association]] in [[England]] and by the corresponding body in [[Russia]]. The Ligue International de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 [[Rue de Provence]] in [[Paris]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/the-iihf.html IIHF and Paris] International Ice Hockey Federation. Retrieved on 2010-02-18&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when bandy and ice hockey were seen as variants of the same game. The founders of the federation were representatives from Belgium, France, Great Britain, Switzerland and Bohemia (now Czech republic). However, as [[ice hockey]] became an Olympic sport while bandy did not, bandy only survived in some of the Nordic countries and the Soviet Union. LIHG is now the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]].

In the 1940s, the Nordic countries [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] set up a joint rules committee. In the early 1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] decided to break out of its isolation in international sport and started a friendly exchange with the said Nordic countries.

The federation was formed on 12 February 1955 at [[Hotell Malmen]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Kronikorer/Claes-Gshistoriskahorna/FinsktiforstaVM-matchen/ Claes-G Bengtsson 23 januari 2010 - ''Finskt i första VM-matchen''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110150623/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Kronikorer/Claes-Gshistoriskahorna/FinsktiforstaVM-matchen/ |date=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by representatives from Finland, Norway, the Soviet Union and Sweden. The federation has had its base in Sweden since 1979. The present office is situated in [[Söderhamn]], headed by FIB Secretary General Bo Nyman. [[Boris Skrynnik]] is the FIB President.

When FIB was formed in 1955, it introduced the same rules for bandy all over the world. Especially in Russia and other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]], different rules had been used prior to this. [[Bandy World Championship]]s have been organized for men since 1957 and [[Women's Bandy World Championship|for women]] since 2004.

The federation was named the '''International Bandy Federation''' ('''IBF''') between 1957 and 2001. The current name was adopted at a request from the International Olympic Committee when the IOC made bandy a "recognized sport", since the acronym IBF at the time was already in use by the International Badminton Federation (in 2006, the International Badminton Federation changed names to [[Badminton World Federation]] and now uses the acronym BWF). In 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=18 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119112911/http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=18 |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIB is a member of [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations]] as well as [[SportAccord|Global Association of International Sports Federations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1049005/sportaccord-changes-name-to-global-association-of-international-sports-federations SportAccord changes name to Global Association of International Sports Federations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of bandy playing nations have grown considerably in the last decades. There were 27 national members of the federation as of 2017
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbandy.com/members.html Members]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.patinajesobrehielo.org.co/index.php/modalidades/speed-skating-news/item/48-colombia-jugar%25C3%25A1-bandy]&lt;/ref&gt; and Slovakia applied for membership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://www.bandypuls.se/sport/bandy/historiskt-bandyderby-avgjort-i-tjeckien-svenskar-i-vinnande-laget]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
In 2011, FIB formulated its purposes as being the following.

FIB vows to completely share the principles and articles of the [[Olympic Charter]] in its activities, including the policy with regard to anti-doping controls.

FIB wants to promote the development of the sports of bandy and [[rink bandy]] in the member countries and wants to carry on propaganda for the importance and advantages of these sports. FIB also works for bandy to become an Olympic sport.

FIB declares itself to be an "independent autonomic mainsports organization which mainly is governing bandy activities all over the world".

FIB leads and supervises bandy and rink bandy around the world. FIB also sees as its job to settle the rules for the games.

One national member association should be entrusted by FIB with arranging an official world championship. FIB means that at least four nations must participate for it to be worth an event.

FIB also wants to promote the introduction and the membership of new nations to the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=1|title=About FIB|publisher=FIB|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=22 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206193234/http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=1|archivedate=6 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules of the game==
The rules of bandy is set in the [[Bandy Playing Rules]]. It is overseen by the [[Rules and Referee Committee]].

==Cooperation with other sport governing bodies==
FIB has an agreement with the [[International Skating Union]] to use the same arenas. The cooperation between the two federations is increasing, since both have an interest in more indoor venues with large ice surfaces being built.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.kuzbassbandyclub.ru/mainnews/archive/3698 kuzbassbandyclub.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and years of admission==
The federation was founded by the national bandy associations in Finland, Norway, the Soviet Union and Sweden.

The Soviet membership was taken over by Russia in early 1992, following the dissolvement of the Soviet Union in December 1991. For two months, the former Soviet Union national bandy team appeared as [[Commonwealth of Independent States national bandy team|Commonwealth of Independent States]], but the CIS was never formally a member of the FIB.

===Former members===
{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} '''Soviet Union 1955–1991''': When the international federation was founded in 1955, the [[Soviet Union]] was one of its founding members. The Soviet national federation was called the [[Federation of bandy and field hockey USSR]] (Федерация хоккея с мячом и хоккея на траве СССР). The Soviet Union had a [[Soviet Union national bandy team|national bandy team for men]] and a [[Soviet Union women's national bandy team|national bandy team for women]]. When the Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991, the national team came to represent the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] for some months. In 1992, Russia took over its place in FIB.

{{flagicon|Germany}} '''West Germany/Germany 1990–1991''': Before the present German Bandy Association was founded in 2013, there had been an earlier, short-lived German federation, which was a member of FIB from January 1990 until March 1991, when it voluntarily choose to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bandy-bund.de/index.php?page=information|title= Information|language= German|publisher= Deutscher Bandy-Bund|date= 2013|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=6 |title=FIB History |publisher=Federation of International Bandy |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221225714/http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=6 |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its short life span, it still overlived the [[German reunification]] in October 1990.

[[File:BandyCountries2015.png|thumb|260px|A world map showing all the member countries before the defunct associations were taken from the membership list of FIB.]]
A number of national federations have been admitted as members during the years&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131016213857/http://www.worldbandy.com/members.asp?pageID=11 List of all members as of January 2012 with contact information], saved at web.archive.org, read 12 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but then for different reasons not survived, often because of a lack of interest in the sport in their countries. In early 2017, seven federations were removed from the member list of FIB and in the summer of 2018 one more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbandy.com/members.html Members] at FIB website, read on 12 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; These defunct national federations were:

==Continental federations==
The Asian countries in FIB have founded the [[Asian Bandy Federation]], which has its headquarters in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan. This helps organize the bandy competition at the [[Asian Winter Games]] and works to spread the knowledge of bandy in Asia.

{{Property law}}
In English and Irish law, a '''fee farm grant''' is a hybrid type of land ownership typical in cities and towns. The word ''fee'' is derived from [[fief]], meaning a [[feudalism|feudal]] landholding, and a fee farm grant is similar to a [[fee simple]] in the sense that it gives the grantee the right to hold a freehold estate, the only difference being the payment of an annual rent (farm being an archaic word for rent) and covenants, thus putting both parties in a landlord-tenant relationship.

==Types==
Fee farm grants fall into three categories:
* '''Feudal fee farm grants'''
The ban on [[subinfeudation]] in the fee simple did not apply to land granted after ''[[Quia Emptores]]'' to supporters of the Crown. These new estates (many of which were created after [[Plantations of Ireland|the 17th-century plantations]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR07000897 Minister McDowell publishes Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; were thus regularly divided into subtenures as fee farm grants.
* '''Conversion fee farm grants'''
Any [[perpetually renewable leases for life]] were converted into fee farm grants after the enactment of the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act 1849. This act also allowed any existing lessees for lives to convert their holding into a fee farm grant.
* '''Express fee farm grants'''
The [[Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment (Ireland) Act 1860|Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment (Ireland) Act 1860 (i.e. Deasy's Act)]] allowed for the creation of express fee farm grants.

==Reform==
In Ireland the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 (Section 12) does not allow the creation of any new fee farm grants, and where any such attempt is made a fee simple is automatically created instead. The act did not alter the status of any existing fee farm grants.

==Etymology==
* '''Fee''' – A right in law to the use of land; i.e. a [[fief]].
* '''Farm''' –  a fixed yearly amount of rent or other payment (from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''ferma'', ''firma'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68240?rskey=EMaLsK&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false# Oxford English Dictionary online ''farm''] accessed 10 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Grant''' – transfer of property by deed of conveyance.

'''Finnicization''' (also '''finnicisation''', '''fennicization''', '''fennicisation''') is the changing of one's personal names from other languages (usually [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) into [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. During the era of [[romantic nationalism|National Romanticism]] in [[Finland]], many people, especially [[Fennoman movement|Fennomans]], finnicized their previously Swedish family names.

Some of these people were descended from Finnish-speaking farmers, who had previously changed their Finnish names to Swedish ones after climbing society's ladder. This was an understandable stratagem, as official positions (and even many trades) were only open to those speaking Swedish, and a Finnish name would have been an impediment to success. 

A notable event in finnicization was the centenary, in 1906, 100 years after the birth of the philosopher and statesman [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]]. Author [[Johannes Linnankoski]] encouraged Finns to give up their Swedish names on 12 May, Snellman's birthday. During 1906 and 1907 about 70,000 Finns changed their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1990 Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus :: Snellmanin 100-vuotispäivä ja sukunimien suomalaistaminen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605130700/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1990 |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dominion-Provincial Conference.JPG|First Minister's conference delegation, 1927|right|500px|thumb]]
In [[Canada]], a '''First Ministers' conference''' is a meeting of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial]] [[premier (Canada)|premiers]] and the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].  These events are held at the call of the prime minister and, since 1950, have typically been held annually.  They are usually held in [[Ottawa]].

Though known as "First Ministers' conferences" only since the 1960s, they ultimately trace their origin to the initial [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] held in the mid-1860s at [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island|PEI]], then-capital of the British Province of Prince Edward Island.  After confederation, two conferences of provincial premiers were held, in 1887 and 1902, in which the federal government was not represented.

Altogether, 76 First Ministers' conferences have been held since the first was convened by Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] in 1906, at the request of the provinces.  Some important First Ministers' conferences were those leading up to the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]]s.  The failed Charlottetown Accord contained a provision that would have made annual First Ministers' conferences obligatory.

The conferences are important for a number of reasons.  A sizable portion of provincial funding (referred to as [[transfer payment]]s) comes from the federal government, the conferences are an opportunity for the premiers to lobby for more money.  Today it is common for the Premiers to meet beforehand to present a common front to the federal government. They are also important in that Canada's federal system leaves a fair amount of overlap between federal and provincial jurisdictions and most large initiatives require some provincial support.

The vast majority of the activity at a First Ministers' conference takes place behind closed doors.  A public statement is issued after the conference.

Formerly, the government leaders of the [[Canadian Arctic|territories]] were only occasionally invited to these conferences, depending on whether issues relevant to the north are being discussed. Today, these leaders normally attend the meetings. The national chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]] may also be invited to attend when issues relevant to [[First Nations]] communities are on the agenda; the group has lobbied for greater inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=4449 Support For The Assembly Of First Nations To Be Invited As An Equal Partner At The First Ministers' Conference On The Economy].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8609">A '''formula restaurant''' is a type of [[formula retail]] business. It is characterized as a restaurant regulated by contractual or other arrangements to standardize menus, ingredients, food preparation, interior and exterior design and/or uniforms. The term refers to the characteristics of the restaurant rather than its ownership, following a business model controlled by an overseeing corporation.  Most formula restaurants are [[chain store|chain restaurants]], though this does not have to be the case.

In legal definitions, there may be a minimum number of "substantially identical" restaurants for them to be considered formula restaurants. This number varies across jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="mccall"&gt;[http://www.mccall.id.us/uploads/committees/planning_zoning/20161004pzap.pdf McCall, ID proposal to amend restriction from "one or more" to "five"] (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sf_use"&gt;[http://sf-planning.org/chain-stores-formula-retail-use San Francisco retail use] (11 or more)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="porttownsend"&gt;[http://www.codepublishing.com/WA/PortTownsend/html/PortTownsend17/PortTownsend1754.html Port Townsend] (14 or more)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula retail==

Formula retail is a type of sales activity required by contractual or other arrangements to offer a standardized array of services and/or merchandise, trademark, interior or exterior design and/or uniforms.&lt;ref name="jaffrey_NH"&gt;[http://www.townofjaffrey.com/sites/jaffreynh/files/pages/summary_of_proposed_zoning_changes.pdf Town of Jaffrey Planning Board Proposed Zoning Changes Summary], Public Hearing January 22, 2018, Town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies to the restaurant industry where menus, ingredients and food preparation may be standardized according to the overseeing corporation's business model, intended to maximize marketing potential.

===Comparison with chain restaurants===

Although there is considerable [[financial]] overlap, "[[chain store|chain restaurant]]" refers to ownership or franchise while "formula restaurant" refers to the characteristics of the business. A formula restaurant doesn't need to belong to a chain but it generally does. Nevertheless, most codified municipal regulation relies on definitions of formula restaurant or formula retail (although non-codified restrictions will sometimes target "chains").

Some [[chain store|chain restaurants]] are not considered formula restaurants because the chain does not maintain a formulaic or monolithic character at different locations, or has few enough locations that they are substantially dissimilar to what is commonly considered to be a formula restaurant. In addition, the term "chain restaurants" generically describes a business arrangement, whereas formula restaurants describe the aesthetic characteristics and customer experience.

===Disguised formula restaurants===

In some cases, a chain may establish a set of formula restaurants but attempt to present each venue as unique. This is common with hotel chains, which rely on centralized meal planning and management, but want to avoid the appearance of their in-house dining facilities being formulaic. Generally, the local manager is encouraged to modify the corporate menu so as to present the appearance of a unique character, while still building the menu around a corporate model (e.g., several entrees based on frozen chicken breast in accordance with a corporate formula).&lt;ref name="cookiecutter"&gt;[https://www.hotelfandb.com/articles/39-building-a-successful-hotel-restaurant Building a Successful Hotel Restaurant], ''Hotel F&amp;B'', 4-Jul-2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrecipe"&gt;[https://www.hotelmanagement.net/food-beverage/first-hospitality-group-s-john-harkey-wants-hotels-to-cook-a-new-recipie First Hospitality Group's Justin Harkey wants hotels to create a new recipe], ''Hotel Management'' 13-Apr-2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Disguised formula restaurants may be recognized by marketing indicators: intense use of staged photographs on the menu, frequent use of marketing [[Marketing buzz|buzzwords]] (or [[Corporate jargon#Marketing speak|marketing terms]]) such as "add" listed under multiple menu items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gritsandgrids.com/2012/10/restaurant-menus-and-pictures-yes-or-no/ Restaurant menus and pictures: Yes or No?], gritsandgrids.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Cultural===

Concerns have been expressed that formula restaurants detract from the unique characteristics of cities and towns.&lt;ref name="ILSR-impact"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/impact-chain-stores-community/ The Impact of Chain Stores on Community], Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILSR-sanibel"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/rule/formula-business-restrictions/2323-2/ ILSR report on Sanibel, Florida business restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marketplace-gentrification"&gt;[https://www.marketplace.org/2014/12/05/business/how-do-chain-restaurants-embody-gentrification How do chain restaurants embody gentrification?] ''Marketplace'' 5-Dec-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of menus can mean fewer choices for consumers. Formula restaurants tend to be marketing centric or based on perception.

===Economic===

Formula restaurants can harm local independent businesses.&lt;ref name="ILSR-impact" /&gt;&lt;ref name="governing"&gt;[http://www.governing.com/columns/assessments/gov-gentrification-local-business-extinction.html Hyper gentrification and the Disappearance of Local Businesses], governing.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=October 2018}} Formula restaurants accelerate [[gentrification]] but deteriorate quality of life.&lt;ref name="governing" /&gt;{{how|date=October 2018}}

Formula restaurants often rely on an economic model that encourages the use of disposable tableware.&lt;ref name="dontbus"&gt;[http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html  www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  This can create a negative economy in waste&lt;ref name="dontbus" /&gt; and food distribution, in part to support the business model of the controlling corporation.

==Response and regulation==
===Informal restrictions===
* [[Ketchum, Idaho]] has traditionally restricted franchise restaurants through the zoning approval process. The city has no formal formula restaurant ordinances.
* Iceland has informal health restrictions that discourage some formula restaurants.&lt;ref name="iceland webcam"&gt;[https://www.bushostelreykjavik.com/last-mcdonalds-in-iceland/ webcam] of "the last McDonald's in Iceland"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal restrictions===
* [[Malibu, California]] compiled a list of municipalities that restrict formula retail.&lt;ref name="malibu"&gt;[https://www.malibucity.org/DocumentCenter/View/4882/PC130729_Item-6D_Correspondence_DWaite2 Analysis of Cities with Formula Business Ordinances], Malibu (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bermuda has banned all franchised restaurants in the country (Prohibited Restaurant Act of 1997).&lt;ref name="dailymeal-mcd"&gt;[https://www.thedailymeal.com/travel/10-countries-banned-mcdonalds-slideshow (dailymeal slideshow listicle)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal challenges===
In the United States, legal restrictions on formula restaurants (and formula retail in general) have been challenged as an impermissible restriction on [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]], and as exceeding municipal zoning authority.&lt;ref name="park_v_malibu"&gt;[https://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2017-b271620.pdf?ts=1498075335 The Park at Cross Creek v.

The '''General Archive of the Nation''' ({{lang-es|Archivo General de la Nación}}) is a Colombian [[government agency]] ascribed to the [[Colombian Ministry of Culture]] charged with "''conserving the historical legacy, as well as recovering and circulating the documentary heritage of the country''". It is the head of the National System of Archives. The headquarters are located in the city of [[Bogotá]] and was designed by the architect [[Rogelio Salmona]].

==Contents==
The archive contains historical documents that date from 1541 to 1991. These documents include constitutional policies, notarized documents, judicial documents from colonial times, letters from famous historical figures such as [[Simón Bolívar]], and historical maps of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]]. The collections has documents from all periods of the history of the Americas, from the conquest to the present day. In addition to material from Colombia, the archive has documents from the territories that formed the New Kingdom of Granada as well as from the later countries of [[Gran Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and [[Ecuador]]. There are also documents from [[Central America]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]]. A collection of documents titled "''Negros y Esclavos''" (''Blacks and Slaves'') was featured by [[UNESCO]] as part of its [[Memory of the World Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-6/negros-y-esclavos-archives/|title=Negros y Esclavos Archives {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''second cabinet of Per Albin Hansson''' ({{lang-sv|Regeringen Hansson II}}) was the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of [[Sweden]] from 1936 to 1939. It was a [[Coalition government|coalition cabinet]] consisting of the two parties: [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and the [[Farmers' League (Sweden)|Farmers' League]].&lt;ref name="hedenborgkvarnström296"/&gt;

== History ==
=== Before the election ===
Since 1933, the Social Democrats had organized cooperation with the [[Farmers' League (Sweden)|Farmers' League]], when a historic compromise was reached between the parties regarding political collaboration, which was an important part of the [[Nordic model|Swedish model]].&lt;ref name="hedenborgkvarnström295"&gt;[[#HedenborgKvarnström2006|Hedenborg and Kvarnström (2006)]]: p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;
This cooperation ceased temporarily in the summer of 1936, when [[Per Albin Hansson]] resigned his [[Hansson I Cabinet|first cabinet]].&lt;ref name="hedenborgkvarnström296"/&gt; The reason for the resignation was that it did not get the support in parliament for its defense policy, even though it was only three months left to the [[Swedish general election, 1936|autumn general election]].

The task of forming a new government went to the [[Farmers' League (Sweden)|Farmers' League]]'s leader [[Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp]]. This so-called vacation government launched any reforms or implemented some changes in the law since the parliament was not collected.&lt;ref name="hedenborgkvarnström296"&gt;[[#HedenborgKvarnström2006|Hedenborg and Kvarnström (2006)]]: p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall elections were a major success for the Social Democrats, which gave rise to the Prime Minister to submit the government's resignation.

=== After the election ===
The task of forming a new government went back to [[Per Albin Hansson]] as to the general astonishment government began negotiations with the Farmers' League, possibly because the Social Democrats did not want to depend on any of the left parties in parliamentary polls. The Farmers' League received three ministerial posts: Pehrsson-Bramstorp as Minister for Agriculture, [[Karl Gustaf Westman]] as Minister for Justice, and [[Janne Nilsson]] as Minister for Defence. Together, the two parties in the coalition a majority in both chambers, to sklinnad from previous minority governments.&lt;ref name="hedenborgkvarnström296"/&gt;

In the period leading to [[World War II]], the Government implemented a number of social reforms, including expensive district grouping of basic pensions and the introduction of two weeks paid vacation for all workers.

When the [[Winter War|Finnish Winter War]] broke out, the government resigned and instead formed a coalition government, consisted by the Social Democrats, the Farmers' League, the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]], and the [[National Organization of the Right]].

'''Immovable property''' is an [[Irresistible force paradox|immovable object]], an item of [[property]] that cannot be moved without destroying or altering it – property that is fixed to the earth, such as land or a house. Immovable property includes premises, property rights (for example, inheritable building right), houses, land and associated goods, and [[Personal property|chattels]] if they are located on, or below, or have a fixed address.  It is delimited by geographic coordinates or by reference to local landmarks, depending on the jurisdiction.

In much of the world's [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems (based as they are on Romano-Germanic law, which is also known as Civil law or Continental law), immovable property is the equivalent of "[[real property]]"; it is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface.

To describe it in more detail, immovable property includes land, buildings, hereditary allowances, rights to way, lights, ferries, fisheries or any other benefit which arises out of land, and things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything which is attached to the earth. It does not include standing timber, growing crops, nor grass. It includes the right to collect rent, life interest in the income of the immovable property, a right of way, a fishery, or a lease of land.

Other sources describe immovable property as "any land or any building or part of a building, and includes, where any land or any building or part of a building is to be transferred together with any machinery, plant, furniture, fittings or other things, such machinery, plant, furniture, fittings and other things also. Any rights in or with respect to any land or any building or part of building (whether or not including any machinery, plant, furniture, fittings or other things therein) which has been constructed or which is to be constructed, accruing or arising from any transaction (whether by way of becoming a member of, or acquiring shares in, a co-operative society, or other association of persons) or by way of any agreement or any arrangement of whatever nature, not being a transaction by way of sale, exchange or lease of such land, building or part of a building."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Immovable property cannot be altered or remodeled, added to, or reconstructed without entering into an agreement with and getting permission from its owner.  Construction, alteration, and demolition may also be subject to government regulation, such as the need to obey [[zoning laws]] and obtain [[building permit]]s.

Also, a property or an object, which can be moved by destroying it would be considered a "destructible property" rather than an "immovable property". {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the past, leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) have consistently opposed marriage between different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]. Apostle [[Boyd K. Packer]] publicly stated in 1977 that "We've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. ... The counsel has been wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packer|first1=Boyd|title=Follow the Rule|url=https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_follow-rule/|website=byu.edu|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=26 August 2017|quote=We've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. The counsel has been wise. ... You might even say, "I can show you local Church leaders or perhaps even general leaders who have married out of their race." I say, "Yes—exceptions." Then I would remind you of that Relief Society woman's near-scriptural statement, "We'd like to follow the rule first, and then we'll take care of the exceptions."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every decade for over a century—beginning with the church's formation in the 1830s until the 1970s—has seen some denunciation against [[miscegenation]], with most focusing on black-white marriage.&lt;ref name="BushDialogue"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bush |first1=Lester E. |date=1973 |title= Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf |journal=Dialogue |volume=8 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42–43}}

Though no longer taught as a sin, Mormon leaders punished white members who married black individuals by banning  both from entering a temple into at least the 60s and recommended against any interracial marriages in official publications into the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Ban" /&gt;&lt;ref name="black and mormon" /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="Manual" /&gt; The teachings of church leaders on race and [[interracial marriage]] have stemmed from biological and social ideas of the time and have garnered criticism and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Bush |editor-first= Lester E.

The Church viewed miscegenation from the unique perspective of the priesthood policy but was, of course, by no means unique in its conclusions; in fact, the leadership generally invoked 'biological and social' principles in support of their conclusions on the subject. ... Clark stated, 'Biologically, it is wrong'; Lee invoked the 'laws of heredity and the centuries of training'; and the First Presidency characterized intermarriage as 'a concept which has heretofore been most repugnant to most normal-minded people.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–90}} One exception was intermarriage with Native Americans, who Mormons believed descended from Israelites.&lt;ref name="Mauss 2003" /&gt;{{rp|64}} In 2013, the LDS Church disavowed previous teachings that interracial marriage is a sin.&lt;ref name="Slack2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57241071&amp;itype=CMSID|title=Mormon church traces black priesthood ban to Brigham Young|author=Peggy Fletcher Stack|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Essay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and the Priesthood|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=LDS church|date=13 December 2013|quote=Today, the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else. Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any form.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In canonized scripture==

===The Book of Mormon===

[[File:Mormon-book.jpg|left|thumb|150px|In The Book of Mormon one group of lighter-skinned people was commanded by God not to intermarry with a darker-skinned group.]]
In [[The Book of Mormon]], the Lord cursed the [[Lamanite]]s and their skin (Jacob 3:5) in a form of a mark of blackness so that the Nephites would not find the Lamanites "enticing", (2 Nephi 5:21) "that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions" (Alma 3:8) and so that the Nephites and the Lamanites would be a separate people (Alma 3:14).  If someone intermarried and had children with the Lamanites, the Lord also marked and cursed them (Alma 3:15) and cursed their descendants (2 Nephi 5:23 and Alma 3:9).

[[Hugh Nibley]], a prominent [[Mormon apologist]], argues that the curse could be thought of as a culture with traditions that were inconsistent with God's commandments.  He argues the curse did not spread through intermarriage alone, but that the Nephites had to participate in the Lamanite culture.  He argues that Lord put the mark on the Lamanites to prevent the spread of Lamanite culture among the Nephites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-jTBwAAQBAJ|title=Nibley Commentary of the Book of Mormon Volume 1: Commentary of the Book of Mormon|author=Hugh W. Nibley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Book of Mormon Seminary Teacher Manual, which is currently used to teach seminary students about the Book of Mormon, quotes Joseph Fielding Smith in ''Answers to Gospel Questions'' that the skin color was given to "keep the two peoples from mixing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of Mormon Seminary Teacher Manual|year=2012|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-27|pages=91–93|quote=The dark skin was placed upon the Lamanites so that they could be distinguished from the Nephites and to keep the two peoples from mixing. The dark skin was the sign of the curse. The curse was the withdrawal of the Spirit of the Lord.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pearl of Great Price===
In the [[Book of Abraham]], the name of [[Ham]]'s wife is [[Egyptus]], which is given the meaning of forbidden.  It teaches that their grandson, [[Pharaoh (Book of Abraham)|Pharaoh]], was a descendant of the Canaanites (Abraham 1:22), a race of people who had been cursed with [[black people|black skin]] (Moses 7:8).  [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]], a counselor in the presidency of the church, taught that Ham himself was cursed because he had married a black wife.&lt;ref name="Harris2015" /&gt;  In ''The Way to Perfection'', [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] quoted [[B. H. Roberts]] in pointing out that Egyptus means forbidden, and suggests that might be because she was "of a race with which those who held the Priesthood were forbidden to intermarry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cain, Ham, and the Priesthood|author=Joseph Fielding Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Old Testament Student Manual, which is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament, teaches that Ham's sons were denied the priesthood because he had married Egyptus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Testament Student Manual Genesis-2 Samuel|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/genesis-4-11-the-patriarchs?lang=eng&amp;clang=pes&amp;_r=1|quote=Therefore, although Ham himself had the right to the priesthood, Canaan, his son, did not. Ham had married Egyptus, a descendant of Cain ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/1/21-24#21-24 Abraham 1:21-24]), and so his sons were denied the priesthood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bible===
In Genesis 28:1, Isaac commands Jacob not to marry the Canaanites.  The Old Testament Seminary Teacher Manual, which is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament to seminary students, teaches that it is because "a daughter of Canaan would not be worthy to join Jacob in entering into a marriage covenant with the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Testament Seminary Teacher Manual|publisher=lds.org|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-teacher-manual/genesis-continued/lesson-31-genesis-28-30?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Deuteronomy 7, the Israelites were commanded not to marry the Canaanites.  In 1954, Mark E. Petersen used this as an example of why the church did not allow interracial marriages.&lt;ref name="Harris2015" /&gt;{{rp|70}}

In Judges 14, [[Samson]] marries a Philistine woman.  The Old Testament Seminary Teacher Manual teaches that marrying a Philistine was against the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Testament Seminary Teacher Manual|year=2014|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-teacher-manual/introduction-to-the-book-of-judges/lesson-78-judges-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Testament: Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual|year=2001|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other records of Smith's teaching on interracial marriage. For example, in 1897 First Presidency member [[George Q. Cannon|George Cannon]] stated in his journal that Joseph Smith had taught a later president of the church, [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], that a white man married to a woman with black ancestry could not receive the priesthood and they both would be killed along with any of their children if the penalty of the law were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of George Q.

The question also came up whether a white man who was married to a woman having negro blood in her veins could receive the Priesthood.

In this case submitted to us a white man had married a woman with negro blood in her ignorantly; yet if he were to receive the Priesthood and still continue his association with his wife the offspring of the marriage might make a claim or claims that would interfere with the purposes of the Lord and His curse upon the seed of Cain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marianno|first1=Scott D.|title=To Belong as Citizens: Race and Marriage in Utah, 1880-1920|date=1 July 2015|publisher=Utah State University|location=Logan, UT|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5480&amp;context=etd|accessdate=26 August 2017|quote=In 1897, the First Presidency considered a question related to interracial mixing involving a white husband who married someone 'either black or ... tainted with negro blood.'

Blood atonement is the doctrine that some crimes are so heinous that the atonement of Jesus does not apply, including miscegenation. Instead, to atone for these sins, the perpetrators should be killed in a way that would allow their blood to be shed upon the ground as a sacrificial offering. This doctrine was the most widespread during the [[Mormon Reformation]]. Examples of Young's teaching on this and interracial relationships include the following:

[[File:Brigham Young by Charles William Carter.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Brigham Young publicly taught several times that the punishment for black and white interracial marriages was death.]]
* '''1847''' — Young heard of a Mormon family composed of a black man Enoch Lovejoy Lewis (son of ordained priesthood holder [[Walker Lewis|Kwaku Walker Lewis]]), a white woman Mary Matilda Webster, and their interracial child living in Massachusetts and responded that if the family wasn't living so close to non-Mormons "they would all have to be killed" since the law is that black and white seed should not be "amalgamated".&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;
* '''1852''' — As territory governor, Young stated before the territory legislature that if a white man had children with a black woman, he should request to have his head chopped off. He continued saying that if someone were to kill the man, woman and any children of such a union, that it would be a blessing to them and "it would do a great deal towards atoning for the sin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=Fred C.|title=The Teachings of President Brigham Young Vol. 3 1852–1854|date=1987|publisher=Colliers Publishing Co.|isbn=0934964017|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkRZGQ8oO8IC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;ots=30VXmz65se&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=if any man mingles his seed with the seed of Cane [i.e. black people] the only way he could get rid of it or have salvation would be to come forward &amp; have his head cut off [and] spill his blood upon the ground.

* '''1865''' — In a speech in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] Young repeated the teaching of death as punishment for black and white individuals producing interracial offspring, stating that this penalty would always be in place.&lt;ref name="Young1865"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Brigham|title=The Persecutions of the Saints—Their Loyalty to the Constitution—The Mormon Battalion—The Laws of God Relative to the African Race|journal=Journal of Discourses|date=1865|volume=10|page=110|url=http://scriptures.byu.edu/jod/pdf/JoD10/JoD10_0110.pdf|quote=Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race?

====Interracial marriages of William McCary====
In 1847, former slave&lt;ref name="Performance" /&gt;{{rp|100}} and Mormon convert [[William McCary]] drew the ire of Brigham Young and others in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] for his marriage to the white Mormon Lucy Stanton, and his later alleged mixed-race polygamous sealings to other white women without authorization.&lt;ref name="Performance" /&gt;{{rp|98}}&lt;ref name="Preacher" /&gt;{{rp|227–228}} McCary claimed Native American heritage in order to marry Stanton and avoid the greater stigma that the few black people in Nauvoo faced.&lt;ref name="Performance" /&gt;{{rp|107–108,113}} The most common interpretation of the interracial events around McCary and his excommunication is that they contributed to or precipitated the subsequent ban of black members from temple ordinances and priesthood authority.&lt;ref name="Performance"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pulley Hudson|first1=Angela|title=William McCary, Lucy Stanton, and the Performance of Race at Winter Quarters and Beyond|journal=Journal of Mormon History|date=July 2015|volume=41|issue=3|jstor=10.5406/jmormhist.41.3.97}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|98,117}} McCary elicited the first recorded general authority statement connecting race and the priesthood when the apostle [[Parley P.

====Lynching of Thomas Coleman====
In 1866 Thomas Coleman, a black member of the LDS church, was murdered in Salt Lake City after it was discovered that he was courting a white woman. His throat was slit so deeply from ear to ear that he was nearly decapitated, and his right breast was slit open, similar to the [[Penalty (Mormonism)|penalties]] illustrated in the temple ritual and taught by Brigham Young. He was castrated and a note warning black men to stay away from white women was pinned to his chest. Historian [[D. Michael Quinn|Michael Quinn]] states that this murder was a fulfillment of Young's 1852 teaching that the penalty for miscegenation was decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VnbZAAAAMAAJ|title=The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power|author=D. Michael Quinn|publisher=Signature Books|year=1997|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; FairMormon argues that Coleman's death may have been unrelated to Young's teachings or temple penalties, since Coleman was not an endowed member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Blood Atonement| publisher=Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research| url=http://fairwiki.org/index.php/Blood_atonement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Wilford Woodruff===
In the late 1800's at least two white members were denied church ordinances after they had married a black person. In 1895 a white woman was denied a temple sealing to her white husband because she had previously married a black man, even though she had divorced him.&lt;ref name="Neither White Nor Black" /&gt;{{rp|78–79}} First Presidency member [[George Q. Cannon|George Cannon]] argued that allowing her access to the temple would not be fair to her two daughters, whom she'd had with her former husband.&lt;ref name="Reeve 2015" /&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;ref name="Neither White Nor Black" /&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of George Q.

Cannon: February 1881 |url=https://www.churchhistorianspress.org/george-q-cannon/1880s/1881/02-1881?lang=eng |website=The Church Historian’s Press |publisher=LDS Church|quote=1 February 1881, Tuesday ...

He had ... become disgusted with the attitude of the churches upon this important question. He said all the churches taught or consented to miscegenation, and he felt it would be the destruction of every people who practiced it ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1900–1950 teachings==

===George Cannon===
In 1900, [[George Q. Cannon|George Cannon]], first counselor under Lorenzo Snow, repeated Brigham Young's teachings that if a man who had the priesthood married a black woman, then according to the law of the Lord, the man and any offspring should be killed so that the seed of Cain did not receive the priesthood.&lt;ref name="Reeve 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=W.

===Under Joseph F. Smith===
Some other early 20th century teachings on the subject include notes from a 1907 Deseret News book by church seventy and influential Mormon theologian [[B.H. Roberts]]. In it Roberts approvingly quoted a Southern author who stated that a social divide between white and black people should be maintained at all costs as socializing would lead to mixed-race marriages with an inferior race and no disaster would compare to this as it would doom the Caucasian race.&lt;ref name="Interracial Marriage" /&gt;{{rp|125}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Brigham Henry|title=The Seventy's Course in Theology, Vol. 1|date=1907|publisher=Deseret News|location=Salt Lake City|pages=165–166|url=https://archive.org/stream/seventyscoursein00robe#page/n182/mode/1up|quote=[T]he south is entirely right in thus keeping open at all times, at all hazards, and at all sacrifices an impassible [sic] social chasm between black and white.

No other conceivable disaster that might befall the South could, for an instant, compare with such miscegenation within her borders. ... But some may deny that the mongrelization of the Southern people would offend the race notion ... That the negro is markedly inferior to the Caucasian is proved both craniologically and by six thousand years of planet-wide experimentation; and that the commingling of inferior with superior must lower the higher is just as certain as that the half-sum of two and six is only four ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 1913 church publication in the church's ''[[Young Woman's Journal]]'' encouraged young women to maintain white racial purity and health by avoiding "race disintegration" and "race suicide".&lt;ref name="Marriage" /&gt;{{rp|69}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Young Woman's Journal|issue=7|last1=Middleton|first1=George W.|title=The Real Eugenics Problem of America|volume=24|date=July 1913|publisher=LDS Church Deseret News|location=Salt Lake City|pages=408–410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-RHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA408#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 August 2017|quote=The patriots of a hundred years ago are being overrun by the Polish Jews, and Italians, and Irish peasants who are flocking to America in droves ...

[[File:J. Reuben Clark3.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|right|The apostle Reuben Clark spoke against mixed-race marriage several times in the 1940s, once calling it a "wicked virus."&lt;ref name=BushDialogue /&gt;{{rp|66}}]]
[[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] member [[J.

Biologically, it is wrong; spiritually, it is wrong."&lt;ref name=BushDialogue /&gt;{{rp|66}} The quote was reprinted in the church's official [[Improvement Era]] magazine (a predecessor to the current [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign magazine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=J.

In 1947 the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], sent a response letter to a member inquiring on the subject stating, "Social intercourse between the Whites and the Negroes should certainly not be encouraged because of leading to intermarriage, which the Lord has forbidden. ...

==1950–1978 teachings==
===Under David McKay===
The latter half of the 20th century saw many changes in U.S. legal, and social views of interracial marriage, and many changes in top church leaders' teachings on the topic. For instance, church apostle [[Mark E. Petersen|Mark Petersen]] said in a 1954 address that church doctrine barred black people and white people from marrying each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Matthew L.|last2=Bringhurst|first2=Newell G.|title=The Mormon Church and Blacks: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn20CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2015|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-08121-7|pages=69–71|quote=I think I have read enough to give you an idea of what the Negro is after. ...

Now what is our policy in regard to intermarriage? As to the Negro, of course, there is only one possible answer. We must not intermarry with the Negro. ... I think the Lord segregated the Negro and who is man to change that segregation? ... '[W]hat God hath separated, let not man bring together again ....'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was circulated among BYU religion faculty, much to the embarrassment of fellow LDS scholars, and over twenty years later Petersen denied knowing if the copies of his speech being passed around were authentic or not, apparently out of embarrassment.&lt;ref name="Harris2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Matthew L.|last2=Bringhurst|first2=Newell G.|title=The Mormon Church and Blacks: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn20CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PAiii&amp;lpg=PAiii&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2015|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-08121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68–69,173}}&lt;ref name="Petersen1954"&gt;Petersen, Mark E.[https://archive.org/details/RaceProblemsAsTheyAffectTheChurchMarkEPetersen Race Problems&amp;nbsp;— As They Affect The Church], Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, August 27, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a white woman who had received her endowments was banned by local leaders from going to the temple and was told her endowments were invalid because she had since married a black man.

Kimball]] gave several speeches addressing the subject.&lt;ref name="Dates" /&gt; In a June 1958 address at [[Brigham Young University]], he stated that "When I said you must teach your people to overcome their prejudices and accept the Indians, I did not mean that you would encourage intermarriage ... we must discourage intermarriage ... it is not expedient."&lt;ref name="Kimball1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimball|first1=Edward L.|title=The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball|date=1982|publisher=Bookcraft|isbn=0884944727|page=226|quote=Cultural differences pose dangers for marriage. When I said you must teach your people to overcome their prejudices and accept the Indians, I did not mean that you would encourage intermarriage. I mean that they should be brothers, to worship together and to work together and to play together; but we must discourage intermarriage, not because it is sin. I would like to make this very emphatic. A couple has not committed sin if an Indian boy and a white girl are married, or vice versa. It isn't a transgression like the transgressions of which many are guilty. But it is not expedient. Marriage statistics and our general experience convince us that marriage is not easy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dates"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mormons Oppose Dates, Marriage To Interracial|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/07/15/mormons-oppose-dates-marriage-to-interracial/33b0330d-8954-4669-9969-671d77d35659/|accessdate=26 August 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=15 July 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified, however, that interracial marriage was not considered a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kimball|first1=Spencer|title=Teachings Concerning Marriage and Child-Bearing|url=http://emp.byui.edu/SATTERFIELDB/PDF/Quotes/Marriage%20and%20Family%20SWK.pdf|website=emp.byui.edu|publisher=BYU-Idaho|accessdate=26 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115134653/http://emp.byui.edu/SATTERFIELDB/PDF/Quotes/Marriage%20and%20Family%20SWK.pdf|archivedate=15 January 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 1959 address he taught that church leaders were unanimous in teachings that Caucasians should marry Caucasians stating that interracial marriage was selfish because the background differences could pose challenges to the marriage and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimball|first1=Edward L.|title=The Teachings of Spencer W.

In spite of the most favorable matings, the evil one still takes a monumental toll and is the cause for many broken homes and frustrated lives.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings from 1978–present==

Church publications have also contained statements discouraging interracial marriage. In the same June 1978 issue announcing that black members were now eligible for temple rites, missionary service, and priesthood ordination, the official newspaper of the LDS Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Paul T.

In 2003 author [[Jon Krakauer]] stated that "official LDS policy has continued to strongly admonish white saints not to marry blacks" in his "[[Under the Banner of Heaven]]". In response the church newsroom released a statement from BYU Dean of Religious Education [[Robert L. Millet]] that "There is, in fact, no mention whatsoever in [the church] [[Handbook (LDS Church)|handbook]] concerning interracial marriages. In addition, having served as a Church leader for almost 30 years, I can also certify that I have never received official verbal instructions condemning marriages between black and white members."&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Millet, [http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-response-to-jon-krakauers-under-the-banner-of-heaven "Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven"], June 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Though, denying any condemnation of interracial marriage, there was no comment on whether it was still discouraged, however. The most recent statement came in 2008 when spokesperson Mark Tuttle stated that the church has no policy against interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Matthew L.|last2=Bringhurst|first2=Newell G.|title=The Mormon Church and Blacks: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn20CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=This+folklore+is+not+part+of+and+never+was+taught+as+doctrine+by+the+church+mark+tuttle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J-_94_vN4u&amp;sig=FfndtYWnLhdmyNPpAOmweS6Shwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU2crl7fjVAhXkjVQKHap7AvQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=This%20folklore%20is%20not%20part%20of%20and%20never%20was%20taught%20as%20doctrine%20by%20the%20church%20mark%20tuttle&amp;f=false|date=2015|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-08121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|200}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stack|first1=Peggy Fletcher|title=Mormon and Black: Grappling with a racist past|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_9497769|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discouragement of marriage between those of different ethnicities by church leaders continued being taught to youth during Sunday meetings until 2013 when the use of the 1996 version of the church Sunday meeting manual for adolescent boys was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Park|first1=Benjamin|title=Why it's time for the Mormon Church to revisit its diverse past|url=http://theconversation.com/why-its-time-for-the-mormon-church-to-revisit-its-diverse-past-75376|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Conversation|date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manual had used a 1976 quote from past church president [[Spencer W.

Nelson|Russell Nelson]] notes that loving without racial discrimination is a general commandment, but not one to apply to specific marriage partner criteria since it states that being united in ethnic background increases the probability of a successful marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Russell|title=Children of the Covenant|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/04/children-of-the-covenant?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=28 August 2017|quote=The commandment to love our neighbors without discrimination is certain.

In 2013 the LDS Church published an essay entitled ''Race and the Priesthood'' on its official website. The essay disavowed teachings in the past that interracial marriage was a sin, indicating that it was influenced by the racism of the era.&lt;ref name=Slack2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Essay" /&gt;

Today, the family business, including a large integrated steel plant near [[Mumbai]], is run by his younger brothers [[Pramod Mittal]] and Vinod Mittal, but Lakshmi has no connection with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1164606/Caribbean-global-steel-giant-rise-ArcelorMittal |title=From the Caribbean to global steel giant: The rise of ArcelorMittal |first=Andrew |last= Saunders |work=Management Today |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social benefit==

===Sports===
After witnessing India win only one medal, [[bronze medal|bronze]], in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and one medal, [[silver medal|silver]], at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], Mittal decided to set up [[Mittal Champions Trust]] with $9&amp;nbsp;million to support ten Indian athletes with world-beating potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-mittal-s-olympic-dream-is-worth-rs-40-crore-9054 |title=Mittal's Olympic dream is worth Rs 40 crore |work=[[Daily News &amp; Analysis]] |date=9 November 2005 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Mittal awarded [[Abhinav Bindra]] with Rs. 1.5 Crore (Rs. 15 million), for getting India its first individual Olympic gold medal in shooting.

For [[Comic Relief]] he matched the money raised (~£1 million) on the celebrity special BBC programme, ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Education===
In 2003, the Lakshmi Niwas Mittal and Usha Mittal Foundation and the [[Government of Rajasthan]] partnered together to establish a university, the [[LNM Institute of Information Technology]] (LNMIIT) in [[Jaipur]] as an autonomous non-profit organisation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lnmiit.ac.in/aboutus/directorsmessage.html|title=The LNM Institute of Information Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Foundation along with [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] founded the Usha Lakshmi Mittal Institute of Management in [[New Delhi]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[SNDT Women's University]] renamed the Institute of Technology for Women (ITW) as [[Usha Mittal Institute of Technology]] after a large donation from the Lakshmi Niwas Mittal Foundation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Medical===
In 2008 the Mittals made a donation of £15 million to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] in London, the largest private contribution the hospital had ever received. The donation was used to help fund their new facility, the Mittal Children's Medical Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/mittals-15m-gift-to-great-ormond-street-is-a-record-6680419.html Mittals' £15m gift to Great Ormond Street is a record]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and allegations==

===PHS===
Mittal successfully employed [[Marek Dochnal]]'s consultancy to influence Polish officials in the privatisation of PHS steel group, which was Poland's largest. Dochnal was later arrested for bribing Polish officials on behalf of Russian agents in a separate affair.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article395940.ece |title=How tycoon went from polo lawns to Polish jail |work=The Times |date=27 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Polish government said it wanted to renegotiate the 2004 sale to ArcelorMittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/news/16200741062.htm |title=Poland wants to renegotiate terms of PHS sale to Arcelor Mittal |publisher=Abcmoney.co.uk |date=16 March 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slave-labour allegations and questionable safety records===
Employees of Mittal have accused him of "slave labour" conditions after multiple fatalities in his mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1909761.ece |first1=Mark |last1=Franchetti |first2=Robert |last2=Winnett |title=UK’s richest man in slave labour row |work=The Times |location=London |date=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During December 2004, twenty-three miners died in explosions in his mines in [[Kazakhstan]] caused by faulty gas detectors.

===The Mittal Affair: "Cash for Influence"===
In 2002 [[Plaid Cymru]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Adam Price]] obtained a letter written by [[Tony Blair]] to the Romanian Government in support of Mittal's LNM steel company, which was in the process of bidding to buy Romania's state-owned steel industry.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1813620.stm |title=Plaid reveals Labour steel cash link |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1820324.stm |title=Lakshmi Mittal, steel mill millionaire |first=Mike |last=Verdin |work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 February 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbage"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1818955.stm |title=Q&amp;A: 'Garbagegate' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 February 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revelation caused controversy, because Mittal had given £125,000 to the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] the previous year. Although Blair defended his letter as simply "celebrating the success" of a British company, he was criticised because LNM was registered in the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Antilles]] and employed less than 1% of its workforce in the UK.&lt;ref name="Garbage"/&gt; LNM was a "major global competitor of Britain's own struggling steel industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1827460.stm |title=Steel firm condemns 'Mittal aid' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=18 February 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair's letter hinted that the privatisation of the firm and sale to Mittal might help smooth the way for Romania's entry into the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; It also had a passage, removed just prior to Blair's signing of it, describing Mittal as "a friend".&lt;ref name="Garbage"/&gt;

===Queens Park Rangers===
Mittal had emerged as a leading contender to buy and sell [[Premier League|Barclays Premiership]] clubs [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. However, on 20 December 2007 it was announced that the Mittal family had purchased a 20 per cent shareholding in [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers football club]] joining [[Flavio Briatore]] and Mittal's friend [[Bernie Ecclestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=QPR secure huge investment boost|work=BBC|accessdate=20 December 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/7154202.stm|date=20 December 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the investment Mittal's son-in-law, Amit Bhatia, took a place on the board of directors. The combined investment in the struggling club sparked suggestions that Mittal might be looking to join the growing ranks of wealthy individuals investing heavily in English football and emulating similar benefactors such as [[Roman Abramovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/12/21/sfnqpr121.xml |title=Lakshmi Mittal pushes QPR up the rich list |first=Kevin |last=Garside |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2010, Briatore resigned as QPR chairman, and sold further shares in the club to Ecclestone, making Ecclestone the single largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Briatore resigns as QPR chairman|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=20 February 2010|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/motorSportsNews/idINLDE61I27B20100219|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental damage===
Mittal purchased the Irish Steel plant based in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland, from the government for a nominal fee of £1&amp;nbsp;million. Three years later, in 2001, it was closed, leaving 400 people redundant. Subsequent environmental issues at the site have been a cause for criticism. The government tried to sue in the High Court to have him pay for the clean-up of Cork Harbour but failed. The clean up was expected to cost €70&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20040808/ai_n12900740 |title=Steel Plant Mess Bill Has Doubled |publisher=Sunday Mirror |date=8 August 2004 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |first=Lisa |last=O'Connor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027174039/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20040808/ai_n12900740/ |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers''' was an event that brought together the progressive intellectuals of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Western Ukraine]], and [[Western Belorussia|Western Belarus]]. It took place on May 16-17, 1936 in [[Lviv]], being organized by the [[Communist Party of Poland]] along with the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]] in order to create the united front against Fascism.

== Background ==
In Paris in 1935, the International Anti-Fascist Congress of Writers took place, led by, among others, [[Romain Rolland]], [[André Gide|Andre Gide]], [[André Malraux|Andre Malraux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books/about/Writers_Block.html?id=LWkuMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Writers' Block: The Paris Antifascist Congress Of 1935|last=Boas|first=Jacob|date=2016-12-19|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|isbn=9781781884492|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting called for organizing local unions and meetings of intellectuals whose goal was to defend culture from fascism. The idea to organize such a Congress in Poland was the reply to that call. Besides, the Lviv Congress of 1936 was a political event implementing the recommendations of the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern|7th Comintern World Congress]] of 1935 on the organization of [[Popular front|Popular Fronts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1971|title=The 7th Comintern Congress and The United front Against Fascism|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-8/pl-7th-congress.htm|journal=Progressive Labor|volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known intellectuals such as [[Stepan Tudor]], [[Yaroslav Halan]], [[Oleksandr Havryliuk]], [[Leon Kruczkowski]], [[Kuzma Plekhatyi]], [[Halina Górska]], [[Adolf Berman]] and others took part in preparing the Congress.

Lviv, as the venue of the Congress, was not chosen by chance. In the 1930s, the city became the center of Polish, Jewish and Ukrainian intellectuals, as well as the arena of class struggle.

Spring of 1936 was a hot period for the working class in Lviv. In April massive clashes between city workers and the police turned into firefights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,15892673,Masakra_we_Lwowie.html?disableRedirects=true|title=Masakra we Lwowie|last=Leszczyński|first=Adam|date=2014-05-05|work=wyborcza.pl|access-date=2018-03-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; That time could be called one of the peak moments in the left-wing movement's history in Western Ukraine. The Anti-Fascist Congress became a link of this chain of events, and set the goal to express solidarity between intellectuals and workers.

== Event ==

The event was held in the [[Hnat Khotkevych Palace of Culture|Tramway Workers' House]], also known as the Red Fortress, a cultural club that was built at the expense of workers' donations and constructed by themselves in 1933.

During the meeting, the Congress Hall was decorated with a portrait of [[Maxim Gorky]], who along with Romain Rolland and [[Heinrich Mann]] were elected to the Honorary Presidium. The Congress was opened by the Polish communist [[Henryk Dembiński (politician)|Henryk Dembiński]]. The writer [[Wanda Wasilewska]] read out the Resolution of the Congress of Cultural Workers.

Representatives of the striking workers and former political prisoners spoke at the congress. In breaks between sessions, the writers made speeches at the factories. According to witnesses, the workers made up the vast majority of the Congress guests. Among the participants, all main nationalities of the country - Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Jews - were represented. Some writers from the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] were invited.

During the Congress, the following reports were made: ''Culture and Fascism'' (by Henryk Dembinski, Stepan Tudor), ''War and the Future of Culture'' (by Leon Kruczkowski), ''Culture and Conditions of Human Labour'' (by [[Halina Krahelska]]), ''On the State of Literature, Theatre, Music, Journalism, Education'' (by [[Marian Czuchnowski]], Yaroslav Halan, Wanda Wasilwska, [[Bronisław Dabrowski (actor)|Bronisław Dabrowski]], [[Emil Zegadłowicz]], [[Aleksander Weintraub|Aleksander Dan]]).

Speaking on the national question, the participants of the Congress expressed in favour of meeting all the cultural needs of the nationalities inhabiting the Polish state. The speakers demanded the opening of national schools, Ukrainian and Belarusian universities, and the equal rights of languages. Yaroslav Halan spoke particularly hotly about these issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books/about/%D0%AF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD.html?id=YMEGAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ярослав Галан|last=Беляев|first=Владимир Павлович|last2=Елкин|first2=Анатолий Сергеевич|date=|publisher=Молодая гвардия|year=1971|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress debunked the oppressive, pro-fascist policy of the government of the Polish Republic, condemned the oppression of the working masses by the capitalists, [[bourgeois nationalism]], [[chauvinism]], [[militarism]].

The resolution, unanimously approved, urged the intelligentsia of Poland, Western Ukraine and Western Belarus to participate in a nationwide struggle against [[Nazism]], to stop the preparation of a war against the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], for the free development of science and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pbd.su/%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%87%D1%8C/%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0|title=Красная Западная Украина {{!}} Победитель|last=Каменяр|first=Александр|date=2016-09-08|work=|access-date=2018-03-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress ended with singing [[The Internationale|''The Internationale'']].

The tone of the participants was revolutionary, some of them announced an imminent meeting «in a red Lviv».

== Consequences ==
These political accents have caused a scandal. The Association of Railway Bookstores ''Ruch'', which had a monopoly on the distribution of the press, issued a circular forbidding the distribution of communist newspapers - Chłopskie Jutro, Język Międzynarodowy, Kultura Wschodu, Lewar, Lewy Tor, Literatur, Oblicze Dnia and Przekrój Tygodnia - previously available in normal sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kongreskultury.pl/title,II_Antyfaszystowski_Kongres_Kultury_Polskiej,_16-17_maja_1936,_Lwow__,pid,83.html|title=Kongres Kultury Polskiej 2009|last=Blueprint|first=Agencja Interaktywna|website=www.kongreskultury.pl|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For initiators and organizers of the Congress, it was not safe to stay in the city. Soon afterwards, its participants received a signal: «Leave Lviv». For instance, Yaroslav Halan had to move to [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Years later, historians of the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]] regarded the Congress as a great success for their policies.

In many countries, a '''mayor ''' (from the [[Latin]] ''maior'' {{IPA-la|majˈjɔr|}}, meaning "bigger") is the highest-ranking [[official]] in a [[Municipal corporation|municipal government]] such as that of a [[city]] or a [[town]].

Worldwide, there is a wide [[variance]] in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated. Depending on the system chosen, a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government, may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power, or may play a solely ceremonial role. Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public, or selection by an elected governing council or board.

==History==

===British Isles===
{{anchor|England|Scotland|Wales}}{{See also|Mayors in England|Mayors in Wales}}
In modern [[England]] and [[Wales]], the position of mayor descends from the feudal lord's [[bailiff]] or [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (''see [[borough]]''). The [[chief magistrate]] of [[London]] bore the title of [[portreeve]] for considerably more than a century after the [[Norman Conquest]]. This official was elected by popular choice, a privilege secured from [[John, King of England|King John]]. By the beginning of the 12th century, the title of portreeve gave way to that of mayor as the designation of the chief officer of London, followed around 1190 by that of [[Winchester]]. Other boroughs adopted the title later. In the 19th century, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]], Section 15, regulated the election of mayors. The mayor was to be a fit person elected annually on 9 November by the council of the borough from among the aldermen or councillors or persons qualified to be such. His term of office was one year, but he was eligible for re-election. He might appoint a deputy to act during illness or absence, and such deputy must be either an alderman or councillor. A mayor who was absent from the borough for more than two months became disqualified and had to vacate his office. A mayor was ''ex officio'' a [[justice of the peace]] for the borough during his year of office and the following year. He received such remuneration as the council thought reasonable. These provisions have now been repealed.

In medieval Wales, the [[Laws of Hywel Dda]] codified the [[maer (office)|mayor]] ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|maior}}''; [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''{{lang|cy|maer}}'') as a position at the [[Welsh kingdoms|royal courts]] charged with administering the serfs of the [[demesne|king's lands]]. To maintain its dependence on and loyalty to the Crown, the position was forbidden to the leaders of the clan groups.&lt;ref name=HyDda&gt;[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. 
Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/447|Welsh Medieval Law]]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 1 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A separate mayor, known as the "cow dung mayor"&lt;!--seriously. see source.--&gt; (''maer biswail''), was charged with overseeing the royal cattle.&lt;ref name=HyDda/&gt; There were similar offices at the Scottish and Irish courts.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The office of [[Mayors and provosts in the United Kingdom|mayor]] in most modern English and Welsh boroughs and towns did not in the 20th century entail any important administrative duties, and was generally regarded as an honour conferred for local distinction, long service on the Council, or for past services. The mayor was expected to devote much of his (or her) time to civic, ceremonial, and representational functions, and to preside over meetings for the advancement of the public welfare. His or her administrative duties were to act as returning officer at parliamentary elections, and as chairman of the meetings of the council. However, since [[Local Government Act 2000|reforms]] introduced in 2000, 14 English local authorities have [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|directly elected mayors]] who combine the 'civic' mayor role with that of Leader of the Council and have significantly greater powers than either. The mayor of a [[town council]] is officially known as "town mayor" (although in popular parlance, the word "town" is often dropped). Women mayors are also known as "mayor"; the wife of a mayor is sometimes known as the "mayoress". Mayors are not appointed to District Councils which do not have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]]. Their place is taken by the Chairman of Council, who undertakes exactly the same functions and is, like a mayor, the civic head of the district concerned.

In [[Scotland]] the post holders are known as Convenors, Provosts, or Lord Provosts depending on the local authority.

===Continental Europe===
{{main article|Mayor of the Palace|podestà}}
The original [[Franks|Frankish]] mayors or majordomos were {{ndash}} like the Welsh ''meiri'' {{ndash}} lords commanding the king's lands around the [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] courts in [[Austrasia]], [[kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[Neustria]]. The mayorship of Paris eventually became hereditary in the [[Pippinids]], who later established the [[Carolingian dynasty]].

In modern [[France]], since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], a mayor (''maire'') and a number of mayoral adjuncts (''adjoints au maire'') are selected by the municipal council from among their number. Most of the administrative work is left in their hands, with the full council meeting comparatively infrequently. The model was copied throughout Europe in Britain's mayors, Italy's [[sindaco]]s, most of the German states' [[burgomaster]]s, and Portugal's [[President of the Municipal Chamber|presidents of the municipal chambers]].

In [[Medieval Italy]], the [[Italian city-states|city-states]] who did not consider themselves independent principalities or dukedoms {{ndash}} particularly those of the Imperial [[Ghibelline]] faction {{ndash}} were led by [[podestà]]s.

The [[Greece|Greek]] equivalent of a mayor is the demarch (Greek: {{lang|grc|δήμαρχος}}, lit. "[[archon]] of the [[deme]]").

====Scandinavia====
In [[Denmark]] all [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] are led by a political official called ''[[Burgomaster|borgmester]]'', "mayor". The mayor of [[Copenhagen]] is however called ''[[List of mayors of Copenhagen|overborgmester]]'' "superior mayor". In that city other mayors, ''borgmestre'' (plural), are subordinate to him with different undertakings, like ministers to a prime minister. In other municipalities in Denmark there is only a single mayor.

In [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] the mayoral title ''borgermester/borgmästare'' has now been abolished. Norway abolished it in 1937 as a title of the non-political top manager of (city) municipalities and replaced it with the title ''rådmann'' ("[[alderman]]" or "[[magistrate]]"), which is still in use when referring to the top managers of the [[municipalities of Norway]]. The top ''elected'' official of the municipalities of Norway, on the other hand, has the title ''ordfører'', which actually means "word-bearer", i.e. "chairman" or "president", an equivalent to the Swedish word ''[[:wikt:ordförande|ordförande]]''.

In Sweden ''borgmästare'' was a title of the senior judge of the courts of the cities, courts which were called ''rådhusrätt'', literally "town hall court", somewhat of an equivalent to an English [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. These courts were abolished in 1971. Until 1965 these mayor judges on historical grounds also performed administrative functions in the "board of magistrates", in Swedish known collegially{{clarifyme|date=April 2017}} as ''magistrat''. Until 1965 there were also municipal mayors (''kommunalborgmästare''), who had these non-political administrative roles in smaller cities without a magistrates' court or ''magistrat''. This office was an invention of the 20th century as the smaller cities in Sweden during the first half of the 20th century subsequently lost their own courts and magistrates.

In the 16th century in Sweden, king [[Gustav Vasa]] considerably centralised government and appointed the mayors directly. In 1693 king [[Charles XI]] accepted a compromise after repeated petitions from the Estate of the Burgesses over decades against the royal mayor appointments. The compromise was that the burgesses in a city could normally nominate a mayor under the supervision of the local governor. The nominee was then to be presented to and appointed by the king, but the king could appoint mayors directly in exceptional cases. This was codified in the [[Instrument of Government]] of 1720 and on 8 July the same year [[Privy Council of Sweden|Riksrådet ("the Council of the Realm")]] decided, after a petition from the said Estate, that only the city could present nominees, not the king or anyone else. Thus the supervision of the local governor and directly appointed mayors by the king ceased after 1720 (the so-called [[Age of Liberty]]). On 16 October 1723, it was decided after a petition that the city should present three nominees, of whom the king (or the Council of the Realm) appointed one.&lt;ref name=NF&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0637.html The article ''Borgmästare'' (in Swedish)] in [[Nordisk Familjebok]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was kept as a rule from then on in all later regulations&lt;ref name=NF/&gt; and was also kept as a tradition in the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|1809 Instrument of Government]] ([http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Regeringsform_1809#.C2.A731. § 31]) until 1965.

In [[Finland]], there are two mayors, in [[Tampere]] and [[Pirkkala]]. Usually in Finland the highest executive official is not democratically elected, but is appointed to a public office by the city council, and is called simply ''kaupunginjohtaja'' "city manager" or ''kunnanjohtaja'' "municipal manager", depending on whether the municipality defines itself as a city. The term ''pormestari'' "mayor", from Swedish ''borgmästare'' confusingly on historical grounds has referred to the highest official in the registry office and in the city courts (abolished in 1993) as in Sweden, not the city manager. In addition, ''pormestari'' is also an honorary title, which may be given for distinguished service in the post of the city manager. The city manager of Helsinki is called ''ylipormestari'', which translates to "Chief Mayor", for historical reasons. Furthermore, the term "city manager" may be seen translated as "mayor".

==Mayors by country==
===Australia===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Albury, New South Wales]] --&gt;
On Australian councils, the mayor is generally the member of the council who acts as ceremonial figurehead at official functions, as well as carrying the authority of council between meetings. Mayoral decisions made between meetings are subject to Council and may be confirmed or repealed if necessary. Mayors in Australia may be elected either directly through a ballot for the position of mayor at a local-government election, or alternatively may be elected from within the council at a meeting.

The civic regalia and insignia of local government have basically remained unaltered for centuries.
The robes, the [[Livery collar|mayoral chain]] and the [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] are not intended to glorify the individual, but rather they are a uniform of office and are used to respect and honour the people whom the users serve.

The mayoral robe may be crimson with lapels and sleeves trimmed in ermine. The mayor may also wear a lace fall (neck piece) and cuffs.

The deputy-mayoral robe may be crimson with lapels and sleeves trimmed with black velvet and bordered with lapin.

Mayors have the title of ''''[[Worship (style)|His/Her Worship]]'''' whilst holding the position.

In councils where [[Councillors]] are elected representing political parties, the mayor is normally the leader of the party receiving the most seats on council. In [[Queensland]] the [[Lord Mayor]] and Mayors are elected by popular vote at the general council election.

===Brazil===
Every municipality in Brazil elects a mayor (Portuguese: ''prefeito''/''prefeita''), for a four-year term, acting as an executive officer with the city council (Portuguese: ''Câmara Municipal'') functioning with legislative powers. The mayor can be re-elected and manage the city for two consecutive terms.

The Brazilian system works similarly to the [[mayor-council government]] in the United States.

===Canada===
The chief executives of [[borough#Canada|boroughs]] (''[[Arrondissement#Quebec|arrondissements]]'') in [[Quebec]] are termed mayors (''maires/mairesses'' in French). A borough mayor simultaneously serves as head of the borough council and as a regular councillor on the main city council.

As is the practice in most Commonwealth countries, in Canada a mayor is addressed as His/Her Worship while holding office.

In some small [[township (Canada)|townships]] in [[Ontario]], the title '''reeve''' was historically used instead of mayor. In some other municipalities, "mayor" and "reeve" were two separate offices, with the mayor retaining leadership powers while the reeve was equivalent to what other municipalities called an "[[at-large]] councillor". While most municipalities in the province now designate their elected municipal government heads as mayors, in certain areas of the province, the elected head of the municipality continues to be refereed to as reeve, and the second-in-command is referred to as the deputy reeve. For example, this continues to be the case in the municipalities of [[Algonquin Highlands]], [[Dysart et al]], [[Highlands East]], and [[Minden Hills]], all located within the [[Haliburton County]].

Many municipalities in Alberta continue to use the title reeve to denote the office of mayor or chief elected official in accordance with the Municipal Government Act.

In rural municipalities (RM) in the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], the elected head of the RM is still referred to as a "reeve", as are the heads of most counties and district municipalities (DMs) in Alberta.

The scheduling of municipal elections in Canada varies by jurisdiction, as each province and territory has its own laws regarding municipal governance. See also [[municipal elections in Canada]].

===Dominican Republic===
The mayor of a municipality in the [[Dominican Republic]] is called indistinctly ''alcalde'' or ''síndico''. The latter name is preferred as to avoid confusing the title with the similarly sounding ''alcaide'' (''lit. [[prison warden]]''). Such person is the governor of the municipality whose township elected him (or her) by [[direct vote]] for a term of four years. The mayor's office daily duties are restricted to the local governance, and as such, it is responsible for the coordination of [[waste collection]], [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|upkeep]] of [[public spaces]] (parks, undeveloped urban parcels, streets, city ornate, traffic light control, sewage and most public utilities). In practice most of it duties are centered in light street repairing (new or big road projects, like overpasses, bridges, pedestrian crossings, etc. are handled by the Public Works Ministry (''Ministerio de Obras Públicas'' in Spanish) office), under the direct control of the Central Government. Subcontracting [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] and management, overseeing the use of public spaces and arbitring neighborhood land ''use'' disputes which is managed by the National Property office (''Oficina de Bienes Nacionales'' in Spanish) is also controlled by the mayor's office. Water, electrical supply and public transportation coordination are handled by several Central Government's offices, and as such, are not under control of the mayor.

===France===
{{details|Mayor (France)}}
Mayors (''maires'') in France are elected every six years in [[Elections in france#Municipal|local elections]].

===Germany===
In Germany local government is regulated by [[states of Germany|state]] statutes. Nowadays only the mayors of the three city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]) are still elected by the respective city-state parliaments. In all the other states the mayors are now elected directly by the [[EU citizen]]s living in that area. The post of mayor may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in administration. In big cities (details are regulated by state statutes) the official title is Oberbürgermeister ([[Lord Mayor]]). In these cities a "simple" mayor is just a deputy responsible for a distinct task (e.g., welfare or construction works). Big cities are usually [[Kreisfreie Stadt|kreisfrei ("free of district")]]. That means that the city council also has the powers and duties of a rural district council. The leader of a rural district council is called Landrat ("land counsellor"). In that case the chief mayor has also the duties and powers of a Landrat. The term Oberbürgermeister is not used in the three city-states, where the mayors are simultaneously [[minister-president|head of state governments]], but ''Regierender Bürgermeister'' ([[Governing Mayor of Berlin]]), ''Erster Bürgermeister'' ([[First Mayor of the city-state of Hamburg]]) and ''Präsident des Senats und Bürgermeister'' ([[Mayor of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen]]) are used.

===Greece===
Mayors in [[Greece]] were elected every four years in [[Elections in Greece#Local elections|local elections]] and are the head of various municipal governments in which the state is divided. Starting from 2014, mayors are elected for a 5-year term. Local administration elections for the new, consolidated municipalities and peripheries will henceforth be held together with the [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].

Local administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the "[[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]] Project", consolidated the country's numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000. The second phase, initially called "Kapodistrias II" but eventually called the "[[Callicrates]] Project", was implemented in 2010, further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country's 54 prefectures into 13 peripheries. The Callicratean municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example each island (except [[Crete]]) was incorporated into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were consolidated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.

=== India ===
In [[India]], the mayor is leader of the council and has a number of roles, both legislative and functional. The legislative requirements are outlined in Section 73 and 73AA of Local Government Act 1989. In most Indian states mayors are elected indirectly among the council members themselves except in seven states [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]]; where mayors are elected directly by the public.

===Indonesia===
In [[Indonesia]], mayor ({{lang-id|wali kota}}, formerly called ''walikotamadya'' and ''walikota'') is a regional head of a city or town. A mayor has the same level as a [[regent]] ({{lang-id|bupati}}), head of a regency ({{lang-id|kabupaten}}). Basically, a mayor has duties and authority to lead the implementation of the policies established by the region along with the city council ({{lang-id|Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kota}}, DPRD Kota; formerly called Tier 2-DPRD (''DPRD tingkat II'')). A mayor is elected in a pair with a vice mayor through direct elections and is a political office, except in Jakarta. There, mayoralty is a civil-service career position with limited authority and is designated by the [[Governor of Jakarta]]. Their region are called [[Jakarta#Administrative divisions|administration cities]] ({{lang-id|kota administrasi}}).

Before 1999, there were administrative cities ({{lang-id|kota administratif}}, [[:id:Kota administratif|id]]) which were headed by administrative mayors.

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], the mayor is the executive manager of city and elected by the Islamic City Council. The mayor is elected for a four-year term.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the head of a borough corporation was called "mayor" from the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] until boroughs were abolished by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. The [[Local Government Act 2001]] allowed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] councils to style their chairperson as "mayor" and most do so. [[City status in Ireland|City]] council chairs are "mayor" (or "lord mayor" in the cases [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|of Dublin]] and [[Lord Mayor of Cork|of Cork]]). Since 2000 [[Proposed directly elected mayor for the Dublin Metropolitan Area|there have been proposals]] for a directly elected mayor of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Area]].

===Italy===
In Italy the mayor is called ''sindaco'', or informally ''primo cittadino'' ("first citizen"). Every municipality ({{lang-it|Comune}}) has its mayor who represents the local government. The mayor is elected every five years by the inhabitants of the municipality, but he cannot be re-elected after two terms (except in small towns).&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11358245/Del_terzo_mandato_dei_sindaci {{lang|it|No ai tre mandati dei sindaci. Principio di legalità batte disobbedienti}}].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan's [[Local Autonomy Law|Local-Autonomy Law]] of 1947 defines the structure of Japanese local governments, which were strengthened after World War II. It gives strong executive power to the mayor in the local politics like [[mayor-council government#Executive or Strong Mayor Form|strong mayors]] in large cities in the United States of America.
The titles that are translated as "mayor" by the governments are those of the heads of [[cities of Japan|cities]] {{Nihongo||市長|shichō}}, [[towns of Japan|towns]] {{Nihongo||町長|chōchō}}, [[villages of Japan|villages]] {{Nihongo||村長|sonchō}}, and Tokyo's [[special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] {{Nihongo||区長|kuchō}}.
(The head of the [[Tokyo|Tokyo prefecture]] is the {{Nihongo|Governor|知事|Chiji}}.)
A mayor is elected every four years by direct popular votes held separately from the assembly. A mayor can be [[recall election|recalled]] by a popular initiative but the [[prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and the national governments cannot remove a mayor from office. Towards the assembly the mayor prepares budgets, proposes local [[Act of Parliament|acts]] and has vetoes on local acts just approved by the assembly which can be overridden by two-thirds assembly support. A mayor can resolve the assembly if the assembly passes a [[motion of no confidence]] or if the mayor thinks the assembly has no confidence in fact.

===Kazakhstan===
In Kazakhstan, the mayor is called [[Akim]] who is the head of an akimat, a municipal, district, or provincial government (mayorat), and serves as the Presidential representative. Akims of provinces and cities are appointed to the post by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the akims of other administrative and territorial units are appointed or selected to the post in an order defined by the President. He may also dismiss akims from their posts. Powers of akims ends with the introduction into the post of new-elected president of the republic. Thus, the akim continues to fulfill the duties before appointment of corresponding akim by the President of Kazakhstan.

===Malaysia===
{{See also|Mayor of Kuala Lumpur|Mayor of Penang Island}}
The mayor functions as the head of the local government of the cities in Malaysia. To date, there are [[List of cities in Malaysia#Cities of Malaysia|14 officially-recognised cities in the country]].

In cities which lie within the jurisdiction of any one of the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|13 Malaysian states]], the mayor is appointed by the state government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/24/elect-local-leaders|title=Elect local leaders|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuala Lumpur]], the country's capital, is a notable exception, as it forms part of the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] which come under the purview of the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]], via the [[Ministry of Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Ministry of Federal Territories]]. Thus, the mayor of Kuala Lumpur is selected by, and subordinate to, the [[Minister of Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Minister of Federal Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/teresa-kok-federal-territories-ministry-should-be-abolished|title=Teresa Kok: Federal Territories Ministry should be abolished|date=2018-06-13|work=The Edge Markets|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], which saw the country undergoing its first ever regime change, there have been calls to revive local government elections, which had been the practice in certain cities such as Kuala Lumpur, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Ipoh]] and [[Malacca City|Melaka]] until their abolishment in 1965.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/1631905/non-partisan-local-elections-the-way-forward-says-ipoh-ngo|title=Non-partisan local elections the way forward, says Ipoh NGO {{!}} Malay Mail|website=www.malaymail.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/local-elections-begin-soon-economy-stabilises|title=Local elections to begin as soon as economy stabilises|date=2018-05-28|work=The Edge Markets|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reinstatement of local government elections would lead to the mayoral position being elected, instead of being appointed as per the current system.

===Malta===

In Malta, the mayor (In [[Maltese language|Maltese]]: Sindku) is the leader of the majority party in the [[Local councils of Malta|Local Council]]. The members of the Local Councils are directly elected and collectively serve as a basic form of local government.

===Moldova===
The Mayor of the municipality in Moldova is elected for four years. In [[Chişinău]], the last mayor elections had to be repeated three times, because of the low rate of participation.

===Netherlands===
{{Main article|Burgemeester}}

In the [[Netherlands]], the mayor (in {{lang-nl|burgemeester}}) is the leader of the municipal executives ('[[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders]]'). In the Netherlands, burgermeesters are ''de facto'' appointed by the national [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]], ''de jure'' by the [[Dutch Monarchy|monarch]]. They preside both the municipal executive and the legislative ('[[gemeenteraad]]'). The title is sometimes translated as [[burgomaster]], to emphasize the appointed, rather than elected, nature of the office. The appointment procedure was brought for discussion in the early 2000s (decade), as some of the political parties represented in parliament regarded the procedure as undemocratic. Generally, mayors in the Netherlands are selected from the established political parties. Alternatives proposed were direct election of the mayor by the people or appointment by the city council (''gemeenteraad''). A constitutional change to allow for this failed to pass the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in March 2005.

===Nepal===
Mayors in Nepal are elected every Five years in the [[Elections in Nepal|Local elections]].


===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Mayors in New Zealand}}

Mayors in New Zealand are elected every three years in the [[Elections in New Zealand|local body elections]].

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], a city is headed by the [[Districts of Pakistan|District]] [[Nazim]] (the word means "supervisor" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor) and assisted by [[Naib Nazim]] who is also speaker of District Council. District Nazim is elected by the nazims of [[Union councils of Pakistan|union councils]], union councillors and by [[tehsil]] nazims, who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public. Council elections are held every four years.

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], mayors ({{lang-tl|Punong Bayan / Punong Lungsod}}) are the head of a [[List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|municipality or a city]], with the vice mayor as the second highest position in the city. They are elected every three years during the midterm and national elections, and they can serve until three terms of office. As of - September 2012, there are 1,635 mayors in the Philippines.

===Poland===
Mayors in [[Poland]] are [[direct election|directly elected]] by inhabitants of their respective [[municipality]]. The mayor is the sole chief of the [[executive branch]] of the municipality and he cannot serve on the municipal council ([[city council]]) or in the [[parliament]]. The mayor may appoint a deputy mayor if needed. In Poland, a mayor is called a ''burmistrz'' or, in towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants or other municipalities that traditionally use the title, ''prezydent'' ("president", for example "President of [[Warsaw]]", instead of "Mayor of Warsaw"). The equivalent title in a rural community ("[[gmina]]") is "[[wójt]]".

The mayor is elected for a four-year term concurrently with the four-year term of the municipal council, and his/her service is terminated at the end of the municipal council's term. Mayors cannot be dismissed by the municipal council, but they can be removed from the office by the citizens of their municipality in a [[referendum]]. A mayor can also be dismissed by the [[Prime Minister]] in case of persistent transgression of the law. Citizens having a criminal record cannot run for mayor, but only if sentenced for intentional offense [[ex officio]].

The mayor manages the municipal estate, issues minor regulations, and incurs [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] within limits set by the municipal council. The mayor presents a budget to the municipal council, that may then be amended by the council. After the municipal council passes the budget in a form of resolution, the mayor is responsible for its realization. The mayor is the head of the [[town hall]] and the [[register office]] (he/she may appoint deputies for these specific tasks). Mayors legally act as employers for all of the officials of the town hall. Mayors in Poland have wide administrative authority: the only official that he/she cannot appoint or dismiss is a [[city treasurer]], who is appointed by a city council. Although mayors in Poland do not have veto power over city council resolutions, their position is relatively strong and should be classified as a [[mayor-council government]].

===Portugal===
In [[Portugal]] and many other Portuguese-speaking countries the mayor of a municipality is called the ''Presidente da Câmara Municipal'' ([[President of the Municipal Chamber]]).

===Romania===
In [[Romania]] the mayor of a commune, town or city is called ''primar''. He is elected for a period of four years. In carrying out his responsibilities he is assisted by an elected local council (''consiliu local''). [[Bucharest]] has a general mayor (''primar general'') and six sector mayors (''primar de sector''), one for each [[Sectors of Bucharest|sector]]. The responsibilities of the mayor and of the local council are defined by Law 215/2001 of the Romanian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/legea/215-2001.php|title=Legea nr. 215/2001|author=APD-Timisoara|work=resurse-pentru-democratie.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia, the '''Мэр''', from [[France language|fr]] '''Maire''' ([[English language|en]] transcription = ''Mer'' - not to be confused to the NATO [[OF-3]] rank ''Майор'' - en: ''[[Major]]''), is one of possible titles of the head of the administration of a city or municipality.  This title is equivalent to that of the head of a Russian rural district. Exceptionally, the ''mer'' of [[Moscow]], [[Saint-Petersburg]] and [[Sevastopol]] are equivalent to governors in Russia, since these three federal cities are equivalent to Russian federations.

Except for those just-named three large cities, the governance system of a Russian municipality (city, county, district or town) is subordinate to the representative council of the federation in which it is located. The ''mer'', is either directly elected in municipal elections (citywide referendum) or is elected by the members of the municipality's representative council. Election by council members is now more widespread because it better integrates with the Russian federal three-level vertical governance structure:
#National government: 
##President (executive) 
##[[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]]
#Federation governments: 
##Heads of federation (commonly governors)
##Regional representative councils
#Local governments: 
##Heads of administration (who have the official title of ''mer'', whether or not local law defines it as such)
##Local representative councils

The typical term of office of a ''mer'' in Russia is four years. The ''mer's'' office administers all municipal services, public property, police and fire protection, and most public agencies, and enforces all local and state laws within a city or town.

According to Medialogy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222162625/http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''mer'' of [[Novosibirsk]], Edward Lokot', is mentioned in the media more than any other Russian mayor.  The ''mer'' of [[Kazan]], Il'sur Metshin, is the most popular in Russia, scoring 76 out of 100, according to the Russian People's Rating of ''Mers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia-rating.ru/info/1530.html|title=Регионы России: Рейтинг Мэров (Май, 2014)|work=russia-rating.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]], the mayor is the head of the city or a town. He acts on behalf of the city, and performs an executive function. The position of the mayor of [[Belgrade]] is important as the capital city is the most important hub of economics, culture and science in [[Serbia]]. Furthermore, the post of the mayor of Belgrade is the third most important position in the government after the [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] and [[President of Serbia|President]].

===Spain and Hispanic America===
''[[Alcalde]]'' is the most common Spanish term for the mayor of a town or city. It is derived from the {{lang-ar|[[Qadi|al-qaḍi]]|script=Latn}} ({{lang|ar|قاضي|rtl=yes}}), i.e., "the ([[Sharia]]) judge," who often had administrative, as well as judicial, functions. Although the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ''alcalde'' and the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] ''qaḍi'' had slightly different attributes (the ''qaḍi'' oversaw an entire province, the ''alcalde'' only a municipality; the former was appointed by the ruler of the state but the latter was elected by the [[Cabildo (council)|municipal council]]), the adoption of this term reflects how much Muslim society in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] influenced the Christian one in the early phases of the ''[[Reconquista]]''. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted the Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.

Today, it refers to the executive head of a municipal or local government, who usually does not have judicial functions. The word ''[[Intendant|intendente]]'' is used in [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] for the office that is analogous to a mayor.

In larger cities in [[Mexico]], the chief executive is known as the ''presidente municipal'' or "municipal president".

===Sweden===
The Swedish title ''borgmästare'' ([[burgomaster]]) was abolished in the court reform of 1971 when also the [[stad (Sweden)|towns of Sweden]] were officially abolished. Since the middle of the 20th century, the [[municipal commissioner]] – the highest-ranking politician in each municipality – is informally titled "mayor"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} in English.

===Switzerland===
The function and title for mayor vary from one canton to another. Generally, the mayor presides an executive council of several members governing a [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]].

The title is:
*in Italian: ''Sindaco'' ([[Ticino]]), Podestà ([[Grigioni]])
*in French: ''Maire'' ([[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]), ''Syndic'' ([[Vaud]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]),  ''Président du Conseil municipal'' ([[Valais]]), ''Président du Conseil communal'' ([[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]])
*in German: e.g. ''Stadtpräsident'', ''Stadtammann'', ''Gemeindepräsident'', ''Gemeindeammann''

===Taiwan===
In the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan the mayor is the head of city's government and its city's council, which is in charge of legislative affairs. The mayor and city council are elected separately by the city's residents.

===Turkey===
Mayors ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''Belediye Başkanı'') in Turkey are elected by the municipal councill. As a rule, there are municipalities in all province centers and district centers as well as towns ({{lang-tr|belde}}) which are actually villages with a population in excess of 2000. However beginning by 1983, a new level of municipality is introduced in Turkish administrative system. In big cities Metropolitan municipalities ({{lang-tr|Büyükşehir belediyesi}}) are established. (See [[Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey]]) In a Metropolitan municipality there may be several  district municipalities (hence mayors).

===Ukraine===
In [[Ukraine]] the title ''Mer'' was introduced for the position of the head of the municipal state administration in the federal cities of [[Kiev]] and [[Sevastopol]]. In the rest of the urban and rural settlements the position is unofficial and simply refers to the head of a local council who at the moment of such assignment cannot be affiliated with any party of the council.

===United States===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of mayors of New York City]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Mayoralty in the United States}}

The mayor is the leader in most United States municipalities (such as cities, townships, etc.). In the [[Mayoralty in the United States|United States]], there are several distinct types of mayors, depending on the system of local government. Under [[council-manager government]], the mayor is a [[first among equals]] on the [[city council]], which acts as a legislative body while executive functions are performed by the appointed manager. The mayor may chair the city council, but lacks any special legislative powers. The mayor and city council serve part-time, with day-to-day administration in the hands of a professional city manager. The system is most common among medium-sized cities from around 25,000 to several hundred thousand, usually rural and suburban municipalities.

In the second form, known as [[mayor-council government]], the mayoralty and city council are separate offices. Under a ''strong mayor'' system, the mayor acts as an elected executive with the city council exercising legislative powers. They may select a [[chief administrative officer]] to oversee the different departments. This is the system used in most of the United States' large cities, primarily because mayors serve full-time and have a wide range of services that they oversee. In a ''weak mayor'' or ''ceremonial mayor'' system, the mayor has appointing power for department heads but is subject to checks by the city council, sharing both executive and legislative duties with the council. This is common for smaller cities, especially in [[New England]]. [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] are two notable large cities with a ceremonial mayor.

Many American mayors are styled "His Honor" or "Her Honor" while in office.

==Multi-tier local government==
In several countries, where there is not local [[autonomy]], mayors are often appointed by some branch of the federal or regional government. In some cities, subdivisions such as [[borough]]s may have their own mayors; this is the case, for example, with the [[arrondissement]]s of Paris, [[Montreal]], and [[Mexico City]]. In Belgium, the capital, [[Brussels]], is administratively one of the federation's three regions, and is the only city subdivided, without the other regions' provincial level, into 19 rather small municipalities, which each have an elected—formally appointed—Burgomaster (i.e., Mayor, responsible to his / her elected council); while [[Antwerp]], the other major metropolitan area, has one large city (where the boroughs, former municipalities merged into it, elect a lower level, albeit with very limited competence) and several smaller surrounding municipalities, each under a normal Burgomaster as in Brussels.

In the People's Republic of China, the Mayor (市長) may be the administrative head of any municipality, provincial, prefecture-level, or county-level. The Mayor is usually the most recognized official in cities, although the position is the second-highest-ranking official in charge after the local Communist Party Secretary. In principle, the Mayor (who also serves as the Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the city) is responsible for managing the city administration while the Communist Party Secretary is responsible for general policy and managing the party bureaucracy, but in practice the roles blur, frequently causing conflict.

==Acting mayor==
'''Acting mayor''' is a temporary office created by the charter of some [[municipal]] governments.

In many cities and towns, the charter or some similar fundamental document provides that in the event of the death, illness, resignation, or removal from office of the [[incumbent]] mayor, another official will lead the municipality for a temporary period, which, depending on the jurisdiction, may be for a stated period of days or months until a [[special election]] can be held, or until the original end of the term to which the vacating mayor was elected.

Some cities may also provide for a [[deputy mayor]] to be temporarily designated as "acting mayor" in the event that the incumbent mayor is temporarily unavailable, such as for health reasons or out-of-town travel, but still continues to hold the position and is expected to return to the duties of the office. In this latter capacity, the acting mayor's role is to ensure that city government business can continue in the regular mayor's absence, and the acting mayor is not deemed to have actually held the office of mayor.

The position of acting mayor is usually of considerably more importance in a [[mayor-council]] form of municipal government, where the mayor performs functions of day-to-day leadership, than it is in a [[council-manager]] form of government, where the [[city manager]] provides day-to-day leadership and the position of mayor is either a largely or entirely ceremonial one.

In some jurisdictions, the mayor's successor is not considered to be an acting mayor but rather fully mayor in his or her own right, much in the manner that the [[Vice President of the United States]] is not styled or considered to be [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] following the death or resignation of the [[President of the United States|President]], but rather President in every sense.

'''''Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition''''' is a 2003 book by [[Bent Flyvbjerg]], Nils Bruzelius, and Werner Rothengatter, published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. According to chief economist and director of transportation policy at Infrastructure Management
Group, Inc., Porter K. Wheeler, "this book makes an important contribution to understanding the infrastructure development process worldwide, with focus on [[megaprojects]]."&lt;ref name=wheeler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = Porter K. | year = 2004 | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | journal = Journal of the Transportation Research Forum | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | format = PDF | url = http://journals.oregondigital.org/trforum/article/view/751/646 | pages = 145–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
"[[Megaproject]]s" is the term applied to multibillion-dollar infrastructure developments such as massive dams and bridges, and to elaborate railways and highways. The "megaprojects paradox" is that more of these projects are being implemented, but such projects typically perform very poorly, often with substantial cost overruns and market shortfalls.&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/4/1/115.extract |title=Book Review: Megaprojects and Risk |first=Gordon L. | last = Clark |date=March 2005 |volume = 4 | issue = 1 | journal = Planning Theory |pages=115–119 | doi = 10.1177/147309520500400107| accessdate = Nov 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =brown&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Peter H. |date=November 2005 | title = Book Review: Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | journal = Economic Development Quarterly | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | publisher =  | format = PDF | doi = 10.1177/0891242405279767 | url = http://edq.sagepub.com/content/19/4/387.extract | pages = 387–388| accessdate = Nov 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters two to four examine the [[Channel Tunnel]], which opened in 1994 at a cost of £4.7&amp;nbsp;billion following cost-overruns of 80% which caused several companies to nearly go bankrupt. [[Denver International Airport]], which cost $5&amp;nbsp;billion, opened in 1995 following a 200% cost overrun, and passenger traffic in 1995 was only half that expected. There were also problems with Hong Kong's [[Chek Lap Kok Airport]], opened in 1998, which had low revenues and negatively affected Hong Kong's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | author=Flyvbjerg, B. Buzelius, N. Rothengatter, W. | year = 2003 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-00946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to authors, the reason for these poor performances is that many of the participants in the process have incentives to underestimate costs, overestimate revenues, undervalue environmental impact, and overvalue economic development effects.&lt;ref name=zahariadis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahariadis | first1 = Nikolaos |date=September 2004 | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | journal = Perspectives on Politics | volume = 2| issue = 3 | publisher =  | doi = 10.1017/S1537592704620378 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=246744 | pages = 609–610| accessdate = Nov 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The central problems are lack of accountability and inappropriate risk sharing which can be improved by reforming the institutional arrangements of decision making and to institute accountability at the project development and evaluation stages.&lt;ref name=wheeler/&gt;

The United States '''Military Commissions Act of 2006''',&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 109-366, 120 Stat. 2600 (Oct. 17, 2006), enacting Chapter 47A of title 10 of the [[United States Code]] (as well as amending section 2241 of title 28),&lt;/ref&gt; also known as HR-6166, was an Act of Congress&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill 3930 [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:S.3930: Military Commissions Act of 2006 (as passed by Congress)], S.3930, September 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on October 17, 2006. The Act's stated purpose was "to authorize trial by [[military justice|military commission]] for violations of the [[law of war]], and for other purposes".&lt;ref name=TheAct&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s3930es.txt.pdf Military Commissions Act of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was drafted following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision on ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006),&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/opinion/28thu1.html?ex=1317096000&amp;en=3eb3ba3410944ff9&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss "Rushing Off a Cliff", ''The New York Times'', September 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; which ruled that the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s (CSRT), as established by the [[United States Department of Defense]], were procedurally flawed and unconstitutional, and did not provide protections under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It prohibited [[detainees]] who had been classified as [[enemy combatants]] or were awaiting hearings on their status from using [[habeas corpus]] to petition federal courts in challenges to their detention. All pending habeas corpus cases at the federal district court were stayed.

In ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008), the US Supreme Court held that section 7 of the MCA was unconstitutional because of its restrictions of detainee rights. It determined that detainees had the right to petition federal courts for habeas corpus challenges.

==Scope of the Act==
:Sec. 948b. Military commissions generally
::(a) Purpose— This chapter establishes procedures governing the use of military commissions to try alien unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission.

::(b) Authority for Military Commissions Under This Chapter— The President is authorized to establish military commissions under this chapter for offenses triable by military commission as provided in this chapter.

::(c) Construction of Provisions— The procedures for military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for trial by [[court martial|general court-martial]] under chapter 47 of this title (the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically provided in this chapter. The judicial construction and application of that chapter are not binding on military commissions established under this chapter.

::(d) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions—

:::(1) The following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial by military commission under this chapter:

::::(A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.

::::(B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b), and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to compulsory self-incrimination.

::::(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.

:::(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only to the extent provided by this chapter.

::(e) Treatment of Rulings and Precedents— The findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not be introduced or considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a court-martial convened under chapter 47 of this title. The findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not form the basis of any holding, decision, or other determination of a court-martial convened under that chapter.

::(f) Status of Commissions Under Common Article 3— A military commission established under this chapter is a regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article 3 of the [[Geneva Conventions]].

::(g) Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Source of Rights— No alien unlawful enemy combatant subject to trial by military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights.

:Sec. 948c. Persons subject to military commissions
::Any alien unlawful enemy combatant is subject to trial by military commission under this chapter.

:Sec. 948d. Jurisdiction of military commissions
::(a) Jurisdiction— A military commission under this chapter shall have jurisdiction to try any offense made punishable by this chapter or the law of war when committed by an alien unlawful enemy combatant before, on, or after [[September 11, 2001]].

::(b) Lawful Enemy Combatants— Military commissions under this chapter shall not have jurisdiction over lawful enemy combatants. Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of war are subject to chapter 47 of this title. Courts-martial established under that chapter shall have jurisdiction to try a lawful enemy combatant for any offense made punishable under this chapter.

::(c) Determination of Unlawful Enemy Combatant Status Dispositive— A finding, whether before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, by a [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant is dispositive for purposes of jurisdiction for trial by military commission under this chapter.

::(d) Punishments— A military commission under this chapter may, under such limitations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter, including the penalty of death when authorized under this chapter or the law of war.

The term ''"[[competent tribunal]]"'' is not defined in the Act itself.
It is defined in the US Army Field Manual, section 27–10, for the purpose of determining whether a person is or is not entitled to [[prisoner of war]] status, and consists of a board of not less than three officers. It is also a term used in Article five of the [[third Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;The ICRC [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Commentary on Article 5] says on the issue of ''competent tribunal'' that "At Geneva in 1949, it was first proposed that for the sake of precision the term 'responsible authority' should be replaced by 'military tribunal' (11). This amendment was based on the view that decisions which might have the gravest consequences should Hot [sic] be left to a single person, who might often be of subordinate rank. The matter should be taken to a court, as persons taking part in the fight without the right to do so are liable to be prosecuted for murder or attempted murder, and might even be sentenced to capital punishment (12). This suggestion was not unanimously accepted, however, as it was felt that to bring a person before a military tribunal might have more serious consequences than a decision to deprive him of the benefits afforded by the Convention (13). A further amendment was therefore made to the Stockholm text stipulating that a decision regarding persons whose status was in doubt would be taken by a 'competent tribunal', and not specifically a military tribunal.&lt;br&gt;
Another change was made in the text of the paragraph, as drafted at Stockholm, in order to specify that it applies to cases of doubt as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4 (14). The clarification contained in Article 4 should, of course, reduce the number of doubtful cases in any future conflict.&lt;br&gt;
It therefore seems to us that this provision should not be interpreted too restrictively; the reference in the Convention to 'a belligerent act' relates to the principle which motivated the person who committed it, and not merely the manner in which the act was committed."
*(11) [(2) p.77] See ' Final Record of the Diplomatic Conference
of Geneva of 1949, ' Vol. II-A, p. 388;
*(12) [(3) p.77] Ibid., Vol. III, p. 63, No. 95;
*(13) [(4) p.77] Ibid., Vol. II-B, p. 270;
*(14) [(5) p.77] Ibid., pp. 270-271;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rights guaranteed by the third Geneva Convention to [[lawful combatants]] are expressly denied to ''unlawful'' military combatants for the purposes of this Act by Section 948b (see above).

==Unlawful and lawful enemy combatant==

"Any alien unlawful enemy combatant is subject to trial by military commission under chapter 47A — Military Commissions (of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:S.3930: 10&amp;nbsp;U.S.C.&amp;nbsp;948a (Section 1, Subchapter I)])). The definition of unlawful and lawful enemy combatant is given in [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c109:4:./temp/~c109zcaiHd:e2019: Chapter 47A—Military commission: Subchapter I--General provisions: Sec.&amp;nbsp;948a. Definitions]

{{quote|1=
The term '[[unlawful combatant|unlawful enemy combatant]]' means —
:(i) a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a [[lawful]] enemy combatant (including a person who is part of the [[Taliban]], [[al-Qaida]], or associated forces); or
:(ii) a person who, before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.
...
The term '[[lawful enemy combatant]]' means a person who is —
:(A) a member of the regular forces of a State party engaged in hostilities against the United States;
:(B) a member of a militia, volunteer corps, or organized resistance movement belonging to a State party engaged in such hostilities, which are under responsible command, wear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry their arms openly, and abide by the law of war; or
:(C) a member of a regular armed force who professes allegiance to a government engaged in such hostilities, but not recognized by the United States."|2=[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:S.3930: Law No: 109-366] ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HR06166:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; summary])}}

The Act also defines an alien as "a person who is not a citizen of the United States", and a co-belligerent to mean "any State or armed force joining and directly engaged with the United States in hostilities or directly supporting hostilities against a common enemy."

==Provisions==
The Act changes pre-existing law to forbid explicitly the invocation of the Geneva Conventions when executing the [[writ of habeas corpus]] or in other civil actions [Act&amp;nbsp;sec.&amp;nbsp;5(a)]. This provision applies to all cases pending at the time the Act is enacted, as well as to all such future cases.

If the government chooses to bring a prosecution against the detainee, a military commission is convened for this purpose. The following rules are some of those established for trying alien unlawful enemy combatants.

&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) NOTICE TO ACCUSED—Upon the swearing of the charges
and specifications in accordance with subsection (a), the accused
shall be informed of the charges against him as soon as practicable.
* A civilian defense [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] may not be used unless the attorney has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information that is classified at the level Secret or higher. [{{nowrap|10 U.S.C. sec. 949c(b)(3)(D)}}]
* A finding of Guilty by a particular commission requires only a two-thirds majority of the members of the commission present at the time the vote is taken [{{nowrap|10 U.S.C. sec. 949m(a)}}]
* In General— No person may invoke the Geneva Conventions or any protocols thereto in any ''habeas corpus'' or other civil action or proceeding to which the United States, or a current or former officer, employee, member of the Armed Forces, or other agent of the United States is a party as a source of rights in any court of the United States or its States or territories. [{{nowrap|Act sec. 5(a)}}]
* As provided by the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] and by this section, the President has the authority for the United States to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions and to promulgate higher standards and administrative regulations for violations of treaty obligations which are not grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. [{{nowrap|Act sec. 6(a)(3)(A)}}]
* No person may, without his consent, be tried by a military commission under this chapter a second time for the same offense. [{{nowrap|10 U.S.C. sec. 949h(a)}}].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Act also contains provisions (often referred to as the "habeas provisions") removing access to the courts for any alien detained by the United States government who is determined to be an enemy combatant, or who is 'awaiting determination' regarding enemy combatant status.  This allows the United States government to detain such aliens indefinitely without prosecuting them in any manner.

These provisions are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630220512/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c109:3:./temp/~c109IRC4fi:e116721: Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(e)(1) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the United States who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.

(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section &amp;nbsp;1005(e) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 ({{nowrap|10 U.S.C. 801}} note), no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the United States and has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.}}

Among other things, the MCA created the position of [[Chief Defense Counsel (United States)]].

==''Boumediene v. Bush'' (2008)==
In ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008), the US Supreme Court held that the MCA was unconstitutional as it restricted detainees' use of habeas corpus and access to the federal courts. It determined that detainees could have access to federal courts to hear habeas corpus petitions, to restore the protection of the Constitution.

===Amendment in 2009===
The [[Military Commissions Act of 2009]] amended some of the provisions of the 2006 Act to improve protections for defendants. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] summarized the positive aspects as "restricting coerced and hearsay evidence and providing greater defense counsel resources." Overall, it argued that the law as amended still fell "short of providing the [[due process]] required by the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;

| archivedate=2009-12-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
There is a controversy over whether this law affects the rights of [[habeas corpus]] for United States citizens.

The text of the law states that its "purpose" is to "establish procedures governing the use of military commissions to try [[Alien (law)|alien]] [[Unlawful combatants|unlawful enemy combatants]] engaged in hostilities against the United States for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission." While the most controversial provisions in the law refer to "alien unlawful enemy combatants", section&amp;nbsp;948a refers to "unlawful enemy combatants" (not explicitly excluding US citizens).

[[Cato Institute]] legal scholar [[Robert A. Levy]] writes that the Act denies [[habeas corpus|habeas rights]] only to aliens, and that US citizens detained as "unlawful combatants" would still have habeas rights with which to challenge their indefinite detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/10/02/does-the-military-commission-act-apply-to-us-citizens/ |title=Does the Military Commission Act Apply to U.S. Citizens? |accessdate=2007-05-23 |last=Levy |first=Robert A. |date=2006-10-02 |work=Cato-at-liberty |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; While formally opposed to the Act, [[Human Rights Watch]] has also concluded that the new law limits the scope of trials by military commissions to non-US citizens including all legal aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hrw.org/backgrounder/usa/qna1006/ |title=Q and A: Military Commissions Act of 2006 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=October 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]] legal commentator Andrew Cohen, commenting on this question, writes that the "suspension of the writ of [[habeas corpus]]—the ability of an imprisoned person to challenge their confinement in court—applies only to resident aliens within the United States as well as other foreign nationals captured here and abroad" and that "it does not restrict the rights and freedoms and liberties of U.S. citizens {{Sic|hide=y|any|more|expected=any more}} than they already have been restricted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/10/19/couricandco/entry2109264.shtml |title=Habeas Corpus: Working on Commissions |accessdate=2007-05-23 |last=Cohen |first=Andrew |date=2006-10-19 |work=Couric &amp; Co |publisher=[[CBS News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, congressman [[David Wu]] (D–OR) stated in the debate over the bill on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] that "by so restricting habeas corpus, this bill does not just apply to enemy aliens. It applies to all Americans because, while the provision on page 93 has the word "alien in it, the provision on page 61 does not have the word alien in it." For more on this interpretation, see [[#Criticism|criticism]].

==Legislative history==
The bill, {{USBill|109|S|3930}}, passed the Senate, 65–34, on September 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00259#position Roll call vote], via www.senate.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill passed in the House, 250–170–12, on September 29, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.asp?year=2006&amp;rollnumber=508 Roll call vote], via clerk.house.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush signed the bill into law on October 17, 2006.

===Legislative actions in the Senate===
Several amendments were proposed before final passage of the bill by the Senate; all were defeated.  Among them were an amendment by [[Robert Byrd]] which would have added a [[sunset provision]] after five years, an amendment by [[Ted Kennedy]] directing the Secretary of State to notify other countries that the U.S. considered waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques to be grave breaches of the Geneva Convention (SA.5088&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00258 S.Amdt. 5088 to S. 3930, which would have outlawed specific interrogation techniques including waterboarding]&lt;/ref&gt;), and an amendment by [[Arlen Specter]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]–[[List of United States Senators from Pennsylvania|PA]]) and [[Patrick Leahy]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–[[List of United States Senators from Vermont|VT]]) preserving habeas corpus. The Kennedy amendment was defeated on separation of powers grounds although the Republican manager of the bill and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner (R-VA), noted that he agreed with Sen. Kennedy that the techniques were grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and "clearly prohibited by the bill." Specter's amendment was rejected by a vote of 51–48. Specter voted for the bill despite the defeat of his amendment. The bill was finally passed by the House on September 29, 2006 and presented to the President for signing on October 10, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN03930:@@@X thomas.loc.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the act say that the Constitutional provision guaranteeing [[habeas corpus]] does not apply to alien enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States, and that the provisions of the Act removing [[habeas corpus]] do not apply to United States [[citizens]];  they conclude that therefore the law does not conflict with the Constitution.

[[National Review]] columnist Andrew McCarthy argued that since the law applies to "aliens with no immigration status who are captured and held outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and whose only connection to our country is to wage a barbaric war against it" they do not have a constitutional right to habeas corpus. McCarthy also wrote that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, while not allowing a standard habeas corpus review, provides that each detainee "has a right to appeal to our civilian-justice system. — specifically, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. And if that appeal is unsuccessful, the terrorist may also seek certiorari review by the Supreme Court."&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YWNlMjg3YWRlNmNjMTk0NDc1NzE0ZWI2YzBlOGRlNzU= The New Detainee Law Does Not Deny Habeas Corpus], Andrew McCarthy, National Review, October 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Yoo]], a former Bush Administration [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] official and current professor of law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], called the Act a "stinging rebuke" of the Supreme Court's [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]] ruling, calling that ruling "an unprecedented attempt by the court to rewrite the law of war and intrude into war policy." Yoo cited [[Johnson v. Eisentrager]], in which the court decided that it would not hear habeas claims brought by alien enemy prisoners held outside the US and refused to interpret the Geneva Conventions to give rights in civilian court against the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009113 Sending a Message Congress to courts: Get out of the war on terror], [[John Yoo]], [[Opinionjournal]], October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|US Army Judge Advocate General's Corps]] and current professor at [[St. Mary's University School of Law]], Jeffrey Addicott wrote "the new Military Commissions Act reflects a clear and much-needed Congressional commitment to the war on terror, which to this point has been largely conducted in legal terms by the executive branch with occasional interjections from the judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/10/military-commissions-act-congress.php The Military Commissions Act: Congress Commits to the War on Terror]; Jeffrey Addicott; [[JURIST]]; October 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George W. Bush]], [[President of the United States]]:
:Today, the Senate sent a strong signal to the terrorists that we will continue using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks on America. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that has been one of America's most potent tools in fighting the [[War on Terror]]. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060928/nyth173.html?.v=53 Statement by President Bush], PRNewswire, Source: White House Press Office, September 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McCain]], [[United States Senator]]:
:Simply put, this legislation ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency to the process of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to this legislation from some quarters, including the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=NewsCenter.ViewPressRelease&amp;Content_id=2456 Statement] of Senator [[John McCain]], On the Military Commissions Act, S. 3930, September 28, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===MCA ruled unconstitutional re: suspension of habeas corpus===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008) that the MCA constituted an unconstitutional encroachment of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' rights, and established jurisdiction for federal courts to hear petitions for ''habeas'' corpus from Guantanamo detainees tried under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the provisions of MCA suspending ''Habeas Corpus'' are no longer in effect.

A number of legal scholars and Congressional members—including Senator [[Arlen Specter]], who was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and the [[Ranking Member]] of the Senate Judiciary Committee—previously criticized the habeas provision of the Act as violating [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Civil and legal protections|a clause of the Constitution]] that says the right to challenge detention "shall not be suspended" except in cases of "rebellion or invasion".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/19/AR2006101901692.html?nav=rss_nation/special "Court Told It Lacks Power in Detainee Cases"], ''Washington Post'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the House debate, Representative [[David Wu]] of [[Oregon]] offered this scenario:
:Let us say that my wife, who is here in the gallery with us tonight, a sixth generation Oregonian, is walking by the friendly, local military base and is picked up as an unlawful enemy combatant. What is her recourse? She says, &amp;ldquo;I am a U.S. citizen&amp;rdquo;. That is a jurisdictional fact under this statute, and she will not have recourse to the courts? She can take it to [[Donald Rumsfeld]], but she cannot take it across the street to an article&amp;nbsp;3 court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_cr/h092706.html "House Floor Debate on Military Commissions Act"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following debate in the House and Senate, the final law revoked ''Habeas Corpus'' protections only for non-citizens:
:(e)(1) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' filed by or on behalf of an '''alien''' detained by the United States who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an [[enemy combatant]] or is awaiting such determination.

Hence in the preceding example, if Wu's wife, a citizen, were picked up outside a military base, Wu could walk across the street and file a ''habeas corpus'' petition with the courts.  Since the Supreme Court in 2008 ruled the restrictions on ''habeas corpus'' provisions invalid, in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'', non-citizens can also request the courts review the legality of their arrest and imprisonment.

===Broad definition of enemy combatant===
According to [[Bill Goodman]], past Legal Director of the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], and Joanne Mariner, from [[FindLaw]], this bill redefines unlawful enemy combatant in such a broad way&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2006/10/challenging-military-commissions-act.php Challenging the Military Commissions Act], Jurist, October 04, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that it refers to any person who is
:engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States.

From Section 950q. Principals:
:Any person is punishable as a principal under this chapter who commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission.

This makes it possible for US citizens to be designated unlawful enemy combatant&lt;ref&gt;

[[Jennifer Van Bergen]], a journalist with a law degree, responds to the comment that habeas corpus has never been afforded to foreign combatants with the suggestion that, using the current sweeping definition of [[war on terror]] and [[unlawful combatant]], it is impossible to know where the battlefield is and who combatants are. Also, she notes that most of the detentions are already unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/rights/43691/”http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/09/does-military-commissions-act-apply-to.html Bush's Brave New World of Torture] Jennifer Van Bergen, [[TomPaine.com]], November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also suggests that unlawful enemy combatant refers to any person
:who, before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.
Some commentators have interpreted this to mean that if the President says you are an enemy combatant, then you effectively are.&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Patrick Leahy]], [[United States Senator]]:
:Passing laws that remove the few checks against mistreatment of prisoners will not help us win the battle for the hearts and minds of the generation of young people around the world being recruited by [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al Qaeda]]. Authorizing indefinite detention of anybody the Government designates, without any proceeding and without any recourse—is what our worst critics claim the United States would do, not what American values, traditions and our rule of law would have us do. This is not just a bad bill, this is a dangerous bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200609/092806c.html Statement] of Senator [[Patrick Leahy]], On the Military Commissions Act, S. 3930, September 28, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

One Bush administration critic described the Act as "the legalization of the [[José Padilla (alleged terrorist)|José Padilla]] treatment"—referring to the American citizen who was declared an unlawful enemy combatant and then imprisoned for three years before finally being charged with a lesser crime than was originally alleged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/09/legalization-of-torture-an_115945829460324274.html "The legalization of torture and permanent detention", Glenn Greenwald]&lt;/ref&gt; A legal brief filed on Padilla's behalf alleges that during his imprisonment Padilla was subjected to [[sensory deprivation]], [[sleep deprivation]], and enforced stress positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/10/bush-administrations-torture-of-us.html " The Bush administration's torture of U.S. citizen Jose Padilla"]&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to be held by the United States and now has access to US courts.

=== Claims the MCA is an unconstitutional ex post facto law ===
Another criticism is that the Act violates the Constitution's prohibition against [[ex post facto]] laws.  Pro human rights group [[Human Rights First]] stated that "In violation of this fundamental tenet of the rule of law, defendants could be convicted for actions that were not illegal when they were taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Analysis of Proposed Rules for Military Commissions Trials| publisher =[[Human Rights First]]| year =2007| url = http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/07125-usls-hrf-rcm-analysis.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-30 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joanne Mariner, an attorney who serves as the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program Director at [[Human Rights Watch]], described the issue this way:
:The MCA states that it does not create any new crimes, but simply codifies offenses "that have traditionally been triable by military commissions." This provision is meant to convince the courts that there are no ex post facto problems with the offenses that the bill lists. In ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld'', however, a plurality of the Supreme Court (four justices) found that conspiracy—one of the offenses enumerated in the MCA—was not a crime triable by military commission. The bill's statement that conspiracy is a traditional war crime, does not, by legislative fiat, make it so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Mariner| first =Joanne  | title =The Military Commissions Act of 2006: A Short Primer| publisher =[[FindLaw]]| date =October 9, 2006  | url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/mariner/20061009.html | accessdate =  2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor John P. Cerone, the co-chair of the [[American Society of International Law]] Human Rights Interest Group, adds that the Act "risks running afoul of the principle against ex post facto criminalization, as recognized in international law (article 15 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]) as well as US constitutional law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cerone| first =John P.  | title =The Military Commissions Act of 2006:Examining the Relationship between the International Law of Armed Conflict and US Law | publisher =American Society of International Law| date =November 13, 2006| url =http://www.asil.org/insights/2006/11/insights061114.html| accessdate = 2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protections from criminal and civil prosecutions for previous instances of alleged torture===
Two provisions of the MCA have been criticized for allegedly making it harder to prosecute and convict officers and employees of the US government for misconduct in office.

First, the MCA changed the definition of war crimes for which US government defendants can be prosecuted. Under the [[War Crimes Act of 1996]], any violation of [[Third Geneva Convention|Common Article&amp;nbsp;3 of the Geneva Conventions]] was considered a war crime and could be criminally prosecuted.  Section&amp;nbsp;6 of the Military Commissions Act amended the War Crimes Act so that only actions specifically defined as "grave breaches" of Common Article&amp;nbsp;3 could be the basis for a prosecution, and it made that definition retroactive to November 26, 1997. The specific actions defined in section&amp;nbsp;6 of the Military Commissions Act include [[torture]], cruel or inhumane treatment, [[murder]], [[mutilation]] or [[maiming]], intentionally causing serious bodily harm, [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] or abuse, and the [[hostage|taking of hostages]]. According to Mariner of Human Rights Watch, the effect is "that perpetrators of several categories of what were war crimes at the time they were committed, can no longer be punished under U.S. law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Mariner| first =Joanne| title =The Military Commissions Act of 2006: A Short Primer (Part Two)| publisher =[[FindLaw]]| date =October 25, 2006| url =http://writ.news.findlaw.com/mariner/20061025.html| accessdate = 2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] adds:
:The MCA's restricted definitions arguably would exempt certain U.S. officials who have implemented or had [[command responsibility]] for [[coercive interrogation techniques]] from war crimes prosecutions.&lt;br&gt;. . . .&lt;br&gt;This amendment is designed to protect U.S. government perpetrators of abuses during the "war on terror" from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Center for Constitutional Rights  | authorlink =Center for Constitutional Rights | title =Military Commissions Act of 2006: A Summary of the Law| date =  | url =http://ccrjustice.org/files/MCA%20Factsheet%209-23-08.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate = 2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a provision of the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] (section 1004(a)) had created a new [[Defense (legal)|defense]] as well as a provision to providing [[lawyer|counsel]] for agents involved in the detention and interrogation of individuals "believed to be engaged in or associated with international terrorist activity". The 2006 MCA amended section&amp;nbsp;1004(a) of the Detainee Treatment Act to guarantee free counsel in the event of civil or criminal prosecution and applied the above mentioned legal defense to prosecutions for conduct that occurred during the period September 11, 2001 to December 30, 2005. Although the provision recognizes the possibility of civil and or criminal proceedings, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] has criticised this claiming that "The MCA retroactively immunizes some U.S. officials who have engaged in illegal actions which have been authorized by the Executive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Center for Constitutional Rights | authorlink =Center for Constitutional Rights | title =Military Commissions Act of 2006: A Summary of the Law| date = | url =http://ccrjustice.org/files/MCA%20Factsheet%209-23-08.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate = 2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other claims the MCA is a violation of human rights===
[[Amnesty International]] said that the Act "contravenes human rights principles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-060930-features-eng "US Congress gives green light to human rights violations in the 'war on terror'" Amnesty International, September 29, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and an editorial in ''The New York Times'' described the Act as "a tyrannical law that will be ranked with the low points in American democracy, our generation's version of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]],"&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; while [[American Civil Liberties Union]] Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said, "The president can now, with the approval of Congress, indefinitely hold people without charge, take away protections against horrific abuse, put people on trial based on hearsay evidence, authorize trials that can sentence people to death based on testimony literally beaten out of witnesses, and slam shut the courthouse door for habeas petitions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2006/10/17/national/w071356D13.DTL&amp;type=printable "Bush signs terror interrogation law", Associated Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Turley]], professor of constitutional law at [[George Washington University]], called the Military Commissions Act of 2006 "a huge sea change for our democracy. The framers created a system where we did not have to rely on the good graces or good mood of the president. In fact, [[James Madison|Madison]] said that he created a system essentially to be run by devils, where they could not do harm, because we didn't rely on their good motivations. Now we must."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15318240/ 'National yawn as our rights evaporate' - Countdown with Keith Olbermann - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nat Hentoff opined in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"conditions of confinement and a total lack of the due process that the Supreme Court ordered in [[Rasul v. Bush]] and [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]"
make US government officials culpable for war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0651,hentoff,75320,2.html Our Own Nuremberg Trials] by Nat Hentoff, Village Voice, December 17th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Application==
Immediately after Bush signed the Act into law, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] notified the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] that the Court no longer had jurisdiction over a combined ''habeas'' case that it had been considering since 2004. A notice dated the following day listed 196 other pending habeas cases for which it made the same claim.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

===First use===
On November 13, 2006, the Department of Justice asserted in a motion&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pdf/al-marrimotiontodismissforlackofjurisdiction.pdf Juris.law.pitt.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705063201/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pdf/al-marrimotiontodismissforlackofjurisdiction.pdf |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] that, according to the Act, [[Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri]] should be tried in a military tribunal as an enemy combatant rather than in a civilian court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/11/doj-asserts-mca-bars-enemy-immigrants.php DOJ asserts MCA bars enemy immigrants, Gitmo detainees from judicial review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222031516/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/11/doj-asserts-mca-bars-enemy-immigrants.php |date=2007-12-22 }}, ''[[Jurist]]'', November 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The document begins with:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 27(f), respondent-appellee Commander S.L. Wright respectfully moves this Court to remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Respondent-appellee has conferred with counsel for petitioner-appellant, and they agree with the briefing schedule proposed below. As explained below, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366 (see Attachment&amp;nbsp;1), which took effect on October 17, 2006, removes federal court jurisdiction over pending and future habeas corpus actions and any other actions filed by or on behalf of detained aliens determined by the United States to be enemy combatants, such as petitioner-appellant al- Marri, except as provided in Section&amp;nbsp;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). In plain terms, the MCA removes this Court's jurisdiction (as well as the district court's) over al-Marri's habeas action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Initial prosecutions===
Of the first three war crimes cases brought against Guantanamo Bay detainees under the MCA, one resulted in a [[plea bargain]] and the two others were dismissed on [[jurisdiction]]al grounds.

The first person prosecuted under the MCA was [[David Matthew Hicks]], an Australian. The outcome of his trial was prescribed by a pre-trial agreement negotiated between Hicks's defense counsel and the [[convening authority]], [[Susan J. Crawford]] on March 26, 2007. The agreement stipulated an effective sentence of nine months in exchange for his guilty plea and compliance with other conditions. On March 31, 2007, the tribunal handed down a seven-year sentence, of which all but nine months was suspended, with the remainder to be served in Australia.&lt;ref name='HicksPlea'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/04/horton-plea-bargain-hicks |title=The Plea Bargain of David Hicks |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |work=[[Harper's Magazine]] |author=Scott Horton |date=2007-04-02 |accessdate=2007-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175952/http://harpers.org/archive/2007/04/horton-plea-bargain-hicks |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2007, in two separate cases, military tribunals dismissed charges against detainees who had been designated as "enemy combatants" but not as "unlawful enemy combatants".  The first case was that of [[Omar Khadr]], a Canadian who had been designated as an "enemy combatant" in 2004.  Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002.  [[Colonel]] [[Peter Brownback]] ruled that the military tribunals, created to deal with "unlawful enemy combatants," had no jurisdiction over detainees who had been designated only as "enemy combatants." He dismissed without prejudice all charges against Khadr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Koring| first =Paul  | title =U.S. case against Khadr collapses| newspaper =[[The Globe and Mail|Toronto Globe and Mail]]| year =2007| url =https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070604.wkhadr0604_1/BNStory/International/home| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Also on June 4, [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and uniformed services|Captain]] [[Keith J. Allred]] reached the same conclusion in the case of [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]].&lt;ref name='NYT20070605_Glaberson'&gt;{{Cite news| last =Glaberson| first =William  | title =Military Judges Dismiss Charges for 2 Detainees| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date =June 5, 2007| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/world/americas/05gitmo.html?hp| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense]] responded by stating: "We believe that Congress intended to grant jurisdiction under the Military Commissions Act to individuals, like Mr. Khadr, who are being held as enemy combatants under existing C.S.R.T. procedures."  That position was called "dead wrong" by Specter.&lt;ref name='NYT20070605_Glaberson' /&gt;

==Court challenge==
{{Main|Boumediene v. Bush}}
On December 13, 2006, [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]] challenged the MCA's declination of habeas corpus to "alien unlawful enemy combatants" in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]. Judge [[James Robertson (judge)|James Robertson]], who ruled in favor of Hamdan in the ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld'' case, refused to rule in favor of Hamdan in this case regarding habeas corpus, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Constitution does not provide alien enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay with the constitutional right to file a petition for [[habeas corpus]] in our civilian courts, and thus Congress may regulate those combatants' access to the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/13/AR2006121301946.html Judge Rejects Detention Challenge of Bin Laden's Driver], ''[[Washington Post]]'' December 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 2007, the Supreme Court declined to hear two cases challenging the MCA: ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' and ''[[Al Odah v. United States]]'' On June 29, 2007, the court reversed that decision, releasing an order that expressed their intent to hear the challenge.

Even though detainees now have the right to challenge the government's basis of their detention, that does not guarantee release as evidenced by the Dec 14th, 2009 ruling of U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan who upheld continued detention of [[Musa'ab Al-Madhwani]] in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba even though the court determined that he was not a continuing threat, the government met its burden of proving he was a member of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/14/AR2009121402275.html U.S. can continue to detain Yemeni], ''[[Washington Post]]'' December 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2466">The '''National Anti-Sweating League''' is the name adopted by two groups of social reformers in Australia and Britain at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Both campaigned against the poor conditions endured by many workers in so-called [[sweatshop]]s and called for a [[minimum wage]].

==Australia==
The National Anti-Sweating League was inaugurated in [[Melbourne]] on 29 Jul 1895, with Rev. A. Gosman as president, [[Samuel Mauger]] as secretary, and [[Alfred Deakin]] as treasurer.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;Race Mathews (1993) ''Australia's First Fabians: Middle-class Radicals, Labour Activists and the Early Labour Movement'' Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-44133-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vida Goldstein]] was another member.&lt;ref name=Lees&gt;Lees, Kirsten (1995) ''Votes for Women: The Australian Story'' St. Leonards: Allen &amp; Unwin, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;  Their efforts resulted in wage regulation via the Factory Act of 1896.&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 "Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
The National Anti-Sweating League was an all-party pressure group formed in 1906 with a 3-day conference in the [[Guildhall, London]].&lt;ref name=Blackburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMirror1906&gt;Daily Mirror 18 October 1906&lt;/ref&gt;  341 delegates representing (via [[trade union]]s) some two million workers attended.&lt;ref name=Blackburn/&gt; Notable members included [[Alfred George Gardiner]],&lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite book |title= Sweated Industry and the Minimum Wage|last=Black |first= Clementina|year= 1907|publisher= Duckworth &amp; Co |location= London|page= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dywXAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R.

The amendment included the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress declares that the National Park Service, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superb environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|16|1a-1}}, ''National Park System: administration; declaration of findings and purpose''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this amendment, the [[Congress of the United States]] required the entire National Park System be managed as a whole, and not as constituent parts.

==History==

=== Early years ===
The party was founded in 2016, by [[Justin Barrett]] as party president and [[James Reynolds (Irish politician)|James Reynolds]] as party vice president. The National Party had planned to hold its press launch in the [[Merrion Hotel]] in Dublin but the event was cancelled by the hotel, which refused to say why.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/merrion-hotel-cancels-launch-of-anti-immigration-political-party-1.2870264|title=Merrion Hotel cancels launch of anti-immigration political party|last=D'Arcy|first=Ciarán|date=16 November 2016|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's press release claimed they seek to espouse the "true spirit of the Republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/the-national-party-merrion-hotel-3084352-Nov2016/|title=Dublin hotel cancels launch of new extreme right-wing party which had been planned for tomorrow|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=7 February 2018|publisher=TheJournal.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett, from Tipperary, has a background in [[pro-life]] and [[anti-immigration]] politics, formerly being a leading figure in [[Youth Defence]] and campaigning against the [[Treaty of Nice#The Irish referenda|Treaty of Nice]].

The party held its first [[Ardfheis]] in November 2017, at Donald Trump's [[Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland|Doonbeg hotel]] in County Clare. Approximately fifty delegates attended. Justin Barrett criticised [[Fine Gael]] in his speech for not calling its annual conference an ardfheis. [[Garda whistleblower scandal#John Wilson|John Wilson]], a guest speaker, challenged "homophobic" comments made by deputy leader James Reynolds. Barrett defended Reynolds' comments and reportedly answered in the affirmative when asked by Wilson whether the National Party was "only for straight Irish people". Wilson then walked out in protest at the comments.&lt;ref name="times20171126" /&gt;

The party held its second Ardfheis in County Fermanagh, at which Barrett spoke strongly in favour of a United Ireland in reaction to [[Brexit]].

=== Abortion Never campaign ===
Abortion Never was formed as a No campaign by the National Party in March 2018 to contest the Irish abortion referendum, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/yes-and-no-campaigners-register-as-third-parties-with-watchdog-1.3471743?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/yes-and-no-campaigners-register-as-third-parties-with-watchdog-1.3471743|title=Yes and No campaigners register as ‘third parties’ with watchdog|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It ends in euthanasia, because they already have a plan. You see discussions in the newspapers sometimes, ‘What are we going to do about the pensions crisis?’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/you-re-next-if-law-repealed-far-right-tells-elderly-b88qj0wn6|title=You’re next if abortion law repealed, far-right tells elderly|last=Coyne|first=Ellen|date=21 March 2018|work=The Times|access-date=26 March 2018|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, he called for the abortion referendum campaign to be "as divisive as possible". During the course of the referendum campaign Barrett suggested that doctors who perform abortions should receive the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/jim-jefferies-abortion-sketch-3977137-Apr2018/|title=An Australian comedian made an Irish anti-abortion campaigner travel to the UK to interview him about abortion|last=O'Neill|first=Rachel|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was ultimately approved by 66.4% of voters.

== Ideology and policies ==
Descriptions of the National Party in the press have ranged from it being right wing&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-irish-golf-course-lost-23-million-in-2016/2018/01/02/b410a14c-ef5b-11e7-b390-a36dc3fa2842_story.html|title=Trump’s Irish golf course lost $2.3 million in 2016|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|date=2 January 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to far-right.&lt;ref name="larkin3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/farright-partys-launch-is-cancelled-35222497.html|title=Far-right party's launch is cancelled|last1=Larkin|first1=Laura|date=17 November 2016|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Justin Barrett, 2017 Ard Fheis (cropped).jpg|thumb|National Party leader Justin Barrett at the party's 2017 Ard Fheis in County Clare.]]

The party supports a renegotiation of Ireland's relationship with the EU, including a withdrawal from the [[Eurozone]], but does not support exiting the European Union itself. They have described the EU as "dictatorial".&lt;ref name="IT20161118"/&gt;

The party makes an [[Irredentism#Ireland|irredentist claim]] on [[Northern Ireland]]; the first of its "nine principles" is copied from the [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland#1937–1999 version|old Article 2 of the Irish Constitution]]: "The National Party believes that the territory of Ireland consists of the whole island of [[Ireland]], its islands and the territorial seas."&lt;ref name="np_website_1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalparty.ie/principles/|title=National Party Principles - The National Party|work=The National Party|access-date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It advocates the reintroduction of the [[death penalty]] for "particularly heinous crimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparty.ie/principles/|title=Principles|publisher=National Party|access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party opposes [[same-sex marriage]], stating that it is "against gay marriage, but not gay people".&lt;ref name="IT20161118"/&gt; In 2016 Barrett declared marriage equality a "sham" and "not natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.ie/archives/irish-news/243704/new-national-party-leader-justin-barrett-wants-ban-on-muslims-entering-ireland/|title=New National Party leader Justin Barrett wants ban on Muslims entering Ireland|date=17 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The party opposes allowing any law permitting [[abortion]] in Ireland, supports repeal of the [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013]], supports a reversal of the Supreme Court's judgement in the [[Attorney General v. X|X Case]] (method unstated), and supported the retention of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparty.ie/press-statement-national-party-citizens-assembly-outcome/|title=Press Statement by the National Party on the “Citizens’ Assembly” Outcome|date=29 April 2017|access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party endorsed a No vote in the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018|abortion referendum]], and campaigned against it through the Abortion Never campaign.

Barret has spoken in support of [[Protectionism|protectionist]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piv3fEcZOE8|title=Justin Barrett - Setting a New Economic Agenda for Ireland|last=|first=|date=|website=[[YouTube]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal threats==
In the early 2000s, Bulgarian and international authorities recognized organized crime and corruption as grave ongoing problems exacerbated by Bulgaria’s geographic location along major international smuggling lines. In 2003 Bulgaria adopted a National Drugs Strategy for the period 2003–8, modeled on the [[European Union]] (EU) strategy. As of mid-2005, an interministerial anticorruption commission, established in 2002, had not reduced corruption to the satisfaction of the EU. Prosecution of organized crime figures, who are known to operate sophisticated networks in Bulgaria, has been rare. [[Domestic violence]] against women and organized [[Human trafficking|trafficking in women]] are considered serious problems. However, between 2001 and 2004 the overall crime rate decreased.

'''Opal Kunz''' (November 6, 1894 – May 15, 1967)&lt;ref name=birthdate/&gt;  was an early American [[aviator]], the chief organizer of the [[Betsy Ross Air Corps]], and a charter member of the [[Ninety-Nines]] organization of women pilots. In 1930, she became the first woman pilot to race with men in an open competition. She made many public appearances to urge more women to take up flying. 

==Personal history==
Opal Logan Giberson was born in 1894 or 1896 in Missouri to Edward F. Giberson and his wife.&lt;ref name=maidenname/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt; She graduated from Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt;

In 1923, she married mineralogist [[George Frederick Kunz]] (1856–1932).&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt7/&gt; The marriage was annulled in 1929.&lt;ref name=nyt3/&gt; The couple remained on good terms, with Kunz caring for George for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name=nyt3/&gt; On his death, he left her a substantial bequest.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=wdn/&gt;

==Aviation career==
Kunz earned her pilot's license in 1929. A crash two weeks later in New Jersey drew extensive press coverage; she escaped uninjured.&lt;ref name=nyt5/&gt;&lt;ref name=dn29/&gt; A second crash two years later left her with gasoline burns. &lt;ref name=nys3/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt9/&gt; 

She spent a great deal of time and money on her flying pursuits and always named her planes after [[Betsy Ross]].&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt; On April 7, 1930, at the Philadelphia American Legion Benefit Air Meet, she became the first woman to race with men in open competition.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; She won the race.&lt;ref name=nyt4/&gt; 

Kunz gave frequent press interviews and radio addresses to urge more women to take up flying.&lt;ref name=wabc/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt6/&gt;&lt;ref name=nys4/&gt;

===Powder Puff Derby===
In 1929, Kunz participated in the first [[Women's Air Derby]], later dubbed the "Powder Puff Derby" by humorist Will Rogers. At the time, there were only 70 licensed female pilots in the entire United States, and only 40 qualified to take part in this contest. The transcontinental course began in Santa Monica, California, and ended in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Race rules stipulated that the aircraft must have horsepower "appropriate for a woman." Kunz was told her own 300-horsepower Beech [[Travel Air]] was too fast for a woman to handle and would not be allowed. Forced to  borrow a less-powerful airplane in order to take part in the race, she finished eighth.&lt;ref name="Jessen"&gt;Jessen, Gene Nora. [http://www.ninety-nines.org/1929airrace.html "The 1929 Air Race"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519071136/http://www.ninety-nines.org/1929airrace.html |date=2009-05-19 }}. The Ninety-Nines website. Accessed  May 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Jack Donaldson===
On September 7, 1930, Kunz loaned her plane to aviator [[John Donaldson (aviator)|John Donaldson]] at the American Legion Air Races meet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Donaldson suffered fatal injuries when the airplane fell from a height of 1,800 feet straight down into the municipal airfield.&lt;ref name=gscn/&gt;

===Betsy Ross Air Corps===
Kunz was an organizer of the [[Betsy Ross Air Corps]], a paramilitary service formed to support to support the Army Air Corps (the precursor to the U.S. Air Force) in national defense and to serve as humanitarian "air minutemen"&lt;ref name=simbeck/&gt; in times of emergency.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=douglas/&gt;&lt;ref name=nys/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=newark/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; It also had the goal of offering flight instruction to women in order to build a reserve group of women aviators.&lt;ref name=nys/&gt;&lt;ref name=es/&gt;&lt;ref name=es2/&gt; Kunz grew the corps to about 100 members, partially funding it herself.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyht/&gt; She served as the corps' first commander, and her husband designed its insignia.&lt;ref name=nys/&gt;&lt;ref name=dmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=nys2/&gt;&lt;ref name=altick/&gt; The short-lived corps (1931–1933) was never formally recognized by the U.S. military.

===World War II===
As World War II approached, Kunz began teaching aviation students at [[Arkansas State College]]. In 1942, she moved to Rhode Island, and at the start of World War II became an instructor at the [[T. F. Green Airport|Rhode Island state airport]] for Navy cadets and for the government-sponsored [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]]. She taught several hundred young men how to fly for the war effort.&lt;ref name="Canton"/&gt; 

==Later years==
After the war, she became an inspector for the [[Aerojet]] Corporation in California.&lt;ref name="Canton"/&gt; 

In 1961, following after the historic space flight of the Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]], she wrote to President [[John F. Kennedy]] to volunteer her services as an American astronaut. In honor of her extensive aviation experience, the president wrote her a courteous reply.&lt;ref name=Canton /&gt;

Kunz [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/48266661/opal-logan-kunz died] at home in [[Auburn, California]] in 1967.

The '''''Parti socialiste du Québec''''' ('''PSQ''', English: ''Socialist Party of Quebec'') was a [[List of political parties in Quebec|provincial party]] in [[Quebec]]. The PSQ was founded in November 1963 as the result of a split at the founding conference of the original [[Parti de la Democratie Socialiste|New Democratic Party of Quebec]], held in June 1963, over the issue of Quebec self-determination with [[Michel Chartrand]], former leader of the [[Parti social démocratique du Québec]], among the nationalists supporting self-determination.&lt;ref name=source&gt;{{cite web|title=Parti socialiste du Québec &amp;#171; QuébecPolitique.com|url=http://www.quebecpolitique.com/partis-politiques/les-partis/parti-socialiste-du-quebec/|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roch Denis (1979), Luttes de classes et question nationale au Québec, 1948-1968|url=http://classiques.uqac.ca/contemporains/denis_roch/luttes_de_classes_quest_nat/luttes_classes.html|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leclerc&gt;André Leclerc, ''Fernand Daoust. 1.

The [[Federalism in Quebec|federalist]] NDP -Québec decided to concentrate its efforts on organizing for federal elections, leaving the more [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] Parti Socialiste du Québec to work on the provincial level.&lt;ref name=source/&gt;

While the party never managed to become an officially registered political party, it unofficially stood five candidates in the [[Quebec general election, 1966|1966 provincial election]], by which time Chartrand had moved to a harder [[Quebec separatism|separatist]] position and joined the [[Rassemblement pour l'Indépendance Nationale]], before dissolving in 1968, with many of its members joining the newly formed [[Parti Québécois]] (which was both separatist and [[social democratic]]), while others rejoined the NDPQ, which would begin to run candidates in provincial elections in [[Quebec general election, 1970|1970]].&lt;ref name=source/&gt;

The PSQ published a journal titled ''Le Peuple''.

A '''planned community''', '''planned city''' or '''planned town''', is any community that was carefully planned from its inception and is typically constructed on previously undeveloped land. This contrasts with settlements that evolve in a more ''ad hoc'' fashion. [[Land use conflicts]] are less frequent in these communities. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The term ''new town'' refers to planned communities of the [[new towns movement]] in particular, [[New towns in the United Kingdom|mainly in the United Kingdom]]. It was also common in the [[European colonization of the Americas]] to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Nicolas G.|date=2015-03-02|title=Native Americans and Cities|url=http://americanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-22|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De stad Batavia TMnr 3728-537.jpg|thumb|Batavia, circa 1780.]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luchtfoto van het Ministerie van Openbare Werken TMnr 10015224.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bandung]] laid as a well-planned city, set as the new capital of the Dutch East Indies back in 1920s.]]
* [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (predecessor of modern [[Jakarta]]) was a planned city, modeled after Dutch 17th century coastal city architecture. First, in the 17th century as a planned fortified city, crisscrossed with Dutch-style canals dug in regular grid. The city served as the administrative center of [[Dutch East India Company]].
* In early 19th century, the Dutch colonial authority moved their administrative center from the dilapidated and unhealthy port town of Old Batavia (now [[Kota Tua Jakarta|Kota]] area) several kilometres south to [[Weltevreden, Java|Weltevreden]] area (now [[Central Jakarta]]). Old Batavia and Weltevreden were connected by the Molenvliet Canal and a road (now Gajah Mada Road) that ran alongside the waterway.&lt;ref name=Heritage6-109&gt;{{cite book |series=Indonesian Heritage |title=Architecture |volume=6 |editor= Gunawan Tjahjono |year=1998 |publisher=Archipelago Press |location=Singapore |isbn=981-3018-30-5 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a well-planned community around the [[Medan Merdeka|Koningsplein]], the [[Lapangan Banteng|Waterlooplein]] and Rijswijk (Jalan Veteran). The area, then known as Weltevreden, which include the Koningsplein, Rijswijk, Noordwijk, Tanah Abang, Kebon Sirih, and Prapatan became a popular residential, entertainment and commercial district for the European colonial elite.
* [[Menteng]], today a subdistric in Central Jakarta, was first built as a well-planned community. An [[urban design]] developed in the 1910s set the area to become a residential area for Dutch people and high officials. At the time of its development, the area was the first planned [[garden suburb]] in colonial [[Batavia (Dutch East Indies)|Batavia]]. Supported by easy access to service centers and nearby to the central business district, this area has become one of the most expensive areas for residential real estate in modern Jakarta.
* In early 20th century, [[Bandung]] was planned by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government as a new capital city to replace Batavia. The idea was to separate the busy trading port or the commercial center (Batavia) from the new administrative and political center (Bandung). By 1920s the plan to transfer the capital to Bandung was underway. As the city began to laid the masterplan of a well-planned new city, grid of streets and avenues were laid, and numbers of government buildings were constructed, such as [[Gedung Sate]] that was planned as the colonial administrative center of Dutch East Indies. The plan, however, failed due to the [[Great Depression]] and the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Fanara"&gt;{{cite book | title = Angel of the East Indies: Biography of the Van Dooremolen Family | author = Dino Fanara | publisher = iUniverse | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780595860449 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?hl=id&amp;id=Vh0j32NRF98C&amp;dq=bandung+as+capital+of+east+indies&amp;q=Bandung+capital+East+Indies#v=snippet&amp;q=Bandung%20capital%20East%20Indies&amp;f=false | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since [[Palangkaraya]] was established as the capital of [[Central Kalimantan]] province in 1957, the first president of Indonesia, [[Sukarno]], outlined a plan to develop Palangkaraya as the future capital of Indonesia. Palangkaraya is far larger in area than [[Jakarta]] and safe from the danger of earthquakes and [[volcano]]es, common on the island of [[Java]].
* In late 1950s to first half of 1960s, [[Sukarno]], Indonesia's first president, laid a masterplan to built [[Jakarta]] as the planned national capital of the Republic of Indonesia. He filled Jakarta with numbers of monuments and statues. Numbers of monumental projects were conceived, planned and initiated during his administration, including [[National Monument (Indonesia)|Monumen Nasional]], [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta|Istiqlal mosque]], [[DPR/MPR Building]], and [[Gelora Bung Karno]] stadium. Sukarno also filled Jakarta with nationalistic monuments and statues, including [[Selamat Datang Monument]], Pemuda Monument at Senayan, Dirgantara Monument at Pancoran, and Irian Jaya Liberation Monument at [[Lapangan Banteng]]. Although many of this projects were completed later in his successor era ([[Suharto]] administration), Sukarno is credited for shaping Jakarta's monuments and landmarks. He desired Jakarta to be the beacon of a powerful new nation.&lt;ref name="Megacity-Jakarta"&gt;{{cite book | title = Planning the Megacity: Jakarta in the Twentieth Century – Planning, History and Environment Series | first = Christopher | last = Silver | publisher = Routledge | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781135991227| url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=UEaUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Sukarno+build+Jakarta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0F4-oUZubF&amp;sig=Il7M2TTKMMk5Hl9mo-PwbI_lCbc&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimn4nilcrNAhUNR48KHcIkDj4Q6AEIPDAE#v=snippet&amp;q=Sukarno%20buiild%20Jakarta&amp;f=false | page = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
[[Quezon City]] was the planned city of President [[Manuel L. Quezon]], who had earlier proposed a new city to be built on land northeast of the [[City of Manila]]. Carefully planned districts include Santa Mesa Heights (part of the original [[Daniel Burnham|Burnham]] Plan for Manila), the Diliman Estate (includes the [[University of the Philippines]]), New Manila, the Cubao Commercial District, South Triangle, Housing Projects 1 (Roxas District), 2 and 3 (Quirino District), 4, 5 (Kamias-Kamuning District), 6, 7, and 8.

President [[Elpidio Quirino]] proclaimed Quezon City as the national capital on 17 July 1948, with President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] restoring Manila as the capital on 24 June 1976. He then created a metropolitan area called [[Metro Manila]], which remains congested today due to failed execution of the Quezon City plan as well as the Burnham Plan.

Other planned cities (in order of foundation):
* [[Baguio]]
* [[Trece Martires]], [[Cavite]]
* [[Island Garden City of Samal]]
* [[Palayan]], [[Nueva Ecija]]
*Clark Green City

===Singapore===
{{Main|New towns of Singapore}}
The new town planning concept was introduced into Singapore with the building of the first New Town, [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]], from July 1952 to 1973 by the country's public housing authority, the [[Housing and Development Board]]. Today, the vast majority of the approximately 11,000 public housing buildings are organised into 22 new towns across the country.

Each new town is designed to be completely self-sustainable. Helmed by a hierarchy of commercial developments, ranging from a town centre to precinct-level outlets, there is no need to venture out of town to meet the most common needs of residences. Employment can be found in industrial estates located within several towns. Educational, health care, and recreational needs are also taken care of with the provision of schools, hospitals, parks, sports complexes, and so on.

Singapore's expertise in successful new town design was internationally recognised when the Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the [[World Habitat Awards|World Habitat Award]] to [[Tampines]] New Town, which was selected as a representative of Singapore's new towns, on 5 October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bshf.org/en/to.php/about/whawards/projects.php?pID%3D00039 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228085457/http://www.bshf.org/en/to.php/about/whawards/projects.php?pID=00039 |archivedate=28 December 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In the period of the Persian [[Safavid]] Empire, [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], the Persian capital, was built according to a planned scheme, consisting of a long boulevard and planned housing and green areas around it.

In modern-day Iran more than 20 planned cities have been developed or are under construction, mostly around Iran's main metropolitan areas such as [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Tabriz]]. Some of these new cities are built for special purposes such as:
* [[Pardis]], which is built as a scientific city.
* [[Poulad-Shahr]], which is an industrial city built for the housing of Isfahan's steel industry workers.
* [[Shirin Shahr]] which is to provide housing for the sugar industry personnel.
* [[Tehranpars]] which was built to house Tehran's additional population.
* [[Shahrak-e Gharb]], built as a massive project of modern apartment buildings.
* [[Parand]] which is intended to provide residences for the staff of [[Imam Khomeini International Airport]].
* [[Shushtar|Shushtar New Town]] which was built to provide housing for the employees of a sugar cane processing plant.

576,000 people were planned to be settled in Iran's new towns by the year 2005.

For a list of Iran's modern planned cities see: [[List of Iran's planned cities]].

===Israel===
[[File:Blueprint Negev planned community.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A planned community in the [[Negev]]]]
According to politics of country settlement a number of planned cities were created in peripheral regions. Those cities also known as ''[[Development Town]]s''. The most successful is [[Ashdod]] with more than 200,000 inhabitants, a [[Ashdod Port|port]] and developed infrastructure. Other cities that were developed following Israel's lineation plan are [[Shoham]], [[Karmiel]] and [[Arad, Israel|Arad]]. [[Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]] has been another of the country's most successful planned cities. Construction began in 1994 and it now has a population of over 80,000. Modi'in also rates higher in terms of average salary and graduation rates than the national average. It was designed and planned by Israeli architect [[Moshe Safdie]]. Many [[Israeli settlement]]s follow this model, including towns like [[Modi'in Illit]] and [[Betar Illit]].

===Palestinian territories===
* [[Rawabi]]

===Saudi Arabia===
[[King Abdullah Economic City]], a future planned city along the [[Red Sea]] located in Saudi Arabia.

In 1975, Jubail Industrial City, also known as [[Jubail]], was designated as a new industrial city by the [[Politics of Saudi Arabia|Saudi government]]. It provides 50% of the country's drinking water through [[desalination]] of the water from the [[Persian Gulf]].

===United Arab Emirates===
* Capital city of Abu Dhabi, is a planned city to some extent
* Certain new parts of Dubai, are planned
* [[Masdar City]], conceived of as a mixed purpose residential and commercial area

===Japan===
[[File:Daidairi of Heiankyo.jpg|thumb|[[Kyoto]] was built on a grid system, starting in 794.]]
The city of [[Kyoto]] was developed as a planned city in 794 as a new imperial capital (then called [[Heian-kyō]]), built on a grid layout modeled after the [[Tang dynasty]] capital of [[Chang'an]] (modern day [[Xi'an]]), and remained the capital for over a millennium. The grid layout remains, reflected in major east-west streets being numbered, such as {{Nihongo|4th street|四条|shi-jō}}. In modern times, [[Sapporo]] was built from 1868, following an American [[grid plan]], and is today the fifth-largest city in Japan. Both these cities have regular addressing systems (following the grid) unlike the usual subdivision-based [[Japanese addressing system]].

{{No footnotes|section|date=October 2012}}
Borrowing from the New Town movement in the United Kingdom, some 30 new towns have been built all over Japan. Most of these constructions were initiated during the period of rapid economic growth in the 1960s, but construction continued into the 1980s. Most of them are located near Tokyo and the [[Kansai]] region. Some towns, (Senri New Town, [[Tama New Town]]) do not provide much employment, and many of the residents commute to the nearby city. These towns fostered the infamous congestion of commuter trains (although as the metropolitan areas have grown, this commute has become relatively short in comparison to commutes from the new urban fringe).

Other New Towns act as industrial/academic agglomerations (''sangyo-shuseki'') ([[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba Science City]], Kashima Port Town). These areas attempt to create an all-inclusive environment for daily living, in accordance with [[Uzō Nishiyama]]'s "life-spheres" principle.

Japan has also developed the concept of new towns to what [[Manuel Castells]] and [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] call [[Science park|technopolis]]. The technopolis program of the 1980s has precedents in the New Industrial Cities Act of the 1960s. These cities are largely modeled after Tsukuba Academic New Town (Tsukuba Science City) in that they attempt to agglomerate high-tech resources together in a campus-like environment.

In the past, the Japanese government had proposed relocating the capital to a planned city, but this plan was cancelled.

Overall, Japan's New Town program consists of many diverse projects, most of which focus on a primary function, but also aspire to create an all-inclusive urban environment. Japan's New Town program is heavily informed by the Anglo-American [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] tradition, American neighborhood design, as well as Soviet strategies of industrial development.

In 2002 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced the end of new town construction, although the new towns continue to receive government funding and redevelopment.

===People's Republic of China===
Many ancient [[cities in China]], especially those on the [[North China Plain]], were carefully designed according to the [[Feng shui|fengshui]] theory, featuring square or rectangular city walls, rectilinear road grid, and symmetrical layout. Famous examples are [[Chang'an]] in [[Tang Dynasty]] and Beijing.

An exception to that is an ancient town in [[Tekes County]], [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], Xinjiang, with a shape of a [[ba gua]].

In modern China, many [[special economic zones]] are developed from the sketch, for example, [[Pudong]], a new district of Shanghai.

===Hong Kong===
[[File:Butterfly Estate 1.jpg|thumb|right| Southern Castle Peak, Part of Tuen Mun New Town, developed from the 1970s onward]]
{{Main|New towns of Hong Kong}}
The terrains of Hong Kong are mostly mountainous and many places in the [[New Territories]] have limited access to roads. Hong Kong started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate rapidly growing populations. In the early days the term "satellite towns" was used. The very first new towns included [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. [[Wah Fu Estate]] was built in a remote corner on [[Hong Kong Island]], with similar concepts in a smaller scale.

In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed to date. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]], [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] and [[Tseung Kwan O New Town|Tseung Kwan O]]. [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful at the beginning and maintained as a [[dormitory town]] up until the recent decades like the other new towns. More recent developments are [[Tin Shui Wai New Town|Tin Shui Wai]] and [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau]]. The government also plans to build such towns in [[Hung Shui Kiu]], [[Ping Che]]-[[Ta Kwu Ling]], [[Fanling]] North and [[Kwu Tung]] North. At present, there are a total of nine new towns:
* [[Tsuen Wan New Town]]
* [[Sha Tin New Town]]
* [[Tuen Mun New Town]]
* [[Tai Po New Town]]
* [[Fanling-Sheung Shui New Town]]
* [[Yuen Long New Town]]
* [[Tseung Kwan O New Town]]
* [[Tin Shui Wai New Town]]
* [[North Lantau New Town]]

===Taiwan===
* [[Zhongxing Xincun]], [[Nantou County]]
* [[Linkou District]], [[New Taipei]]—[[Guishan District]], [[Taoyuan City]] (Linkou New Town, 林口新市鎮)
* Danhai, [[Tamsui District]], [[New Taipei]] (Danhai New Town, 淡海新市鎮)

===South Korea===
[[New Songdo City]] is a planned international business centre to be developed on 6 square kilometres of reclaimed land along Incheon's waterfront, 65 kilometres west of Seoul and connected to Incheon International Airport by a 10 kilometre highway bridge. This 10-year development project is estimated to cost in excess of $40&amp;nbsp;billion, making it the largest private development project ever undertaken anywhere in the world.

[[Gwanggyo]] newtown is located 25&amp;nbsp;km south away from Seoul in Suwon city and Youngin city, Gyeonggi province. Gwanggyo newtown area 11 square kilometers was designated in 2004 by Gyeonggi Province, Suwon city, Youngin city, and Gyeonggi Development Corporation (GICO). It will accommodate more than 31,000 households. Gwanggyo newtown was not only for the housing supply but also for several regional goals such as provincial office movement, convention center building, and creating economic growth core in Gyeonggi provincial area. Its infrastructure was scheduled to be constructed by 2012.

Since the 1990s, several planned communities were built in the [[Seoul Metropolitan Area]] to alleviate housing demands in [[Seoul]]. They include:
* Several ongoing developments in [[Hwaseong City|Hwaseong]], including Bongdam, Dongtan, and Hyangnam
* [[Bundang]], [[Seongnam City]]
* [[Ilsan]], [[Goyang City]]
* [[Pangyo, Seongnam|Pangyo]], [[Seongnam City]]

Since 2007 [[Sejong City]] was planned as the new capital, but it is becoming a research hub instead, with many national research institutes moving there between 2013 and 2015. It has a planned population of 0.8&amp;nbsp;million, which is the largest of all the newtown development plans.

===South Asia===
====Ancient history====
An urban culture is evident in the mature phase of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] which thrived in present-day Pakistan and north western India from around 3300 BC. The quality of municipal city planning suggests knowledge of [[urban planning]] and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on [[hygiene]]. The streets of major cities in present-day Pakistan such as [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], the world's earliest planned cities, were laid out in a perfect [[grid plan|grid pattern]] comparable to that of present-day New York City. The houses were protected from noise, odours, and thieves.

As seen in the ancient sites of [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan and western border of India, this urban plan included the world's first urban [[sanitation]] systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from [[water well|well]]s. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, [[wastewater|waste water]] was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner [[courtyard]]s and smaller lanes.

The ancient Indus systems of [[sewage]] and [[drainage]] that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus Valley were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in some areas of modern South Asia today. The advanced architecture of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]] is shown by their [[dockyard]]s, [[granary|granaries]], [[warehouse]]s, brick platforms, and protective walls.

====Medieval history====
A number of medieval Indian cities were planned including:
* [[Ahmedabad]] in Gujarat. Established by Sultan Ahmad Shah in 1411.
* [[Jaipur]] in Rajasthan. Established in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai [[Jai Singh II]].It is the capital of [[Rajasthan]] state of India.
* [[Udaipur, Rajasthan|Udaipur]] in Rajasthan. It was the historic capital of the former kingdom of [[Mewar]].
* [[Madurai]], in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It was the capital of the erstwhile [[Pandyan kingdom]] and is noted for its lotus-like symmetry.
* [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[Agra]]. Its planning was done by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar the Great]].
* [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagar]] in Karnataka, the capital of the erstwhile [[Vijayanagara Empire]].
* [[Hampi]] in Karnataka, which was the former capital of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] prior to the city of Vijayanagar.

==Europe==
===History===
New settlements were planned in Europe at least since Greek antiquity (see article [[Urban planning]]). The Greeks built new colonial cities around the Mediterranean. The ancient Romans also founded many new colonial towns through their empire. There are, however, also traces of planned settlements of non-Roman origin in pre-historic northern Europe. Most planned settlements of medieval Europe were created in the period of about the 12th to 14th centuries. All kinds of landlords, from the highest to the lowest rank, tried to found new villages and towns on their estates, in order to gain economical, political or military power. The settlers generally were attracted by fiscal, economical and juridical advantages granted by the founding lord, or were forced to move from elsewhere from his estates. Most of the new towns were to remain rather small (as for instance the [[bastide]]s of southwestern France), but some of them became important cities, such as Cardiff, Leeds, 's-Hertogenbosch, Montauban, Bilbao, Malmö, Lübeck, Munich, Berlin, Bern, Klagenfurt, Alessandria, Warsaw and Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;Boerefijn, Wim (2010) '’The foundation, planning and building of new towns in the 13th and 14th centuries in Europe. An architectural-historical research into urban form and its creation'’. Phd. thesis Universiteit van Amsterdam. {{ISBN|978-90-9025157-8}} ([http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/336940]).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Empire====
The Romans built a large number of towns throughout their empire, often as colonies for the settlement of citizens or veterans. These were generally characterised by a grid of streets and a planned water-supply; and many modern European towns of originally Roman foundation still retain part of the original street-grid.

===Belgium===
[[Louvain-la-Neuve]], built for the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]].

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* [[Slobomir]] is a new town in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its name means: "the city of freedom and peace". It is located on the [[Drina]] river near [[Bijeljina]]. It was founded by Slobodan Pavlović, a Bosnian philanthropist. It aims to be one of the major cities of post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina. In fact, the city will be located in two countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, although majority of it will be in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city is named after its founder, Slobodan Pavlović, and his wife, Mira.
* [[Andrićgrad]] is town under construction by the famous Serbian director [[Emir Kusturica]], and will be located in [[Višegrad]], [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/8/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0/915744/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0+%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%9A%D0%B0+%22%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%9B%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%22.html Почела градња "Андрићграда"] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
The cities of [[Stara Zagora]] and [[Kazanlak]], in central Bulgaria, were rebuilt as planned cities after they were burnt to the ground in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]]. Also the city of [[Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria|Dimitrovgrad]] in south Bulgaria, that was planned as a key industrial and infrastructure center.

===Croatia===
[[Červar-Porat]] is a [[resort town]] in western Croatia, located on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] on the Červar lagoon. It was built as planned town in the 1970s, although the area was inhabited in Roman times. During the War of Independence it was used as a [[refugee camp|camp for refugees]] from Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Vukovar]]. It was planned to house 6500 people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Raša, Istria County|Raša]] in Istria was built as a "new town" during 1936–1937 as part of [[Mussolini]]'s urban colonization of Istria and other Italian territories.

The capital of [[Zagreb]] underwent major expansion during the 1960s. By that time, the city's official boundary was the river [[Sava]], since nothing was built over it. After a flood in the 1960s, many residents were moved and some other districts were created for the residents, such as [[Gornja Dubrava|Dubrava]], which was the interconnection between the Zagreb's old part and [[Sesvete]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, a planned part of Zagreb, [[Novi Zagreb]] (''New Zagreb''), was constructed, which lied on the other, uninhabited part of the river Sava, and is now one of major districts consisting of purely residential buildings and blocks. It is still under expansion and some new landmarks were built in it, the most famous one is the recent one, [[Arena Zagreb]], built in 2008.

===Czech Republic===
[[Poruba (Ostrava)|Poruba]] and [[Havířov]] were established in the 1950s as new satellite residential towns for workers of coal-mining, steel-mill and other heavy-industry complex in the Ostrava region. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Prague]] was extended by large [[housing estates]] – "new towns" in the 1970s and 1980s: [[Severní Město]] (Northern Town), [[Jižní Město]] (Southern Town), [[Jihozápadní Město]] (South-Western Town) were the largest, with population around 100.000 each. Their remote position to the city centre was compensated for by underground lines constructed usually a decade after the completion of the housing projects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} A new housing estate called [[Západní Město]] (Western Town) is currently (2017) partly under construction (Britská čtvrť) and partly in planning stage.

===Denmark===
[[Fredericia]] was designed as a combination of town and military fortress following the devastation caused by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. More recent examples are [[Græse Bakkeby]] in [[North Zealand]], and [[Ørestad]], planned and built to strengthen development in the [[Copenhagen]]/[[Malmö]] region. The suburb [[Albertslund]] was also built from scratch in the 1970s, merging the two villages [[Vridsløselille]] and [[Herstedvester]].

In 2017, plans for a new 20,000-inhabitant town outside [[Frederikssund]] called [[Vinge]] were approved by the Danish authorities.

===Finland===
The city of [[Helsinki]], previously a town of 5,000 inhabitants, was made the capital of the new [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] in 1812 by decree of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I, Emperor of Russia]]. The city center was rebuilt with the lead of the German architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]].

However, the last city in Finland that was ordered to be built on a previously completely uninhabited land was [[Raahe]], founded by governor general [[Per Brahe the Younger]] in 1649.

Finland also has various "ekokylä" communities or "ecological villages". For example, [[Tapiola]] is a post-war [[Garden city movement|garden city]] on the edge of [[Espoo]].

The city of [[Vaasa]] was rebuilt about seven kilometers northwest of its original location in 1862, after a fire which destroyed the city in 1852. The new town was planned by [[Carl Axel Setterberg]]. The disastrous consequences of the fire were considered as the design included five broad avenues which divided the town into sections and each block was divided by alleys.

[[Hamina]] is an old Finnish Eastern trade capital, founded during the Swedish reign. The star-shaped fortress and the circular town plan are based on an Italian Renaissance fortress concept from the 16th century.

===France===
Many new cities, called [[bastide]]s, were founded from the 12th to 14th centuries in southwestern France, where the [[Hundred Years War]] took place, in order to replace destroyed cities and organize defence and growth. Among those, [[Monpazier]], [[Beaumont-du-Périgord|Beaumont]], and [[Villeréal]] are good examples.

In 1517, the construction of [[Le Havre]] was ordered by [[Francis I of France]] as a new port. It was completely destroyed during the [[Second World War]] and was entirely rebuilt in a [[modernist]] style, during the [[Trente Glorieuses]], the thirty-year period from 1945 to 1975.

[[Cardinal Richelieu]] founded the small Baroque town of [[Richelieu, Indre-et-Loire|Richelieu]], which remains largely unchanged.

A program of new towns (French ''[[:fr:Ville nouvelle#Les villes nouvelles contemporaines|ville nouvelle]]'') was developed in the mid-1960s to try to control the expansion of cities. Nine ''villes nouvelles'' were created.
* Near Paris: [[Cergy-Pontoise]], [[Marne-la-Vallée]], [[Sénart]] (former Melun-Sénart), [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]], [[Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines]]
* Near [[Lille]]: [[Villeneuve d'Ascq]] (Former Lille-Est)
* Near [[Lyon]]: [[L'Isle-d'Abeau]]
* Near [[Marseille]]: [[Étang de Berre|Rives de l'Etang de Berre]]
* Near [[Rouen]]: [[Le Vaudreuil]]
* Near [[Grenoble]]: [[L'Isle-d'Abeau]]

[[La Défense]], in the greater Paris area, could also be considered a planned town, though it was not built all at once but in successive stages beginning in the 1950s.

===Germany===
Planned cities in Germany are:
* [[Bayreuth]]: an example of a medieval new city
* [[Bremerhaven]]: founded as a seaport in the 19th century
* [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Berlin – Friedrichstadt]]
* [[Eisenhüttenstadt]]: the "first socialist town" in Germany
* [[Freudenstadt]]: the roads follow the layout of the [[Nine Men's Morris|Nine Men's Morris game]]

* [[Halle-Neustadt]]: a "Stadtteil" or borough in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]]
* [[Hellerau]]: first German garden city founded in 1909, today part of [[Dresden]]
* [[Karlsruhe]]: the roads follow the layout of a hand-held fan with the castle being at the juncture
* [[Ludwigsburg]]: planned new capital for the duke of Württemberg
* [[Quadratestadt|Mannheim Quadratestadt]]: squares named like ranks and files on a chessboard
* [[Munich|Munich Maxvorstadt]]: the first planned city expansion of [[Munich]] was realized from 1805 to 1810 according to a raster

* [[Wilhelmshaven]]: founded as a naval base by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]
* [[Wolfsburg]]: founded in 1938 to host the factories for the newly built Volkswagen

[[Welthauptstadt Germania]] was the projected renewal of [[Berlin]] as a planned city, although only a small portion was constructed between 1937 and 1943.

After World War II, several expellee towns were built like [[Espelkamp]], [[Neutraubling]] and [[Traunreut]].

===Greece===
Planned cities in Greece are:
* [[Lakki, Leros|Lakki]]: planned and built in the 1930s by the Italians to house members of its military stationed on the island of [[Leros]]; its initial name was Portolago
* [[Nea Alikarnassos]]: founded in 1925 to house [[Greek refugees]]
* [[Orestiada]]: founded in 1922 to house [[Greek refugees]]
* [[Paralia Distomou]]: planned and built to house workers of [[Aluminium of Greece]]
* [[Sparta (modern)|Sparta]]: planned and built in 1834 after a decree issued by [[Otto of Greece]]

===Hungary===
All Hungarian planned cities were built in the second half of the 20th century when a program of rapid industrialization was implemented by the communist government.

* The [[:hu:Akadémiaújtelep|Akadémiaújtelep]] area of [[Budapest]] was designed in a unique geometrical fashion.
* [[Dunaújváros]], built next to the existing village Dunapentele to provide housing for workers of a large steel factory complex. Once named after Stalin, the city maintains its importance in heavy industry even after the recession following the end of Communist era.
* [[Tiszaújváros]], built next to the existing village Tiszaszederkény and was named after Lenin for decades. A significant chemical factory was built simultaneously.
* [[Kazincbarcika]], created from the villages Sajókazinc, Barcika and Berente (the latter has become independent since then) in a mining area. The city and its population grew fast after the founding of a factory.
* [[Tatabánya]], created from four already existing villages was developed into a mining town and industrial centre and shortly after its elevation to town status became the county seat of its county, a status it still maintains despite the presence of historically more significant towns in the area.
* [[Beloiannisz]] (although not a town, only a village) was planned and built in the 1950s to provide home for Greek refugees of the [[Greek Civil War|Civil War]].
* The [[:hu:Wekerletelep|Wekerletelep]] was developed between 1908 and 1925 as a result of planned state construction in the area of [[Kispest]] in a unique lacy layout.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland the term "new town" is often used to refer to planned towns built after World War II which were discussed as early as 1941. The term "new town" in Ireland was also used for some earlier developments, notably during the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian era]]. Part of [[Limerick]] city was built in a planned fashion as "Newtown Pery".

In 1961 the first new town of [[Shannon Town|Shannon]] was commenced and a target of 6,000 inhabitants was set. This has since been exceeded. Shannon is of some regional importance today as an economic centre (with the [[Shannon Free Zone]] and [[Shannon Airport]]), but until recently failed to expand in population as anticipated. Since the late 1990s, and particularly in the early 2000s, the population has been expanding at a much faster rate, with town rejuvenation, new retail and entertainment facilities and many new housing developments.

It was not until 1967 that the Wright Report planned four towns in [[County Dublin]]. These were [[Blanchardstown]], [[Clondalkin]], [[Lucan, County Dublin|Lucan]] and [[Tallaght]] but in actuality this was reduced to Blanchardstown, Lucan-Clondalkin and Tallaght. These areas had previously contained small semi-rural villages on the edge of the city of Dublin, but were greatly expanded throughout the 1970s. Each of these towns has approximately 50,000 inhabitants today.

The most recent new town in Ireland is [[Adamstown, Dublin|Adamstown]] in [[County Dublin]]. Building commenced in 2005 and it is anticipated that occupation will commence late in 2006 with the main development of 10,500 units being completed within a ten-year timescale.

[[File:Cinta muraria di Palmanova.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palmanova]], Italy, founded in the 16th century.]]

===Italy===
In the past centuries several new towns have been planned in Italy. One of the most famous is [[Pienza]], close to [[Siena]], a [[Renaissance]] city, also called The Ideal Town or Utopia Town. Between 1459 and 1462 the most famous architects of Italy worked there for the Pope Pius II and built the city centre of the small town.

Another example of renaissance planned cities is the walled star city of [[Palmanova]]. It is a derivative of ideal circular cities, notable [[Filarete]]'s imaginary Sforzinda.

In early 20th century, during the fascist government of [[Benito Mussolini]], many new cities were founded, the most prominent being [[Latina, Lazio|Littoria]] (renamed Latina after the fall of the Fascism). The city was inaugurated on 18 December 1932. Littoria was populated with immigrants coming from Northern Italy, mainly from [[Friuli]] and [[Veneto]].

The great [[1693 Sicily earthquake|Sicilian earthquake of 1693]] forced the [[Sicilian baroque#New cities|complete rebuilding on new plans]] of many towns.

Other well-known new cities are located close to [[Milan]] in the metropolitan area. [[Crespi d'Adda]], a few kilometres east of Milan along the Adda River, was settled by the Crespi family. It was the first Ideal Worker's City in Italy, built close to the cotton factory. Today Crespi d'Adda is part of the [[Unesco World Heritage]] List. [[Cusano Milanino]] was settled in the first years of the 20th century in the formerly small town of Cusano. It was built as a new green city, rich in parks, villas, large boulevards and called Milanino (Little Milan). In the 1970s in the eastern metropolitan area of Milan a new city was built by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. It is called [[Milano Due]]. It is a garden city designed for families of the upper middle class, with peculiarity of having pedestrian paths completely free of traffic. In the 1980s another two similar cities were built by Berlusconi, [[Milano 3]] and [[Milano Visconti]]. Each of them has around 12,000 inhabitants.

===Lithuania===
In 1961 [[Elektrėnai]] was established as planned city for workers in [[Elektrėnai Power Plant]] and in 1975 [[Visaginas]] was established as planned city for workers in [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]].

===Macedonia===
[[File:NovoLisice.jpg|thumb|right|The graphical scheme of the Detailed Urbanist Plan for a settlement within the [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Municipality of Aerodrom]] within the [[City of Skopje]], Republic of Macedonia.]]
The [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Municipality of Aerodrom]] within the [[City of Skopje]] is a planned community.

===Malta===
* The fortified cities of [[Senglea]] and [[Valletta]] were both built on a [[grid plan]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] in the 16th century.
* The town of [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], also known as ''Raħal Ġdid'' (New Town), is built on a grid plan by the Grand Master [[Antoine de Paule]].
* The towns of [[San Ġwann]] and [[Santa Luċija]] were built as planned cities in the 1960s and 1970s

===Netherlands===
One province of the Netherlands, [[Flevoland]] (pop. 370,000 (2006)), was reclaimed from the [[Zuiderzee]] (Southern Sea). After a flood in 1916, it was decided that the Zuiderzee, an inland sea within the Netherlands, would be closed and reclaimed. In 1932, a [[causeway]] (the [[Afsluitdijk]]) was completed, which closed off the sea completely. The Zuiderzee was subsequently called IJsselmeer (IJssel-lake) and its previously salty water became fresh.

The first part of the new lake that was reclaimed was the Noordoostpolder (Northeast polder). This new land included, among others, the former island of Urk and it was included with the province of Overijssel. After this, other parts were also reclaimed: the eastern part in 1957 (Oost-Flevoland) and the southern part (Zuid-Flevoland) in 1968. The municipalities on the three parts voted to become a separate province, which happened in 1986. The capital of Flevoland is [[Lelystad]], but the biggest city is [[Almere]] (pop. 183,500 in February 2008). Apart from these two larger cities, several 'New Villages' were built. In the Noordoostpolder the central town of [[Emmeloord]] is surrounded by ten villages, all on cycling distance from Emmeloord since that was the most popular way of transport in the 1940s (and it's still very popular). Most noteworthy of these villages is [[Nagele]] which was designed by famous modern architects of the time, [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Aldo van Eyck]], [[Willem Wissing]] and [[Jaap Bakema]] among them. The other villages were built in a more traditional/vernacular style. In the more recent Flevolandpolders four more 'New Villages' were built. Initially more villages were planned, but the introduction of cars made fewer but larger villages possible.

New towns outside Flevoland are [[Hoofddorp]] and [[IJmuiden]] near Amsterdam, [[Hellevoetsluis]] and [[Spijkenisse]] near Rotterdam and the navy port [[Den Helder]].

The cities of [[Almere]], Capelle aan den IJssel, [[Haarlemmermeer]] (also a reclaimed polder, 19th century), [[Nieuwegein]], [[Purmerend]] and [[Zoetermeer]] are members of the European New Town Platform.

===Norway===
* [[Oslo]]: After a great fire in 1624, it was decided by the then King Christian IV that the city would be moved behind the Akershus fortress. The new town, named Christiania, was laid out in a grid and is now the downtown area known as "Kvadraturen" (''the Quadrature''). The original town of Oslo was later incorporated into Christiania, and is now a neighborhood in eastern Oslo; [[Gamlebyen]] or "The Old City".
* The city of [[Kristiansand]] was formally founded in 1641 by King [[Christian IV]]. The city was granted all trade privileges on the southern coast of Norway, denying all other towns to trade with foreign states. As Oslo/Christiania before it, the city was behind a fortress, with a grid system allowing cannons to fire towards the two ports of the city and the river on the eastern end.

===Poland===
Four cities stand out as examples of planned communities in Poland: '''[[Zamość]]''', '''[[Gdynia]]''', '''[[Tychy]]''' and '''[[Nowa Huta]]'''. Their very diverse layouts are the result of the different aesthetics that were held as ideal during the development of each of these planned communities. Planned cities in Poland have a long history and fall primarily into three time periods during which planned towns developed in Poland and its neighbors that once comprised the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. These are the [[History of Poland (1569–1795)|Nobleman's Republic]] (16th to 18th centuries), the interwar period (1918–1939) and [[Socialist Realism]] (1944–1956).

====The Nobleman's Republic of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{See also|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
The extreme opulence that Poland's nobility enjoyed during the [[Renaissance]] left Poland's elites with not only obscene amounts of money to spend, but also motivated them to find new ways to invest their hefty fortunes out of the grasp of the Royal Treasury. [[Jan Zamoyski]] founded the city of [[Zamość]] in order to circumvent royal tariffs and duties while also serving as the capital for his mini-state. Zamość was planned by the renowned Paduan architect [[Bernardo Morando]] and modeled on [[Renaissance]] theories of the 'ideal city'. Realizing the importance of trade, Zamoyski issued special location charters for representatives of peoples traditionally engaged in trade, i.e. to [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] and secured exemptions on taxes, customs duties and tolls, which contributed to its fast development. Zamoyski's success with [[Zamość]] spawned numerous other Polish nobles to found their own "private" cities such as [[Białystok]] and many of these towns survive today, while [[Zamość]] was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UN World Heritage list]] in 1992 and is today considered one of the most precious urban complexes in Europe and in the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

====Interwar period====
{{See also|History of Poland (1918-1939)}}
The preeminent example of a planned community in interwar Poland is Gdynia. After [[World War I]] when Poland regained its independence it lacked a commercial seaport (''De iure'' [[Poles]] could use [[Gdańsk]], which was the main port of the country before the War and is again today, but ''de facto'' [[Free City of Danzig|the Germans]] residing in the city made it almost impossible for them), making it necessary to build one from scratch. The extensive and modern seaport facilities in [[Gdynia]], the most modern and extensive port facilities in Europe at the time, became Poland's central port on the [[Baltic Sea]]. In the shadow of the port, the city took shape mirroring in its scope the rapid development of 19th-century Chicago, growing from a small fishing village of 1,300 in 1921 into a full blown city with a population over 126,000 less than 20 years later. The Central Business District that developed in [[Gdynia]] is a showcase of [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernist]] architectural styles and predominate much of the cityscape. There are also villas, particularly in the city's villa districts such as Kamienna Góra where [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] inspired [[Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] architecture.

====Socialist realism====
{{See also|History of Poland (1945–1989)}}
After the destruction of most Polish cities in World War II, the [[Communist]] regime that took power in Poland sought to bring about architecture that was in line with its vision of society. Thus urban complexes arose that reflected the ideals of [[socialist realism]]. This can be seen in districts of Polish cities such as [[Warsaw]]'s [[Marszałkowska Dzielnica Mieszkaniowa|MDM]]. The City of [[Nowa Huta]] (now a district of [[Kraków]]) and [[Tychy]] were built as the epitome of the proletarian future of Poland.

===Portugal===

[[Vila Real de Santo António Municipality|Vila Real de Santo António]] was built after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], on the same model that was used for rebuilding [[Lisbon]], Portugal's capital city (also destroyed in the earthquake), and on a similar orthogonal plan.

===Romania===
The cities of [[Brăila]], [[Giurgiu]] and [[Turnu Severin]] were rebuilt, according to new plans, in the first part of the 19th century and the cities of [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]] and [[Călărași]] were built completely new the same time.
The city of [[Victoria, Romania|Victoria]], located in the [[Braşov County]], was built by the communist government in the beginning of the second half of the 20th century.

===Russia===

* [[Saint Petersburg]] was built by [[Peter the Great]] as a planned capital city starting in 1703.
* [[Magnitogorsk]] is an example of a planned industrial city based on Stalin's 1930s five-year plans.
* The Avtozavodsky district of [[Tolyatti]] is a planned industrial city of Soviet post-war modernism.
* [[Zelenograd]] was planned as center of textile industry and re-oriented and as center of the Soviet electronics and microelectronics.

===Serbia===
[[Novi Beograd]], meaning ''New Belgrade'' in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], is a municipality of the city of [[Belgrade]], built on a previously undeveloped area on the left bank of the [[Sava]] river. The first development began in 1947, the municipality has since expanded significantly and become the fastest developing region in Serbia.

[[Drvengrad]], meaning ''Wooden Town'' in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], is a traditional village that the [[Serbs|Serbian]] film director [[Emir Kusturica]] had built for his film ''[[Life Is a Miracle]]''. It is located in the [[Zlatibor District]] near the city of [[Užice]], two hundred kilometers southwest of Serbia's capital, [[Belgrade]]. It is located near [[Mokra Gora]] and [[Višegrad]].

===Slovakia===
* [[Partizánske]] was established in 1938–1939, when [[Jan Antonín Baťa]] of [[Zlín]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now Czech Republic) and his powerful network of companies built a shoe factory in the cadastral area of Šimonovany municipality. The newly created settlement for workers carried the name of Baťovany and was part of Šimonovany. With the growth of the factory, so grew the settlement. The whole municipality was renamed to Baťovany in 1948 and given town status. As a sign of recognition of local inhabitants fighting in the [[Slovak National uprising]], the town was renamed Partizánske on 9 February 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.partizanske.sk/main.php?id_menu=1629&amp;firmy_slovenska_flag=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213185431/http://www.partizanske.sk/main.php?id_menu=1629&amp;firmy_slovenska_flag=0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-02-13 |title=Partizánske |website=Partizanske.sk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Svit]] was established in 1934 by business industrialist [[Jan Antonín Baťa]] of [[Zlín]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now Czech Republic) in accordance with his policy of setting up villages around the country for his workers.

===Slovenia===
[[Nova Gorica]], built after 1947 immediately to the east of the new border with Italy, in which the town of [[Gorizia]] remained.

===Spain===
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the population of Spain declined due to emigration to the Americas and later kings and governments made efforts to repopulate the country. In the second half of the 18th century, King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] implemented the so-called New Settlements (Nuevas Poblaciones) plan which would bring 10,000 immigrants from central Europe to the region of [[Sierra Morena]]. [[Pablo de Olavide]] was appointed superintendent and about forty new settlements were established of which the most notable was [[La Carolina]], which has a perfectly rectangular grid design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Proyectos IP |url=http://www.pueblos-espana.org/andalucia/jaen/la+carolina/ |title=La Carolina (Jaén) |location=38.274399;-3.614214 |website=Pueblos-espana.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later kings and repopulation efforts led to the creation of more settlements, also with rectangular grid plans. One of them was the town of La Isabela (40.4295 N, 2.6876 W), which disappeared in the 1950s submerged under the waters of the newly created artificial lake of [[Buendía (municipality)|Buendía]] but is still visible just under the water in satellite imagery.

Under [[Francisco Franco]], the [[Instituto Nacional de Colonización]] (National Institute of Colonization) built a great number of towns and villages.

[[Tres Cantos]], near [[Madrid]], is a good example of a successful new town design in Spain. It was built in the 1970s.

Newer additional sections of large cities are often newly planned as is the case of the [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca district]] or [[Ciudad Lineal]] in Madrid or the [[Eixample]] in Barcelona.

===Sweden===

[[Gothenburg]] was planned and built as a major fortified city from nothing from 1621.

[[Karlskrona]] was also planned and built as a major city and naval base from nothing, beginning 1680.

[[Vällingby]], a suburb, is an example of a new town in Sweden from after 1950.

[[Kiruna]] was built because of the large mine, from 1898.

[[Arvika]] was also a planned city, in 1811.

Most old planned cities have grown far outside the original planned areas. The new areas were usually (but not always) also planned, but later and separately. [[Majorna (district)|Majorna]] is a near suburb of Gothenburg that was not planned, but grew more ad-hoc, with irregular curvy streets following the topography.

===Turkey===
Some parts of the biggest city, [[Istanbul]], being [[Satellite town|re-developed and re-planned]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marschall |first=Melissa |url=http://www.mei.edu/content/map/mega-projects-and-limits-urban-planning-megacities-case-istanbul-akp-era |title=Mega Projects and the Limits of Urban Planning in Megacities: The Case of Istanbul in the AKP Era &amp;#124; Middle East Institute |website=Mei.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital, [[Ankara]], was built by a plan and is constantly re-planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/tr/ank/prj/urs/geb/sta/trindex.htm |title=Bir Başkentin Oluşumu: Avusturyalı, Alman ve İsviçreli Mimarların İzleri – Yeni Başkente Doğru – Şehir Planlaması – Goethe-Institut |website=Goethe.de |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atça]], [[Aydın]] was burned down by Greek forces in the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish Independence War]]. The rebuilding plan was based on Paris' plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aydinatca.com/imar-plni.html |title=İmar Plânı |website=Aydinatca.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other cities including; [[Erzincan]], [[Karabük]], [[Kars]], [[Kayseri]], [[Konya]] were also planned.

=== Ukraine ===
[[Odesa]] was built as a planned city according to 18th-century plans by the Flemish engineer Franz de Wollant (also known as François Sainte de Wollant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveltoukraine.org/odesa.htm |title=Odesa &amp;#124; Travel to Ukraine – 10 Must See Places – Odessa |publisher=Travel to Ukraine |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same engineer also planned the following municipalities in Ukraine in the late 18th century:
* [[Voznesensk]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Вознесенськ), in [[Mykolayiv Oblast]]
* [[Ovidiopol]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Овідіополь), in [[Odesa Oblast]]

[[Horishni Plavni]], founded in the 1960 as ''Komsomolsk'', is the most prosperous planned city in Ukraine, depending on the internationally important iron ore mining business.

[[Pripyat (city)|Prypiat]] is another new city in Ukraine built in 1970. The city was abandoned on 27 April 1986 after the [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]]. On 26 April the city had 50,000 habitants, the majority working at the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant]]. Now the [[ghost town|abandoned town]] is highly contaminated by radiation. Most of the [[Pripyat (city)|Prypiat]]'s former inhabitants were resettled to [[Slavutych]] which was planned and built for that purpose.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|New towns in the United Kingdom|New towns movement|Town and country planning in the United Kingdom}}

The Romans planned many towns in Britain, but the settlements were changed out of all recognition in subsequent centuries. The town of [[Winchelsea]] is said to be the first post-Roman new town in Britain, constructed to a grid system under the instructions of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] in 1280, and largely completed by 1292. Another claimant to the title is [[Salisbury]], established in the early 13th century by the then [[Bishop of Salisbury|Bishop of Sarum]]. The best known pre-20th-century new town in the UK was undoubtedly the [[Edinburgh]] [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], built in accordance with a 1766 master plan by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], and (along with Bath and Dublin) the archetype of the elegant [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style of British architecture.

====England====
The term "new town" often refers in the UK to towns built after [[World War II]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946]]. These were influenced by the [[garden city movement]], launched around 1900 by [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Sir Patrick Geddes]] and the work of [[Raymond Unwin]], and manifested at [[Letchworth, England|Letchworth Garden City]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in Hertfordshire.

Following [[World War II]], some 28 projected towns were designated as New Towns under the 1946 Act, and were developed partly to house the large numbers of people whose homes had been destroyed by bombing during the war and partly to move parts of the population out of (mainly [[Victorian era|Victorian]]) urban [[slums]]. New Towns policy was also informed by a series of wartime commissions, including:{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* the Barlow Commission (1940) into the distribution of industrial population,
* the Scott Committee into rural land use (1941)
* the Uthwatt Committee into compensation and betterment (1942)
* (later) the [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Reith Report]] into New Towns (1947).

Also crucial to thinking was the [[Patrick Abercrombie|Abercrombie Plan for London]] (1944), which envisaged moving a million and a half people from London to new and expanded towns. (A similar plan was developed for the [[River Clyde|Clyde Valley]] in 1946 to combat similar problems faced in [[Glasgow]].) Together these committees reflected a strong consensus to halt the uncontrolled sprawl of London and other large cities. For some, this consensus was tied up with a concern for social welfare reform (typified by the [[Beveridge Report]]), as typified in the motto ''if we can build better, we can live better''; for others, such as [[John Betjeman]] it was a more conservative objection to the changing character of existing towns.

Following the building of [[Borehamwood]], [[Middlesex]], 12 miles north-west of central London, the first in a ring of major "first generation" New Towns around London (1946) were [[Stevenage]], Hertfordshire, 33 miles to the north of London, and [[Basildon]], Essex, 32 miles east of London along the [[River Thames]]. Hertfordshire built four other new towns, two in the vicinity of Stevenage ([[Welwyn Garden City]] and [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]]), a third to the north called [[Letchworth]], and [[Hemel Hempstead]] to the west. (Hall 1996: 133) New Towns in the [[North East England|North East]] were also planned such as [[Newton Aycliffe]] (which the social reformer and government adviser [[William Beveridge]] wanted to be the "ideal town to live in") and [[Peterlee]].  [[Bracknell]] in Berkshire, to the south-west of London, was designated a New Town in 1949 and is still expanding. Other London new towns from this era include [[Harlow]] in Essex and [[Crawley]] in West Sussex.

Later a scatter of "second-generation" towns were built to meet specific problems, such as the development of the [[Corby Steelworks]]. Finally, five "third-generation" towns were launched in the late 1960s: these were larger, some of them based on substantial existing settlements such as [[Peterborough]], and the most famous was probably [[Milton Keynes]], midway between London and Birmingham, known for its huge central park and shopping centre, [[History of Milton Keynes#1960s Plans for a new city in North Buckinghamshire, 1967 designation of Milton Keynes|designed from the outset as a new city]] – though in law it is a 'New Town'. The 1960s saw new towns crop up around England's second-city [[Birmingham]], namely [[Redditch]], [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Telford]].

Other towns, such as [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in Kent, [[Basingstoke]] in Hampshire and [[Swindon]] in Wiltshire, were designated "Expanded Towns" and share many characteristics with the new towns. Scotland also gained three more new towns: [[Cumbernauld]] in 1956, famous for its enclosed [[Cumbernauld town centre|'town centre']], [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] (1962) and [[Irvine, Ayrshire|Irvine]] (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestlaidschemes.com/moviezone/new-towns |title=New Towns |publisher=Best Laid Schemes |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=2016-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821024235/http://www.bestlaidschemes.com/moviezone/new-towns/ |archivedate=21 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the relative success of new towns in the London Metropolitan green belt, London continued to suffer from a chronic housing shortage, especially in the south-east. Another small New Town, [[Thamesmead]], was developed adjacent to the Thames in the early 1960s but suffered from poor transport links. Some improvement in infrastructure has been seen subsequently.

All the new towns featured a car-oriented layout with many roundabouts and a grid-based road system unusual in the old world. Milton Keynes in particular was designed with a grid-based distributor road system. The earlier new towns, where construction was often rushed and whose inhabitants were generally plucked out of their established communities with little ceremony, rapidly got a poor press reputation as the home of "[[new town blues]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} These issues were systematically addressed in the later towns, with the third generation towns in particular devoting substantial resources to cycle routes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclecraft.co.uk/digest/2decades.html |title=Body |website=Cyclecraft.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; public transport and community facilities, as well as employing teams of officers for social development work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The financing of the UK new towns was creative. Land within the designated area was acquired at agricultural use value by the development corporation for each town, and infrastructure and building funds borrowed on 60-year terms from the UK Treasury. Interest on these loans was rolled up, in the expectation that the growth in land values caused by the development of the town would eventually allow the loans to be repaid in full. However, the high levels of retail price inflation experienced in the developed world in the 1970s and 1980s fed through into interest rates and frustrated this expectation, so that substantial parts of the loans had ultimately to be written off.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

All New Towns designated under the New Towns Act of 1946 were serviced by a secretariat, the New Towns Association, a [[quango]] that reported to the New Towns Directorate of the Department of the Environment. It coordinated the work of the General Managers and technical officers, published a monthly information bulletin and provided information for visitors from around the world. As each New Town reached maturity, the town's assets were taken over by the Commission for New Towns. Set up in 1948, the New Towns Association was dissolved in 1998. All papers held by it and the Commission for New Towns are held in The National archives:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121223161811/http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details.mvc/Collection/?iAID=7311]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s the first generation towns began to reach their initial growth targets. As they did so, their development corporations were wound up and the assets disposed of: rented housing to the local authority, and other assets to the [[Commission for the New Towns]] (in England; but alternative arrangements were made in Scotland and Wales). The Thatcher Government, from 1979, saw the new towns as a socialist experiment to be discontinued, and all the development corporations were dissolved by 1992 (with the closure of [[Milton Keynes Development Corporation]]), even for the third generation towns whose growth targets were still far from being achieved. Ultimately the Commission for the New Towns was also dissolved and its assets – still including a lot of undeveloped land – passed to the English Industrial Estates Corporation (later known as [[English Partnerships]]).

Many of the New Towns attempted to incorporate [[public art]] and cultural programmes but with mixed methods and results. In [[Harlow]] the architect in charge of the design of the new town, [[Frederick Gibberd]], founded the Harlow Art Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlowarttrust.org |title=デパートおせち予約・通販ランキング |website=Harlowarttrust.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it to purchase works by leading sculptors, including [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]]. In [[Peterlee]] the abstract artist [[Victor Pasmore]] was appointed part of the design team, which led to the building of the [[Apollo Pavilion]]. Washington New Town was provided with a community theatre and art gallery. The [[public art in Milton Keynes]] includes the (in)famous [[Concrete Cows]], which resulted from the work of an '[[artist in residence]]' and have gone on to become a recognised landmark.

In the 1990s, an experimental "new town" was developed by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]] to use very traditional or vernacular architectural styles was started at [[Poundbury]] in Dorset.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, building of [[Craigavon]] in [[County Armagh]] commenced in 1966 between [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]], although entire blocks of flats and shops lay empty, and later derelict, before eventually being bulldozed. The area, which now has a population exceeding 80,000 is mostly a dormitory town for Belfast.

[[Derry]] was the first ever planned city in Ireland (the city is now located in Northern Ireland). Work began on building the new city across the River Foyle from the ancient town of Derry (''Doire Cholm Chille'' or ''Doire'') in 1613. The walls were actually completed five years later in 1618. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a good design for defence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071025044545/http://www.planningni.gov.uk/AreaPlans_Policy/Conservation/Londonderry/guides/historic_city.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 under the [[Matthew Plan]] the new city of [[Craigavon]] was founded out of the original towns of [[Portadown]] and [[Lurgan]]. This town today lies mostly incomplete as the troubles halted construction. The plan initially was to construct a relief settlement to take people out of the crowded city of Belfast.

====Scotland====
Two "post-war new towns" were planned at [[East Kilbride]] (1947) and [[Glenrothes]] (1948), then the late 1950s and early 1960s saw the creation of [[Cumbernauld]], [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] and [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]]. Each of these towns is in Scotland's list of 20 most populated towns and cities.
[[Glenrothes]] was the first new town in the UK to appoint a town artist in 1968. A massive range of artworks (around 132 in total) ranging from concrete [[hippo]]s to bronze statues, dancing children, giant flowers, a dinosaur, a horse and chariot and crocodiles, to name but a few, were created. Town artists appointed in Glenrothes include [[David Harding (artist)|David Harding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/town_artist_an.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503184411/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/town_artist_an.php |archivedate=3 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malcolm Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malcolmrobertson.com/ |title=Malcolm Robertson Site Specific Public Art WorksMalcolm Robertson |website=Malcolmrobertson.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales====
The only new towns in Wales have been [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Cwmbran]]. Cwmbran was established to provide new employment in the south eastern portion of the [[South Wales Coalfield]]. The town is perhaps most widely known now for its international sports [[Cwmbran Stadium|stadium]] and [[Cwmbran Shopping Centre|shopping centre]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==North America==

===Canada===
When [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] began to settle the West in Canada, he put the project under the command of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR). The CPR exercised complete control over the development of land under its ownership. The [[Politics of Canada|federal government]] granted every second square mile section (totalling 101,000&amp;nbsp;km²) along the proposed railway line route to the CPR. The CPR decided where to place [[railway stations]], and thus would decide where the dominant town of the area would be. In most instances the CPR would build a station on an empty section of land to make the largest profit from land sales – meaning that the CPR founded many towns in western Canada, such as [[Medicine Hat]] and [[Moose Jaw]], from scratch. If an existing town was close to the newly constructed station but on land not owned by the CPR, the town was forced to move itself to the new site and reconstruct itself, essentially building a new town. [[Calgary]] and [[Yorkton|Yorkton, Saskatchewan]], were among the towns that had to move themselves.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

After the CPR established a station at a particular site, it would plan how the town would be constructed. The side of the tracks with the station would go to business, while the other side would go to warehouses. Furthermore, the CPR controlled where major buildings went (by giving the town free land to build it where the CPR wanted it to go), the construction of roads and the placement and organization of class-structured residential areas.

The CPR's influence over the development of the Canadian west's communities was one of the earliest examples of new town construction in the modern world. Later influences on planned community development in Canada were the exploitation of mineral and forest wealth, usually in remote locations of the vast country. Among numerous [[company town]]s planned and built for these purposes were [[Corner Brook]] and [[Grand Falls-Windsor|Grand Falls]] in Newfoundland, [[Témiscaming]] and [[Fermont]] in Quebec.

In the modern suburban context, several "New Towns" were established in the suburbs of large cities. Early examples include [[Leaside]] in Toronto and [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]] in Montreal. Both were planned and developed by the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] as middle class suburbs, though both, Leaside in particular, featured large industrial tracts. Leaside had its own municipal government until 1967, while Mount Royal continues to enjoy autonomy from the City of Montreal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In the post-war period, new corporate new towns were developed. [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], located in [[Brampton]], Ontario and [[Erin Mills]], located in [[Mississauga]], Ontario, were both developed in phases. Both included residential, commercial and industrial components. Development in Erin Mills continues to this day.

More recently, the [[Cornell, Ontario|Cornell]] development in [[Markham, Ontario]], was built as a new town, using the concepts of [[New Urbanism]].

[[CityPlace, Toronto]] is another example of a planned community.

===Mexico===
[[Tenochtitlan]] was the capital of the [[Aztec]] empire, which was built on an island in [[Lake Texcoco]] in what is now the Federal District in central Mexico. The city was largely destroyed in the 1520s by Spanish [[conquistador]]es. [[Mexico City]] was erected on top of the ruins and, over the ensuing centuries, most of Lake Texcoco has gradually been drained.

[[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] was built because of the need of a Spanish settlement in the route between [[Mexico City]] and the port of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]].

===Panama===
Although Panama City itself is not planned, certain areas are such as Costa del Este, an exclusive high density residential and business area, very close to downtown Panama City. The project combines many skyscrapers with beautiful green areas, and it is close to a highway that connects it to the city center. Other planned areas, but in a lesser degree, are Punta Pacifica and the former Canal Zone.

===United States===
[[File:Memphis Plan 1819.jpg|thumb|The original plan for [[Memphis, Tennessee]], as surveyed in 1819]]

====Colonial period====
In the colonial history of the United States, the first planned community was [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], planned in 1565. The earliest towns in English-speaking America such as [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] had only rudimentary elements of planning. The first comprehensively planned town was Charles Town (later [[Charleston, South Carolina]]), which was founded in 1670, planned in 1672, and relocated in 1680. Later planned cities were [[Philadelphia]], 1682; [[Albany, New York|Albany]], 1695; [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], 1699; [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], 1718; [[New York City]] 1731 (redesigned by the British);and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], 1733; [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], 1748 (with an early plan dated 1638); and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D.

Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2016. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The national capital (Washington, D.C.), and several state capitals ([[Jackson, Mississippi]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]; [[Columbia, South Carolina]]; [[Madison, Wisconsin]]; [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]; [[Tallahassee, Florida]]; and [[Austin, Texas]]) were essentially carved out of the wilderness to serve as capital cities.

====Industrialization====
[[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]], now incorporated into Chicago's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], was a world-renowned company town founded by the industrialist [[George M. Pullman]] in the 1880s.

In [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittsburgh]], [[American Bridge Company]] founded [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania]] in 1905 as a [[company town]] for American Bridge; American Bridge is still based near Ambridge today in nearby [[Coraopolis, Pennsylvania]].

Another well-known company town is [[Gary, Indiana]], which was founded in 1906 by the [[United States Steel Corporation]] as a home for its new steel mill, the [[Gary Works]], and named after [[Elbert Henry Gary]], the chairman of the company. For many years the Gary Works was the largest steel mill in the world, and it dominated the town, the main entrance being at the northern end of [[Broadway (Gary)|Broadway]], the city's main thoroughfare. The fortunes of this planned city have historically risen and fallen with those of the steel mill: prosperous in the 1930s, the city has lost 55 percent of its population since 1960.

[[Riverside, Illinois]], [[Radburn, New Jersey]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri]]'s [[Country Club District]] are other early examples of planned communities. Established in 1912, [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]], was planned and developed in by the [[Van Sweringen brothers]], railroad moguls who envisioned the community as a suburban retreat from the industrial inner-city of Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.preservationnation.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8055] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312072148/http://my.preservationnation.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8055|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kohler Company]] created a planned village of [[Kohler, Wisconsin|the same name]] west of the company's former headquarters city of [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], which incorporated in 1912. In 1918, the [[Aluminum Company of America]] built the town of [[Alcoa, Tennessee]] for the employees of the nearby aluminum processing plant.

====Government-led schemes====
During the Florida land boom of the 1920s in Southern Florida, the communities of [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Opa-locka, Florida|Opa-locka]], and [[Miami Springs, Florida|Miami Springs]], now suburbs of Miami, were incorporated as fully planned "themed" communities which were to reflect the architecture and look of Spain, Arabia, and Mexico respectively, and are now considered some of the first modern planned communities in the United States. [[Oldsmar, Florida|Oldsmar]], located in west central Florida, was developed by automobile pioneer [[Ransom E. Olds]].

In 1928, [[San Clemente, California]] was incorporated by [[Ole Hanson]] who designated that all buildings must be approved by an architectural review board in order to retain control over development and building style.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, several model towns were planned and built by the Federal government. [[Arthurdale, West Virginia|Arthurdale]] and Eleanor, [[West Virginia]], federally funded [[New Deal]] communities, were [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s projects to ease the burden of the depression on coal miners. The Tennessee Valley Authority created several towns of its own to accommodate workers constructing their new dams; the most prominent being [[Norris, Tennessee]]. Three "Greenbelt Communities", [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], [[Greenhills, Ohio]], and [[Greendale, Wisconsin]], built by the Federal government during the 1930s were planned with a surrounding "belt" of woodland and natural landscaping.

During [[World War II]], the [[Manhattan Project]] built several planned communities to provide accommodations for scientists, engineers, industrial workers and their families. These communities, including [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], [[Richland, Washington]] and [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] were necessary because the laboratories and industrial plants of the Manhattan Project were built in isolated locations to ensure secrecy. Even the existence of these towns was a military secret, and the towns themselves were closed to the public until after the war.

====Postwar period====
[[File:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Levittown, Pennsylvania circa 1959]]The [[William Levitt|Levittown]]s—in Long Island, Pennsylvania and New Jersey (now known as [[Willingboro, New Jersey]]) – typified the planned suburban communities of the 1950s and early 1960s. California's [[Rohnert Park, California|Rohnert Park]] (north of San Francisco) is another example of a planned city (built at the same time as [[Levittown, Pennsylvania|Levittown]]) that was marketed to attract middle-class people into an area only populated with farmers with the phrase, "A Country Club for the middle class."

Many other places, such as [[Orange County, California]], the [[Conejo Valley]] in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] in [[Los Angeles County]], as well as [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Northern Arizona]] also have many master planned communities following the housing boom in the 1960s, which is when the fathers of [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] foresaw a huge amount of growth in Arizona. Some of those communities include [[Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California|Anaheim Hills]], [[Rossmoor, California|Rossmoor]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[Ladera Ranch, California|Ladera Ranch]], [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]], [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]], and [[Talega, San Clemente, California|Talega]], [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]], [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]], [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]], [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] in California and (in the Phoenix area) [[Marley Park]], [[Talking Rock Ranch]], [[McCormick Ranch]], [[Rio Verde, Arizona|Rio Verde]], Tartesso and [[Verrado]] in [[Buckeye, Arizona]]. The neighborhood of Warren in the city of [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] has the distinction of being Arizona's first planned community. In the Conejo Valley, which is in the East County Area of Ventura County, all cities were master planned. Most notably, the Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, and Westlake Village area was master planned by the [[Janss Investment Company]], which was also responsible for the development of [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood Village]], part of the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]] in Los Angeles. Valencia is an area that is a master planned community that incorporated into the City of [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], developed and planned by the [[Newhall Land and Farming Company]]. About 25% of Orange County is composed of various master planned communities, much of which was done by the [[Irvine Company]], and since 1990, 85% of all developments in Orange County and a slightly smaller amount of communities in Arizona were part of a master planned community. 75% of all resales today in the Phoenix area are homes in master planned communities, and 80% of all new home construction permits issued by Arizona building departments are master planned communities. These communities provide functionality to the precious land left in the area, as well as the ability to create a housing-business-transportation-open space balance.

====Modern planned cities====
The era of the modern planned city began in 1962–1964 with the creation of [[Reston, Virginia]], followed a year later by [[Coral Springs, Florida]], and [[Columbia, Maryland]]. In more recent years, [[New Urbanism]] has set the stage for new cities, with places like the idyllic [[Seaside, Florida|Seaside]], Florida, and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s new town of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]], Florida.

In the United States, suburban growth in the Sunbelt states has coincided with the popularity of Master Planned Communities within established suburbs. Texas was at the forefront of this trend. [[Las Colinas]], established in 1973, was one of the first such examples and is still growing. Las Colinas is a {{convert|12000|acre|abbr=on}} master planned community within the Dallas-area city of [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. In 2006, residents approved changes to deed restrictions to allow greater density of urban mixed-use and residential construction. Also in the 1970s, just north of the existing town of [[Spring, Texas]] (north of [[Houston]]), oil and gas industry executive [[George P. Mitchell]] developed [[The Woodlands, Texas|The Woodlands]], a major residential and commercial master planned community which is now considered one of the premier residential and business destinations in the Houston area. The Woodlands is still experiencing huge growth to this day. In the 1990s, [[Cinco Ranch, Texas|Cinco Ranch]] was first developed just south of the existing town of [[Katy, Texas|Katy]], one of the western suburbs of Houston, and has contributed to the explosive recent growth of Houston's suburban west side.

In the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], master planned commercial developments such as Bishop Ranch in [[San Ramon, California|San Ramon]] and [[Hacienda Business Park]] in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] have attracted major corporate tenants to relocate from [[downtown Oakland]] and San Francisco; these companies include [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], [[Chevron Corporation]] and [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] (as the former [[Pacific Bell]]).

In recent years, new towns such as [[Mountain House, San Joaquin County, California]], have added a new wrinkle to the movement: to prevent [[conurbation]] with nearby cities, they have imposed strict growth boundaries, as well as automatic "circuit breakers" that place moratoriums on residential development if the number of jobs per resident in the town falls below a certain value. [[Centennial, California|Centennial]] new town part in [[Tejon Ranch]] halfway between Los Angeles and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], will incorporate such restrictions in order to minimize the commuter load on severely congested [[Interstate 5|I-5]]. [[Coyote Springs, Nevada]], [[Destiny, Florida]] and [[Douglas Ranch, Buckeye|Douglas Ranch]] in [[Buckeye, Arizona]] are amongst the largest communities being planned for the 21st century. A recent twist is the town of [[Ave Maria, Florida]], founded in 2007, which is anchored by [[Ave Maria University|a Catholic university]] and has a large [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] church in the center of town surrounded by commercial and residential development.

==South America==

===Argentina===
[[File:La Plata desde el aire.JPG|thumb|La Plata from the air.]]
[[La Plata]] was planned in 1880 to replace [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires city]] as the capital of the [[Buenos Aires Province]].

Urban planner Pedro Benoit designed a city layout based on a rationalist conception of urban centers. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north-south and east-west. (In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonals.) This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. Every six blocks, one finds a small park or square. Other than the diagonals, all streets are on a rectangular grid, and are numbered consecutively.

The designs for the government buildings were chosen in an international architectural competition. Thus, the Governor Palace was designed by Italians, City Hall by Germans, etc. Electric street lighting was installed in 1884, and was the first of its kind in Latin America.

===Brazil===
[[Brasília]]:[[File:Brasilia - Plan.JPG|thumb|right|Brasília: Pilot Plan]] [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered the construction of Brasília, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasília was part of Juscelino's "fifty years of prosperity in five" plan. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer, a close friend, was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasília was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.
The former capital of Brazil was [[Rio de Janeiro]], and resources tended to be concentrated in the southeast region of Brazil. While the city was built because there was a need for a neutrally located federal capital, the main reason was to promote the development of Brazil's [[hinterland]] and better integrate the entire territory of Brazil. Brasília is approximately at the geographical center of Brazilian territory.

[[Lúcio Costa]], the city's principal architect, designed the city to be shaped like an airplane. Housing and offices are situated on giant superblocks, everything following the original plan. The plan specifies which zones are residential, which zones are commercial, where industries can settle, where official buildings can be built, the maximum height of buildings, etc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Belo Horizonte]]:[[File:Planta BH.jpg|thumb|right|Belo Horizonte in 1895.]] In 1889, Brazil became a republic, and it was agreed that a new state capital of [[Minas Gerais]], in tune with a modern and prosperous Minas Gerais, had to be set. In 1893, due to the climatic and topographic conditions, Curral Del Rey was selected by Minas Gerais governor Afonso Pena among other cities as the location for the new economical and cultural center of the state, under the new name of "Cidade de Minas," or City of Minas. Aarão Reis, an urbanist from the State of Pará, was then set to design the second planned city of Brazil (the first one is Teresina), and then Cidade de Minas was inaugurated finally in 1897, with many unfinished constructions as the Brazilian Government set a deadline for its completion. Inhabitation of the city was subsidized by the local government, through the concession of free empty lots and funding for building houses. An interesting feature of Reis' downtown street plan for Belo Horizonte was the inclusion of a symmetrical array of perpendicular and diagonal streets named after Brazilian states and Brazilian indigenous tribes.

[[Goiânia]]: The plan was for a city of 50,000 with the shape of a concentric radius – streets in the form of a spoke, with the Praça Cívica as the center, with the seats of the state and municipal government – The Palace of Emeralds and the Palace of Campinas. In 1937, a decree was signed transferring the state capital from the Cidade de Goiás to Goiânia. The official inauguration only occurred in 1942 with the presence of the president of the republic, governors, and ministers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Fordlândia]] was built to be a part of [[Henry Ford]]'s motor company. Originally intended to be a rubber plantation, it failed within several years and is now home to squatting farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fordlandia: The Failure of Ford's Jungle Utopia|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105068620|work=6 June 2009|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable planned cities in Brazil include [[Teresina]] (The first one, inaugurated in 1842), [[Petrópolis]], [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]], [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]], [[Londrina]], and [[Maringá]] (the latter two in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]).

===Venezuela===
* [[Guayana City]] – [[Bolívar State (Venezuela)|Bolívar State]]
: Guyana City is a city in [[Bolívar State (Venezuela)|Bolívar State]], Venezuela. It lies south of the [[Orinoco]], where the river is joined by the [[Caroni River (Venezuela)|Caroní River]]. The city, officially founded in 1961, is actually composed of the old town of San Félix at the east and the new town of '''Puerto Ordaza''' to the west, which lies on the confluence of the [[Caroní River|Caroní]] and [[Orinoco]] Rivers and is the site of the [[Llovizna Falls]]. There are bridges across the Caroni and a new bridge across the Orinoco ([[Second Orinoco crossing]]). The city stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco. With approximately one million people, it is Venezuela's fastest-growing city due to its important [[Ironworks|iron]] and [[steelworks]] and aluminium industries. The city has a large [[hydroelectric power plant]], [[Macagua Dam]]. Guayana City is one of Venezuela's five most important ports, since most goods produced in Bolívar are shipped through it, onto the Atlantic Ocean via the Orinoco river.  Due to its planned nature, the city has a drastically different feel to it than many other South American cities. The towers of the Alta Vista district recall [[Barranquilla]], and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States in the 1950s, including 'cookie cutter' homes, sidewalks, and patterned lawns. This is an artifact due to the presence in the 1960s and early 1970s of US Steel, an American company with iron mining operations in the region. US Steel built housing for hundreds of its American expatriate workers and families, who lived in Puerto Ordaz and other communities until the nationalization of the Venezuelan steel industry forced the company and its workers to leave.

===Australia===
Australia's most prominent fully planned city is [[Canberra]], its capital, designed by American architect [[Walter Burley Griffin]]. The early central areas of two [[States and territories of Australia|state]] capital cities – [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]] – were also planned by surveyors. Walter Burley Griffin was Australia's most notable city planner, having also designed smaller cities and towns, including [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in [[New South Wales]]. A controversial Japanese-backed planned city, [[Multifunction Polis]], was proposed in the 1980s, but never implemented.

Australia is still building planned communities with developers such as [[Delfin Lend Lease]], an [[S&amp;P/ASX 50]] company, that has been responsible for large master planned communities such as;

* [[Forest Lake, Queensland]], Brisbane (completed 2004)
* The New Rouse Hill, Sydney (current)
* [[Golden Grove, South Australia]] (Completed 1991)

====Adelaide====
[[File:Streetmap of Adelaide and North Adelaide.svg|thumb|right|Adelaide's planned town grids were surrounded by parkland and intersected by the River Torrens]]
[[Adelaide]] was founded by British and German colonists in 1836 to test out [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theories of systematic colonisation. Convict labour was not employed and the colony in theory would be financially self-sufficient; in practice, government assistance was used in the early stages. Land had been sold before anyone set foot in the largely unexplored territory and the city (the basis for the future central business district) was surveyed and planned in a remarkably short space of time. Adelaide's design has been praised for its four-square layout, its choice of setting and its ample parklands which have had minimal encroachment of developments. The town centre was in sufficient proximity to a water source, the [[River Torrens]].

====Melbourne====
[[File:HOD1.png|thumb|left|A reconstruction of Robert Hoddle's original plans for Melbourne's central grid which defined the early township and today's city centre]]
[[Melbourne]] was planned as a free settlement in 1837 through the [[Hoddle Grid]], drawn up by [[Robert Hoddle]] under instructions from [[George Gipps]], the original plan for Melbourne as part of the first land sales (prior to the planning only a handful of existing settlements were built on the fringe of the grid). The grid featured wide parallel streets, spanning a gently sloping valley between hills ([[Batman's Hill]], [[Flagstaff Gardens|Flagstaff Hill]] and Eastern Hill) and roughly parallel to the course of the [[Yarra River]]. The deliberate exclusion of city squares or open space within the grid was a subject of future frustration for the municipality and residents [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne]], in the centre of the grid, was built over a [[gully]] and has therefore been prone to flooding. Despite a later extension and later inclusion of planned suburbs, Melbourne's original plans were not as extensive as Adelaide's, and the city rapidly outgrew its original boundaries. As such, it is often not considered to be a planned city, but the grid continues to define much of the character of the [[Melbourne city centre]].

====Canberra====
[[File:Inner-canberra 01MJC.png|right|thumb|Inner Canberra demonstrates some aspects of the Griffin plan, in particular the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]]]]
[[Canberra]], established in 1908, was planned as the capital city of Australia and is Australia's most notable and ambitious example of civic planning. The city was designed to be the Federal Capital following the federation of the six Australian colonies which formed the Commonwealth of Australia. The new nation required a capital that was located away from other major settlements such as Melbourne and Sydney. Canberra is thus located in a Territory – the [[Australian Capital Territory]] – and not a State. Prior to this time the land that Canberra is found on was farming land, indigenous settlements, and forest. In 1912, after an extensive planning competition was completed, the vision of American [[Walter Burley Griffin]] was chosen as the winning design for the city. Extensive construction and public works were required to complete the city, this involved the flooding of a large parcel of land to form the center piece of the city, [[Lake Burley Griffin]]. Unlike some other Australian cities, the road network, suburbs, parks and other elements of the city were designed in context with each other, rather than haphazard planning as witnessed in much of Sydney. Notable buildings include the High Court, Federal Parliament, Government House, War Memorial, Anzac Parade and headquarters of the Department of Defence.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has several small New Towns, built for a specific purpose. Examples include [[Kawerau]] in the Bay of Plenty (a mill town), [[Twizel]] in North Otago, [[Mangakino]] in the Waikato (both for hydroelectricity), and [[Turangi]] near [[Taupo]] (for the [[Tongariro Power Scheme]]). Construction of Kawerau began in 1953. Twizel was built in 1968 to service nearby hydroelectric projects and was supposed to close on their completion. However, its residents managed to save the town in 1983. Mangakino, constructed from 1946, was also meant to be a temporary construction town, but it too remains today. John Martin, the founder of the Wairarapa town of [[Martinborough]], set out the town's first streets in the pattern of the [[Union Flag]] in the 19th century.

In 2006, construction began on [[Pegasus Town]], a new planned town adjacent to [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]], approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Christchurch]].

A '''pledge drive''' is an extended period of [[fundraising]] activities, generally used by [[public broadcasting]] stations to increase contributions. The term "[[wikt:pledge|pledge]]" originates from the promise that a contributor makes to send in funding at regular intervals for a certain amount of time. During a pledge drive, regular and special programming is followed by on-air appeals for pledges by station employees, who ask the audience to make their contributions, usually by phone or the Internet, during this break

Pledge drives are typically held two to four times annually, at calendar periods that vary (though, they are usually scheduled during the spring, summer and/or fall months) depending on the scheduling designated by the local public broadcasting station.

==Background==
While public broadcasters are partially or completely government-funded in some nations, there are some countries, such as the [[United States]], where some funds come from donations from the public. Stations in these parts of the world commonly hold pledge drives about two to three times each year, usually lasting one to two weeks each time.

Pledge drives are especially common among U.S. stations. Although the federal government of the United States, primarily through the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB), and corporate [[underwriting]] provide some money for public broadcasting organizations like [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), they are largely dependent on program fees paid by their member stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Pays for Public Broadcasting?|url=http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/faq/pays.html|publisher=[[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=October 21, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028135758/http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/faq/pays.html|archivedate=October 28, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stations require funding in turn from listeners and viewers (as well as local corporate [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]]) for not only these fees, but also other daily [[operating cost]]s, and stage regular pledge drives in an attempt to [[persuade]] their audiences to contribute [[donations]].

A hallmark of pledge breaks is the "pledge room", where the speakers deliver their message as [[volunteering]] individuals answer ringing telephones in the background. Frequent updates are provided as to the amount of money that the pledge drive has raised so far, which is also (on [[television station]]s) shown on a numeric display. Small prizes such as mugs and [[tote bag]]s (known as "thank-you" gifts or, euphemistically, as "premiums"), as well as entries into drawings for larger awards, are also offered by many stations in return for pledging certain amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Get Those Phones Ringing!|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/recycled/2009/10/lets_get_those_phones_ringing.html|author=June Thomas|periodical=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pledge drives have been controversial for most of their existence. While pledge drives are an effective method of raising money for stations, they usually annoy viewers and listeners, who find the regular interruption of what is ordinarily [[advertising|commercial]]-free content and the station's regular programming being suspended for lifestyle and music specials to be a nuisance.&lt;ref name="bsr-fundraising"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can PBS survive the fundraising trap?|url=http://www.broadstreetreview.org/cross-cultural/can-pbs-survive-the-fundraising-trap#|author=Gary L.

This practice began in earnest in the mid-1970s due to CPB funding cutbacks that were the result of political pressures and the recessions of the time, as well as increasing [[inflation]]. As the proportions of government funding in stations' budgets continued to decline over time, such programs became more elaborate in order to sway people who would otherwise watch public television only sporadically (or not at all) to tune in, and possibly donate money in response to appeals during program breaks.

Originally, such programming consisted of arts presentations such as classical music, drama, and documentaries. However, the audience for supposedly "high-brow" fare began declining steadily during the 1980s and 1990s due to the attrition of older generations (to whom such programming mainly appealed), while younger ones were largely uninterested in the arts, for a variety of reasons having to do with the eclipse of "high culture" in American society. In order to appeal to such a largely Euro-American, middle-aged and affluent demographic (the so-called "[[Baby Boomers]]" and "[[Generation X]]"), PBS has resorted to specials such as [[self-help]] programs with speakers such as [[Suze Orman]], nostalgic [[pop music|popular music]] concerts, and special versions of PBS' traditionally popular "how-to" programs.&lt;ref name="pbsomb-pledge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Tight Times, PBS Leans on Pledge Drives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/business/media/14pledge.html|author=Elizabeth Jensen|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=March 13, 2011|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the phenomenon is less pronounced on American public radio stations, primarily because of the high popularity of the news and talk programs on that medium and the routine-based patterns of radio listeners that are much more easily disrupted than those of television. Much of the focus is placed upon the "drive time" NPR news programs ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]],'' which have the highest ratings of all public broadcasting in the U.S. This is in contrast to PBS member stations universally holding their drives during weeknight prime time and on weekend afternoons and evenings, and not during the daytime on weekdays or weekend mornings, when children's programming is typically scheduled.&lt;ref name="bsr-fundraising"/&gt;

However, in light of intense competition public broadcasting faces from a greatly expanded media environment, other stations, especially radio, have aimed to eliminate pledge drives altogether, or significantly reduce their length, by asking for contributions throughout the year during regular station identification breaks. On radio, such programs as ''ATC'' may have one of their planned stories deleted simply to extend the length of the fund-raising "pitches". 

In a more recent trend, some stations also advertise that pledge drives will be shortened by one day for every day's worth of contributions donated in the weeks leading up to a drive. Additionally, some radio stations have started using prospect screening during their pledge drive to identify potential major donors for later [[Fundraising#Types|fundraising]] activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17372">The '''social construction theory of ADHD''' argues that [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is not necessarily an actual [[pathology]], but that an ADHD [[diagnosis]] is a [[socially constructed]] explanation to describe behaviors that simply do not meet prescribed [[social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parens E, Johnston J |title=Facts, values, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): an update on the controversies |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1|year=2009 |pmid=19152690|pmc=2637252 |doi=10.1186/1753-2000-3-1 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of the social construct theory of ADHD seem to regard the disorder as genuine, though over-diagnosed in some cultures. These proponents cite as evidence that the [[DSM IV]], favored in the United States for defining and diagnosing mental illness, arrives at levels of ADHD three to four times higher than criteria in the [[ICD 10]], the diagnostic guide favored by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="Singh I 2008 957–64"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh I |title=Beyond polemics: science and ethics of ADHD |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=957–64 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19020513 |doi=10.1038/nrn2514 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular proponent of this theory, [[Thomas Szasz]], has argued that ADHD was "invented and not discovered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chriss, James J.|title=Social control: an introduction |publisher=Polity |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |page=230 |isbn=0-7456-3858-9 |oclc=|doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Szasz, Thomas Stephen |title=Pharmacracy: medicine and politics in America |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |year=2001 |page=212|isbn=0-275-97196-1 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ADHD as a social construct==

Psychiatrists [[Peter Breggin]] and Sami Timimi oppose pathologizing the symptoms of ADHD. [[Sami Timimi]], who is an [[National Health Service|NHS]] child and adolescent psychiatrist, argues that ADHD is not an objective 'disorder'&lt;ref name=TimimiTaylor2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Timimi |first1=Sami |last2=Taylor |first2=Eric |date=January 2004 |title=In Debate: ADHD is best understood as a cultural construct |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=184 |issue=1 |pages=8–9 |doi=10.1192/bjp.184.1.8 |pmid=14702221 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/184/1/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that western society creates stress on families which in turn suggests environmental causes for children expressing the symptoms of ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;Timimi, S. &amp; Begum, M. (2006). Critical Voices in Child and Adolescent Mental Health. London: [[Free Association Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that parents who feel they have failed in their parenting responsibilities can use the ADHD label to absolve [[culpability|guilt]] and [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]].

A common argument against the medical model of ADHD asserts that while the traits that define ADHD exist and may be measurable, they lie within the spectrum of normal healthy human behaviour and are not dysfunctional. However, by definition, in order to diagnose with a mental disorder, symptoms must be interpreted as causing a person distress / espec. maladaptive.  In America, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) requires that "some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings" and that "there must be clear evidence of significant impairment in social, school, or work functioning" for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=7721{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this view, in societies where passivity and order are highly valued, those on the active end of the active-passive spectrum may be seen as 'problems'. Medically defining their behaviour (by giving labels such as ADHD and ADD) serves the purpose of removing blame from those 'causing the problem'. Controversy over the social constructionist view comes from a number of studies that cite significant psychological and social differences between those diagnosed with the disorder, and those who are not. However, the specific reasons for these differences are not certain, and this does not suggest anything other than a difference in behavior. Studies have also shown [[neurological]] differences, but whether this signifies an effect rather than a cause is unknown. Such differences could also be attributed the drugs commonly prescribed to people with this disorder. Studies have also been able to differentiate ADHD from other psychiatric disorders in its symptoms, associated features, 
life course, and comorbidity.&lt;ref name=TimimiTaylor2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Taylor E. |author2=Chadwick O. |author3=Heptinstall E. | year = 1996 | title = Hyperactivity and conduct problems as risk factors for adolescent development | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 1213–1226 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-199609000-00019 | pmid = 8824065 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E., Sandberg, S., Thorley, G., et al.

Gerald Coles, an educational psychologist and formerly an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the University of Rochester who has written extensively on literacy and learning disabilities, asserts that there are partisan agendas behind the educational policy-makers and that the scientific research that they use to support their arguments regarding the teaching of literacy are flawed. These include the idea that there are neurological explanations for learning disabilities. Gerald Coles argues that school failure must be viewed and treated in the context of both the learning environment and the child's individual abilities, behavior, family life, and social relationships. He then presents a new model of learning problems, in which family and school environments are the major determinants of academic success. In this "interactive" paradigm, the attitudes and methods of education are more important than inherent strengths or deficits of the individual child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gerald |last1=Coles |date=15 January 1989 |title=The Learning Mystique: A Critical Look at "Learning Disabilities" |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0449903513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===Questioning the pathophysiological and genetic basis of ADHD===
{{Dablink|See also: [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Cause|Causes]]{{·}} [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]{{·}} [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies#ADHD as a biological illness|ADHD as a biological illness]]}}
Some social constructionist theories of ADHD reject the dominant medical opinion that ADHD has a distinct pathophysiology and genetic components.  The 'symptoms' of ADHD also happen to be morally questionable attributes, this is why the symptoms are described as 'inappropriate'.  Many social constructionists trenchantly question deterministic views of behaviour, such as those views sometimes put forth within behavioural/abnormal psychology and the biological sciences.

Currently, the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|pathophysiology]] of ADHD is unclear; although research has found evidence of differences in the brain between ADHD and non-ADHD patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/brain-matures-a-few-years-late-in-adhd-but-follows-normal-pattern.shtml Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD, But Follows Normal Pattern] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523083043/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/brain-matures-a-few-years-late-in-adhd-but-follows-normal-pattern.shtml |date=2009-05-23 }} NIMH Press Release, November 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lou HC, Andresen J, Steinberg B, McLaughlin T, Friberg L |date=Jan 1998 | title = The striatum in a putative cerebral network activated by verbal awareness in normals and in ADHD children | url = | journal = Eur J Neurol | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 67–74 | doi = 10.1046/j.1468-1331.1998.510067.x | pmid = 10210814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/gene-predicts-better-outcome-as-cortex-normalizes-in-teens-with-adhd.shtml Gene Predicts Better Outcome as Cortex Normalizes in Teens with ADHD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523083322/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/gene-predicts-better-outcome-as-cortex-normalizes-in-teens-with-adhd.shtml |date=2009-05-23 }} NIMH Press Release, August 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dougherty DD, Bonab AA, Spencer TJ, Rauch SL, Madras BK, Fischman AJ |title=Dopamine transporter density in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9196 |pages=2132––33 |year=1999 |pmid=10609822 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dresel SH, Kung MP, Plössl K, Meegalla SK, Kung HF |title=Pharmacological effects of dopaminergic drugs on in vivo binding of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 to the central dopamine transporters in rats |journal=European journal of nuclear medicine |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=31–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9396872 |doi=10.1007/s002590050191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17113158"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coccaro EF, Hirsch SL, Stein MA |title=Plasma homovanillic acid correlates inversely with history of learning problems in healthy volunteer and personality disordered subjects |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=149 |issue=1–3 |pages=297–302 |year=2007 |pmid=17113158 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, such as Jonathan Leo and David Cohen who reject the characterization of ADHD as a disorder, contend that the controls for stimulant medication usage were inadequate in some lobar volumetric studies which makes it impossible to determine whether ADHD itself or [[psychotropic]] medication used to treat ADHD is responsible for decreased thickness observed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Philip |last2=Lerch |first2=Jason |last3=Greenstein |first3=Deanna |last4=Sharp |first4=Wendy |last5=Clasen |first5=Liv |last6=Evans |first6=Alan |last7=Giedd |first7=Jay |last8=Castellanos |first8=F.

Dr. Joseph Glenmullen states, "no claim of a gene for a psychiatric condition has stood the test of time, in spite of popular misinformation. Although many theories exist, there is no definitive biological, neurological, or genetic [[etiology]] for 'mental illness'."&lt;ref&gt;Glenmullin, Joseph (2000). Prozac Backlash. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 192-198&lt;/ref&gt;  His critics argue that  ADHD is a [[Heterogeneous#Locus .28Non-allelic.29 Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] disorder&lt;ref name="Barkley"/&gt; caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors and thus cannot be modeled accurately using the single gene theory. Authors of a review of ADHD etiology have noted: "Although several genome-wide searches have identified chromosomal regions that are predicted to contain genes that contribute to ADHD susceptibility, to date no single gene with a major contribution to ADHD has been identified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

Describing current instructional methods as [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the  [[Sudbury school]]s' [[democratic education]] approach in which children, by enjoying personal freedom thus encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions, learn at their own pace rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

'''The Moscow rules''' are [[Rule of thumb|rules-of-thumb]] said to have been developed during the [[Cold War]] to be used by spies and others working in Moscow.

The rules are associated with Moscow because the city developed a reputation as being a particularly harsh locale for clandestine operatives who were exposed. The list may never have existed as written.

== The rules ==
Agent [[Tony Mendez]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although no one had written them down, they were the precepts we all understood for conducting operations in the most difficult of operating environments: the Soviet capital. By the time they got to Moscow, everyone knew these rules. They were dead simple and full of common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spy Dust: Two Masters of Disguise Reveal the Tools and Operations that Helped Win the Cold War|last=Mendez|first=Antonio|last2=Mendez|first2=Jonna|last3=Henderson|first3=Bruce|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2003|isbn=9780743434584|location=New York|page=36|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[International Spy Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Moscow Rules are given as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=The Spy Museum |url=https://www.spymuseum.org/exhibition-experiences/online-exhibits/argo-exposed/moscow-rules/ |title=Moscow Rules |access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Assume nothing. 
# Never go against your gut.
# Everyone is potentially under opposition control.
# Do not look back; you are never completely alone.
# Go with the flow, blend in.
# Vary your pattern and stay within your cover.
# Lull them into a sense of complacency.
# Do not harass the opposition.
# Pick the time and place for action.
# Keep your options open.

Other rules which have been circulated around the Internet and used in fiction include:

* [[Murphy's Law|Murphy]] is right. (i.e., "What can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible moment.")
* Any operation can be aborted. If it feels wrong, it is wrong.
* Maintain a natural pace.
* Build in opportunity, but use it sparingly.
* Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. (Borrowed from [[Muhammad Ali]].)
* There is no limit to a human being's ability to rationalize the truth.
* Technology will always let you down.
* Once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is an enemy action. (Taken from [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']])
* Do not attract attention, even by being overly careful.

Moscow rules are prominently referenced in [[John le Carré]]'s cold war books including ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]'' and ''[[Smiley's People]]'', as [[tradecraft]], including use of inconspicuous signal markers (drawing pins, chalk marks), the use of [[dead drop]]s, and the ways to signal the need for a (rare) face-to-face meeting. Moscow Rules are important at the beginning of ''Smiley's People,'' where the General invokes the rules to request a meeting with Smiley, but he is followed and killed by [[KGB]] assassins before it can happen.  The applicable rule states that no documents may be carried that cannot be instantly discarded, in this instance a 35mm negative concealed in an empty pack of cigarettes.

In ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' there are references to the Moscow Rules. In particular, in Season 6 Episode 10, [[Harry Pearce]] tells someone, "Treat London as enemy territory, keep your head down, find an opportunity, and make a move." In an earlier episode in Season 5, rogue MI6 agent Richard Dempsey is said to be in disguise and following the Moscow Rules, where the idea of treating the place as enemy territory is repeated.

In ''[[The Middleman (TV series)|The Middleman]]'', episode 8 (the "Ectoplasmic Pan-Hellenic Investigation"), the Moscow Rules are recited.

'''''Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil''''' (Harcourt, 2007) is a book written by [[John Ghazvinian]] about the [[petroleum industry]] in [[Africa]].  The book was received well by critics, and garnered good reviews from both the ''[[Boston Globe]]''&lt;ref&gt;Muldow, Anna.  A fierce new thirst for African's treasure. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.  May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kotkin, Stephen.  In Africa, One Step Forward and Two Back.  ''The New York Times''.  July 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is based extensively on interviews, with representatives of multinational oil companies' views being compared and contrasted with those of politicians within Africa as well as the citizens of affected nations.
Jake Saltzman, the famed critic, gave the book five out of five stars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">'''Uparaja''' or '''Ouparath''', also '''Ouparaja''' ({{lang-my|ဥပရာဇာ}} - {{IPA-my|ṵpəjàzà|IPA}}; {{lang-km|ឧបរាជ}} - ''Ouparach''; {{lang-th|[[:wikt:อุปราช|อุปราช]]}} - {{RTGS|Upparat}}; {{lang-lo|ອຸປຮາດ}} - ''Oupahat''), was a [[Style (manner of address)|royal title]] reserved for the [[viceroy]] in the [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] dynasties in [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], as well as some of their minor tributary kingdoms.

==Burma==
The Great Deputy King, in full '''Maha Uparaja Anaudrapa Ainshe Min''', incorrectly interpreted as Crown Prince by Europeans, and addressed as His Royal Highness, was the single highest rank among the [[Min-nyi Min-tha]], i.e. princes of the royal blood. It is shortened to '''Einshay Min''' ({{my|အိမ်ရှေ့မင်း}}, {{IPA-my|èiɴʃḛ mɪ́ɴ|IPA}}).

However, the position was not reserved for the highest birth rank (if there is one, ''Shwe Kodaw-gyi Awratha'', i.e. eldest son of the sovereign, by his chief Queen), nor did it carry a plausible promise of succession, which was usually only settled in an ultimate power struggle.

==Cambodia==
The word '''Ouparach''' ({{lang-km|ឧបរាជ}}) is derived from both [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] languages, literally means ''Vice King'', who obtains the position following the crowned king. The full term of Ouparach in order to provide the proper honor is '''Samdach Preah Ouparach''' ({{lang-km|សម្តេចព្រះឧបរាជ}}) or '''Samdach Preah Moha Ouparach''' ({{lang-km|សម្តេចព្រះមហាឧបរាជ្យ}}). According to tradition of Kingdom of [[Cambodia]], Samdach Preah Moha Ouparach positions as the supreme official controlling other high and low officials.&lt;ref&gt;Khmer dictionary, adapted from Samdach Chuon Nat Khmer dictionary, page 1643, published in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laos==

== Siam (Thailand) Uparat ==
{{Main|Front Palace}}
'''Uparat''' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:อุปราช|อุปราช]]}}; {{RTGS|Upparat}}) as pronounced in historical [[Siam]], translates to [[viceroy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:th:อุปราช|Thai อุปราช]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Front Palace''' ({{lang-th|วังหน้า}}; {{RTGS|Wang Na}}), however, was the more usual designation, often referred to in English as '''Second King''' or '''Vice King'''.

The office was discontinued in 1876 by [[Rama V]], following the [[Front Palace crisis]] of 1874, in favour of the office of [[Crown Prince of Siam]] ({{lang-th|สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร}}; {{RTGS|Sayammakutratchakuman}}). Note that those serving '''''[[List of Latin phrases: V#vice|vice]]''''' a king constitute a different office, that of [[Regency (government)|regent or regency council]].

The '''White Terror''' in [[Russia]] refers to the organized violence and mass killings carried out by the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–23). It began after the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in November 1917, and continued until the defeat of the White Army at the hands of the [[Red Army]]. The White Army fought the Red Army for power, which engaged in its own [[Red Terror]]. According to some Russian historians, the White Terror was a series of premeditated actions directed by their leaders,&lt;ref name="cvetkovevoluciazakon"&gt;Цветков В. Ж.

== Southern and Western Russia ==
An important member of the White Terror was [[Lavr Kornilov]]. During the [[Ice March]] in the south of Russia, Kornilov said: "I give you a very cruel order: do not take prisoners! I accept responsibility for this order before God and the Russian people."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} He promised, "The greater the terror, the greater our victories."&lt;ref name=mayer254/&gt; He vowed that the goals of his forces must be fulfilled even if it was necessary "to set fire to half the country and shed the blood of three-fourths of all Russians."&lt;ref name=mayer254&gt;Mayer, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, however, Kornilov said that prisoners should be taken care of, saying, "We do not make war against the wounded."&lt;ref name="Tsvetkov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dk1868.ru/statii/kornilov3.htm | first = В. Ж. | last = Цветков | title = Лавр Георгиевич Корнилов. Часть 3 |trans-title=Lavr G. Kornilov. Part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to N. Bogdanov, a participant in the [[Ice March]], 
&lt;blockquote&gt;After receiving information about the [[Bolsheviks]], the commander of the captured detachment was shot. Under Colonel Corwin Krukovsky, there was some especially painful cruelty. I know of many cases when under the influence of hatred for the Bolsheviks, the officers assumed the duties of shooting the captured volunteers. The executions were necessary because under the conditions in which the Volunteer Army had to move, prisoners could not be taken.&lt;ref name="Tsvetkov" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bogdanov cited another occasion, however, where Red Officers were tried and cleared as having acted under duress.&lt;ref name="Tsvetkov" /&gt;

After Kornilov was killed in April 1918, the leadership of the [[Volunteer Army]] passed to [[Anton Denikin]]. During the Denikin regime, the [[News media|press]] regularly urged violence against Jews. For example, a proclamation by one of Denikin's generals incited people to "arm themselves" in order to extirpate "the evil force which lives in the hearts of [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jew-communists]]." In the small town of Fastov alone, Denikin's Volunteer Army murdered over 1,500 Jews, mostly the elderly, women, and children. An estimated 100,000 to 150,000 Jews in Ukraine and southern Russia were killed in [[pogrom]]s perpetrated by Denikin's forces as well as Petlyura's nationalist-separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6RAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=100,000+jews+denikin++Petlyura+Florinsky |title=Encyclopedia of Russia and the Soviet Union |first=Michael T. |last=Florinsky |page=258 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1961 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Jews were left homeless and tens of thousands became victims of serious illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, page [https://books.google.com/books?id=B0jHwhsSNfQC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;dq=Arno+Mayer+Jews+Denikin unknown]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Don Province, the Soviet government was displaced by a regime headed by [[Pyotr Krasnov]] formed in April 1918. According to Walter Laqueur, more than 45,000 people were shot or hanged by Krasnov's White Cossack regime, which lasted until the Red Army conquered the region following [[Battle for Tsaritsyn|their victory at Tsaritsyn]]. 

Mass executions occurred in 1918 in territories under White occupation. In one incident, commander of the 3rd Division of the Volunteer Army, M. Drozdovsky, gave an order to shoot more than 1,000 captured prisoners.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1918 when the Whites controlled the Northern Territory with a population of about 400,000 people, more than 38,000 were sent to prisons. Of those, about 8,000 were executed while thousands more died from torture and disease.&lt;ref&gt;Litvin, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern Russia ==

In November 1918, after seizing power in [[Siberia]], [[Alexander Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]] pursued a policy of persecuting revolutionaries as well as Socialists of several factions. Kolchak's government issued a broadly worded decree on 3 December 1918 revising articles of the criminal code of Imperial Russia "in order to preserve the system and rule of the Supreme Ruler". Articles 99 and 100 established capital punishment for assassination attempts on the Supreme Ruler and for attempting to overthrow the authorities. Under Article 103, "insults written, printed, and oral, are punishable by imprisonment". Bureaucratic sabotage under Article 329 was punishable by hard labor from 15 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="cvetkovevoluciazakon"/&gt; Additional decrees followed, adding more power. On 11 April 1919, the Kolchak government adopted Regulation 428, "About the dangers of public order due to ties with the Bolshevik Revolt", which was published in the Omsk newspaper ''Omsk Gazette'' (no. 188 of 19 July 1919). It provided a term of 5 years of prison for "individuals considered a threat to the public order because of their ties in any way with the Bolshevik revolt". In the case of unauthorized return from exile, there could be hard labor from 4 to 8 years. Articles 99-101 allowed the death penalty, forced labor and imprisonment, and repression by military courts, and it also imposed no investigation commissions.&lt;ref name="cvetkovevoluciazakon"/&gt;

An excerpt from the order of the government of Yenisei county in Irkutsk province, General. S. Rozanov said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those villages whose population meets troops with arms, burn down the villages and shoot the adult males without exception.
If hostages are taken in cases of resistance to government troops, shoot the hostages without mercy.&lt;ref name="cvetkovevoluciazakon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A member of the Central Committee of the Right-wing Socialist Revolutionaries, D. Rakov wrote about the terror of Kolchak's forces: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Omsk just froze in horror. At a time when the wives of dead comrades, day and night looked in the snow for bodies, I was unaware of the horror behind the walls of the guardhouse. At least 2500 people were killed. Entire bodies of carts were carried to a city, like winter lamb and pork carcasses. Those who suffered were mainly soldiers of the garrison and the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Litvin, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1919 Admiral Kolchak himself demanded one of his generals to "follow the example of the Japanese who, in the Amur region, had exterminated the local population".&lt;ref name=mayer254/&gt; Kolchak's regime also used mass floggings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://66.mvd.ru/gumvd/history/ | title = Наша история |trans-title=Our History | publisher = ГЛАВНОЕ УПРАВЛЕНИЕ МВД РОССИИ ПО СВЕРДЛОВСКОЙ ОБЛАСТИ (General Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk Region) | quote = К концу 1918 года в восточных районах страны была установлена контрреволюционная диктатура адмирала Колчака.

За время своего господства белогвардейцы замучили и расстреляла в Екатеринбургской губернии свыше 25 тысяч человек и около 200 тысяч подвергли порке. (By the end of 1918, Admiral Kolchak established a counter-revolutionary dictatorship in the eastern part of the country. Whites in the occupied territory committed the cruelest terror.

In the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East, extraordinary cruelty was practiced by several Cossack warlords: B. Annenkov, [[Alexander Dutov|A. Dutov]], [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|G. Semyonov]], and J. Kalmykov. During the trial against Annenkov, there was testimony about the robbing peasants and atrocities under the slogan: “We have no restrictions! God is with us and Ataman Annenkov: slash right and left!”.&lt;ref&gt;Litvin, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1918, during the suppression of peasant uprisings in Slavgorod county, Annenkov tortured and killed up to 500 people. The village of Black Dole was burned down, after which peasants were shot, tortured, and hanged on pillars, including the wives and children of the peasants. Girls of Slavgorod and surrounding areas were brought to Annenkov's train, raped, and then shot. According to an eyewitness, Annenkov behaved with brutal torture: victims had their eyes gouged and tongues and strips of their back cut off, were buried alive, or tied to horses. In Semipalatinsk, Annenkov threatened to shoot every fifth resident if the city refused to pay indemnities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Litvin, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 1918, after Ataman Dutov captured Alekasandrov-Gai village, nearly 2,000 men of the Red Army were buried alive. More than 700 people of the village were executed. After capturing Troitsk, Orenburg, and other cities, a regime of terror was installed. One prison in Orenburg contained over 6,000 people, of whom 500 were killed just during interrogations. In Chelyabinsk, Dutov's men executed or deported to Siberian prisons over 9,000 people. In Troitsk, Dutov's men in the first weeks after the capture of the city shot about 700 people. In Ileka they killed over 400. These mass executions were typical of Dutov's Cossack troops.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ratkovsky, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Dutov's Executive order of 4 August 1918 imposed the death penalty for evasion of military service and for even passive resistance to authorities on its territory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In one district of the Ural region in January 1918, Dutov's men killed over 1,000 people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; On 3 April 1919, the Cossack warlord ordered his troops to shoot and take hostages for the slightest display of opposition. In the village of Sugar, Dutov's men burned down a hospital with hundreds of Red Army patients.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Semenov regime in Transbaikalia was characterized by mass terror and executions. At the Adrianovki station in summer of 1919, more than 1,600 people were shot. Semenov himself admitted in court that his troops burned villages. Eleven permanent death houses were set up, where refined forms of torture were practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=словари |url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00070/11100.htm |title=Semenovshchina |publisher=Slovari.yandex.ru |date= |accessdate=2009-07-22}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semyonov personally supervised the torture chambers, during which some 6,500 people were murdered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Litvin, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Major General William S. Graves, who commanded American occupation forces in Siberia, testified that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Semeonoff and Kalmikoff soldiers, under the protection of Japanese troops, were roaming the country like wild animals, killing and robbing the people, and these murders could have been stopped any day Japan wished. If questions were asked about these brutal murders, the reply was that the people murdered were Bolsheviks and this explanation, apparently, satisfied the world. Conditions were represented as being horrible in Eastern Siberia, and that life was the cheapest thing there. There were horrible murders committed, but they were not committed by the Bolsheviks as the world believes. I am well on the side of safety when I say that the anti-Bolsheviks killed one hundred people in Eastern Siberia, to everyone killed by the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Graves. ''America's Siberian adventure, 1918–1920''. Arno Press. 1971. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In literature ==
Many Russian authors wrote about the heroism of the Russian people in combating the White Terror. Novels include Furmanov's [[Vasily Chapayev|''Chapaev'']], [[Alexander Serafimovich|Serafimovich]]'s ''The Iron Flood'', and [[Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev|Fadeyev]]'s ''The Rout''.  Many of the early short stories and novels of [[Mikhail Sholokhov|Sholokhov]], [[Leonid Leonov|Leonov]], and [[Konstantin Fedin|Fedin]] were devoted to this theme.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Chakravarti &amp; A. K. Basu. ''Soviet Union: Land and People''. Northern Book Centre. 1987. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
 	 		
[[Nikolai Ostrovsky]]'s autobiographical novel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ostrovskiy-memory.info/muzey_moskva | title = Музей Николая Островского г. Москва |trans-title=Nikolai Ostrovsky Museum, Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''How the Steel was Tempered'' documents episodes of the White Terror in western Ukraine by anti-Soviet units.

== Memorials to victims of the White Terror ==
In Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and elsewhere, a significant number of monuments are dedicated to victims of the White Terror. Most monuments were placed on the mass graves created by the terror.&lt;ref name="monument.volgadmin.ru"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://monument.volgadmin.ru/start.asp?np=3-11 | title = Памятники и достопримечательности Волгограда |trans-title=Monuments and Landmarks of Volgograd | publisher = МБУ "Городской информационный центр" (MBU "City Information Center")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1920, the central square in [[Volgograd]] has been called the "Square of Fallen Fighters", where the remains of 55 victims of the White Terror are buried. A monument established in 1957 in black and red granite has an inscription: "To the freedom fighters of [[Battle for Tsaritsyn|Red Tsaritsyn]]. Buried here are the heroic defenders of Red Tsaritsyn brutally tortured by White Guard butchers in 1919."&lt;ref name="monument.volgadmin.ru"/&gt;

A monument to victims of the White Terror stands in [[Vyborg]]. It was erected in 1961 near the Leningrad Highway to commemorate 600 people shot by [[machine gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vyborgcity.ru/text/text_24.htm | title = Скульптура Выборга |trans-title=Sculpture of Vyborg | work = Выборга (Vyborg)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "In Memory of Victims of the White Terror" monument in [[Voronezh]] is located in a park near the regional Nikitinskaia libraries. The monument was unveiled in 1920 on the site of public executions in 1919 by the troops of Mamantov.

In [[Sevastopol]] on the 15th Bastion Street, there is a "Communard Cemetery and victims of White terror". The cemetery is named in honor of the members of the Communist underground murdered by Whites in 1919–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sevmonument.ru/readarticle.php?article_id=142 | title = Кладбище Коммунаров |trans-title=Cemetery of Communards (5th St. Bastion) | work = Памятники Севастополя (The Monuments of Sevastopol)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Slavgorod]] in [[Altai Krai]], there is a monument for participants of the Chernodolsky Uprising and their families who fell victim to the White terror of Ataman Annekov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://slavgorod.ru/old/news/news.php?id=1248 | title = Памятник борцам революции, ставшим жертвами белого террора, нуждается в серьёзной реконструкции |trans-title=The monument to the fighters of the revolution victims of the White Terror, in need of serious renovation | first = Svetlana | last = Cherniavsky | date = 2006-09-19 | newspaper = Славгородские вести (Slavgorodskaya Leader)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
