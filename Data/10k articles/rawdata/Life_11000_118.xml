'''Abraham of Bulgaria''' ({{lang-ru|Авраамий Болгарский}}; died April 1, 1229) was a [[Christian]] convert from [[Islam]] later made a [[martyr]] and [[saint]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

He was born in [[Volga Bulgaria]], amongst the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgars]] in what is now [[Tatarstan]], [[Russia]]. He grew to become an [[Islam]]ic merchant, and was good and kindly towards the destitute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oca.org/saints/lives/2012/04/01/100965-martyr-abraham-of-bulgaria "Martyr Abraham of Bulgaria", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt; He later converted to [[Christianity]]. Muslims persistently persuaded him to renounce Christ, but Abraham was unshakable in his faith and was truncated by the sword (quarted) for his conversion by his compatriots on 1 April {{circa}} 1229 at the Volga bank. The saint was buried by Russian merchants in the Christian cemetery in [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] (the capital of [[Volga Bulgaria]]). Grand prince of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] [[Yuri II of Vladimir|Georgy Vsevolodovich]] ordered the transfer of the body of Abraham to Vladimir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravenc.ru/text/62936.html/ АВРААМИЙ [АВРАМИЙ] БОЛГАРСКИЙ (in Russian)] Retrieved on 28 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, according to the chronicle testimony, the city of Bulgar (Bolgar) was burnt as a punishment "for the blood of the martyr of Christ". On the spot of execution of Abraham of Bulgaria a healing spring appeared. A local legend says that the first person to be healed by this source was a man of the [[Mohammedan]] religion. &lt;ref&gt;[http://svyato.info/2009/04/15/rodnik-svyatoi-istochnik-avraamija-bolgarskogo.html/ Святой источник (Saint spring)] Retrieved on 28 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

His relics are venerated at [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] on the [[Klyazma River|Klyazma]]. [[Laurentian Codex|Laurentian Chronicle]] contains the registry about this event that took place on 9 March 1230. 

His [[feast day]] is celebrated on March 9, the translation of relics, and is also commemorated on April 1.

However, due to internal feuding war broke out between the brothers and Mohammed was killed by troops of al-Rashid in 1664.

With a small army al-Rashid ruled the east of Morocco. He was able to expand his power and seize [[Taza]]. In 1666 he marched into [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and ended the rule of the [[zaouia of Dila]], a Berber movement which ruled the northern part of Morocco. After subjugating the northern coastal areas of Morocco he also succeeded in capturing [[Marrakech]] in 1669.

{{House of York|plantagenet}}

'''Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter''' aka '''Anne Plantagenet''' (10 August 1439 – 14 January 1476) was the first child of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]]. She was thus the eldest sister of kings [[Edward IV]] (1461–1483)  and [[Richard III]] (1483–1485); and of [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], [[Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk]],  [[Margaret of York|Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy]] and of [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]].

==Marriages and issue==
Anne married twice and divorced her first husband:

===First marriage===
[[Image:Arms of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter.svg|thumb|Arms of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter: ''[[Royal Arms of England|England]], a bordure of [[Royal arms of France|France]]]]
In 1447 aged eight years old, Anne was married to [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter]] (1430–1475). During the [[Wars of the Roses]] Exeter sided with the [[House of Lancaster]] against his wife's family the [[House of York]]. Exeter was a commander at the great Lancastrian victories at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and [[Second Battle of St Albans]]. He was also a commander at the Lancastrian defeat at the [[Battle of Towton]]. He fled to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] after the battle, and then joined [[Margaret of Anjou]] in her exile in France, queen consort of the Lancastrian King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. On 4 March 1461 Anne's younger brother Edward, Duke of York, was declared in London as King Edward IV. Exeter was [[attainder|attainted]] but the new king gave his estates to Anne, with [[remainder (law)|remainder]] to their daughter Anne Holland. Anne and Exeter separated in 1464 and divorced in 1472. During the [[Readeption of Henry VI]], Anne remained loyal to her brother Edward, and, in what seems to have been her only intervention in politics, worked hard to persuade her brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]], to abandon the Lancastrian cause. If not decisive, her arguments certainly had some effect and thus she played some part in Edward's restoration.

By the Duke of Exeter Anne had one daughter, Anne Holland (1461&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 57, f. 2*r&lt;/ref&gt; – between 26 August 1467 and 6 June 1474), who was married in October 1466{{sfn|Cawley|2011|loc=Earls of Kent}} at [[Greenwich Palace]] to [[Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset]], son of Edward IV's queen [[Elizabeth Woodville]] by her first husband. Lady Dorset died sometime between 26 August 1467 and 6 June 1474 without children. Grey subsequently married [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington]], another rich young heiress, by whom he had issue.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Charles Derek (1974). ''Edward IV''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage===
[[File:Arms of St Leger.svg|thumb|150px|Arms of St Leger: ''Azure fretty argent, a chief or''&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.365, St Leger, [[Earl of Doneraile]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Anne married secondly in about 1474 to [[Thomas St. Leger]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1440 – 1483), a loyal follower of his brother-in-law King Edward IV (1461–1483). He took part in the Duke of Buckingham's [[Buckingham's rebellion|attempted rebellion]] against King Edward's younger brother and eventual successor King Richard III (1483–1485), on the failure of which he was executed in 1483.  King Edward IV had however in  1467 extended the [[remainder (law)|remainder]] of most of the former Duke of Exeter's lands to his sister Anne and to any heirs of her body. Thus, if she remarried any future children could inherit them.

Anne died giving birth to her only daughter by Thomas, [[Anne St. Leger]] (14 January 1476 – 21 April 1526), who  due to the special remainder was  heiress to the estates of her mother's first husband Henry Holland.{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=336-337}} She married [[George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros]], and was mother of the royal favourite [[Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland]].

==Death and burial==
[[File:RutlandChapelGlass 1849 StGeorgesChapel Windsor.PNG|thumb|Heraldic glass in the Rutland Chapel, [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], erected in 1849 by [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland]]. It shows far left the arms of Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter (1439–1476) impaled by the arms of her 1st husband [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter]]. To the right of the last are her arms impaled by the arms of her 2nd husband Sir [[Thomas St Leger]] (c. 1440 – 1483), [[Order of the Garter|KG]]. The rightmost window shows top: the arms of Anne's daughter Anne St Leger impaled by the arms of her husband [[George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros]] (c. 1470 – 1513). Below are the arms of his son [[Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland]] (c. 1492 – 1543) impaling the arms of his 2nd wife Eleanor Paston]]
Anne died and was buried on 1 February 1476 in the St Leger [[Chantry chapel|Chantry]], forming the northern transept of [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], founded in 1481 by her husband,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/archives/blog/?tag=george-manners&lt;/ref&gt; "with two priests singing forevermore". It was later named the Rutland Chantry in honour of her son-in-law [[George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros]] (whose effigy, with that of his wife Anne St Leger, is situated in the chantry), father of [[Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland]]. A [[Monumental brass]] in memory of Anne of York and her husband Sir Thomas St Leger survives on the east wall of the St Leger Chantry inscribed as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Wythin thys Chappell lyethe beryed Anne Duchess of Exetur suster unto the noble kyng Edward the forte. And also the body of syr Thomas Sellynger knyght her husband which hathe funde within thys College a Chauntre with too prestys sy’gyng for ev’more. On whose soule god have mercy. The wych Anne duchess dyed in the yere of oure lorde M Thowsande CCCCl xxv" 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The arms above Anne show her paternal arms of the Dukes of York: in the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] half the [[royal arms of England]], emphasising their descent from [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]] (1338–1368), third son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (on which basis the House of York claimed the throne), who married [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster]] (1332–1363). Their daughter Philippa de Burgh married [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]], whose son [[Roger de Mortimer, 4th Earl of March]], was the great-grandfather of Anne, her brother King Edward IV, and their siblings; In the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] half are shown in chief: ''Or a [[cross]] gules'' ([[House of de Burgh|de Burgh]]) and in base: ''Barry or and azure, on a chief of the first two pallets between two base esquires of the second over all an inescutcheon argent'' ([[Roger de Mortimer, 4th Earl of March|Mortimer]]).

It is [[ethics]] with respect to real-world actions and their moral considerations in the areas of private and public life, the professions, health, technology, law, and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0006.xml "Applied Ethics"] Oxford Bibliographies.

__NOTOC__

==Modern approach==
Much of applied ethics is concerned with three theories:

# [[Utilitarianism]], where the practical consequences of various policies are evaluated on the assumption that the right policy will be the one which results in the greatest happiness. This theory's main developments came from [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality. Later developments have also adjusted the theory, most notably [[Henry Sidgwick]] who introduced the idea of [[motive (law)|motive]] or [[intent]] in morality, and [[Peter Singer]] who introduced the idea of [[preference]] in moral decision making. 
# [[Deontological ethics]], notions based on 'rules' i.e. that there is an obligation to perform the 'right' action, regardless of actual consequences (epitomized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s notion of the [[Categorical Imperative]] which was the centre to Kant's ethical theory based on [[duty]]). Another key deontological theory is [[Natural Law]], which was heavily developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and is an important part of the [[Catholic Church]]'s teaching on Morals. 
# [[Virtue ethics]], derived from Aristotle's and Confucius's notions, which asserts that the right action will be that chosen by a suitably 'virtuous' agent.

One modern approach which attempts to overcome the seemingly impossible divide between deontology and utilitarianism (of which the divide is caused by the opposite takings of an [[absolute morality|absolute]] and [[Moral relativism|relativist]] moral view) is [[case-based reasoning]], also known as [[casuistry]].  Casuistry does not begin with theory, rather it starts with the immediate facts of a real and concrete case.  While casuistry makes use of ethical theory, it does not view ethical theory as the most important feature of moral reasoning.  Casuists, like Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Abuse of Casuistry'' 1988), challenge the traditional [[paradigm]] of applied ethics.  Instead of starting from theory and applying theory to a particular case, casuists start with the particular case itself and then ask what morally significant features (including both theory and practical considerations) ought to be considered for that particular case.  In their observations of medical ethics committees, Jonsen and Toulmin note that a consensus on particularly problematic moral cases often emerges when participants focus on the facts of the case, rather than on [[ideology]] or [[theory]].  Thus, a Rabbi, a Catholic priest, and an agnostic might agree that, in this particular case, the best approach is to withhold extraordinary medical care, while disagreeing on the reasons that support their individual positions.  By focusing on cases and not on theory, those engaged in moral debate increase the possibility of agreement.

'''''Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States''''' is an anthropological study of childbirth by [[Brigitte Jordan]] published in 1978.

== Background ==
Throughout the book Jordan explores the birth practices of four different cultures: the [[Yucatán|Yucatan]], [[Holland]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]]. In chapter four, she explains in detail why she decided to focus her study on childbirth: "I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth in Four Cultures|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn=0-88133-717-X|location=|pages=93|quote=I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Jordan's work argues against romanticized perspectives of "early, less complex societies"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burtch|first=Brian E.|date=1981-01-01|title=Review of Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden and the United States|jstor=3340150|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie|volume=6|issue=4|pages=547–549|doi=10.2307/3340150}}&lt;/ref&gt; that present childbirth as uncomplicated. Instead, she suggests that childbirth is a life-altering event in all societies, but can be understood differently by using a [[cross-cultural]] perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Four-Cultures-Crosscultural-Investigation/dp/088133717X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486655147&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=birth+in+four+cultures|title=Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|last2=Davis-Floyd|first2=Robbie|date=1992-11-01|publisher=Waveland Pr Inc|isbn=9780881337174|edition=4th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their edited collection, ''Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives'', [[Robbie Davis-Floyd|Robbie E. Davis-Floyd]] and [[Carolyn Sargent|Carolyn F. Sargent]] praised the book for focusing "anthropological attention on childbirth as a subject worthy of in-depth ethnographic fieldwork and cross-cultural comparison, and that inspired many others to enter the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis-Floyd|first1=Robbie E.|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F.|title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520207858|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan argues that birth should be examined utilizing a biosocial approach, which recognizes birth as a biological process that is shaped by social and cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth in Four Cultures: A Cross Cultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn=9780881337174|editor-last=Davis-Floyd|editor-first=Robbie|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=xv-xvi|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a concern for medical safety, Jordan also focuses on "maternal attitudes and participation in birth, the birth setting, and the mother's selection of birth attendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Ronald|year=1980|title=Birth in Four Cultures|url=|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=168|pages=386–387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan uses her observations in the field, alongside academic anthropological sources to analyze birth as it occurs in four different societies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Field method ==
As an ethnographer, Jordan and her collaborator Nancy Fuller incorporated qualitative and quantitative approaches to compare health policies and statistical data from the four birthing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=648585|title=Reviewed Work: Birth in Four Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States by Brigitte Jordan|last=MacCormack|first=Carol|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan employed formal and informal interviews based on her [[participant observation]]. In particular, she used technological means of data collection, such as videotaping and tape recording devices, to record and review her findings and produce high-quality documentation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jordan reflects upon the methodological and ethical responsibility in her research to justify the decision-making process of the biosocial framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=brigitte+jordan+and+interviewing+in+birth+of+four+cultures+4th+edition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kly05PRli-&amp;sig=I0qpb5Z0wky8BCG6cfJYVWd884w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT6-zPwIHSAhUM0oMKHZ2QAQoQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=brigitte%20jordan%20and%20interviewing%20in%20birth%20of%20four%20cultures%204th%20edition&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|last=Frayser|first=Suzanne|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and recognition ==

=== Honors and awards ===
In 1980, Jordan received the [[Margaret Mead Award]] in recognition for ''Birth in Four Cultures''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Academic reviews ===
While much of the reception for ''Birth in Four Cultures'' has been overwhelmingly positive, some anthropologists have criticized Jordan for her exclusive focus on the social aspects of birth without much attention to religious or ideological concerns in her research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Martha A.|date=1979-01-01|title=Review of Birth in Four Cultures|jstor=648398|journal=Medical Anthropology Newsletter|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birth in Four Cultures'' was one of the first [[Ethnography|ethnographies]] to study cross-cultural systems of birth. Jordan argued that economics, culture, and politics affect birth as a system, which led to the beginning of the sub-category of anthropology called Anthropology of Birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ant|title=Perspectives on the Anthropology of Birth|last=Van Hollen|first=Cecilia|date=1994|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=1994|dead-url=|access-date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birth in Four Cultures'' has been used to advocate for preserving midwifery care in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/globalissues.asp|title=Anthropological Perspectives on Global Issues in Midwifery|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|date=2000|website=Midwifery Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Updates and editions ==
There have been four editions of the book in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1993, including updates to the material from Jordan's continued research on the subject. The 4th edition was revised and expanded by anthropologist Robbie Davis-Floyd.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==
Traditionally, most meat was shipped as [[primal cut]]s from the [[slaughterhouse]] to the butcher.  Meat was then cut to commonly used cuts and packaged at the store or was custom cut for consumers.

Case-ready meat is cut and packaged at central regional facilities and sent to retail stores ready for placement in refrigerated display cases.  Local butchering, cutting, trimming, and overwrapping the meat at retail stores is greatly reduced. 

Advantages of the centralized master-packager preparation include: efficiency of centralized operations, tight [[quality control]], close control of sanitization, specialized packaging, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Packaging==

Centralized cutting  and processing of meats has the potential of  reducing the [[shelf life]] of the cuts.  Specialized packaging is needed to regain and even extend that shelf life.  

Packaging includes tray &lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent

==Distribution==
Control of temperature during the distribution [[cold chain]] is critical to meat quality and safety.  An effective [[Quality Management System]] needs to be in place and validated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17355">A '''catch-22''' is a [[paradoxical]] situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Catch-22 | journal=Random House Dictionary | publisher=Random House | year=2012 | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/catch-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OALD&gt;"[http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/catch-22 Catch 22]", ''Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary'', accessed 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Joseph Heller]], who used it in his 1961 novel ''[[Catch-22]]''.

An example is:
: "How am I supposed to gain experience [to find a good job] if I'm constantly turned down for not having any?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jacquelyn|title=When an Employer Requires Experience and You Have None|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/05/09/when-an-employer-requires-experience-and-you-have-none/#66ba99c22878|website=Forbes|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to, but has no control over, because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it (''e.g'', a bank will never issue someone a loan if they ''need'' the money). One connotation of the term is that the creators of the "catch-22" situation have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power.

== Origin and meaning ==

[[Joseph Heller]] coined the term in his 1961 novel ''[[Catch-22]]'', which describes absurd bureaucratic constraints on soldiers in [[World War II]]. The term is introduced by the character Doc Daneeka, an army psychiatrist who invokes "Catch-22" to explain why any pilot requesting mental evaluation for insanity—hoping to be found not sane enough to fly and thereby escape dangerous missions—demonstrates his own sanity in creating the request and thus cannot be declared insane. This phrase also means a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beidler|first1=Philip D.|title=Scriptures for a Generation: What We Were Reading in the '60s|date=1995|isbn=978-0820317878|page=162|quote=It is Catch-22: Dr. Daneeka explains how anybody who is crazy has a right to ask to be removed from combat status but how anybody who asks is revealing a rational concern for his own safety that makes him not crazy;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"You mean there's a catch?"

"Sure there's a catch," Doc Daneeka replied. "Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy."

There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane, he had to fly them. If he flew them, he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to, he was sane and had to. [[John Yossarian|Yossarian]] was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.|4 = }}

Different formulations of "Catch-22" appear throughout the novel. The term is applied to various loopholes and quirks of the military system, always with the implication that rules are inaccessible to and slanted against those lower in the hierarchy. In chapter 6, Yossarian (the pilot) is told that Catch-22 requires him to do anything his [[commanding officer]] tells him to do, regardless of whether these orders contradict orders from the officer's superiors.&lt;ref name=Henriksen&gt;Margot A. Henriksen, ''Dr. Strangelove's America: Society and Culture in the Atomic Age''; University of California Press, 1997; {{ISBN|0-520-08310-5}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGrsQOIQgeYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 250].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a final episode, Catch-22 is described to Yossarian by an old woman recounting an act of violence by soldiers:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/topic/joseph-heller Joseph Heller]", ''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'', accessed via Answers.com, 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CombsNimmo /&gt;

{{quotation|"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing."

"What the hell are you talking about?" Yossarian shouted at her in bewildered, furious protest. "How did you know it was Catch-22? Who the hell told you it was Catch-22?"

"The soldiers with the hard white hats and clubs. The girls were crying. 'Did we do anything wrong?' they said. The men said no and pushed them away out the door with the ends of their clubs. 'Then why are you chasing us out?' the girls said. 'Catch 22,' the men said. All they kept saying was 'Catch-22, Catch-22.' What does it mean, Catch 22? What is Catch-22?"

"Didn't they show it to you?" Yossarian demanded, stamping about in anger and distress. "Didn't you even make them read it?"

"They don't have to show us Catch-22," the old woman answered. "The law says they don't have to."

"What law says they don't have to?"

"Catch-22."}}

According to literature professor Ian Gregson, the old woman's narrative defines "Catch-22" more directly as the "brutal operation of power", stripping away the "bogus sophistication" of the earlier scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Gregson, ''Character and Satire in Post War Fiction''; London: Continuum, 2006; {{ISBN|9781441130006}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0qqaRTVt_sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances in the novel ===

Besides referring to an unsolvable logical [[dilemma]], Catch-22 is invoked to explain or justify the military bureaucracy. For example, in the first chapter, it requires Yossarian to sign his name to letters that he censors while he is confined to a hospital bed. One clause mentioned in chapter 10 closes a loophole in promotions, which one private had been exploiting to reattain the attractive rank of [[Private First Class]] after any promotion. Through [[courts-martial]] for going [[AWOL]], he would be busted in rank back to private, but Catch-22 limited the number of times he could do this before being sent to the stockade.

At another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected.

At one point, Captain Black attempts to press Milo into depriving [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]] of food as a consequence of not signing a loyalty oath that Major Major was never given an opportunity to sign in the first place. Captain Black asks Milo, "You're not against Catch-22, are you?"

In chapter 40, Catch-22 forces Colonels Korn and Cathcart to promote Yossarian to Major and ground him rather than simply sending him home. They fear that if they do not, others will refuse to fly, just as Yossarian did.

=== Significance of the number 22 ===

{{main|Catch-22#Explanation of the novel's title|Catch-22}}
Heller originally wanted to call the phrase (and hence, the book) by other numbers, but he and his publishers eventually settled on 22. The number has no particular significance; it was chosen more or less for [[euphony]]. The title was originally ''Catch-18'', but Heller changed it after the popular ''[[Mila 18]]'' was published a short time beforehand.&lt;ref name="Aldridge1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt;

== Usage ==

The term "catch-22" has filtered into common usage in the English language.&lt;ref name=OALD /&gt; In a 1975 interview, Heller said the term would not translate well into other languages.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669372/A-classic-by-any-other-name.html A classic by any other name]", ''The Telegraph'', 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

James E. Combs and Dan D. Nimmo suggest that the idea of a "catch-22" has gained popular currency because so many people in modern society are exposed to frustrating bureaucratic logic. They write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone, then, who deals with organizations understands the bureaucratic logic of Catch-22. In high school or college, for example, students can participate in student government, a form of self-government and democracy that allows them to decide whatever they want, just so long as the principal or dean of students approves. This bogus democracy that can be overruled by arbitrary fiat is perhaps a citizen's first encounter with organizations that may profess 'open' and libertarian values, but in fact are closed and hierarchical systems. Catch-22 is an organizational assumption, an unwritten law of informal power that exempts the organization from responsibility and accountability, and puts the individual in the absurd position of being excepted for the convenience or unknown purposes of the organization.&lt;ref name=CombsNimmo&gt;James E. Combs &amp; Dan D. Nimmo, ''The Comedy of Democracy''; Westport, CT: Praeger (Greenwood Publishing Group), 1996; {{ISBN|0-275-94979-6}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJw9OdBFgmgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 152].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Along with George Orwell's "[[doublethink]]", "Catch-22" has become one of the best-recognized ways to describe the predicament of being trapped by contradictory rules.&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, "[http://thesmartset.com/article/article07181101.aspx 22 Going on 50: Half a century later, the world is full of Catch-22s]"; ''The Smart Set'', 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant type of definition of [[alternative medicine]] has been termed a catch-22. In a 1998 editorial co-authored by [[Marcia Angell]], a former editor of the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'', argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments."&lt;ref name= Angell1998&gt;{{cite journal |title= Alternative medicine--The risks of untested and unregulated remedies |last1= Angell |first1= M. |last2= Kassirer |first2= J.P. |authorlink= Marcia Angell |journal= [[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 339 |issue= 12 |pages= 839–41 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9738094 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199809173391210 |ref= harv|displayauthors= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition has been described by [[Robert L. Park]] as a logical catch-22 which ensures that any [[Portal:Complementary and alternative medicine|Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)]] method which is proven to work "would no longer be CAM, it would simply be medicine."&lt;ref name=Park_Catch-22&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L.]], [http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn032902.html Alternative Medicine: The Clinton Commission's Catch-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic ==

The [[Archetype|archetypal]] ''catch-22'', as formulated by [[Joseph Heller|Heller]], involves the case of [[John Yossarian]], a [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]], who wishes to be grounded from combat flight. This will only happen if he is evaluated by the squadron's [[flight surgeon]] and found "unfit to fly". "Unfit" would be any pilot who is willing to fly such dangerous missions, as one would have to be [[Insanity|mad]] to volunteer for possible death. However, to be evaluated, he must ''request'' the evaluation, an act that is considered sufficient proof for being declared sane. These conditions make it impossible to be declared "unfit".

The "Catch-22" is that "anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy".&lt;ref name="Heller1999" /&gt; Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation ''are'' sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.

Therefore, Catch-22 ensures that no pilot can ever be grounded for being insane even if he is.

A logical formulation of this situation is:
{{Aligned table |cols=4
 |col1style=width:3.0em;text-align:center; |col2style=padding-right:1.0em; |col3style=width:47.0em;line-height:1.35em;padding-right:1.5em;
 | 1. | &lt;math&gt;(E \rightarrow (I \land R))&lt;/math&gt;
      | For a person to be excused from flying (E) on the grounds of insanity, they must both be insane (I) and have requested an evaluation (R). | ([[premise]])
 | 2. | &lt;math&gt;(I \rightarrow \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;
      | An insane person (I) does not request an evaluation (¬R) because they do not realize they are insane. | (premise)
 | 3. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg I \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;
      | Either a person is not insane (¬I) or does not request an evaluation (¬R). | {{nowrap|(2. and [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]])}}
 | 4. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg (I \land R))&lt;/math&gt;
      | No person can be both insane (I) and request an evaluation (R). | (3. and [[De Morgan's laws]])
 | 5. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg E)&lt;/math&gt;
      | Therefore, no person can be excused from flying (¬E) because no person can be both insane and have requested an evaluation. | (4., 1. and ''[[modus tollens]]'')
}}

The philosopher [[Laurence Goldstein (philosopher)|Laurence Goldstein]] argues that the "airman's dilemma" is logically not even a condition that is true under no circumstances; it is a "vacuous biconditional" that is ultimately meaningless. Goldstein writes:&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Goldstein, "[http://philpapers.org/rec/GOLTBR The Barber, Russell's paradox, catch-22, God, contradiction and more: A defence of a Wittgensteinian conception of contradiction]"; in ''The law of non-contradiction: new philosophical essays'', ed. Graham Priest, Jc Beall &amp; Bradley Armour-Garb; Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The catch is this: what looks like a statement of the conditions under which an airman can be excused flying dangerous missions reduces not to the statement

:(i) 'An airman can be excused flying dangerous missions if and only if Cont' (where 'Cont' is a contradiction)  
 
(which could be a mean way of disguising an unpleasant truth), but to the worthlessly empty announcement 
 
:(ii) 'An airman can be excused flying dangerous missions if and only if it is not the case that an airman can be excused flying dangerous missions' 
 
If the catch were (i), that would not be so bad—an airman would at least be able to discover that under no circumstances could he avoid combat duty. But Catch-22 is worse—a welter of words that amounts to nothing; it is without content, it conveys no information at all.}}

'''Cesar Francesco Barone'''&amp;nbsp;(born&amp;nbsp;'''Adolph James Rode'''&amp;nbsp;on December 4, 1960 in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]&amp;nbsp;- died on December 24, 2009 in [[Salem, Oregon]]) was an American&amp;nbsp;[[serial killer]]. He was [[sentenced to death]]&amp;nbsp;in 1995 for assaulting and killing four women in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]&amp;nbsp;area between 1991 and 1993.

== Biography ==
When he was three, his mother left the household to live with another man; his parents divorced the following year and Cesar was raised by his father and his new partner.&lt;ref name="Cesar Barone : Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Rode,%20Adolph%20James.pdf|title=Adolph James Rode a.k.a Cesar Barone : Life event||format=PDF|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of fifteen, he entered the home of Alice Stock, a neighbour in her seventies, threatening her with a knife and ordering her to undress: the old lady refused and Cesar left the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Levin, ''Serial Killers and Sadistic Murderers : Up Close and Personal'', Prometheus Books, 2008, {{P.|54}}. {{ISBN|1591025761}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his aggression and other acts of delinquency, he was placed in a center for problematic adolescents, and as soon as he was released, he was back to his old lifestyle. A violent and [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] teenager, Barone became a regular consumer of various drugs and alcohol ([[Methaqualone]], [[cocaine]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], etc.), and committed new burglaries and assaults until he was arrested in 1977; he was then sentenced to two years in prison. Released in November 1979, he later tried to break into the home of his former stepmother, who managed to escape.

In 1980, Cesar Barone was sentenced again for several burglaries and imprisoned. During his incarceration at [[Cross City, Florida|Cross County]] Prison in Florida, he assaulted a female prison guard and tried to rape her: he was then transferred to the [[Florida State Prison]] in [[Starke, Florida|Starke]], where he met [[Ted Bundy]], a serial killer.

Released in 1987 after seven years in detention, he moved to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]&amp;nbsp;with his girlfriend Kathi Scarbrough, whom he met in prison. Shortly after, Adolph James Rode decided to rename himself Cesar Francesco Barone.&amp;nbsp;In 1988, Cesar and Kathi married and moved to [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], in [[Oregon]].

In 1989, unable to keep a job (he changed employers six times in a few months), Cesar Barone decided to join the army. He received a qualification of "good shooter" with the [[M16 rifle|M16]], the parachutist and first aid badges. In December of that same year, he participated in the [[US invasion of Panama]], and later said that he had killed many Panamanians, both civilian and military.&amp;nbsp;In 1990, he was accused of exposing himself to a female officer and eventually was kicked out of the army after his superiors learned that he had changed his identity and had spent several years in prison.

From 1991 to 1993, Cesar Barone killed at least four women around Portland, as well as sexually assaulting another three during that same period without killing them.&lt;ref name="Montaldo"&gt;Charles Montaldo, [https://www.thoughtco.com/serial-rapist-and-killer-cesar-barone-973160 «&amp;nbsp;Profile of Serial Rapist and Killer Cesar Barone&amp;nbsp;»], 31 mars 2016, ''thoughtco.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Saker, [http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/oregon_death_row_inmate_cesar.html «&amp;nbsp;Oregon death row inmate dies, taking secrets with him&amp;nbsp;»], ''oregonlive.com'', 24 décembre 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;It is suspected that he had more victims.

Barone was arrested on February 27, 1993, and was [[sentenced to death]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, ''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'', Infobase Publishing, 2006, {{P.|395}}. {{ISBN|0816069875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 2009, Cesar Barone died of natural causes at the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] in Salem, after spending several weeks in the medical section of the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/12/25/01011-20091225FILWWW00009-mort-naturelle-d-un-tueur-recidiviste-.php «&amp;nbsp;Mort naturelle d'un tueur récidiviste&amp;nbsp;»], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 25 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Edward Conder''' (24 October 1868&amp;nbsp;– 9 February 1909)&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; was an [[England|English]]-born [[Painting|painter]], [[lithographer]] and designer. He emigrated to [[Australia]] and was a key figure in the [[Heidelberg School]], arguably the beginning of a distinctively Australian tradition in Western art.

==Early life==

Conder was born in [[Tottenham]], [[Middlesex]], the second son, of six children, of James Conder, [[civil engineer]] and Mary Ann Ayres.&lt;ref&gt;Conder's other surviving siblings were Samuel James and Alice. (Gibson, 1914, p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several years as a young child in [[India]] until the death of his mother (aged 31 years) on 14 May 1873 in [[Bombay]], when Charles was four; he was then sent back to England and attended a number of schools including a boarding school at [[Eastbourne]], which he attended from 1877. He left school at 15, and his very religious, non-artistic father, against Charles's natural artistic inclinations, decided that he should follow in his footsteps as a civil engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, at the age of 16, he was sent to [[Sydney]], Australia, where he worked for his uncle, a [[Surveying|land surveyor]] for the [[New South Wales]] government. However he disliked the work, much preferring to draw the landscape rather than survey it. In 1886, he left the job and became an artist for the "Illustrated Sydney News", where he was in the company of other artists such as [[Albert Henry Fullwood]], [[Frank P. Mahony|Frank Mahony]]  and [[Benjamin Edwin Minns]]. He also attended the painting classes of [[Alfred James Daplyn]] and had joined the Art Society of New South Wales.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;Ursula Hoff, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030418b.htm Conder, Charles Edward (1868–1909)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Vol. 3, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1969, pp 446–447.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, pp. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Charles Conder - A holiday at Mentone - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[A holiday at Mentone]]'', c. 1888 (This painting featured on a 1984 Australian postage stamp)]] 
[[File:Conder - La morte amoureuse, 1910.jpg|thumb|''La Morte Amoureuse'' (1910, watercolour on silk)]]
In 1888, Conder moved to [[Melbourne]] where he met other Australian artists including [[Arthur Streeton]], and shared a studio with [[Tom Roberts]], whom he had previously met in Sydney. Short of cash, the attractive Conder apparently paid off his landlady by sexual means, catching [[syphilis]] in the process, which was to plague the later years of his life.  During his two years in Melbourne, Conder worked with the other members of the school and produced a number of famous works, including ''Under The Southern Sun''. This painting clearly shows the burning sunlight and desolation that can be inflicted by an Australian [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Conder_southern.htm ''Under the Southern Sun'', 1890] (artistsfootsteps.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, he moved to Paris and studied at the [[Académie Julian]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=WYaRX58a0_IC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian%22&amp;f=false Ian Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', P.164]&lt;/ref&gt; where he befriended several avant-garde artists.

In Sydney and later Melbourne Conder associated with [[G. P. Nerli]], an itinerant Italian painter and the bearer of new European influences who has been credited with shaping Conder's development. The extent of the influence has been debated, but the fact of it is undeniable. Like Conder, Nerli was a bon-vivant whose appreciation of the 'dam fine' 'Melbourne girls' survives in a letter to a mutual friend, [[Percy Spence]].
[[File:Charles Conder - An Early Taste for Literature, 1888.jpg|thumbnail|''An Early Taste for Literature'']]
Regarded as his greatest Sydney painting, ''Departure of the Orient – Circular Quay'' (1888)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/829/|title=Departure of the Orient - Circular Quay|last=Conder|first=Charles|date=1888|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the culmination of Conder’s new mastery of form and brushwork. Painted from the vantage point of an upstairs room at the First and Last Hotel, overlooking the bustling harbour and ferry berths at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, this work depicts the dockside scene at the moment when the ‘Orient’ has cast off for her voyage to England. The theme of lively urban streetscapes and rainy atmospheric conditions was one that derived originally from Japanese art and informed the work of the American-born James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who in turn inspired a generation of international artists conversant with the principles of French Impressionism.
Following successful sale of this work to the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], Conder departed for Melbourne in October 1888 to join Roberts and the circle of painters working there. He returned to Europe in 1890, where he became fully involved with Aestheticism and mixed with leading artists and writers of the day including Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/work/829/&lt;/ref&gt;

Conder was a fun-loving man who painted with an often humorous touch. While staying with Tom Roberts in his famous [[Grosvenor chambers]] studio, he painted ''[[A holiday at Mentone]]'' (1888), which shows men and women at the beach relaxing while clothed from head to foot–the men in suits and hats; the ladies in long, girdled dresses with boots and pretty hats. The man and woman at the front of the painting face away from each other, yet possibly are interested in each other, each watching the other from the corner of their eye. The mood is one of simple elegance and with a relaxed feel, as in the background people are strolling along the beach into the distance. The composition of the painting has possibly been borrowed from a work by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in which a bridge similarly transects the  picture. Conder among other painters such as [[Frederick McCubbin]] had been directly or indirectly influenced by Whistler.

===Europe===

Conder left Australia in 1890, and spent the rest of his life in Europe, mainly England, but visiting [[France]] on many occasions.  His art was better received in England than in [[Paris]].  In 1892, [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] painted his portrait, this sketch is owned by the [[Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museum]].

In 1895, Conder came to Dieppe, attempting to socialise among the artistic community and the English families with their attractive daughters, as described by Simona Pakenham in her study of the English people there in the century before World War I. His friends remembered him as " a sick man, unable to face reality". In spite of drunken spells and disreputable company, Conder's powers as an artist were then at their height. He made a specialty of painting on silk, relatively easy on silk fans, but he excelled on one occasion when he painted a series of white silk gowns worn by Alexandra Thaulow, wife of Norwegian painter [[Frits Thaulow]], while she stood on a table, the gowns becoming "coloured like a field of flowers".&lt;ref&gt;Simona Pakenham, ''Sixty Miles from England'', p.145-148.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Aubrey Beardsley]] in Dieppe, but they did not like each other.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Pakenham, ''Sixty Miles from England'', p.152&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to paint, but his output was severely affected by the continual poor health, including paralysis and a bout of [[delirium tremens]].

He married a wealthy widow, Stella Maris Belford (née MacAdams) at The British Embassy Paris on 5 December 1901, giving him financial security.  His later works are not nearly as well regarded critically as his earlier Australian paintings.

==Later life and death==
He spent the last year of his life in a sanatorium, and died in [[Holloway Sanatorium]] of "[[general paresis of the insane]]", in modern terms tertiary syphilis. In death, Conder's work was rated highly by many notable artists, such as [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].

The [[Canberra]] suburb of [[Conder, Australian Capital Territory|Conder]], established in 1991, was named after him. Satirist [[Barry Humphries]] is a major aficionado and collector of the artist, and at one time had the world's largest private collection of Conder's work.&lt;ref&gt;Clive James, "Approximately in the Vicinity of Barry Humphries", ''London Review of Books'', 6–9 October 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4088">{{Humanism}}

'''Christian humanism''' regards humanist principles like universal human dignity and [[individualism|individual]] freedom and the primacy of human happiness as essential and principal components of, or at least compatible with, the teachings of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/christian_humanism_religious_humanism_and_secular_humanism/&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Definitions == 

Proponents of the term "Christian humanism" assert a continuity with early Modern [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]], humanities scholars, often Catholics, whose works revived some secular thinking from the ancient world. This definition of "Christian humanism" draws a continuity between late-medieval humanities scholars and modern-day Christians who identify more closely with "ancient secular values".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Humanism|url=http://www.mb-soft.com/believe/txn/chrishum.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prominent humanists reject the validity of terms like "Christian humanism". In ''The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Humanism'', [[Andrew Copson]] of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and [[Humanists UK]] refers to Christian humanism as a "hybrid term... which some from a Christian background have been attempting to put into currency." Copson argues that attempts to append religious adjectives like Christian to the [[life stance]] of [[humanism]] are incoherent, saying these have "led to a raft of claims from those identifying with other religious traditions – whether culturally or in convictions – that they too can claim a ‘humanism’. The suggestion that has followed – that ‘humanism’ is something of which there are two types, ‘religious humanism’ and ‘secular humanism’, has begun to seriously muddy the conceptual water." He encourages religious believers emphasising the humanitarian aspects of their beliefs to make, as philosopher [[Karl Popper]] did, a distinction "between 'humanists' and 'religious humanitarians'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Copson |editor1-first=Andrew | editor2-last=Grayling | editor2-first = Anthony | author-link= Andrew Copson | last=Copson| author-first = Andrew | editor1-link = Andrew Copson | editor2-link = AC Grayling | date=  2015 |title= The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Humanism |chapter-url= https://understandinghumanism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Handbook-of-Humanism-What-is-Humanism.pdf |location= UK |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |page= |isbn= 9781119977179 | chapter = What is Humanism? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Communication ethics''' is the notion that  an individual's or group's behavior are governed by their morals which in turn affects [[communication]].  Generally speaking communication ethics deals with the [[moral good]] present in any form of human communication.  This includes interpersonal communication, [[mass media]]ted communication, and [[digital communication]].

==Overview==
Communication ethics concerns not only the individual, but is of great concern to businesses, corporations, and professional entities.  A business with unethical communication practices is not as effective as one with ethical communication practices. For example, a business with unethical communication practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Who Suppress Free Speech|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/06/filming-the-watchmen-why-the-first-amendment-protects-your-right-to-film-the-police-in-public-places}}&lt;/ref&gt; may withhold evidence that it is harming the environment or breaking a law through a lack of transparence; while a business with ethical communication practices will immediately press a release to the affected parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgeon General on Tobacco|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/initiatives/tobacco/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fearless, Adversarial Journalism|url=http://www.firstlook.org/theintercept/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, transparency makes the business more effective because it notifies its clients, prospective or established, providers/suppliers, or other affiliates of the potential [[environmental hazard]] or law violation. In other words, in this example, transparency will encourage trust and good faith, that the effective business will not conceal what is in the interest of its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Locking In Public Access to Scientific Knowledge by Unlocking Scholarly Research|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/locking-public-access-scientific-knowledge-unlocking-scholarly-research}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of counterexample, there may be a time when censorship is the more effective business practice: take the case of trade secrets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment to Economic Espionage Act|url=https://www.chillingeffects.org/blog_entries/742}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a design method or management tactic is not openly revealed in the name of competitive advantage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Software Foundation Privacy Policy|url=http://www.fsf.org/about/free-software-foundation-privacy-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when terms of agreement/use that a business may have with a service provider forbids transparency. In the latter counterexample, a business may use social media to advertise, but the social media service provider may limit the conduct of its users. Here, if the business considers social media to be a valuable service to achieve its advertising, it may have to censor its product or service to preserve its agreement with the social media provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Terms of Agreement|url=http://www.facebook.com/terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication ethics is also a division &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NCA|title=Communication Ethics Division|url=http://commethics.org/news/}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NCA (National Communication Association) which was established by Western Michigan University in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA Communication Ethics Commission - Newsletter|url=http://wmich.edu/ethics/docs/85_newsletter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the NCA has adopted a Credo for Ethical Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCA Credo|url=http://www.dinfosalum.org/credo2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Communication Ethics Conference has been held every year for the last 13 years, and has various speakers from Communication Studies backgrounds.

'''Cornelis de Bie''' (10 February 1627 – c. 1715) was a Flemish ''[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijker]]'', [[poet]], [[jurist]] and minor [[politician]] from [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]].
He is the author of about 64 works, mostly [[comedies]]. He is known internationally today for his biographical sketches of Flemish and Dutch painters in his ''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]] der Edel Vry Schilderconst'' (the Golden Cabinet of the Honourable Free Art of Painting), first printed in 1662.

==Biography==

He was the son of the painter [[Adriaan de Bie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0069.htm Adriaan de Bie biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the [[Chamber of Rhetoric]] in Lier known as ''den Groeyenden Boom''. After his study at the propedeuse faculty of Arts at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]], he returned to [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] where he became a [[Civil law notary|notary]] and bookseller. He was married twice: the first time to Elisabeth Smits who died in 1662 and the second time to Isabella Caelheyt who died in 1706. He had eight children, four from each wife. He died after 1712 and before 1715.

{{main article|Het Gulden Cabinet}}

When the publisher [[Jan Meyssen]] asked Cornelis de Bie to write a book on painters, he started out to write the most important Dutch book on painters of the seventeenth century. This book of artist biographies continues the traditions of [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Schilder-Boeck'' and [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite]]''. He used biographical material from [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]], but the importance of this work is that it is the only known biography for many painters of the seventeenth century that were active after Vasari and van Mander's periods. Because it is written in verse form, it is rather difficult to read today, but it is longer than 500 pages and includes engravings of more than 50 painters from period paintings and drawings. He was an important source for [[Arnold Houbraken]], who refers to him as ''K. de Bie'', short for Kornelis de Bie.

The work was first published in 1662 in [[Antwerp]] and De Bie has prepared a second edition of the work, but that was never published and the [[manuscript]] is now in the Koninklijk Bibliotheek van België (Royal Library of Belgium) in [[Brussels]]. The work included the biographies of painters, sculptors and architects, both already deceased and living. Most of the work is written in verse and therefore, it is rather a [[panegyric]]. The full title of the work is ''Het Gulden Cabinet vande edele vry Schilder-Const, Ontsloten door den lanck ghewenschten Vrede tusschen de twee machtighe Croonen van Spaignien en Vrancryck, Waer-inne begrepen is den ontsterffelijcken loff vande vermaerste Constminnende Geesten ende Schilders Van deze Eeuw, hier inne meest naer het leven af-gebeldt, verciert met veel vermakelijcke Rijmen ende Spreucken.'' There are also indications that it was rapidly set and printed and therefore, it is possible that it was mainly meant as a commercial work.

===Poetry versus historical accuracy===
Like Vasari and Van Mander before him, De Bie's biographies are interspersed with amusing anecdotes. Although such literary motifs belong to a long rhetorical tradition, many of these stories were labelled "historically unreliable" by leading historians in the 19th century and only recently have some of them been reinstated. However, since they were also often the only surviving source of information about certain painters, these stories have always been repeated as hard facts about the lives of ''other'' painters appearing in the stories. Examples are when Cornelis de Bie describes apprenticeships that were considered improbable because the artist painted in a completely different genre than the teacher. An example is De Bie's statement that [[Philips Wouwerman]] trained with [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3pFbAAAAQAAJ ''Het gulden cabinet vande edel vry schilder const''], online facsimile version in [[Google books]], p.281&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians claimed this was improbable, because Wouwerman painted landscapes with horses and Hals was a portrait painter. Today this is still considered by some to be improbable, though Hals clearly had a large workshop and took on his sons as well as other pupils.

'''DQS''' Holding GmbH based in [[Frankfurt am Main]] is the [[holding company]] of the worldwide DQS Group. The group provides assessments and [[certifications]] of [[management systems]] and processes of any type.

== History ==
DQS was founded in 1985 in Frankfurt am Main and was the first German certification body.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;Wolfgang Hansen: ''Zertifizierung und Akkreditierung von Produkten und Leistungen der Wirtschaft'', Carl Hanser Verlag München Wien, 1993, p. 155, {{ISBN|3-446-17108-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Masing&gt;Walter Masing: ''Handbuch der Qualitätssicherung'', Carl Hanser Verlag, 2nd ed., 1988, p. 972, {{ISBN|3-446-15172-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the founding partners, [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Qualität|DGQ]] ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Qualität|German Society for Quality]]) and [[DIN]] (German Institute for Standardization), was mainly to promote the German economy. The foundation overlapped with the publication of the first drafts of the [[ISO 9000]] series of standards, which also include the most important quality standard worldwide today: [[ISO 9001]].

In 1986 DQS became the first certification body in Germany to issue a certificate according to ISO 9001.&lt;ref name=Franceschini&gt;Fiorenzo Franceschini, Maurizio Galetto, and Giovanni Gianni: ''A new forecasting model for the diffusion of ISO 9000 standard certifications in European countries'', International Journal of Quality &amp; Riliability Management, ''21'' (2004) p. 32–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the merger of DQS with the Management Systems Solutions (MSS) division of the American product certification body [[Underwriters Laboratories Inc.]] in March 2008, DQS-UL Group is currently one of the world's largest system certification bodies. Since June 2015 the company changed its name to DQS Group.

== Corporate Organization ==
DQS Holding GmbH has more than 80 offices in over 60 [[countries]]. DQS Group currently has about 20,000 certified customers{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} across almost all industries with approximately 55,000 certified locations in over 130 countries.

The concern employs 588 people and commands 2,479 [[auditors]] in 2013 (annual average).&lt;ref name="consolidated financial statement" /&gt; Among the largest companies within the group are DQS Inc. (USA), DQS do Brasil Ltd., DQS Japan Inc., DQS Medizinprodukte GmbH (Medical Devices) and DQS GmbH (both Germany).

'''DQS GmbH in Germany'''

Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main and with local offices in [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Stuttgart]], DQS GmbH offers the entire service spectrum{{clarify|date=February 2017}} of the group in Germany. With over 200 employees and about 800 auditors, DQS GmbH is the largest subsidiary of DQS Holding GmbH. Managing Director is Götz Blechschmidt.

== Service spectrum ==
The international offices of DQS Group focus their portfolio of assessment services on their respective market situation and customer requirements. The group’s service spectrum includes cross-industry assessments to customer or industry-specific requirements and certifications to more than 100 nationally and internationally recognized standards and specifications.

In addition, the group also offers assessments in the areas of Risk Management Systems, [[Sustainability]], [[Education]], Data Privacy, [[Business Excellence]], Health and [[Social Services]], and Integrated Management Systems.

=== Network ===
DQS is a charter and full member of the international certification network IQNet Association which was founded in 1990. The main objective of the currently approx. 40-member global network is the mutual recognition of certificates issued by the member companies. The current Managing Director of DQS GmbH, Michael Drechsel, is currently President of the network. Dr Sied Sadek, Managing Director of DQS CFS and DQS Middle East, pointed out in an interview to share DQS's expertise in the field of CSR reporting and DQS's understanding of the necessity to do so sensitive to the regional and cultural context, in the development process of the [[Islamic Reporting Initiative|Islamic Reporting Initiative (IRI)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makingitmagazine.net/?p=9128#IRI&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jainism]], [[Ātman (Jainism)|Ātman]] (soul) is eternal and never dies. According to Tattvartha Sutra which is a compendium of Jain principles, the function of matter ([[pudgala]]) is to contribute to pleasure, suffering, life and death of living beings.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=72}}

==Types of Deaths==
According to Jain texts, there are 17 different types of death:&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavati Aradhana&lt;/ref&gt;

* Avici-marana
* Avadhimarana
* Atyantika-marana
* Vasaharta-marana
* Valana-marana
* Antahsalya-marana
* Tadhava-marana
* Bala-marana or Akama marana
* Pandita-marana or Sakama marana
* Balpandita-marana
* Chadmastha-marana
* Kevali-marana
* Vaihayasa-marana
* Guddhapristha-marana
* Bhaktapratyakhyana-marana
* Inginta-marana
* Padopagamana-marana

=== Akama Marana &amp; Sakama Marana ===
Out of all 17 types of Marana, two are considered important:&lt;ref&gt;Uttaradhyayana Sutra 5:1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akama Marana''' which refers to someone who has attachment to life and doesn't want to die but dies when his life is over. Therefore, he has died helplessly and not on his own accord. According to Jainism, this person is often one who is willingly or unwillingly ignorant to the concepts of rebirth, other worlds, and liberation of the soul.

'''Sakama Marana''' which refers to someone who is not afraid of death and who accepts it willingly and at ease. They understand that there is no way to avoid death and that it is a natural process. Sakama Marana can be further divided into 4 types. These are [[Sallekhana |Samadhi marana]], anasana, santharo, and [[sallekhana]].

Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 44 (1940): 398–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Lesions to the left angular gyrus are associated with finger agnosia, as well as the other symptoms of Gerstmann Syndrome, also known as Angular Gyrus Syndrome. In a study by Rusconi et al., repetitive [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] was used in healthy individuals to simulate finger agnosia. Stimulation to the intraparietal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, as well as the left and right angular gyrus and posterior parietal areas caused difficulties in naming, recognizing, and distinguishing fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Rusconi, E, Walsh, V., Butterworth, B. Dexterity with numbers: rTMS over Left Angular Gyrus disrupts finger gnosis and number processing. Neuropsychologia 43 (2005): 1609–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==

Patients with finger agnosia may have difficulty selectively moving fingers, regardless if it is by command or imitation. Others show an inability to name or point to others' fingers, or to show the same finger on the opposite hand. Persons with finger agnosia are able to name and point to a finger when able to use visual guidance, but will have more errors than a person without the disorder. When their own hand is out of sight and they are asked to name a finger that was touched, they are unable to do so and perform at chance.

==Without Gerstmann syndrome==

Although it is a necessary component of [[Gerstmann syndrome|Gerstmann's syndrome]], cases of finger agnosia alone have been reported. Della Sala et al. reported a woman with a stroke in the left subcortical posterior parietal area who had only finger agnosia a year and a half later.&lt;ref&gt;Della Sala, S, and Spinnler, H. Finger Agnosia: fiction or reality? Archives of Neurology 51.5 (1994): 448–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acalculia ==
There is a strong link between [[acalculia]] and finger agnosia. Early in development, calculation begins with our fingers. The order that we use when we count with our finger is very specific and it is found in a variety of different cultures. The use of a base ten number system is also found in many cultures. Gerstmann believed that it was no coincidence the word digit means both a finger and any numeral.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstmann, J. Syndrome of Finger Agnosia, disorientation for right and left, Agraphia, and Acalculia. Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 44 (1940): 398–408.&lt;/ref&gt;
Rusconi et al. suggested that these two conditions co-occur because they are close in cortical territory. In their 2005 study with repetitive [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS), they noted both finger agnosia and acalculia in the test subjects when areas of the intraparietal sulcus were stimulated.  They concluded that the areas underlying finger agnosia and acalculia are extremely close to one another, but distinct. These areas receive blood from the same branch of the middle cerebral artery. Any damage to that blood supply would cause symptoms of both acalculia and finger agnosia.&lt;ref&gt;Rusconi, E, Walsh, V., Butterworth, B. Dexterity with numbers: rTMS over Left Angular Gyrus disrupts finger gnosis and number processing. Neuropsychologia 43 (2005): 1609–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prognosis==
As in many other agnosias, those with the disorder have difficulty recognizing their errors and often do not correct themselves.
There is no known treatment for finger agnosia. Typically, finger agnosia does not present difficulties in daily life. In most cases, visual guidance can help with any difficulty in distinguishing or moving the appropriate finger.

In [[computer programming]], '''genetic representation''' is a way of representing solutions/individuals in [[evolutionary computation]] methods. Genetic representation can encode appearance, behavior, physical qualities of individuals. Designing a good genetic representation that is expressive and evolvable is a hard problem in evolutionary computation. Difference in genetic representations is one of the major criteria drawing a line between known classes of evolutionary computation.

Terminology often comes by analogy with natural [[genetics]]. The block of computer memory that represents one candidate solution is called an individual. The data in that block is called a chromosome. Each chromosome consists of genes. The possible values of a particular gene are called [[allele]]s. A programmer may represent all the individuals of a population using ''binary encoding'', ''permutational encoding'', ''encoding by tree'', or any one of several other representations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic algorithm]]s use linear binary representations. The most standard one is an array of [[bit]]s. Arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way. The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size. This facilitates simple crossover operation. Variable length representations were also explored in [[Genetic algorithm]]s, but crossover implementation is more complex in this case.

[[Evolution strategy]] uses linear real-valued representations, e.g. an array of real values. It uses mostly [[gaussian]] mutation and blending/averaging crossover.

[[Genetic programming]] (GP) pioneered tree-like representations and developed [[genetic operator]]s suitable for such representations. Tree-like representations are used in GP to represent and evolve functional programs with desired properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~nichael/nlc-publications/icga85/index.html A Representation for the Adaptive Generation of Simple Sequential Programs], Nichael Lynn Cramer, ''Proceedings of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Applications'' (1985), pp.&amp;nbsp;183-187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human-based genetic algorithm]] (HBGA) offers a way to avoid solving hard representation problems by outsourcing all genetic operators to outside agents, in this case, humans. The algorithm has no need for knowledge of a particular fixed genetic representation as long as there are enough external agents capable of handling those representations, allowing for free-form and evolving genetic representations.

Professor '''Johann Georg Bühler''' (July 19, 1837 – April 8, 1898) was a scholar of ancient Indian languages and law.

==Early life and education==
Bühler was born to Rev. Johann G. Bühler in [[Borstel, Lower Saxony|Borstel]], [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], attended grammar school in Hanover, where he mastered [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], then university as a student of theology and philosophy at [[Georg August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where he studied classical [[philology]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Zend language|Zend]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. In 1858 he received his doctorate in eastern languages and [[archaeology]]; his thesis explored the suffix ''-tês'' in Greek grammar. That same year he went to [[Paris]] to study Sanskrit manuscripts, and in 1859 onwards to [[London]], where he remained until October 1862. This time was used mainly for the study of the [[Vedas|Vedic]] manuscripts at the India Office and the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]]. While in England, Bühler was first a private teacher and later (from May 1861) assistant to the Queen's librarian in [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jolly|first=J.|last2=Thite|first2=G. U.|date=2010|title="GEORG BÜHLER (1837-1898)"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41692167|journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|volume=91|pages=155–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In Fall 1862 Bühler was appointed assistant at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] library; he moved there in October. While settling in, he received an invitation via Prof. [[Max Müller]] to join the [[Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi|Benares Sanskrit College]] in [[India]]. Before this could be settled, he also received (again via Prof. Müller) an offer of Professor of Oriental Languages at the [[Elphinstone College]], [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]). Bühler  responded immediately and arrived on February 10, 1863 in Bombay. Noted Sanskrit and legal scholar [[Kashinath Trimbak Telang]] was then a student at the college. In the next year Bühler became a Fellow of [[Bombay University]] and member of the Bombay Branch of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]]. He was to remain in India until 1880. During this time he collected a remarkable number of texts for the Indian government and the libraries of [[Berlin]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], and [[Oxford University]].

In the year 1878 he published his translations of the Paiyalachchhi, the oldest [[Prakrit]] dictionary, with glossary and translation. He also took responsibility for the translation of the [[Apastamba]], [[Dharmasutra]] etc. in Professor [[Max Müller]]'s monumental compilation and translation, the ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'', vols. 2, 14, and 25.

On 8 April 1898 Bühler drowned in [[Lake Constance]], under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Contemporary accounts mostly attributed it to an accident, but it has been speculated that it was a suicide motivated by Bühler's connections to a scandal involving his former student [[Alois Anton Führer]].&lt;ref name=drowning/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19980">The '''Godard family disappearance''' (also known as the '''''affaire Godard''''', or the '''Godard Affair'''), involved the disappearance of [[France|French]] doctor Yves Godard, his second wife and their two children in September 1999. Clues to the mystery were gradually discovered: traces of blood were found in the family home near [[Juvigny-sur-Seulles]] in [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[Lower Normandy]]. Then it was established that Godard and his two children departed on a sailing boat rented in [[Saint-Malo]], [[Brittany]], a few days before the discovery of the blood. During the course of the next few years, various objects were found on the north coast of Brittany or at sea: a lifeboat, identity papers, credit cards, the skull of one of the Godard children, and finally the bones of Godard himself. The case was closed on 14 September 2012.

== Timeline of events ==

=== Disappearance of the Godard family ===
On Monday 30 August 1999, Yves Godard, a 43-year-old doctor and [[acupuncturist]], saw his patients for the last time at his practice in [[Caen]], [[France]]. The following day, Godard cancelled his consultations, put his affairs in order at his practice and took his children fishing in ponds in [[Planquery]], 16 kilometres (10 miles) west of [[Juvigny-sur-Seulles|Juvigny]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = L'Assassinat du docteur Godard|last = Lemasson|first = Éric|publisher = Édition des Arènes|year = 2011 |isbn = 978-2-35204-180-1 |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September, he drove a [[Jeanneau|Jeanneau Sun Oddysey 30]] sailing boat, the ''Nick'', from Pontoon E at the port of [[Saint-Malo]]. His children were also on board: Camille (6) and Marius (4). His wife, Marie-France, was not on the boat with them. He told the owner of the ''Nick'' that he wanted to go on a cruise as far as [[Perros-Guirec]], returning on 5 September.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sur les traces de l'énigmatique docteur Godard|url = http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20111008.OBS2055/sur-les-traces-de-l-enigmatique-docteur-godard.html|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bought cleaning products and floor cloths in Saint-Malo before setting sail, and left them in his [[Volkswagen Westfalia Campers|Volkswagen Camper]] van, which he had parked at the port.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On 2 September, French [[Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes|customs officers]] inspected the ''Nick'' between Cap d'[[Erquy]] and [[Cap Fréhel]]. It was a routine inspection, and the officers noticed one of the children sleeping inside the boat. The ''Nick'' proceeded on its voyage without using the motor once the wind picked up. One of the customs officers was intrigued by Godard's behaviour and checked his story with the boat owner in Saint-Malo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the inspection, Godard's boat seems to have remained for a few days near the Bay of Bréhec, between [[Plouha]] and [[Plouézec]]. Several witnesses in Bréhec saw the ''Nick'' between 2 and 5 September.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among them was a waffle vendor at the small port, who formally testified that Godard and his children came to buy waffles from her on 3 September.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The next day, the ''Nick'' was spotted by a pair of walkers near the Pointe de Minard in Plouézec, apparently abandoned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ''Nick''{{'s}} small pneumatic [[dinghy]] was recovered by a [[Fishing vessel|fishing boat]] on 5 September, the day on which the boat was supposed to return to Saint-Malo.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = La mer a gardé ses secrets|url = http://www.liberation.fr/grand-angle/010198572-la-mer-a-garde-ses-secrets|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dinghy appeared to have been abandoned 30 [[nautical mile]]s (34.5 land miles, 55.5 kilometres) from the [[Île de Batz]] in the [[Finistère]] département. In the dinghy was a jacket and a [[cheque book]] in Godard's name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intrigued, the [[Maritime Gendarmerie]] in [[Roscoff]] opened an investigation into the disappearance. Godard had still not returned to Saint-Malo by 7 September, where investigators found significant traces of blood and doses of [[morphine]] in his van.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = L'énigmatique Dr Godard|url = http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/justice/l-eacute-nigmatique-dr-godard_479015.html|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery forced the investigation to take on more urgency. On 8 September, investigators searched the Godard family home in Juvigny, 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) west of Caen, where they again found significant traces of blood in the bathroom, the living room and the parents' bedroom. On 10 September, a judicial murder investigation was opened, with Godard considered the prime suspect and being made the subject of an [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]]. The investigation was led by Judge Gérard Zaug at the court of Saint-Malo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On 16 September, the blood found in the van was identified as being that of Marie-France Godard, whom no one had seen since 31 August.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Items found since September 1999 ===
On 16 September, eleven days after the dinghy was discovered, amateur sailors off the coast of the [[Channel Islands]] of [[Guernsey]] and [[Alderney|Aurigny]] discovered a [[Personal flotation device|life jacket]] belonging to the ''Nick''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A week later, on 23 September, the inflatable survival raft of Godard's boat was recovered half-deflated on a beach at [[Lyme Bay]] in [[Dorset]], [[England]]. Unusually, the raft's canvas canopy had been cut off and was missing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police appeal - Yachting Monthly|url = http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/police-appeal-26892|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although French investigators were leaning towards the theory that Godard had murdered his wife and then fled,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; these latest discoveries brought chaos into the investigation. According to experts at the French [[Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service]], it was impossible for these items to have been found at these locations as a result of [[ocean current]]s alone:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they had to have been scattered deliberately.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the dinghy's emergency inflation device had been detached. According to the manufacturer, the dinghy could only have remained inflated for 72 hours after this device was removed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 16 January 2000, four months after the disappearance of the Godard family, a canvas bag came up in a fisherman's trawling net off the coast of the Île de Batz.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It contained numerous personal effects belonging to all the members of the family: clothes, driving licences, insurance documents, cheque books, the entire contents of Marie-France Godard's handbag, binoculars and a hammer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French mine-sweeper helps in murder hunt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=20000121&amp;id=gVZIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3773,3822348|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=[[New Straits Times]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=21 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2000, a sea-shell harvester's boat cast its nets along the bed of [[Saint-Brieuc]] Bay, off the coast of [[Erquy]]. In the middle of the night, the [[Dredging|dredger]] brought up a fragment of a human skull, which the fisherman threw back into the water. Four hours later, another skull came up, which the fisherman kept. [[DNA profiling|DNA analysis]] revealed that it was the skull of Camille, Godard's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La fille du docteur Godard a bien péri en mer|url = http://www.leparisien.fr/une/la-fille-du-docteur-godard-a-bien-peri-en-mer-21-06-2000-2001453585.php|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skull of missing girl, 6, is found|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=20000623&amp;id=g54kAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1077,4165896|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=23 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific analysts at [[IFREMER]] concluded that the skull had been at its location since at least February 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This seemed to corroborate the theory that the ''Nick'' somehow sank, claiming the lives of its three passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Archives - Le Point.fr|url = http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/2007-01-16/le-mystere-de-la-baie/920/0/3244|website = Le Point.fr|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Le Point,|last = magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area in which Camille's skull was found – which is close to where the ''Nick'' was inspected by customs officers on 2 September 1999 – was scoured by a [[minehunter]] and the [[French Navy]], but no trace of the boat was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Le voilier du docteur Godard échappe au sonar Saint-Brieuc DE NOTRE ENVOYÉ SPÉCIAL|url = http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/le-voilier-du-docteur-godard-echappe-au-sonar-saint-brieuc-de-notre-envoye-special-26-06-2000-2001464237.php|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation took on a new dimension when Godard's [[business card]] was found on Sunday 11 February 2001 by a walker on a beach on the Ébihans archipelago, off the coast of [[Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Un document du Dr Godard retrouvé|url = http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20010214.OBS2180/un-document-du-dr-godard-retrouve.html|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February, a bank card bearing Godard's name was found on the same beach by a resident of Saint-Jacut. Then, on 24 May, walkers found a credit card, again on the same beach. Investigators searched the beach thoroughly and the [[examining magistrate]] ordered a [[minesweeper]] to survey the seabed around the archipelago, but again no traces of the ''Nick'' were found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On 3 June, another credit card was found off the beach by a diver. These events led the investigators to believe that Godard stopped off at this beach and emptied the contents of his wallet there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La mystérieuse escale du docteur Godard|url = http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/la-mysterieuse-escale-du-docteur-godard-22-06-2001-2002249593.php|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further searches were carried out at the beach, including by a tractor being used to sieve through the sand, but no more of Godard or his family's personal effects were found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, on 31 July, a fifth credit card was found on the beach. All these cards were analysed at a forensic laboratory, whose experts determined that they had not been in the water for long before being discovered, and had therefore not been thrown into the water in September 1999. It is likely that they were discarded one by one into the water in early 2001.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Investigators and the lawyer of Marie-France Godard's family believe that it was the work of an accomplice who wanted to make it look like the deaths of Yves Godard and his children were accidental.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A briefcase believed to belong to Godard was found on 8 August 2003 in Saint-Brieuc Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Le nom du Dr Godard dans une mallette à la mer|url = http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101451198-le-nom-du-dr-godard-dans-une-mallette-a-la-mer|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, investigators have never confirmed its authenticity, and it is likely that it was a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La mallette retrouvée serait un canular|url = http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/la-mallette-retrouvee-serait-un-canular-15-08-2003-2004314674.php|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2006, bones – a [[femur]] and a [[tibia]] – belonging to Godard were found on the seabed of [[Hurd's Deep]], 70 kilometres (43.5 miles) north of Roscoff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The French Navy minehunter ''L'Aigle'' ('The Eagle') was despatched to the area to try to find a trace of the sailing boat, without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Info direct|url = http://www.marine-marchande.com/info-en-direct-1063.htm|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}{{dead link|date=April 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmation of Godard's death brought about an end to much public interest in the case, but the mystery of the disappearance of his wife – whose body has never been found – and the deaths of Godard and Camille, as well as the very likely death of Marius, remains unsolved: it is either a family drama followed by a covered-up suicide, or an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = L'affaire Godard rebondit|url = http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/l-affaire-godard-rebondit_461907.html|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the court file was not immediately closed. On 14 December 2008, a plastic insurance card belonging to Godard was found in perfect condition on the beach at Chapelle, which caused investigators to renew their efforts in the case.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In February 2018, a child's skull was found at a beach in [[Plérin]], sparking speculation that it might be the skull of Marius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lamanchelibre.fr/actualite-464125-normandie-la-decouverte-d-un-crane-d-enfant-fait-rejaillir-le-spectre-de-l-affaire-godard|title=Normandie : la découverte d'un crâne d'enfant fait rejaillir le spectre de l'affaire Godard|work=lamanchelibre.fr|access-date=2018-07-04|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investigations and witnesses ===
In the autumn and winter of 1999, following the discovery of significant traces of Marie-France Godard's blood at the family home in Juvigny, large-scale searches were carried out in the region to find her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fouilles autour de la maison du Dr Godard.|url = http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101300591-fouilles-autour-de-la-maison-du-dr-godard|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These searches were suspended without success in mid-January 2000.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They were resumed on 27 January 2007, a month after Godard's death was announced. Following a tip-off in an anonymous letter, investigators searched the storeroom of a cemetery in [[Lingèvres]], less than 5 kilometres (3 miles) from the Godard home. There, they found bones, which the letter claimed belonged to Marie-France Godard. However, analysis revealed this was not true. A [[Radiesthesia|radiesthesist]] from Normandy claimed to be the author of the anonymous letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Affaire Godard : Les os ne sont pas ceux de l'épouse Godard - Société - MYTF1News|url = http://lci.tf1.fr/france/faits-divers/2007-02/sont-ceux-epouse-godard-4863844.html|website = MYTF1NEWS|accessdate = 2015-10-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233807/http://lci.tf1.fr/france/faits-divers/2007-02/sont-ceux-epouse-godard-4863844.html|archivedate = 2016-03-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 1999, a hotel owner on the [[Isle of Man]] claimed that Godard and his children had stayed in his hotel between 7 and 14 September. This was the first of a series of witness statements placing Godard and his children at various locations all around the world. Sightings of him were also reported on the [[Isle of Lewis]] in [[Scotland]], in [[South Africa]], in [[Miami]] and on [[Crete]]. In early May 2000, investigations carried out in [[Madeira]], where Godard had opened a bank account, yielded no results. There had been no movements of funds since his disappearance.

In 2011, Eric Lemasson published a book, ''L'Assassinat du docteur Godard'' (''The Murder of Dr Godard''), which shed light on a new theory relating to there being financial reasons behind the disappearance, even including links to the [[Mafia]]. The book highlighted several murders of people affiliated to the French [[trade union]], the ''Confédération de défense des commerçants et artisans'' (Confederation for the Defence of Salesmen and Craftspeople), in which Godard played a very active role as a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Issue 45|last = |first = |date = December 2011|journal = Newsletter of Confédération de défense des commerçants et artisans|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case closed ===
On 14 September 2012, the examining magistrate ordered the case to be closed.

In his summation, Alexandre de Bousschère, the Saint-Malo Public Prosecutor, stated: "the only hypothesis we can exclude is that the family's disappearance was a simple sailing accident" and "even if it is the most likely line of investigation, we cannot formally confirm that Yves Godard murdered his family: the case is closed with no charges brought."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Affaire Godard: ordonnance de non-lieu rendue après 13 ans d'enquête|url = http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/09/15/affaire-godard-ordonnance-de-non-lieu-rendue-apres-13-ans-d-enquete_1760750_3224.html|newspaper = Le Monde.fr|access-date = 2015-10-04|issn = 1950-6244|language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Françoise Chandernagor]] wrote a four-episode series to appear in ''Le Figaro littéraire'', the literary supplement of the ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper.

'''Harris Boyle''' (1953 &amp;ndash; 31 July 1975) was an [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) soldier and a high-ranking member of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), a [[Ulster loyalism|Northern Irish loyalist]] paramilitary organisation. Boyle was implicated in the 1974 [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]],&lt;ref&gt;Jack Harper.

The popular Irish cabaret band was driving home to Dublin after a performance in [[Banbridge]]. He was one of the two gunmen killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus exploded prematurely.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Peter Taylor (1999). ''Loyalists''. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. pp. 124, 147-49; {{ISBN|0-7475-4519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes referred to as '''Horace Boyle'''.&lt;ref name="Godandthegun"/&gt;

==Ulster Volunteer Force and UDR link==
Boyle was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], and grew up in the working-class Killycomain estate. He was raised as a [[Protestant]]&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;[http://cain.ulster.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1975.html Cain: Sutton Index of Deaths - 1975], cain.ulster.ac.uk; accessed 2 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and attended Edenderry Primary School. On an unknown date, Boyle joined both the Portadown company of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment|UDR]] (as a part-time member) and the Portadown unit of the [[UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade]]. He held the rank of [[major]] in the latter organisation, which at the time was commanded by [[Billy Hanna]]. Despite a vetting process, joint membership of the UDR and loyalist paramilitary organisations was common. Paramilitaries joined to obtain weapons, training and intelligence.&lt;ref name="cain.ulst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/publicrecords/1973/subversion_in_the_udr.htm|title=CAIN: Public Records: Subversion in the UDR|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vetting procedures were carried out jointly by the military [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]'s Special Branch and if no intelligence was found to suggest unsuitability individuals were passed for recruitment and would remain as soldiers until the commanding officer was provided with intelligence enabling him to remove soldiers with paramilitary links or sympathies.&lt;ref name="cain.ulst"/&gt;

''The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre'' documentary about the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]] which was broadcast by Yorkshire Television in 1993 maintained that Boyle was second-in-command to Hanna.&lt;ref&gt;''The Barron Report'' (2003): Appendices, "The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre" transcript, p. 15; retrieved 16 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade formed part of what later became known as the [[Glenanne gang]]. This was a violent loyalist group which operated out of a farm owned by [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] reservist James Mitchell, and comprised rogue elements of Northern Ireland's security forces as well as the UVF and to a lesser extent, the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA). This loose alliance carried out sectarian attacks and killings of Catholics, often, although not always, those seen as upwardly mobile, during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/sarmagh/sarmagh.html "Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid Ulster Area in the mid-1970s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426121606/http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/sarmagh/sarmagh.html |date=26 April 2011 }}, patfinucanecentre.org; accessed 2 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Miami Showband killings}}

Boyle was one of the Mid-Ulster Brigade UVF gang that carried out the attack against the popular Irish cabaret band, the Miami Showband on 31 July 1975. Author [[Martin Dillon]] suggested in his book ''God and the Gun: the Church and Irish Terrorism'' that Boyle was one of the leaders of the unit.&lt;ref name="Godandthegun"/&gt; At about 2.30 a.m., as the band was returning home to Dublin from a performance at the Castle Ballroom in [[Banbridge]], their minibus (driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy) was stopped on the [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A-1 road]] at Buskhill, seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) north of Newry, at a bogus military [[Security checkpoint|checkpoint]] by UVF gunmen dressed in British Army uniforms. At least four of the other men, like Boyle, were serving members of the UDR. The band members were lined up with their hands on their heads facing a ditch and asked to give their names and addresses.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Saxophonist Des McAlea, who survived the attack, later testified that Boyle had become angry at some of the other gunmen who had joked with the band members about the success of their performance that night.&lt;ref name="Godandthegun"&gt;Martin Dillon. (18 March 1999), ''God and the Gun: The Church and Irish Terrorism''. pp. 58-60, Routledge; 1st edition; {{ISBN|0415923638}}/{{ISBN|978-0415923637}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Boyle and [[Wesley Somerville]]&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; went to the rear of the minibus and placed a ten-pound [[time bomb]] on board. This was meant to explode as the band drove through either [[Newry]].&lt;ref&gt;Liam Collins. "The Miami band lined up against the van. Then they were coldly murdered". ''The Independent'', 17 July 2005; retrieved 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; or after they reached the [[Republic of Ireland]], killing all five band members on board.&lt;ref name="DirtyWar"/&gt; According to ''The Dirty War'' by [[Martin Dillon]], the plan behind the UVF bombing was to portray the band members as [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] smuggling explosives for the [[Provisional IRA]].&lt;ref name="DirtyWar"&gt;Martin Dillon (1991), ''The Dirty War''. Routledge (re-released 17 March 1999), pp. 198-99, 214, 217; {{ISBN|041592281X}}/{{ISBN|978-0415922814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after Boyle and Somerville closed the rear door, clumsy soldering on the clock which was used as a timer came apart and the bomb detonated prematurely. The bus was blown in half. The two loyalists, both in the vicinity of the explosion, took the full force of the blast and were killed instantly with their bodies hurled in opposite directions. Boyle's body landed in the road, fifty yards away from the front half of the destroyed vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;RTÉ One Programme: Miami Showband; retrieved 13 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was ripped in two and badly burned. Both men were decapitated and dismembered; one limbless torso was completely charred.&lt;ref&gt;''The Miami Showband Massacre - Shared Troubles'', by Stephen Travers; retrieved 7 April 2011.&lt;!-- ISBN, pages needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Survivor Stephen Travers later saw a photograph of one of the dead men and described it: "He didn't have any head, just a black torso, no head, legs or arms."&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; A severed arm with the tattoo "UVF Portadown" was later found a hundred yards from the scene.&lt;ref name="Godandthegun"/&gt; According to Michael Browne of the ''Irish Mail on Sunday'', the arm belonged to Wesley Somerville.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Mail on Sunday'' by Michael Browne, pg.   34, 3 December 2006; retrieved 14 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was 22 years old at the time of his death. He was unmarried and worked as a telephone wireman.&lt;ref name="McKittrick"&gt;David McKittrick. (2001) ''Lost Lives''. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, pp. 557, 563{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining UVF gunmen opened fire on the Miami Showband members who had been blown down into the field below the level of the road. Three of the band members were killed: trumpeter Brian McCoy, guitarist Tony Geraghty, and lead singer Fran O'Toole. Saxophone player Des McAlea and bassist Stephen Travers were both wounded, the latter having been shot with [[dum-dum bullet]]s. Several days before the Showband attack, Mid-Ulster UVF leader Billy Hanna was shot dead, allegedly by [[Robin Jackson]], who assumed command of the brigade. According to authors and journalists Martin Dillon, Paul Larkin and Joe Tiernan, Boyle had accompanied Jackson when the latter shot Hanna outside his home in [[Lurgan]].&lt;ref name="triggermen"&gt;Martin Dillon, ''The Trigger Men'', Mainstream Publishing (new edition 12 August 2004), {{ISBN|1840189029}}/{{ISBN|978-1840189025}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

An international panel of inquiry (headed by Professor Douglass Cassel, formerly of [[Northwestern University School of Law]]), commissioned by the [[Pat Finucane Centre]] to investigate allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces, concluded there was credible evidence that Jackson was the principal perpetrator of the Miami Showband killings. Although questioned afterwards by the RUC, he never faced charges.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cassel Report'' (2006), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Two serving UDR soldiers and one former UDR soldier: Lance-Corporal Thomas Crozier, Sergeant James McDowell, and John James Somerville (brother of Wesley) were given life sentences for the killings. At the time the Miami Showband attack occurred, the UVF was not an illegal organisation, the ban against them having been lifted in April 1974, by [[Merlyn Rees]], [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; The UVF would be proscribed by the British Government again in October 1975.

==Aftermath==
Within 12 hours of the attack, the UVF issued the following statement giving an account of the event:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA [[Forkhill]] boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.&lt;ref name="DirtyWar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/docs/kaystavern0706.pdf Interim Report on the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern, Dundalk (page 157)], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 2 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would appear that the UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organization transferring weapons the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyle and Somerville were given UVF paramilitary funerals, complete with gun volleys. Eight women dressed in black walked in front of the cortege.&lt;ref name="McKittrick"/&gt; The service was conducted by [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian]] minister [[William McCrea (politician)|William McCrea]], a [[Democratic Unionist]] (DUP) politician. The UVF journal ''Combat'' published sympathy letters from both the "A" Company of the [[9th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment]]&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; and the [[Protestant Action Force]], a cover name used by the UVF.&lt;ref name="InterimReport"&gt;Interim Report on the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern, Dundalk, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the Miami Showband attack, a popular Portadown disc jockey Norman "Mooch" Kerr (aged 28) was shot dead by an IRA gunman as he was packing up his equipment after a show he had put on at the Camrick Bar in [[Armagh]]. Although not a member of any loyalist paramilitary organisation, he had been a friend of Boyle and the two were often seen together.&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portadowntimes"&gt;[http://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/news/local/special_branch_agent_colluded_in_miami_killings_1_3341885 "Special Branch agent colluded in Miami killings"], ''Portadown Times'', 21 December 2011; retrieved 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle had occasionally helped Kerr run his mobile disco.&lt;ref name="murray141"&gt;Murray, Raymond (1990). ''The SAS in Ireland''. Ireland: Mercier Press. p. 141{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA claimed it killed Kerr because he was an associate of Robert Nairac.&lt;ref name="McKittrick"/&gt;

According to [[Martin Dillon]], Boyle and Wesley Somerville served as role models for [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF) leader [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright]], and it was their violent deaths which motivated him to join the UVF in 1975.&lt;ref name="Godandthegun"/&gt; Wright took over the Mid-Ulster UVF Brigade from Robin Jackson in the early 1990s before going on to form the LVF. The RTÉ programme ''[[Today Tonight (Ireland)|Today Tonight]]'' aired a 1987 documentary in which it was claimed that former UVF associates of Boyle revealed to the programme that  Nairac detonated the bomb deliberately at Buskhill in order to eliminate Boyle, with whom he had carried out the Green assassination. ''Sunday Tribune'' journalist Emily O'Reilly noted that none of the three men convicted of the Miami Showband killings ever implicated Nairac in the attack or accused him of causing Boyle's death.&lt;ref&gt;"The MI5 Scandal: Does the Evidence Stand Up?" by Emily O'Reilly, ''The Sunday Tribune'', 22 March 1987, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Northern Irish murals|mural]] and memorial plaque dedicated to Boyle in Portadown's [[Killycomain]] housing estate, where he had grown up.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mural Directory by Jonathan McCormick&lt;/ref&gt; About 100 people, 16 loyalist bands and a UVF military guard of honour were present at the mural's unveiling on 30 July 2005, following a parade through the estate. The plaque describes Boyle as having been "killed in action".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''Heechee''' are a fictional [[Aliens in fiction|alien]] race from the [[science fiction]] works of [[Frederik Pohl]]. The Heechee are portrayed as an exceedingly advanced star-traveling race that explored the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] including Earth's solar system hundreds of millennia ago and disappeared before the evolution of genus ''[[Homo]]''.

==Series==

Pohl introduced the Heechee in a 1972 novella, "[[The Merchants of Venus]]" 
(sometimes called "The Merchants of Venus Underground"). In 1990, it was packaged with nine original short stories as ''The Gateway Trip'' ([[Del Rey Books]]),  a book of about 240 pages that is the only collection in the Heechee series.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

Five novels published from 1977 to 2004 also feature the Heechee.
* ''[[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]]'' (St. Martins, 1977)
* ''[[Beyond the Blue Event Horizon]]'' (Del Rey, 1980)
* ''[[Heechee Rendezvous]]'' (Del Rey, 1984)
* ''[[The Annals of the Heechee]]'' (Del Rey, 1987)
* ''[[The Boy Who Would Live Forever |The Boy Who Would Live Forever: A Novel of Gateway]]'' ([[Tor Books]], 2004)

Collectively the Heechee stories have been considered a series called "The Heechee Saga"&lt;ref name=WWE/&gt; or Heechee Saga or simply Heechee.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; A German-language edition of the first three novels was published 20 years later as "The Gateway Trilogy": ''Die Gateway-Trilogie'' (Munich: Heyne Verlag, 2004).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; Book 4 was sometimes promoted as "the ultimate book in the renowned Heechee Saga".&lt;ref name=WWE/&gt; Book 6, the fifth novel, incorporated three previously published stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb contents|63897|The Boy Who Would Live Forever ''(book)|''first edition}}.

The first novel was serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' beginning November 1976, illustrated by Vincent DiFate. The third was serialized in ''Amazing Science Fiction'' from January 1984, illustrated by Jack Gaughan.

The new stories packaged with "The Merchants of Venus" as ''The Gateway Trip: Tales and Vignettes'' were all published in the first three 1990 issues of ''[[Aboriginal Science Fiction]]''; both the serial and the late 1990 book were illustrated by Frank Kelly Freas.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

==Synopsis==

==="The Merchants of Venus"===

The original Heechee novella was published in the July–August 1972 issue of ''[[Worlds of If]]''&lt;ref name=isfdb-if/&gt; – or ''If'', a magazine Pohl had edited from 1961 to 1969 – and almost simultaneously in ''The Gold at the Starbow's End'' (Ballantine Books, 1972), a collection of short fiction by Pohl. In 1990 it was included in an all-Heechee collection, ''The Gateway Trip: Tales and vignettes of the Heechee'', comprising the novella and nine new short stories. The 1972 magazine story was illustrated by [[Jack Gaughan]]&lt;ref name=isfdb-if/&gt; and the 1990 collection by [[Frank Kelly Freas]].&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;{{efn|name=isfdb-more}}

The Heechee in fact{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} originated as a plot device enabling Pohl to give a plausible reason for humans to make the effort of colonizing the inhospitable planet that space probes have proven [[Venus]] to be. In "The Merchants of Venus", the Heechee (a name given by humans since nobody knows what they called themselves) are nowhere to be found, and humans know of them only from their artifacts. The first evidence came with the discovery of tunnels constructed under the Venusian surface, each tunnel distinguished by the mysterious light-emitting [[cobalt blue]] metal covering the interior sections.

The tunnels facilitate colonization, since they can be adapted to human use at a fraction of what it would cost to dig them from scratch, and they and the other artifacts attract scientists who want to study them; then adventurers and prospectors who hope to make money by discovering more artifacts; and finally tourists rich enough to travel to Venus and see all this. By the next parts of the series, enough people have come to Venus to make it a sovereign state and a major power.

In the main part of the series, the frontier has moved away from Venus after explorers discovered an asteroid orbiting [[perpendicular]] to the [[ecliptic|ecliptic plane]], filled with cobalt blue tunnels, and hundreds of small Heechee spaceships. The asteroid, named ''Gateway'' by the discoverers, is occupied by the powerful nations of the world, who subsequently form the Gateway Corporation to administer the object.

By happenstance, one of the asteroid explorers enters a ship and hits a button, activating the vehicle and sending him on a thirty-day journey to another solar system. Upon his return, the Gateway Corporation decides to allow explorers (called Prospectors) to take trips on the mostly still-functioning ships. Prospectors who find valuable materials or make discoveries are rewarded with substantial bonuses. Ships on the asteroids come in three sizes and are defined as a "one", "three", or "five" based upon the number of passengers that they can (for the most part uncomfortably) carry. Not every vehicle returns and there are other great hazards to the explorers.

===''Gateway''===
The novel ''Gateway'' was serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' beginning November 1976, with illustrations by [[Vincent DiFate]], and was published as a book by [[St. Martin's Press]] in April 1977.&lt;ref name=isfdb-gateway/&gt; It won four major awards as the year's best English-language speculative fiction or science fiction novel.&lt;ref name=isfdb-gateway/&gt;{{efn|ISFDB lists the annual [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]], Hugo Award, and  Nebula Award—sometimes called the "triple crown", selected by a respected panel, by world fans, and by American writers respectively. It also lists the annual Locus Award for Best Novel, 8th place in the 1987 all-time poll of Locus readers (All-Time Best SF Novel), and 11th place in the comparable 1998 poll (All-Time Best SF Novel before 1990).}} Translations into French, German, Dutch, and Italian were all published during 1978 and 1979.&lt;ref name=isfdb-gateway/&gt;{{efn|ISFDB catalogs editions published in six foreign languages: French and German, 1978; Dutch and Italian, 1979; Portuguese, 1986; Hungarian, 1991.}}

The ''Gateway'' novel focuses on the exploits of one of those explorers, Robinette Broadhead. Broadhead hits the jackpot by becoming the first person to return from a [[black hole]]'s [[event horizon]]. In the sequel, Broadhead uses the money to fund further discoveries involving Heechee technology, locating a Heechee food factory that is capable of turning raw [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] ([[CHON]]) from comets into edible food for an overpopulated Earth.

The Heechee do not appear until book three in the series where the reason for their absence is explained. Some 500,000 years earlier, the Heechee were active in exploring the galaxy, including an [[Australopithecine]]-inhabited Earth (where a sampling of the creatures were extracted and left to propagate to modern time on a Heechee station). The Heechee found out that there was a race of pure energy called simply The Foe (or alternatively called either ''The Assassins'' or ''The Kugel'') wiping out civilizations on any planet where they emerged. The inherently cautious Heechee retreated to the interior of the black hole in the [[Galactic Core]] hoping to avoid being destroyed. Due to [[time dilation]], only a few hundred years have passed for the Heechee in the interior of the black hole since they left the normal universe. While in hiding, Heechee scout ships are periodically sent outside the black hole to check on developments through the universe in general and the emerging Earth in particular.

When the latest Heechee crew exits the black hole, they are shocked to discover that humans are flying Heechee spaceships to all parts of the galaxy—and one of those places happens to be the ''[[Kugelblitz (astrophysics)|Kugelblitz]]'' (a [[Black holes in fiction|black hole]] made of energy and not matter), where The Foe was concentrated. The Heechee expected humans to discover the ships, but the cautious race believed Earth people would study and unlock the ships' secrets over a period of hundreds of years—and not simply take the equipment out for random rides in the dangerous galaxy.

When the Heechee finally arrive in force, it is decided that the human intrusion cannot be reversed and The Foe must be confronted.

The Heechee have collected evidence that The Foe have been adding matter into the universe. The Foe intend to tilt the balance and allow the [[Big Bang]] to be reversed and the universe to collapse into a [[Big Crunch]] billions of years into the future. The Foe intend that once the universe rebounds into a second big bang, it will do so in the form of pure energy, removing the atomic matter that The Foe regard as so much clutter. A [[détente]] is created between Broadhead and The Foe, allowing the aliens to continue their project and humans and Heechee growing to accept that they too will eventually progress toward bodiless minds.

==Physical and cultural attributes==

The Heechee's appearance is described as smaller than humans, bow-legged with skeletal frames, and possessed of dark, plastic-smooth skin with patches and curlicues of bright gold and scarlet. Each Heechee carries a [[microwave]] emitter in a storage pod between his or her legs. The pod is a [[trapezohedron]] shaped device and is also used for carrying equipment. The pods also explain why the seats on the ship have V-shaped indentations to accommodate the devices. The Heechee's home planet evolved near a naturally occurring microwave source, making the background radiation a necessary requirement for an ambient environment; the extended absence of the radiation will cause illness and death.

Heechee relationships do not generally feature couple cohabitation for lengthy periods as with human marriages. A burrowing species, they tend to display more solitary conduct than humans. A Heechee bed is a cocoon, stuffed with soft bits of fabric. Heechees only breed when a female is in season.

Heechee are omnivorous and use a fibrous plant to clean their teeth. There are two Heechee languages: the language of Do and the language of Feel, with communications with humans restricted to the former.

Unlike humans, the Heechee did not develop [[artificial intelligence]]. Instead, they relied upon technology to pour the brains of departed Heechee into data storage, giving them a limited immortality. These "stored minds" operate at remarkably faster speeds than "meat" brains. Those stored operate in their own social strata often separate from their organic counterparts. After centuries of existence, the various Heechee consciousnesses join the "massed minds", essentially dying while memories are distributed among other machine stored intelligences.

==Heechee devices==

In addition to the Food Factory, the Heechee created a number of devices that the Earth people discovered and used, including:
* [[Piezoelectric]] devices (allowing voltage to be generated from placing pressure on crystals).
* "Prayer fans" that appear and unfold like traditional [[Fan (implement)|fans]] but are actually computer-related equipment containing the minds of dead Heechees and, later, dead humans. The fans also are used for data storage.
* [[Faster-than-light]] [[starship|spaceship]]s that act by nullifying the [[mass]] of the ship and avoiding the implication of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|Relativity Theory]] that states that an object becomes more massive as it approaches the speed of light.
* A Disruptor of Order in Aligned Systems is the device that allows Heechee to unseal the [[Schwarzschild radius|Schwarzschild]] barrier in black holes and allow ships to traverse the boundaries (referred to jokingly by humans as a "can opener").
* The "Dream Couch" or, more properly, a telepathic psychokinetic transceiver, is capable of receiving and transmitting thoughts across long distances. Heechees focus their law enforcement efforts on catching criminals while they are having perverse thoughts. In the novels, terrorists are depicted as putting insane people in Dream Couches and broadcast their thoughts into populated areas, causing widespread damage and destruction. Before learning of the Dream Couch being the cause, this was known on Earth as the "130-day fever", a period of planet-wide temporary insanity occurring roughly every one hundred and thirty days.

Beside subsequent editions&lt;!--reprints?--&gt; of ''The Gold at Starbow's End'' and a 21st-century collection of Pohl stories, the Internet Speculative Fiction Database shows that "The Merchants of Venus" also appeared in at least three English-language anthologies (1973, 1977, and 1994). 
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;
ISFDB catalogs no interior illustrations for any but the original and ''The Gateway Trip''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5234">'''Helen Elna Hokinson''' (June 29, 1893&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; November 1, 1949) was an American [[cartoonist]] and a staff cartoonist for ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Over a 20-year span, she contributed 68 covers and more than 1,800 cartoons to ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="CooperHewitt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibbons|first1=Carey|title=A Hokinson Woman|url=https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2018/04/10/hokinson/|website=Object of the Day|publisher=Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum|accessdate=April 10, 2018|date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
She was born in [[Mendota, Illinois]], the daughter of Adolph Hokinson, a farm machinery salesman, and Mary Hokinson, the daughter of Phineas Wilcox, the "Carpenter Orator". She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts (now known as the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]), and worked as a freelance fashion illustrator in [[Chicago]] for department stores such as [[Marshall Fields]].

In 1920, Hokinson moved to [[New York City]] to work as a fashion illustrator and study at the School of Fine and Applied Arts (now [[Parsons School of Design]]).&lt;ref name="CooperHewitt"/&gt; Encouraged by an instructor she began submitting comic drawings to magazines, and became one of the first cartoonists to be published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', appearing in the magazine for the first time in the July 4, 1925 issue.&lt;ref name="CooperHewitt"/&gt; She specialized in wealthy, plump, and ditsy society women and their foibles, referring to them as 'My Best Girls', those [[dowager]] denizens of woman's clubs, beauty parlors, art galleries, summer resorts and [[Lane Bryant]]; they were also popularly known as “Hokinson Women”.&lt;ref name="CooperHewitt"/&gt; According to [[James Thurber]] and [[Brendan Gill]], Hokinson relied on the magazine's staff writers to provide captions for her cartoons, a common practice at ''The New Yorker'' in the [[Harold Ross]] era, until entering into a professional partnership with James Reid Parker in 1931.&lt;ref name="Golemba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Golemba|first=Beverly E.|title=Lesser-Known Women: A Biographical Dictionary|year=1992|publisher=Rienner|location=Boulder u.a.|isbn=978-1-55587-301-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokinson and Parker also provided a monthly cartoon, "The Dear Man," for the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' as well as occasional cartoons for advertising campaigns and other magazines.

Hokinson died in the [[Eastern Airlines Flight 537]] mid-air collision at [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington National Airport]] on November 1, 1949, en route to an appearance at the opening of a Community Chest Drive in DC.&lt;ref name="AP1949"&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=November 2, 1949 |title=Congressman, N.Y.

'''Hermann Oelrichs''' (June 8, 1850 – September 1, 1906),&lt;ref name="HOObit1906"/&gt; was an [[United States|American]] businessman, multimillionaire, and agent of [[Hapag-Lloyd|Norddeutsche Lloyd]] shipping. 

==Early life==
Oelrichs was born on June 8, 1850 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  He was the son of German born Henry Ferdinand Oelrichs (1810–1875), a senior partner in the firm of Oelrichs &amp; Lurman, and Julia Matilda ([[née]] May) Oelrichs (1819–1879), who was born in [[Washington, DC]].  His siblings included [[Charles May Oelrichs]] and Henry Oelrichs.&lt;ref name="HOObit1906"/&gt;

Oelrichs was the grandson of Gesche Catharina (née Holler) Oelrichs and Johann Gerhard Oelrichs, a [[German people|German]] merchant in [[Bremen]].  The Oelrichs came to America from Bremen around 1830.&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"/&gt;  His grandfather later married a daughter of statesman [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]].  His maternal grandparents were Julia Matilda (née Slacum) May and Frederick May, who was a member of the May family, prominent in Virginia and Maryland during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"&gt;{{cite news |title=C.

His firm, Oelrichs &amp; Co.,&lt;ref name="HOObit1906"/&gt; became the U.S. agent of the [[Hapag-Lloyd|Norddeutsche Lloyd]] ("North German") shipping company.&lt;ref name="Bone2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bone |first1=James |title=The Curse of Beauty: The Scandalous &amp; Tragic Life of Audrey Munson, America's First Supermodel |date=2016 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=9781942872030 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfI1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oelrichs was also a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and active in [[New York City]] politics, even declining to run for [[Mayor of New York City]],&lt;ref name="Laffaye2011"/&gt; before moving to [[San Francisco, California]].

In the 1890s, the Oelrich's purchased ''Rose Cliff'' on [[Bellevue Avenue]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] from the estate of [[George Bancroft]] and his wife commissioned architect [[Stanford White]] to build them a new residence.&lt;ref name="MrsHOObit1926"/&gt;  The resulting [[Rosecliff]] was modeled after the [[Grand Trianon]] at [[Subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and was completed in 1902 with a final cost of $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="Rosecliff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosecliff {{!}} Newport Mansions |url=http://www.newportmansions.org/explore/rosecliff |website=www.newportmansions.org |publisher=[[Preservation Society of Newport]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1889, the almost forty year old Oelrichs met [[Theresa Fair Oelrichs|Theresa Alice Fair]] ("Tessie"), daughter of [[United States Senator]] and [[Comstock Lode]] millionaire [[James Graham Fair]], while playing tennis at the [[Newport Casino]].&lt;ref name="Laffaye2011"/&gt;  They married a year later in 1890.&lt;ref name="1890Wedding"&gt;{{cite news |title=HERMANN OELRICHS WEDS.

'''Homeostasis''' is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1001472383|title=Anatomy and physiology|last=Gordon.|first=Betts, J.|publisher=|others=DeSaix, Peter., Johnson, Eddie., Johnson, Jody E., Korol, Oksana., Kruse, Dean H., Poe, Brandon.|year=|isbn=9781947172043|location=Houston, Texas|pages=9|oclc=1001472383}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic state of equilibrium is the condition of optimal functioning for the organism and includes many variables, such as [[body temperature]] and [[fluid balance]], being kept within certain pre-set limits (homeostatic range). Other variables include the [[pH]] of [[extracellular fluid]], the concentrations of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]] [[ion]]s, as well as that of the [[blood sugar level]], and these need to be regulated despite changes in the environment, diet, or level of activity. Each of these variables is controlled by one or more regulators or homeostatic mechanisms, which together maintain life.

Homeostasis is brought about by a natural resistance to change in the optimal conditions,&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite book|title=A dictionary of biology|last1=Martin|first1=Elizabeth|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920462-5|edition=6th|location=Oxford|pages=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; and equilibrium is maintained by many regulatory mechanisms. All homeostatic control mechanisms have at least three interdependent components for the variable being regulated: a receptor, a control centre, and an effector. The receptor is the sensing component that monitors and responds to changes in the environment, either external or internal. Receptors include [[thermoreceptor]]s, and [[mechanoreceptor]]s. Control centres include the [[respiratory centre]], and the [[renin–angiotensin system]]. An effector is the target acted on, to bring about the change back to the normal state. At the cellular level, receptors include [[nuclear receptor]]s that bring about changes in [[gene expression]] through up-regulation or down-regulation, and act in [[negative feedback]] mechanisms. An example of this is in the control of [[bile acid]]s in the [[liver]].&lt;ref name="Kalaany"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalaany|first1=NY|last2=Mangelsdorf|first2=DJ|title=LXRS and FXR: the yin and yang of cholesterol and fat metabolism.|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=2006|volume=68|pages=159–91|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.68.033104.152158|pmid=16460270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some centers, such as the [[renin–angiotensin system]], control more than one variable. When the receptor senses a stimulus, it reacts by sending action potentials to a control center. The control center sets the maintenance range—the acceptable upper and lower limits—for the particular variable, such as temperature. The control center responds to the signal by determining an appropriate response and sending signals to an [[Effector cell|effector]], which can be one or more muscles, an organ, or a gland. When the signal is received and acted on, negative feedback is provided to the receptor that stops the need for further signaling.&lt;ref name=Marieb/&gt;

The concept of the regulation of the internal environment was described by French physiologist [[Claude Bernard]] in 1865, and the word ''homeostasis'' was coined by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=wotb&gt;{{cite book |first=W.B. |last=Cannon |authorlink=Walter Bradford Cannon |title=The Wisdom of the Body |pages=177–201 |year=1932 |publisher=W.

==Etymology==
The word ''homeostasis'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|oʊ|m|i|oʊ-|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|s|ᵻ|s}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Homeostasis}}}}{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Homeostasis}}}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''homeo-'' and ''-stasis'', [[New Latin]] from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὅμοιος ''homoios'', "similar" and στάσις ''stasis'', "standing still", yielding the idea of "staying the same".

==Overview==

The [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]] of all organisms can only take place in very specific physical and chemical environments. The conditions vary with each organism, and with whether the chemical processes take place inside the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or in the [[interstitial fluid]] bathing the cells. The best known homeostatic mechanisms in humans and other mammals are regulators that keep the composition of the [[extracellular fluid]] (or the "internal environment") constant, especially with regard to the [[Thermoregulation|temperature]], [[pH]], [[osmolality]], and the concentrations of [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[glucose]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[oxygen]]. However, a great many other homeostatic mechanisms, encompassing many aspects of [[human physiology]], control other entities in the body. Where the levels of variables are higher or lower than those needed, they are often prefixed with ''hyper-'' and ''hypo-'', respectively such as [[hyperthermia]] and [[hypothermia]] and [[hypertension]] and [[hypotension]].

[[Image:Body Temp Variation.png|thumb|250px|right|Circadian variation in body temperature, ranging from about {{val|37.5|u=°C}} from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and falling to about {{val|36.4|u=°C}} from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.]]
If an entity is homeostatically controlled it does not imply that its value is necessarily absolutely steady in health. [[Thermoregulation|Core body temperature]] is, for instance, regulated by a homeostatic mechanism with temperature sensors in, amongst others, the [[hypothalamus]] of the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=tortora2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tortora |first1=Gerard J. | last2=Anagnostakos |first2=Nicholas P. | title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology | edition= Fifth |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers |publication-date=1987 |pages=315–316, 475, 657–658 |isbn=0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]] of the regulator is regularly reset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Khan Academy |title=Homeostasis |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-human-body-systems/hs-body-structure-and-homeostasis/a/homeostasis |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, core body temperature in humans [[Thermoregulation#Variations due to circadian rhythms|varies during the course of the day]] (i.e. has a [[circadian rhythm]]), with the lowest temperatures occurring at night, and the highest in the afternoons.

The medulla oblongata then distributes messages along [[Motor neuron|motor or efferent nerves]] belonging to the [[autonomic nervous system]] to a wide variety of effector organs, whose activity is consequently changed to reverse the error in the blood pressure. One of the effector organs is the heart whose rate is stimulated to rise ([[tachycardia]]) when the arterial blood pressure falls, or to slow down ([[bradycardia]]) when the pressure rises above set point.&lt;ref name=tortora2 /&gt; Thus the heart rate (for which there is no sensor in the body) is not homeostatically controlled, but is one of effector responses to errors in the arterial blood pressure. Another example is the rate of [[sweating]]. This is one of the effectors in the homeostatic control of body temperature, and therefore highly variable in rough proportion to the heat load that threatens to destabilize the body's core temperature, for which there is a sensor in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain.

When core temperature falls, the blood supply to the skin is reduced by intense [[vasoconstriction]].&lt;ref name=tortora2 /&gt; The blood flow to the limbs (which have a large surface area) is similarly reduced, and returned to the trunk via the deep veins which lie alongside the arteries (forming [[vena comitans|venae comitantes]]).&lt;ref name=grays /&gt;&lt;ref name= biology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilroy |first1=Anne M. |last2=MacPherson |first2=Brian R. |last3=Ross|first3=Lawrence M. |title=Atlas of Anatomy| pages=318, 349  |location=Stuttgart|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|publication-date=2008|isbn= 978-1-60406-062-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acts as a [[Countercurrent exchange|counter-current exchange system]] which short-circuits the warmth from the arterial blood directly into the venous blood returning into the trunk, causing minimal heat loss from the extremities in cold weather.&lt;ref name=grays /&gt;&lt;ref name= biology /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7233149"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Schmidt-Nielsen K |title = Countercurrent systems in animals |journal = Scientific American |volume = 244 |issue = 5 |pages = 118–28 |year = 1981 |pmid = 7233149 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0581-118|bibcode = 1981SciAm.244e.118S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subcutaneous limb veins are tightly constricted,&lt;ref name=tortora2 /&gt; not only reducing heat loss from this source, but also forcing the venous blood into the counter-current system in the depths of the limbs.

The metabolic rate is increased, initially by non-shivering [[thermogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stuart |first1=I.R. |title=Human physiology.| page=667|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition= Twelfth |publication-date=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Shivering|shivering thermogenesis]] if the earlier reactions are insufficient to correct the [[hypothermia]].

When core temperature rises are detected by [[thermoreceptor]]s, the [[sweat gland]]s in the skin are stimulated via [[cholinergic]] [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic nerves]] to secrete [[Sweat gland#Sweat|sweat]] onto the skin, which, when it evaporates, cools the skin and the blood flowing through it. Panting is an alternative effector in many vertebrates, which cools the body also by the evaporation of water, but this time from the [[mucous membranes]] of the throat and mouth.

The liver is inhibited from producing [[glucose]], taking it up instead, and converting it to [[glycogen]] and [[triglycerides]]. The glycogen is stored in the liver, but the triglycerides are secreted into the blood as [[very low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) particles which are taken up by [[adipose tissue]], there to be stored as fats. The fat cells take up glucose through special glucose transporters ([[GLUT4]]), whose numbers in the cell wall are increased as a direct effect of insulin acting on these cells. The glucose that enters the fat cells in this manner is converted into triglycerides (via the same metabolic pathways as are used by the liver) and then stored in those fat cells together with the VLDL-derived triglycerides that were made in the liver. Muscle cells also take glucose up through insulin-sensitive GLUT4 glucose channels, and convert it into muscle glycogen.

A  fall in blood glucose, causes insulin secretion to be stopped, and [[glucagon]] to be secreted from the alpha cells into the blood. This inhibits the uptake of glucose from the blood by the liver, fats cells and muscle. Instead the liver is strongly stimulated to manufacture glucose from glycogen (through [[glycogenolysis]]) and from non-carbohydrate sources (such as [[Lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[amino acids]]) using a process known as [[gluconeogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronoff|first=Stephen L.|last2=Berkowitz|first2=Kathy|last3=Shreiner|first3=Barb|last4=Want|first4=Laura|date=2004-07-01|title=Glucose Metabolism and Regulation: Beyond Insulin and Glucagon|url=http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/3/183|journal=Diabetes Spectrum|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=183–190|doi=10.2337/diaspect.17.3.183|issn=1040-9165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glucose thus produced is discharged into the blood correcting the detected error ([[hypoglycemia]]). The glycogen stored in muscles remains in the muscles, and is only broken down, during exercise, to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] and thence to [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] to be fed into the [[citric acid cycle]] or turned into [[lactic acid|lactate]]. It is only the lactate and the waste products of the citric acid cycle that are returned to the blood. The liver can take up only the lactate, and by the process of energy consuming [[gluconeogenesis]] convert it back to glucose.

[[File: 2327 Respiratory Centers of the Brain.jpg |thumb|The respiratory center]]
Changes in the levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and plasma pH are sent to the [[respiratory center]], in the [[brainstem]] where they are regulated.
The [[partial pressure]] of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[arterial blood]] is monitored by the [[peripheral chemoreceptors]] ([[Peripheral nervous system|PNS]]) in the [[common carotid artery|carotid artery]] and [[aortic arch]]. A change in the [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] is detected as altered pH in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] by [[central chemoreceptors]] ([[Central nervous system|CNS]]) in the [[medulla oblongata]] of the [[brainstem]]. Information from these sets of sensors is sent to the respiratory center which activates the effector organs – the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and other [[muscles of respiration]]. An increased level of carbon dioxide in the blood, or a decreased level of oxygen, will result in a deeper breathing pattern and increased [[respiratory rate]] to bring the blood gases back to equilibrium.

Too little carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, too much oxygen in the blood can temporarily halt breathing, a condition known as [[apnea]], which [[freediving|freedivers]] use to prolong the time they can stay underwater.

The [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] is more of a deciding factor in the monitoring of pH.&lt;ref name="Spyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spyer|first1=KM|last2=Gourine|first2=AV|title=Chemosensory pathways in the brainstem controlling cardiorespiratory activity.|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

===Blood oxygen content===
The kidneys measure the oxygen content rather than the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low, oxygen-sensitive cells secrete [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) into the blood.&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|title=Molecular biology of the cell|date=2002|publisher=Garland|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8153-4072-9|pages=1292–1293|edition= 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effector tissue is the [[Bone marrow|red bone marrow]] which produces [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs)(erythrocytes). The increase in RBCs leads to an increased [[hematocrit]] in the blood, and subsequent increase in [[hemoglobin]] that increases the oxygen carrying capacity. This is the mechanism whereby high altitude dwellers have higher hematocrits than sea-level residents, and also why persons with [[pulmonary insufficiency]] or [[right-to-left shunt]]s in the heart (through which venous blood by-passes the lungs and goes directly into the systemic circulation) have similarly high hematocrits.&lt;ref name=tortora&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=444–445|edition=  Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher1996&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisher JW, Koury S, Ducey T, Mendel S |title=Erythropoietin production by interstitial cells of hypoxic monkey kidneys |journal=British Journal of Haematology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=27–32 |year=1996 |pmid=8857934 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1864.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, the amount of oxygen that can be carried, depends on the hemoglobin content. The partial pressure of oxygen may be sufficient for example in [[anemia]], but the hemoglobin content will be insufficient and subsequently as will be the oxygen content. Given enough supply of iron, [[vitamin B12]] and [[folic acid]], EPO can stimulate RBC production, and hemoglobin and oxygen content restored to normal.&lt;ref name=tortora /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17253966&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jelkmann W |title=Erythropoietin after a century of research: younger than ever |journal=European Journal of Haematology |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=183–205 |year=2007 |pmid=17253966 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00818.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arterial blood pressure===
{{Main |Baroreflex |Renin–angiotensin system}}
The brain can regulate blood flow over a range of blood pressure values by [[vasoconstriction]] and [[vasodilation]] of the arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227162001/http://www.orlandoregional.org/pdf%20folder/overview%20adult%20brain%20injury.pdf|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High pressure receptors called [[baroreceptor]]s in the walls of the [[Aorta|aortic arch]] and [[carotid sinus]] (at the beginning of the [[internal carotid artery]]) monitor the arterial [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=4|edition= 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rising pressure is detected when the walls of the arteries stretch due to an increase in [[blood volume]]. This causes [[cardiomyocytes|heart muscle cells]] to secrete the hormone [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] (ANP) into the blood. This acts on the kidneys to inhibit the secretion of renin and aldosterone causing the release of sodium, and accompanying water into the urine, thereby reducing the blood volume.&lt;ref name=tortora7&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |page=430|edition=  Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This information is then conveyed, via [[afferent nerve fiber]]s, to the [[solitary nucleus]] in the [[medulla oblongata]].&lt;ref name="OUP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|pages=299–302|edition= 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here [[motor nerves]] belonging to the [[autonomic nervous system]] are stimulated to influence the activity of chiefly the heart and the smallest diameter arteries, called [[arterioles]]. The arterioles are the main resistance vessels in the [[arterial tree]], and small changes in diameter cause large changes in the resistance to flow through them. When the arterial blood pressure rises the arterioles are stimulated to [[vasodilation|dilate]] making it easier for blood to leave the arteries, thus deflating them, and bringing the blood pressure down, back to normal. At the same time the heart is stimulated via [[cholinergic]] [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic nerves]] to beat more slowly (called [[bradycardia]]), ensuring that the inflow of blood into the arteries is reduced, thus adding to the reduction in pressure, and correction of the original error.

Low pressure in the arteries, causes the opposite reflex of constriction of the arterioles, and a speeding up of the heart rate (called [[tachycardia]]). If the drop in blood pressure is very rapid or excessive, the medulla oblongata stimulates the [[adrenal medulla]], via "preganglionic" [[sympathetic nerves]], to secrete [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) into the blood. This hormone enhances the tachycardia and causes severe [[vasoconstriction]] of the arterioles to all but the essential organ in the body (especially the heart, lungs, and brain). These reactions usually correct the low arterial blood pressure ([[hypotension]]) very effectively.

Calcium in Health and Disease | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor for the first one is situated in the [[parathyroid glands]], where the [[Parathyroid gland#Histology|chief cells]] sense the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level by means of specialized calcium receptors in their membranes. The sensors for the second are the [[parafollicular cells]] in the [[thyroid gland]]. The parathyroid chief cells secrete [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) in response to a fall in the plasma ionized calcium level; the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland secrete [[calcitonin]] in response to a rise in the  plasma ionized calcium level.

The effector organs of the first homeostatic mechanism are the [[bone]]s, the [[kidney]], and, via a hormone released into the blood by the kidney in response to high PTH levels in the blood, the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]. Parathyroid hormone (in high concentrations in the blood) causes [[bone resorption]], releasing calcium into the plasma. This is a very rapid action which can correct a threatening [[hypocalcemia]] within minutes. High PTH concentrations cause the excretion of [[Phosphate|phosphate ions]] via the urine. Since phosphates combine with calcium ions to form insoluble salts, a decrease in the level of phosphates in the blood, releases free calcium ions into the plasma ionized calcium pool. PTH has a second action on the kidneys. It stimulates the manufacture and release, by the kidneys, of [[calcitriol]] into the blood. This [[steroid]] hormone acts on the epithelial cells of the upper small intestine, increasing their capacity to absorb calcium from the gut contents into the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Vitamin D is derived from cholesterol by the ring-splitting action of light.|page=707 |edition=  Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second homeostatic mechanism, with its sensors in the thyroid gland, releases calcitonin into the blood when the blood ionized calcium rises. This hormone acts primarily on bone, causing the rapid removal of calcium from the blood and depositing it, in insoluble form, in the bones.

The two homeostatic mechanisms working through PTH on the one hand, and calcitonin on the other can very rapidly correct any impending error in the plasma ionized calcium level by either removing calcium from the blood and depositing it in the skeleton, or by removing calcium from it. The [[skeleton]] acts as an extremely large calcium store (about 1&amp;nbsp;kg) compared with the plasma calcium store (about 180&amp;nbsp;mg). Longer term regulation occurs through calcium absorption or loss from the gut.

===Sodium concentration===
{{Main |Renin–angiotensin system}} {{Further |Sodium in biology |Tubuloglomerular feedback |Sodium-calcium exchanger}}
The homeostatic mechanism which controls the plasma sodium concentration is rather more complex than most of the other homeostatic mechanisms described on this page.
 
The sensor is situated in the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] of kidneys, which senses the plasma sodium concentration in a surprisingly indirect manner. Instead of measuring it directly in the blood flowing past the [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s, these cells respond to the sodium concentration in the [[nephron|renal tubular fluid]] after it has already undergone a certain amount of modification in the [[proximal convoluted tubule]] and [[loop of Henle]].&lt;ref name=tortora3&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=420–421|edition=  Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells also respond to rate of blood flow through the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which, under normal circumstances, is directly proportional to the [[arterial blood pressure]], making this tissue an ancillary arterial blood pressure sensor.

In response to a lowering of the plasma sodium concentration, or to a fall in the arterial blood pressure, the juxtaglomerular cells release [[renin]] into the blood.&lt;ref name=tortora3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAMA Article Jan 2012|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/280/13/1168.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-146633-9"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL | title = Harrison's principles of internal medicine | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location =New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-07-146633-9 |vauthors=Williams GH, Dluhy RG | chapter = Chapter 336: Disorders of the Adrenal Cortex }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renin is an enzyme which cleaves a [[Peptide#Notes on terminology|decapeptide]] (a short protein chain, 10 amino acids long) from a plasma [[Alpha globulin|α-2-globulin]] called [[angiotensinogen]]. This decapeptide is known as [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin I|angiotensin I]].&lt;ref name=tortora3 /&gt;  It has no known biological activity. However, when the blood circulates through the lungs a pulmonary capillary [[Endothelium|endothelial]] enzyme called [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) cleaves a further two amino acids from angiotensin I to form an octapeptide known as [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin II|angiotensin II]].  Angiotensin II is a hormone which acts on the [[adrenal cortex]], causing the release into the blood of the [[steroid hormone]], [[aldosterone]]. Angiotensin II also acts on the smooth muscle in the walls of the arterioles causing these small diameter vessels to constrict, thereby restricting the outflow of blood from the arterial tree, causing the arterial blood pressure to rise. This, therefore, reinforces the measures described above (under the heading of "Arterial blood pressure"), which defend the arterial blood pressure against changes, especially [[hypotension]].

The angiotensin II-stimulated [[aldosterone]] released from the [[zona glomerulosa]] of the [[adrenal glands]] has an effect on particularly the epithelial cells of the [[distal convoluted tubules]] and [[collecting ducts]] of the kidneys. Here it causes the reabsorption of sodium ions from the [[Nephron|renal tubular fluid]], in exchange for potassium ions which are secreted from the blood plasma into the tubular fluid to exit the body via the urine.&lt;ref name=tortora3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bauer JH, Gauntner WC |title=Effect of potassium chloride on plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone during sodium restriction in normal man |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=286–93 |date=March 1979 |pmid=513492 |doi= 10.1038/ki.1979.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reabsorption of sodium ions from the renal tubular fluid halts further sodium ion losses from the body, and therefore preventing the worsening of [[hyponatremia]]. The hyponatremia can only be ''corrected'' by the consumption of salt in the diet. However, it is not certain whether a "salt hunger" can be initiated by hyponatremia, or by what mechanism this might come about.

When the plasma sodium ion concentration is higher than normal ([[hypernatremia]]), the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus is halted, ceasing the production of angiotensin II, and its consequent aldosterone-release into the blood. The kidneys respond by excreting sodium ions into the urine, thereby normalizing the plasma sodium ion concentration. The low angiotensin II levels in the blood lower the arterial blood pressure as an inevitable concomitant response.

The reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular fluid as a result of high aldosterone levels in the blood does not, of itself, cause renal tubular water to be returned to the blood from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s or [[collecting duct]]s. This is because sodium is reabsorbed in exchange for potassium and therefore causes only a modest change in the [[Osmotic pressure|osmotic gradient]] between the blood and the tubular fluid. Furthermore, the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts is impermeable to water in the absence of [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) in the blood. ADH is part of the control of [[fluid balance]]. Its levels in the blood vary with the [[osmolality]] of the plasma, which is measured in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain. Aldosterone's action on the kidney tubules prevents sodium loss to the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF). So there is no change in the osmolality of the ECF, and therefore no change in the ADH concentration of the plasma. However, low aldosterone levels cause a loss of sodium ions from the ECF, which could potentially cause a change in extracellular osmolality and therefore of ADH levels in the blood.

===Potassium concentration===
{{Main |Potassium#Homeostasis |Potassium in biology}}
High potassium concentrations in the plasma cause [[depolarization]] of the [[zona glomerulosa]] cells' membranes in the outer layer of the [[adrenal cortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid22546854"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu C, Rusin CG, Tan Z, Guagliardo NA, Barrett PQ |title=Zona glomerulosa cells of the mouse adrenal cortex are intrinsic electrical oscillators. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=2046–2053 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22546854 |doi=10.1172/JCI61996 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/61996 |pmc=3966877}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the release of [[aldosterone]] into the blood.

Aldosterone acts primarily on the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[collecting duct]]s of the kidneys, stimulating the excretion of potassium ions into the urine.&lt;ref name=tortora3 /&gt; It does so, however, by activating the [[basolateral]] [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumps]] of the tubular epithelial cells. These sodium/potassium exchangers pump three sodium ions out of the cell, into the interstitial fluid and two potassium ions into the cell from the interstitial fluid. This creates an [[electrochemical gradient#Ion gradients|ionic concentration gradient]] which results in the reabsorption of sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions from the tubular fluid into the blood, and secreting potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions from the blood into the urine (lumen of collecting duct).&lt;ref name="pmid10760062"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|last1=Palmer|first1=LG|last2=Frindt|first2=G|title=Aldosterone and potassium secretion by the cortical collecting duct|journal=Kidney International|volume=57|issue=4|pages=1324–8|pmid=10760062|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.00970.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Linas SL, Peterson LN, Anderson RJ, Aisenbrey GA, Simon FR, Berl T |title=Mechanism of renal potassium conservation in the rat |journal=Kidney International |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=601–11 |date=June 1979 |pmid=222934 |doi= 10.1038/ki.1979.79|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluid balance===
{{Main |Osmoregulation |Thirst}}
The [[body water|total amount of water]] in the body needs to be kept in balance. [[Fluid balance]] involves keeping the fluid volume stabilized, and also keeping the levels of [[electrolyte]]s in the extracellular fluid stable. Fluid balance is maintained by the process of [[osmoregulation]] and by behavior. [[Osmotic pressure]] is detected by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[median preoptic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. Measurement of the plasma [[osmolality]] to give an indication of the water content of the body, relies on the fact that water losses from the body, (through [[Transepidermal water loss|unavoidable water loss through the skin]] which is not entirely waterproof and therefore always slightly moist, [[Breathing#Upper airways|water vapor in the exhaled air]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], [[vomiting]], normal [[feces]] and especially  [[diarrhea]]) are all [[hypotonic]], meaning that they are less salty than the body fluids (compare, for instance, the taste of saliva with that of tears. The latter has almost the same salt content as the extracellular fluid, whereas the former is hypotonic with respect to the plasma. Saliva does not taste salty, whereas tears are decidedly salty). Nearly all normal and abnormal losses of [[body water]] therefore cause the extracellular fluid to become [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]]. Conversely, excessive fluid intake dilutes the extracellular fluid causing the hypothalamus to register [[hypotonic hyponatremia]] conditions.

When the [[hypothalamus]] detects a hypertonic extracellular environment, it causes the secretion of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) called [[vasopressin]] which acts on the effector organ, which in this case is the [[kidney]]. The effect of vasopressin on the kidney tubules is to reabsorb water from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[Collecting duct system|collecting ducts]], thus preventing aggravation of the water loss via the urine. The hypothalamus simultaneously stimulates the nearby [[Thirst|thirst center]] causing an almost irresistible (if the hypertonicity is severe enough) urge to drink water. The cessation of urine flow prevents the [[hypovolemia]] and [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonicity]] from getting worse; the drinking of water corrects the defect.

Hypo-osmolality results in very low plasma ADH levels. This results in the inhibition of water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, causing high volumes of very dilute urine to be excreted, thus getting rid of the excess water in the body.

Urinary water loss, when the body water homeostat is intact, is a ''compensatory'' water loss, ''correcting'' any water excess in the body. However, since the kidneys cannot generate water, the thirst reflex is the all-important second effector mechanism of the body water homeostat, ''correcting'' any water deficit in the body.

===Blood pH===
[[File:2714_Respiratory_Regulation_of_Blood.jpg|border|right|364x364px]]
{{Main|Acid–base homeostasis |Acid-base imbalance}}
The [[pH#Living systems|plasma pH]] can be altered by respiratory changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide; or altered by metabolic changes in the [[carbonic acid]] to [[bicarbonate ion]] ratio. The [[bicarbonate buffer system]] regulates the ratio of carbonic acid  to bicarbonate to be equal to 1:20, at which ratio the blood pH is 7.4 (as explained in the [[Henderson–Hasselbalch equation]]). A change in the plasma pH gives an [[acid–base imbalance]].
In [[acid–base homeostasis]] there are two mechanisms that can help regulate the pH. [[Respiratory compensation]] a mechanism of the [[respiratory center]], adjusts the [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] by changing the rate and depth of breathing, to bring the pH back to normal. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide also determines the concentration of carbonic acid, and the bicarbonate buffer system can also come into play. Renal compensation can help the bicarbonate buffer system.
The sensor for the plasma bicarbonate concentration is not known for certain. It is very probable that the renal tubular cells of the distal convoluted tubules are themselves sensitive to the pH of the plasma.{{citation needed |date=November 2017}} The metabolism of these cells produces carbon dioxide, which is rapidly converted to hydrogen and bicarbonate through the action of [[carbonic anhydrase]].&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; When the ECF pH falls (becoming more acidic) the renal tubular cells excrete hydrogen ions into the tubular fluid to leave the body via urine. Bicarbonate ions are simultaneously secreted into the blood that decreases the carbonic acid, and consequently raises the plasma pH.&lt;ref name=tortora1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=581–582, 675–676|edition=  Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The converse happens when the plasma pH rises above normal: bicarbonate ions are excreted into the urine, and hydrogen ions released into the plasma.

When hydrogen ions are excreted into the urine, and bicarbonate into the blood, the latter combines with the excess hydrogen ions in the plasma that stimulated the kidneys to perform this operation. The resulting reaction in the plasma is the formation of carbonic acid which is in equilibrium with the plasma partial pressure of carbon dioxide.  This is tightly regulated to ensure that there is no excessive build-up of carbonic acid or bicarbonate. The overall effect is therefore that hydrogen ions are lost in the urine when the pH of the plasma falls. The concomitant rise in the plasma bicarbonate mops up the increased hydrogen ions (caused by the fall in plasma pH) and the resulting excess carbonic acid is disposed of in the lungs as carbon dioxide. This restores the normal ratio between bicarbonate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and therefore the plasma pH.
The converse happens when a high plasma pH stimulates the kidneys to secrete hydrogen ions into the blood and to excrete bicarbonate into the urine.  The hydrogen ions combine with the excess bicarbonate ions in the plasma, once again forming an excess of carbonic acid which can be exhaled, as carbon dioxide, in the lungs, keeping the plasma bicarbonate ion concentration, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and, therefore, the plasma pH, constant.

===Cerebrospinal fluid===
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) allows for regulation of the distribution of substances between cells of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakka|first1=L.|last2=Coll|first2=G.|last3=Chazal|first3=J.|title=Anatomy and physiology of cerebrospinal fluid|journal=European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases|date=December 2011|volume=128|issue=6|pages=309–316|doi=10.1016/j.anorl.2011.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroendocrine]] factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high [[glycine]] [[concentration]] disrupts [[temperature]] and [[blood pressure]] control, and high CSF [[pH]] causes [[dizziness]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saladin |first1=Kenneth |title=Anatomy and Physiology |edition= 6th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2012 |pages=519–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurotransmission===
Inhibitory neurons in the [[central nervous system]] play a homeostatic role in the balance of neuronal activity between excitation and inhibition. Inhibitory neurons using [[GABA]], make compensating changes in the neuronal networks preventing runaway levels of excitation.&lt;ref name="Flores"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flores|first1=CE|last2=Méndez|first2=P|title=Shaping inhibition: activity dependent structural plasticity of GABAergic synapses.|journal=Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience|date=2014|volume=8|pages=327|doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00327|pmid=25386117|pmc=4209871}}&lt;/ref&gt; An imbalance between excitation and inhibition is seen to be implicated in a number of [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric disorders]].&lt;ref name="Um"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Um|first1=Ji Won|title=Roles of Glial Cells in Sculpting Inhibitory Synapses and Neural Circuits|journal=Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience|date=13 November 2017|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fnmol.2017.00381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroendocrine system===
{{Further |Metabolism |Enterohepatic circulation |Metabolic pathway}}
{{See also |Enzyme#Regulation}}

The [[neuroendocrine system]] is the mechanism by which the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis, regulating [[metabolism]], reproduction, eating and drinking behaviour, energy utilization, osmolarity and blood pressure.

The regulation of metabolism, is carried out by [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] interconnections to other glands.&lt;ref name="J o E"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toni|first1=R|title=The neuroendocrine system: organization and homeostatic role.|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|date=2004|volume=27|issue=6 Suppl|pages=35–47|pmid=15481802}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Three [[endocrine gland]]s of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]] (HPG axis) often work together and have important regulatory functions. Two other regulatory endocrine axes are the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) and the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis]] (HPT axis).

The [[liver]] also has many regulatory functions of the metabolism. An important function is the production and control of [[bile acid]]s. Too much bile acid can be toxic to cells and its synthesis can be inhibited by activation of [[Farnesoid X receptor|FXR]] a [[nuclear receptor]].&lt;ref name=Kalaany/&gt;

===Gene regulation===
{{Main |Regulation of gene expression}}
At the cellular level, homeostasis is carried out by several mechanisms including [[transcriptional regulation]] that can [[regulation of gene expression|alter the activity of genes]] in response to changes.

===Energy balance===
{{Main |Energy homeostasis}}
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
The amount of energy taken in through [[nutrition]] needs to match the amount of energy used. To achieve energy homeostasis [[appetite]] is regulated by two hormones, [[grehlin]] and [[leptin]]. Grehlin stimulates hunger and the intake of food and leptin acts to signal satiety (fullness).

==Clinical significance==
Many diseases are the result of a homeostatic failure. Almost any homeostatic component can malfunction either as a result of an [[genetic disorder|inherited defect]], an [[inborn error of metabolism]], or an acquired disease. Some homeostatic mechanisms have inbuilt redundancies, which ensures that life is not immediately threatened if a component malfunctions; but sometimes a homeostatic malfunction can result in serious disease, which can be fatal if not treated. A well-known example of a homeostatic failure is shown in [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Here [[blood sugar regulation]] is unable to function because the [[beta cells]] of the [[pancreatic islets]] are destroyed and cannot produce the necessary [[insulin]]. The blood sugar rises in a condition known as [[hyperglycemia]].

The plasma ionized calcium homeostat can be disrupted by the constant, unchanging, over-production of [[parathyroid hormone]] by a parathyroid [[adenoma]] resulting in the typically features of [[hyperparathyroidism]], namely high plasma ionized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels and the resorption of bone, which can lead to spontaneous fractures. The abnormally high plasma ionized calcium concentrations cause conformational changes in many cell-surface proteins (especially ion channels and hormone or neurotransmitter receptors)&lt;ref name=CMArmstrong1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armstrong CM, Cota G | title = Calcium block of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and its effect on closing rate | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 4154–7 | date = Mar 1999 | pmid = 10097179 | pmc = 22436 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.7.4154 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4154A }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to lethargy, muscle weakness, anorexia, constipation and labile emotions.&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Harrison|first1= T.R. | title =Principles of Internal Medicine | edition=  third | pages = 170, 571–579 | location = New York | publisher =  McGraw-Hill Book Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body water homeostat can be compromised by the inability to secrete [[Antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] in response to even the normal daily water losses via the exhaled air, the [[feces]], and [[Dehydration#Cause|insensible sweating]]. On receiving a zero blood ADH signal, the kidneys produce huge unchanging volumes of very dilute urine, causing dehydration and death if not treated.

As organisms age, the efficiency of their control systems becomes reduced. The inefficiencies gradually result in an unstable internal environment that increases the risk of illness, and leads to the physical changes associated with aging.&lt;ref name=Marieb/&gt;

Various [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] diseases are kept under control by homeostatic compensation, which masks a problem by compensating for it (making up for it) in another way. However, the compensating mechanisms eventually wear out or are disrupted by a new complicating factor (such as the advent of a concurrent acute viral infection), which sends the body reeling through a new cascade of events. Such decompensation unmasks the underlying disease, worsening its symptoms. Common examples include decompensated [[heart failure]], [[kidney failure]], and [[liver failure]].

==Biosphere==
In the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lovelock |first1=James | title=Healing Gaia: Practical Medicine for the Planet|location=New York |publisher=Harmony Books |publication-date=1991|isbn= 0-517-57848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the entire mass of living matter on Earth (or any planet with life) functions as a vast homeostatic [[superorganism]] that actively modifies its planetary environment to produce the environmental conditions necessary for its own survival. In this view, the entire planet maintains several homeostasis (the primary one being temperature homeostasis). Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is open to debate. However, some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, it is sometimes claimed that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, certain plants may be able to grow better and thus act to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, warming has exacerbated droughts, making water the actual [[limiting factor]] on land. When sunlight is plentiful and the atmospheric temperature climbs, it has been claimed that the [[phytoplankton]] of the ocean surface waters, acting as global sunshine, and therefore heat sensors, may thrive and produce more [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS). The DMS molecules act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]], which produce more clouds, and thus increase the atmospheric [[albedo]], and this feeds back to lower the temperature of the atmosphere. However, rising sea temperature has stratified the oceans, separating warm, sunlit waters from cool, nutrient-rich waters. Thus, nutrients have become the limiting factor, and plankton levels have actually fallen over the past 50 years, not risen. As scientists discover more about Earth, vast numbers of positive and negative feedback loops are being discovered, that, together, maintain a metastable condition, sometimes within a very broad range of environmental conditions.

==Predictive==
{{main|Predictive homeostasis}}
Predictive homeostasis is an anticipatory response to an expected challenge in the future, such as the stimulation of insulin secretion by gut hormones which enter the blood in response to a meal.&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt; This insulin secretion occurs before the blood sugar level rises, lowering the blood sugar level in anticipation of a large influx into the blood of glucose resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates in the gut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Walter F. | last1 = Boron | first2 = Emile L. | last2 = Boulpaep | title = Medical physiology: a cellular and molecular approach | year = 2009 | publisher = Saunders/Elsevier | location = Philadelphia, PA | isbn = 9781416031154 | edition=  2nd International | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such anticipatory reactions are open loop systems which are based, essentially, on "guess work", and are not self-correcting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=J.H. |last2=Saunders |first2=P.T. |last3=Wessels |first3=J.A. | title=Glucose homeostasis with infinite gain: further lessons from the Daisyworld parable? |journal= Journal of Endocrinology | publication-date=1997 |volume=134 |pages=187–192  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipatory responses always require a closed loop negative feedback system to correct the 'over-shoots' and 'under-shoots' to which the anticipatory systems are prone.

==Other fields==
The term has come to be used in other fields, for example:

===Risk===
{{Main|Risk homeostasis}}
An [[actuary]] may refer to ''risk homeostasis'', where (for example) people who have anti-lock brakes have no better safety record than those without anti-lock brakes, because the former unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits. Previous to the innovation of anti-lock brakes, certain maneuvers involved minor skids, evoking fear and avoidance: Now the anti-lock system moves the boundary for such feedback, and behavior patterns expand into the no-longer punitive area. It has also been suggested that ecological crises are an instance of risk homeostasis in which a particular behavior continues until proven dangerous or dramatic consequences actually occur.&lt;ref name="Risk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Laci|title=Flotation: A Guide for Sensory Deprivation, Relaxation, &amp; Isolation Tanks|date=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=1329173759 |pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===
Sociologists and psychologists may refer to ''stress homeostasis'', the tendency of a population or an individual to stay at a certain level of [[stress (biology)|stress]], often generating artificial stresses if the "natural" level of stress is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z6TXCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Sociologists+and+psychologists+may+refer+to+stress+homeostasis,+the+tendency+of+a+population+or+an+individual+to+stay+at+a+certain+level+of+stress,+often+generating+artificial+stresses+if+the+%22natural%22+level+of+stress+is+not+enough.#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Flotation: A Guide for Sensory Deprivation, Relaxation, &amp; Isolation Tanks|last=Spencer|first=Laci|date=2015-05-29|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329173750|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-François Lyotard]], a postmodern theorist, has applied this term to societal 'power centers' that he describes in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'', as being 'governed by a principle of homeostasis,' for example, the scientific hierarchy, which will sometimes ignore a radical new discovery for years because it destabilizes previously accepted norms.

===Technology===

'''''Ironclad: Battle for Blood''''' is a 2014 [[Epic film|epic]] [[war film]] directed by [[Jonathan English]]. It is the sequel to his 2011 film ''[[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ironclad-battle-blood-film-review-717930 'Ironclad: Battle for Blood': Film Review - The Hollywood Reporter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Five years after the events of ''Ironclad'', the de Vesci family struggles with [[Scottish people|Scot]] raiders along the [[Anglo-Scottish border|English-Scottish border]]. A blood feud begins after the Scot chieftain's son is killed in one of these raids. The wounded de Vesci patriarch, Gilbert, sends his son Hubert to seek help from his nephew, a "great warrior" named Guy de Lusignan.

This Guy is revealed to be none other than [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|Baron d'Aubigny]]'s idealistic [[squire]] from ''Ironclad''. Unable to find peace after the events at Rochester, he has grown into a cynical, hard-bitten fighting man who makes a living in [[mercenary]] work and underground bloodsports. Shrugging off Hubert’s appeal to family, he demands payment for his services and those of his partner Berenger, forcing Hubert to hand over the last of the de Vesci fortune. To bolster their numbers, Guy saves a condemned murderer called Crazy Mary with a bribe, but end up getting "two for the price of one" when authorities come after the headsman, Pierrepoint, for selling prisoners.

Hubert leads the four mercenaries back to the besieged de Vesci castle, and they help the garrison beat back the Scot attacks. Guy's reunion with his relations proves awkward. His beautiful, spoiled cousin Blanche spurns him at first, especially after learning that he came for money instead of family, but begins to warm to him after he saves her from Scot infiltrators.

Casualties mount as the siege drags on. Gilbert de Vesci dies of his wound, passing his lordship on to Hubert. His wife Joan later takes poison to join him, believing the battle lost. Pierrepoint is murdered by Mary, who held a grudge against her would-be executioner. At last, the Scots resort to fire, burning down the castle gates and storming the keep. Berenger, caught outside, nearly wins a duel with the Scot chieftain before the raiders interrupt and kill him. Hubert entrusts his sisters to Guy before making a last stand with Mary as lord of the castle.

The Scots overpower Hubert and Mary, executing the latter by hanging. To spare Hubert the same fate, Guy recalls his honor and heritage and challenges the Scot chieftain to single combat. He emerges victorious with unexpected help from Blanche. With their leader dead, the clan renounces the blood feud and returns to the hills. An epilogue narrated by Hubert reveals that despite his apparent change of heart at the siege’s end, Guy stayed on the mercenary path, and went on to ply his trade in the [[Hundred Years' War]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]].

==Cast==
* [[Tom Austen]] as Guy de Lusignan, a hardened mercenary who fought as a squire at the famous siege of Rochester Castle
* [[David Rintoul]] as Gilbert de Vesci, a former [[Crusades|Crusader]] and lord of the de Vesci castle
* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Joan de Vesci, Gilbert’s wife
* [[Tom Rhys Harries]] as Hubert de Vesci, Gilbert’s son
* [[Roxanne McKee]] as Blanche de Vesci, Gilbert’s spoiled older daughter  
* [[Rosie Day]] as Kate de Vesci, Gilbert’s younger daughter 
* [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] as Smith, Gilbert’s doughty manservant
* [[David Caves]] as Berenger, Guy’s friend and fellow mercenary who owes him a life debt
* [[Twinnie Lee Moore]] as Crazy Mary, a condemned murderer
* [[Andy Beckwith]] as Pierrepoint (Charles Montserrat de Pierrepoint III), an executioner
* [[Predrag Bjelac]] as Maddog, chieftain of the Scot raiders

==Links to the first film==

The film is based on an entirely new story, with only scattered callbacks to its predecessor.

The rebellion and the fight against King John at Rochester are referenced, as are some characters. Archbishop Langton ([[Charles Dance]]), who is mentioned by name, helped Guy settle in a monastery to find peace after the great siege. Guy also recalls the words of Thomas Marshall ([[James Purefoy]]) in an exchange about the nobility of killing.

There is also a parallel between the characters of Jedediah Coteral ([[Jamie Foreman]]) and Pierrepoint, in the form of purchasing prisoners to serve as mercenaries. In particular, Baron d’Aubigny’s ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) question to Coteral before freeing him, “Are you sorry for your sins?”, is repeated by Pierrepoint to his victims.

==Historical inaccuracies==

The epilogue states that Guy fought in the Hundred Years’ War. This is impossible as that war began in 1337, and the film is set five years after the Siege of Rochester Castle which took place in 1215.

==Reception==
Guy Lodge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that English "rehashes most of his technical devices from the first film" and noted that the "production and costume design on the Serbian-shot production are economically restrained," though "Andreas Weidinger’s kitschily choral score is anything but."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-ironclad-battle-for-blood-1201268246/ |title=Film Review: ''Ironclad: Battle for Blood'' |first=Guy |last=Lodge |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Fujinami'''''|藤波||}} was a {{sclass-|Yūgumo|destroyer}} of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Her name means "Purple Wave" or "Waves of [[Wisteria]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/destroy.htm Destroyers].  The word ''nami'' means "wave" (e.g. [[Tsunami]]); the word ''fuji'' means "[[wisteria]]", and can allude to the color purple, the color of wisteria flowers.&lt;/ref&gt; Damaged by a dud aerial torpedo during an air raid at Rabaul on 5 November 1943, with one dead and nine wounded. The ship participated in the [[Battle of Philippine Sea]].

==Fate==
In the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Fujinami'' escorted the 1st Diversion Attack Force, commanded by Admiral [[Kurita Takeo]]. She sustained minor damage from the air attacks on 24–25 October due to near-misses and strafing. In the [[Battle off Samar]] on 25 October ''Fujinami'' was detached to assist {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chōkai||2}}, then she removed survivors and scuttled the cruiser with a [[torpedo]]. On 27 October, while steaming to assist the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hayashimo||2}}, ''Fujinami'' was sunk by aircraft from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}, {{convert|80|mi|km}} north of [[Iloilo]] ({{coord|12|0|N|122|30|E|display=inline, title}}). She was lost with all hands, including the ''Chōkai'' survivors. The [[commanding officer]] was Cmdr. Tatsuji Matsuzaki from 31 July 1943 – 27 October 1944 (KIA). Some US survivors of the escort carrier {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|2}} have stated that Captain Matsuzaki restrained his men from firing on them as they floated by ''Fujinami'' and was allegedly seen to salute the American sailors.{{citation needed|date=August 2015|reason= No citation provided for this story}}

'''Laila Shahzada''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|لیلیٰ شہزادہ}}}}) (1926–	20 July 1994) was a Pakistani abstract [[painter]] who lived and worked in Karachi, [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1042990, 'Homage: Remembering the maestro', Dawn newspaper, Published 15 Sep 2013, Retrieved 18 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Shahzada was born in [[Littlehampton]], England in 1926. After completing her basic education in England, she decided to become a painter-artist and trained under the artist, Nagi, in Karachi. She held her first solo exhibition at the Arts Council, Karachi in 1960. Using artifacts of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in Pakistan as models, she made a series of paintings reflecting the culture of this ancient civilization. These paintings were shown at an exhibit at [[Karachi]] in 1976. In 1986, she participated in a group show at the Shorouks International Gallery, Regent Street, [[London]]. A total of 60 to 70 paintings were done by her before hear death. She was killed in a gas explosion at her studio on 20 July 1994.&lt;ref name=samaa/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Shahzada married twice in her life. She had a son and a daughter from the first marriage, Sohail and Shahien. After separation from her first husband, she was given custody of their son and the first husband got custody of their daughter. She remarried and had another son, Zahir, in the second marriage but could never emotionally get over the loss of her daughter, Shahien. Later, she did a painting titled ''Mother and child''. Some friends and art critics said that the painting was a reflection of her own pain as a mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With love, from art collectors: Remembering Laila Shahzada's sensitivities and inclinations|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/812799/with-love-from-art-collectors-remembering-laila-shahzadas-sensitivities-and-inclinations|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=The Express Tribune|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liliom-Joseph-Schildkraut.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Schildkraut]] in the title role in the [[Theatre Guild]] production of ''Liliom'' (1921)]]
{{italic title}}
'''''Liliom''''' is a 1909 play by the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] playwright [[Ferenc Molnár]]. It was well-known in its own right during the early to mid-20th century, but is best known today as the basis for the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical [[Carousel (musical)|''Carousel'']].

== Plot ==
[[File:Liliom-Schildkraut-Chard-LeGallienne.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Schildkraut (Liliom), Evelyn Chard (Louise) and [[Eva Le Gallienne]] (Julie) in the 1921 Theatre Guild production]]
The play takes place partly in [[Budapest]], Hungary, and partly in a waiting area just outside [[Heaven]]. The story concerns Liliom, a tough, cocky [[carousel]] [[Barker (occupation)|barker]] who falls in love with Julie, a young woman who works as a maid. When both lose their jobs, Liliom begins mistreating Julie out of bitterness — even slapping her once — although he loves her. When she discovers she is pregnant, he is deliriously happy, but, unbeknownst to Julie, he agrees to participate with his friend Ficsur, a criminal, in a hold-up to obtain money to provide for the child. Liliom is unwilling to leave Julie and return to his jealous former employer, the carousel owner Mrs. Muskat, and feels that the robbery is his only way left to obtain financial security. The hold-up is a disaster, but Ficsur escapes, and Liliom kills himself to avoid capture. He is sent to a fiery place, presumably [[Purgatory]]. Sixteen years later, he is allowed to return to Earth for one day to do a good deed for his now teenage daughter, Louise, whom he has never met. If he succeeds, he will be allowed to enter Heaven. He fails in the attempt, and is presumably sent to Hell. The ending, though, focuses on Julie, who obviously remembers Liliom fondly.

A contrasting subplot involves Julie's best friend, Marie, and Wolf Beifeld, a rather pompous hotel porter who marries Marie and finally becomes the wealthy owner of the hotel at which he once worked. The two eventually have seven children, who never appear onstage in Molnár's play. There is also a carpenter in ''Liliom'' who is in unrequited love with Julie, and who, in contrast to Liliom, has a stable job.

== Reception ==
[[File:Liliom offers Louise a star.jpg|thumb|upright|"A star—please, my dear—I must do something good."  Liliom ([[Joseph Schildkraut]]) offers Louise (Evelyn Chard) the star he stole, in this scene from the 1921 [[Theatre Guild]] production.]]
''Liliom'' was a failure in Hungary when it was staged there in 1909, but not when it was staged on Broadway in an English translation by [[Benjamin Glazer]] in 1921. The production starred [[Joseph Schildkraut]] (his role originally offered to [[John Barrymore]]), and [[Eva Le Gallienne]], with supporting roles played by such actors as [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] and [[Helen Westley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=9062|title=Liliom - IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information|author=The Broadway League|work=ibdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivor Novello]] starred as Liliom in 1926 in London, with [[Charles Laughton]], in one of his first stage roles, as Ficsur. Schildkraut and Le Gallienne repeated their roles, and [[Sayre Crawley]] played the Magistrate in the first Broadway revival of the play, in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11658|title=Liliom - IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information|author=The Broadway League|work=ibdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage and radio adaptations ==
===''The Campbell Playhouse'' (1939)===
In 1939, [[Orson Welles]] directed and played the title role in a one-hour radio adaptation for his CBS ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' program. The production costarred [[Helen Hayes]] as Julie and [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Mrs. Muskat, the carousel owner who is infatuated with Liliom. It was broadcast live on October 22, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://orsonwelles.indiana.edu/items/show/1998 |title=The Campbell Playhouse: Liliom |date=October 22, 1939 |website=Orson Welles on the Air, 1938–1946 |publisher=Indiana University Bloomington |access-date=2018-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadway (1940)===
In 1940, a second American stage revival, starring [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]], with [[Elia Kazan]] as Ficsur and [[Joan Tetzel]] as Louise, played in New York.

===''Carousel'' (musical, 1945)===
In 1945, at the suggestion of the [[Theatre Guild]] (which had produced the 1921 and 1932 productions of ''Liliom'' as well as the original ''[[Oklahoma! (musical)|Oklahoma!]]''), [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] wrote ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', an American musical adaptation of the play. This was also produced by the Theatre Guild and became one of the great classics of musical theatre. Even though the musical adaptation took liberties with Molnár's play, changing the ending so that the ex-barker is successful in trying to help Louise upon his return to Earth, Molnár applauded ''Carousel''. The character of Louise is made more poignant in the musical, in which she is snobbishly taunted and rejected because her father was a thief. It is the Liliom character who finally gives her the confidence she needs to face life. In ''Carousel'', the characters of Marie and Wolf Beifeld in ''Liliom'' become Carrie Pipperidge and Mr. Snow who, a fisherman in the musical, is made even more pompous than in the original play. His children are the ones who so viciously taunt Louise, although, in order to keep Carrie a sympathetic character, Hammerstein keeps her totally unaware of this; in contrast to Mr. Snow, she is even supportive of a potential budding romantic relationship between their eldest son and Louise. (The relationship is quickly cut short, however, when Mr. Snow's son insults Louise by stating outright that marrying her would be "beneath his station.") Both Carrie and Mr. Snow are made into rather comical figures (especially the feather-brained Carrie) in the musical, in contrast to the completely serious Marie and Wolf Beifeld in ''Liliom''.

''Carousel'' also Americanizes the story, setting it in [[Maine]] during the last part of the nineteenth century, and including a [[New England clam bake]] as the setting for some of the more cheerful songs in the show. The names of most of the other characters were changed as well. Liliom became Billy Bigelow, the criminal Ficsur became Jigger Craigin, and Mother Hollunder, the boarding house keeper, became Julie's cousin Nettie. There is no carpenter character in ''Carousel''.

There is an added layer of social commentary in ''Liliom'' which is deliberately omitted from ''Carousel''. The intended holdup victim in Molnar's play, a payroll clerk named Linzman, is [[Jewish]], as is Wolf Beifeld. In ''Carousel'', Linzman becomes Mr. Bascombe, the wealthy owner of the [[cotton mill]] at which Julie once worked.

In ''Liliom'', Liliom encounters Linzman only once, during the robbery. In ''Carousel'', Billy Bigelow has met Bascombe much earlier during the play. Bascombe finds him and Julie together and kindly offers not to fire Julie, who has stayed out past the mill workers' curfew, if she allows him (Bascombe) to take her back to the mill. She gently refuses.

However, many elements of ''Liliom'' are retained faithfully in ''Carousel'', an unusual step in the 1940s for a musical play based on such a serious drama. Molnár's basic plotline for Liliom and Julie is largely adhered to, as is much of his dialogue (although Hammerstein makes it more colloquial and gives it a [[New England]] flavor). Billy Bigelow is a womanizer and an abusive husband, as is Liliom in the non-musical play; however, both the Molnar play and the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical are careful to stress that he has hit his wife only once, and that other characters erroneously believe that he is a habitual wife-beater.

''Carousel'' also retains the attempted robbery scene, however in the film adaptation, Billy falls on his knife while trying to get away and doesn't commit suicide like Liliom does in the original play.

===Hamburg Ballet (2011)===
In December 2011, a ballet adaptation of ''Liliom'', with music by Oscar-winning composer [[Michel Legrand]], was premiered by the [[Hamburg Ballet]], and starred [[Alina Cojocaru]] as Julie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alinacojocaru.com/page3.htm|title=ALINA COJOCARU - What / When / Where..|work=alinacojocaru.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, Liliom's child is changed from being a girl to a boy (Louis instead of Louise).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danceviewtimes.com/2011/12/john-neumeiers-new-liliom.html|title=John Neumeier's new "Liliom" - danceviewtimes|work=danceviewtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Théâtre de Liège (2014)===
In 2014 Galin Stoev directed the play in [[Théâtre de Liège]].

===Andrei Şerban's ''Carousel'' (2015)===
A stage adaptation by [[Andrei Şerban]] and Daniela Dima, ''Carousel'', also based on [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1934 ''[[Liliom (1934 film)|Liliom]]'', has played at [[Bucharest]]'s [[Bulandra Theatre]] since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Chiţan:

== Film adaptations ==

''Liliom'' has been filmed several times, beginning in the silent era:

*The first film version, directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] in 1919, was aborted in mid-production because of Curtiz's flight from Hungary, and never finished.
*The second, a somewhat disguised and heavily altered version reset in [[Coney Island]], was made in 1921 and was titled ''A Trip to Paradise''. It starred [[Bert Lytell]].
*In 1930 came the first [[talkie]] version, a mostly faithful adaptation made in English by [[Fox Film]] written by [[S.N. Behrman]] and Sonya Levien, although Ficsur (played by [[Lee Tracy]]) was called "The Buzzard" in this version. The character Hollinger, who is alluded to in the stage version but never actually appears, was one of the supporting characters in this film, and Mother Hollunder, the boarding house keeper, was re-christened Aunt Hulda. Directed by [[Frank Borzage]], the film starred [[Charles Farrell]] and [[Rose Hobart]], and was not a success. It is rarely shown today, but has recently been issued on DVD in an enormous multi-disc set entitled ''Murnau, Borzage, and Fox''. The package contains many of the best known silent and early talkie films that [[F. W. Murnau]] and Frank Borzage made for Fox Film. The 1930 ''Liliom'' is, as yet, not available as a single disc.
*In 1934 came what is considered to be the most notable film version of Molnar's original play — the French film version directed by [[Fritz Lang]], starring [[Charles Boyer]] and [[Madeleine Ozeray]]. This version, released by [[Fox Europa]], was also seen extremely rarely until it was made available on DVD in 2004. On the whole, it was a very faithful adaptation. Lang, however, omitted the characters of Wolf Beifeld and the Carpenter. Mother Hollunder was renamed Mrs. Menoux. In Lang's version, Hollinger again appears onscreen. He is a jealous barker who tries to undermine Liliom at the amusement park. It is Mrs. Menoux's assistant, a meek young man, who serves as substitute for the Carpenter and is infatuated with Julie. The criminal Ficsur, who leads Liliom into committing a holdup, was renamed Alfred. In this version, Liliom slaps Julie onscreen; in the original stage versions of both ''Liliom'' and ''Carousel'' he is never shown doing this.

{{main|Liliom (1934 film)}}

These first two talking film versions of Molnar's original play also alter the ending to make it more hopeful, though not as drastically as ''Carousel'' does. (''A Trip to Paradise'' also featured a happy ending.) In the 1934 French film, Liliom finally does gain entry into Heaven, not because he has successfully done something good for his daughter, but because of Julie's forgiveness and love for him. Likewise, in the 1930 American film version, Liliom feels that he has failed, but the Heavenly Magistrate ([[H. B. Warner]]) reassures him that he has not, because Julie clearly still loves him. But it is never revealed in this version whether or not Liliom actually enters Heaven.

By contrast, in the original stage play, Liliom is ominously and sternly led offstage after he fails in his heavenly mission and is never seen or heard from again, although Julie still remembers him fondly.

*The play has also been adapted for Austrian and German television, and twice for Spanish television.
*Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical adaptation, ''Carousel'', was made into a [[CinemaScope 55]] [[Carousel (film)|color film]] by [[20th-Century Fox]] in 1956, starring [[Gordon MacRae]] and [[Shirley Jones]]. The movie version of the hit musical failed to attract wide public attention at the time, although its soundtrack album was a best-seller and remains so to this day. In 2006, this film and the 1934 film of ''Liliom'' were packaged together on a 2-Disc DVD. (See the article on the film, ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]''.)
*A television adaptation of ''Carousel'', starring [[Robert Goulet]] and a previously unknown singer-actress named [[Mary Grover]], aired in 1967 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.

== Major characters in ''Liliom'' ==
*Liliom, a carousel barker
*Julie, a housemaid who falls in love with Liliom
*Mrs. Muskat, owner of the carousel at which Liliom works; she is infatuated with Liliom
*Ficsur, a criminal and friend of Liliom
*Mother Hollunder, owner of the boarding house at which Liliom and Julie are staying
*Young Hollunder, her son
*Marie, Julie's best friend
*Wolf Beifeld, a hotel porter and Marie's fiancé
*A Carpenter, in unrequited love with Julie
*Louise, Liliom and Julie's daughter
*Linzman, a payroll clerk
*The Heavenly Magistrate
*Two Policemen from the Beyond

==Trivia==
Liliom is the Hungarian word for [[lily]], derived from the [[Latin]] ''lilium''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.behindthename.com/name/liliom/submitted  Given Name LILIOM]&lt;/ref&gt; Lilies are the flowers most commonly used at funerals, where they symbolically signify that the soul of the deceased has been restored to the state of innocence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teleflora.com/meaning-of-flowers/lily  Meaning &amp; Symbolism of Lilies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liliom is just a stage name, to the police he gives his "real" name: Andreas Zavoczki.

'''Marie de Bourbon''' (15 October 1605 &amp;ndash; 4 June 1627), [[Duchy of Montpensier|Duchess of Montpensier]], and [[Duchess of Orléans]] by marriage, was a French noblewoman and one of the last members of the [[House of Bourbon-Montpensier]]. Her parents were [[Henri, Duke of Montpensier|Henri de Bourbon]], ''[[Duke of Montpensier]]'' and [[Henriette Catherine de Joyeuse]], Duchess of Joyeuse in her own right.&lt;ref name="Gavard1848"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gavard|first=Charles|title=Galeries historiques du Palais de Versailles |trans-title=Historical Galleries of the Palace of Versailles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK0DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|accessdate=27 May 2018|year=1848|language=fr |publisher=Impr. Royale|pages=206, 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Marie de Bourbon was born in the [[château de Gaillon]], in Gaillon ([[Eure]] department of France), in the former province of [[Normandy]].

Known as ''Mademoiselle de Montpensier'' before her marriage, she was the Duke and Duchess of Montpensier's only child. At the age of two, she had been engaged to the second son of [[Henry IV of France]], [[Nicolas Henri, Duke of Orléans|Nicolas Henri de France, Duke of Orléans]], but he died at the age of four in 1611. She was then betrothed to his brother, [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans|Gaston de France, Duke of Orléans]], the younger brother of king [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], and the [[heir presumptive]] to the [[throne]] of France.

At the death of her father, in 1608, Marie became the Duchess of Montpensier in her own right; the Duchy was one of the oldest in France having been elevated from a County in 1539. Marie was a descendant of [[John II of France]], of the [[House of Valois]] and of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]].

Because of the Montpensier's fortune, of which Marie was the only heiress, and despite the aversion shown by Gaston toward this arranged marriage, Louis XIII and [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] were determined the marriage would take place.

The wedding ceremony was celebrated in [[Nantes]], on 6 August 1626, in the presence of Louis XIII, his wife, Queen [[Anne of Austria]], and [[Marie de' Medici]], the Queen Mother. According to her daughter's biographer, [[Vita Sackville-West]], quoting a member of her husband's household, ''A sadder wedding was never seen.''.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, V.. ''Daughter of France:The life of Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, duchesse de Montpensier 1627-1693''&lt;/ref&gt;

From this union, the new ducal couple had one child:
*[[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, ''Duchess of Montpensier'']] (Louvre, 29 May 1627 &amp;ndash; Palais du Luxembourg, 3 April 1693), the future '''''Grande Mademoiselle'''''.

Marie died on 4 June 1627 at the [[Palais du Louvre]] in Paris, at the age of twenty-one, shortly after the birth of her daughter who, as her only child, inherited her fortune and titles. She was buried at the [[Basilica of St Denis|Royal Basilica of Saint Denis]], north of Paris.

In a will intended to disinherit her niece,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Ranum, "Mademoiselle de Guise, ou les défis de la quenouille," ''XVII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Siècle'' (1984), pp.221-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Marie's half-sister [[Marie de Lorraine, Duchess of Guise|Marie de Lorraine]],&lt;ref&gt;Ranum, ''Portraits'', pp. 449-54&lt;/ref&gt;) chose Charles François de Stainville as beneficiary in 1688; but on the urging of her heirs, the will was broken by the [[Parlement of Paris]] in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;Marie de Guise (1615-1688), French Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Counts and Dukes of Guise]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her daughter, ''La Grande Mademoiselle'', in 1693, Marie's fortune was handed over to [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe de France]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s younger and only brother.

The '''Monovalent Cation:Proton Antiporter-1 (CPA1) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36 TC# 2.A.36]) is a large family of proteins derived from [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacteria, [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[yeast]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

Bacterial homologues have also been found to facilitate Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Antiporter|antiport]], but some also catalyze Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waditee R, Hibino T, Tanaka Y, Nakamura T, Incharoensakdi A, Takabe T | title = Halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica contains an Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, homologous to eukaryotic ones, with novel ion specificity affected by C-terminal tail | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 40 | pages = 36931–8 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11479290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M103650200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phylogeny ==
The [[phylogenetic tree]] for the CPA1 family shows three principal clusters. The first cluster includes proteins derived exclusively from animals, and all of the functionally characterized members of the family belong to this cluster. Of the two remaining clusters, one includes all bacterial homologues while the other includes one from ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]],'' one from ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and two from yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe|S. pombe]]''). Several organisms possess multiple paralogues; for example, seven paralogues are found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]],'' and five are known in humans. Most of these paralogues are very similar in sequence, and they belong to the animal specific cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A representative list of proteins belonging to the CPA1 family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.8 Transporter Classification Database].

== Structure ==
Numerous members of the CPA1 family have been sequenced, and these proteins vary substantially in size. The bacterial proteins have 520-550 amino acyl residues (aas) while eukaryotic proteins are generally larger, varying in size from 540-900 residues. They exhibit 10-12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). A proposed [[Topology|topological]] model suggests that in addition to 12 TMSs, a region between TMSs 9 and 10 dips into the membrane to line the pore. However, one homologue, Nhx1 of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.1.12 TC# 2.A.36.1.12])'','' has an extracellular glycosylated C-terminus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakabayashi S, Pang T, Su X, Shigekawa M | title = A novel topology model of the human Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 275 | issue = 11 | pages = 7942–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10713111 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.275.11.7942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells KM, Rao R | title = The yeast Na+/H+ exchanger Nhx1 is an N-linked glycoprotein. Topological implications | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 5 | pages = 3401–7 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11036065 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M001688200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Using the mammalian NHE1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.1.1 TC# 2.A.36.1.1]), it has been found that TMSs 4 and 9 as well as the extracellular loop between TMSs 3 and 4 are important for drug ([[amiloride]]- and [[benzoyl]] [[Guanidine|guanidinium]]-based derivatives) sensitivities. Mutations in these regions also affect transport activities. M4 and M9 therefore contain critical sites for both drug and [[cation]] recognition.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by functionally characterized members of the CPA1 family is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36|title=2.A.36 The Monovalent Cation:Proton Antiporter-1 (CPA1) Family|website=Transporter Classification Database|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) ⇌ Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Neurophilosophy''' or '''philosophy of neuroscience''' is the interdisciplinary study of [[neuroscience]] and [[philosophy]] that explores the relevance of [[neuroscientific]] studies to the arguments traditionally categorized as [[philosophy of mind]]. The philosophy of neuroscience attempts to clarify neuroscientific methods and results using the conceptual rigor and methods of [[philosophy of science]].

==The indirectness of studies of mind and brain==
Many of the methods and techniques central to neuroscientific discovery rely on assumptions that can limit the interpretation of the data. Philosophers of neuroscience have discussed such assumptions in the use of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]],&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack(2010)"Subtraction and Beyond" in Hanson and Bunzl, Human Brain Mapping. pp. 147–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein C. (2010) "Philosophical Issues in Neuroimaging" Philosophy Compass 5(2) pp. 186–198&lt;/ref&gt; dissociation in cognitive [[neuropsychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Dunn (2003) "The Elusive Dissociation" cortex 39 no. 1 pp. 21–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn and Kirsner. 2003. What can we infer from double dissociations?&lt;/ref&gt; [[single unit recording]],&lt;ref&gt;deCharms and Zandor (2000) "Neural Representation and the temporal code" Annual Review of Neuroscience 23: pp. 613–47&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Winsberg (2003)"Simulated Experiments: a Methodology for the Virtual World" Philosophy of Science.vol 70 no 1 105–125&lt;/ref&gt; Following are descriptions of many of the current controversies and debates about the methods employed in neuroscience.

===fMRI===
Many fMRI studies rely heavily on the assumption of "localization of function"&lt;ref&gt;Huettel, Song and McCarthy ''Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging'' 2009 Sinauer Associates pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt; (same as [[functional specialization]]). Localization of function means that many cognitive functions can be localized to specific brain regions. A good example of functional localization comes from studies of the motor cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Passingham, R. E. Stephan, K. E. Kotter, R."The anatomical basis of functional localization in the cortex"Nature Reviews Neuroscience. 2002, VOL 3; PART 8, pages 606–616&lt;/ref&gt; There seem to be different groups of cells in the motor cortex responsible for controlling different groups of muscles. Many philosophers of neuroscience criticize fMRI for relying too heavily on this assumption. Michael Anderson points out that subtraction method fMRI misses a lot of brain information that is important to the cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson.(2007) "The Massive Redeployment Hypothesis and Functional Topography of the Brain" Philosophical Psychology Vol20 no 2 pp.144–149&lt;/ref&gt; Subtraction fMRI only shows the differences between the task activation and the control activation, but many of the brain areas activated in the control are obviously important for the task as well.

Some philosophers entirely reject any notion of localization of function and thus believe fMRI studies to be profoundly misguided.&lt;ref&gt;The Massive Redeployment Hypothesis and Functional Topography of the Brain" Philosophical Psychology Vol20 no 2 pp.149–152&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophers maintain that brain processing acts holistically, that large sections of the brain are involved in processing most cognitive tasks (see [[holism]] in neurology and the modularity section below). {{anchor|radio repair man}}One way to understand their objection to the idea of localization of function is the radio repair man thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Bunzel, Hanson, and Poldrack "An Exchange about Localization of Function" Human Brain Mapping. pp.50&lt;/ref&gt; In this thought experiment, a radio repair man opens up a radio and rips out a tube. The radio begins whistling loudly and the radio repair man declares that he must have ripped out the anti-whistling tube. There is no anti-whistling tube in the radio and the radio repair man has confounded function with effect. This criticism was originally targeted at the logic used by neuropsychological brain lesion experiments, but the criticism is still applicable to neuroimaging. These considerations are similar to Van Orden's and Paap's criticism of circularity in neuroimaging logic.&lt;ref&gt;VanOrden, G and Paap, K "Functional Neuroimaging fails to discover Pieces of the Mind" Philosophy of science. 64 pp. S85-S94&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, neuroimagers assume that their theory of cognitive component parcellation is correct and that these components divide cleanly into feed-forward modules. These assumptions are necessary to justify their inference of brain localization. The logic is circular if the researcher then use the appearance of brain region activation as proof of the correctness of their cognitive theories.

A different problematic methodological assumption within fMRI research is the use of reverse inference&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack (2006)"Can Cognitive Processes be inferred from Neuroimaging Data"Trends in Cognitive Sciences. vol 10 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; A reverse inference is when the activation of a brain region is used to infer the presence of a given cognitive process. Poldrack points out that the strength of this inference depends critically on the likelihood that a given task employs a given cognitive process and the likelihood of that pattern of brain activation given that cognitive process. In other words, the strength of reverse inference is based upon the selectivity of the task used as well as the selectivity of the brain region activation. A 2011 article published in the NY times has been heavily criticized for misusing reverse inference.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, B "Do you Really love Your iPhone that Way" http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-decision-tree/201110/do-you-really-love-your-iphone-way&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, participants were shown pictures of their iPhones and the researchers measured activation of the insula. The researches took insula activation as evidence of feelings of love and concluded that people loved their iPhones. Critics were quick to point out that the insula is not a very selective piece of cortex, and therefore not amenable to reverse inference.

The Neuropsychologist [[Max Coltheart]] took the problems with reverse inference a step further and challenged neuroimagers to give one instance in which neuroimaging had informed psychological theory&lt;ref&gt;Coltheart, M(2006b), "What Has Functional Neuroimaging Told Us about the Mind (So Far)?", Cortex 42: 323–331.&lt;/ref&gt; Coltheart takes the burden of proof to be an instance where the brain imaging data is consistent with one theory but inconsistent with another theory. Roskies maintains that Coltheart's ultra cognitive position makes his challenge unwinnable.&lt;ref&gt;Rooskies, A. (2009)"Brain-Mind and Structure-Function Relations: A methodological Response to Coltheart" Philosophy of Science. vol 76&lt;/ref&gt; Since Coltheart maintains that the implementation of a cognitive state has no bearing on the function of that cognitive state, then it is impossible to find neuroimaging data that will be able to comment on psychological theories in the way Coltheart demands. Neuroimaging data will always be relegated to the lower level of implementation and be unable to selectively determine one or another cognitive theory. In a 2006 article, Richard Henson suggests that forward inference can be used to infer dissociation of function at the psychological level.&lt;ref&gt;Henson, R (2006)"Forward Inference Using Functional Neuroimaging: Dissociations vs Associations" Trends in Cognitive Sciences vol 10 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that these kinds of inferences can be made when there is crossing activations between two task types in two brain regions and there is no change in activation in a mutual control region.

One final assumption worth mentioning is the assumption of pure insertion in fMRI.&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack "Subtraction and Beyond" in Hanson and Bunzl Human Brain Mapping pp. 147–160&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of pure insertion is the assumption that a single cognitive process can be inserted into another set of cognitive processes without affecting the functioning of the rest. For example, if you wanted to find the reading comprehension area of the brain, you might scan participants while they were presented with a word and while they were presented with a non-word (e.g. "Floob"). If you infer that the resulting difference in brain pattern represents the regions of the brain involved in reading comprehension, you have assumed that these changes are not reflective of changes in task difficulty or differential recruitment between tasks. The term pure insertion was coined by Donders as a criticism of reaction time methods.

Recently, researchers have begun using a new functional imaging technique called resting state functional connectivity MRI.&lt;ref&gt;Wig, Schlaggar, and Peterson (2011) "Concepts and Principals in the Analysis of Brain Networks" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1224&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects' brains are scanned while the subject sits idly in the scanner. By looking at the natural fluctuations in the bold pattern while the subject is at rest, the researchers can see which brain regions co-vary in activation together. They can use the patterns of covariance to construct maps of functionally linked brain areas. The name "functional connectivity" is somewhat misleading since the data only indicates co-variation. Still, this is a powerful method for studying large networks throughout the brain. There are a couple of important methodological issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, there are many different possible brain mappings that could be used to define the brain regions for the network. The results could vary significantly depending on the brain region chosen. Secondly, what mathematical techniques are best about to characterize these brain regions?

The brain regions of interest are somewhat constrained by the size of the voxels. Rs-fcMRI uses voxels that are few millimeters cubed so the brain regions will have to be defined on a larger scale. Two of the statistical methods that are commonly applied to network analysis can work on the single voxel spatial scale, but graph theory methods are extremely sensitive to the way nodes are defined. Brains regions can be divided according to their cellular architectural, according to their connectivity, or according to physiological measures. Alternatively, you could take a theory neutral approach and randomly divide the cortex into partitions of the size of your choosing. As mentioned earlier, there are several approaches to network analysis once the your brain regions have been defined. Seed based analysis begins with an a priori defined seed region and finds all of the regions that are functionally connected to that region. Wig et al. caution that the resulting network structure will not give any information concerning the inter-connectivity of the identified regions or the relations of those regions to regions other than the seed region. Another approach is to use independent component analysis to create spatio-temporal component maps and the components are sorted by components that carry information of interest and those that are caused by noise. Wigs et al. once again warns that inference of functional brain region communities is difficult under ICA. ICA also has the issue of imposing orthogonality on the data.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford et al (2010) "Detecting network modules in fMRI time series: A weighted network analysis approach" Neuroimage. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Graph theory uses a matrix to characterize covariance between regions which is then transformed into a network map. The problem with graph theory analysis is that network mapping is heavily influenced by a priori brain region and connectivity (nodes and edges), thus the researcher is at risk for cherry picking regions and connections according to their own theories. However, graph theory analysis is extremely valuable since it is the only method that gives pair-wise relationships between nodes. ICA has the added advantage of being a fairly principled method. It seems that using both methods will be important in uncovering the network connectivity of the brain. Mumford et al. hoped to avoid these issues and use a principled approach that could determine pair-wise relationships using a statistical technique adopted from analysis of gene co-expression networks.

===Dissociation in cognitive neuropsychology===
Cognitive Neuropsychology studies brain damaged patients and uses the patterns of selective impairment in order to make inferences on the underlying cognitive structure. [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|Dissociation]] between cognitive functions is taken to be evidence that these functions are independent. Theorists have identified several key assumptions that are needed to justify these inferences:&lt;ref&gt;Coltheart, M "Assumptions and Methods in Cognitive Neuropsychology" in The Handbook of Cognitive Neuropsychology. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
1) ''Functional Modularity''- the mind is organized into functionally separate cognitive modules.
2). ''Anatomical Modularity''- the brain is organized into functionally separate modules. This assumption is very similar to the assumption of functional localization. These assumptions differ from the assumption of functional modularity, because it is possible to have separable cognitive modules that are implemented by diffuse patterns of brain activation.
3)''Universality''- The basic organization of functional and anatomical modularity is the same for all normal humans. This assumption is needed if we are to make any claim about functional organization based on dissociation that extrapolates from the instance of a case study to the population.
4) ''Transparency'' / ''Subtractivity''- the mind does not undergo substantial reorganization following brain damage. It is possible to remove one functional module without significantly altering the overall structure of the system. This assumption is necessary in order to justify using brain damaged patients in order to make inferences about the cognitive architecture of healthy people.

There are three principal types of evidence in cognitive neuropsychology: association, single dissociation and double dissociation.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, K and Plaut, D (2009) "Shallow Droughts Intoxicate the Brain: Lessons from Cognitive Science for Cognitive Neuropsychology"&lt;/ref&gt; Association inferences observe that certain deficits are likely to co-occur. For example, there are many cases who have deficits in both abstract and concrete word comprehension following brain damage. Association studies are considered the weakest form of evidence, because the results could be accounted for by damage to neighboring brain regions and not damage to a single cognitive system.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M (2010) "Double Dissociation: Understanding its Role in Cognitive Neuropsychology" Mind &amp; Language vol 25 no 5 pp500-540&lt;/ref&gt; Single Dissociation inferences observe that one cognitive faculty can be spared while another can be damaged following brain damage. This pattern indicates that a) the two tasks employ different cognitive systems b) the two tasks occupy the same system and the damaged task is downstream from the spared task or c) that the spared task requires fewer cognitive resources than the damaged task. The "gold standard" for cognitive neuropsychology is the double dissociation. Double dissociation occurs when brain damage impairs task A in Patient1 but spares task B and brain damage spares task A in Patient 2 but damages task B. It is assumed that one instance of double dissociation is sufficient proof to infer separate cognitive modules in the performance of the tasks.

Many theorists criticize cognitive neuropsychology for its dependence on double dissociations. In one widely cited study, Joula and Plunkett used a model connectionist system to demonstrate that double dissociation behavioral patterns can occur through random lesions of a single module.&lt;ref&gt;Joula and Plunkett (1998)"Why Double Dissociations Don't Mean Much" Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society&lt;/ref&gt; They created a multilayer connectionist system trained to pronounce words. They repeatedly simulated random destruction of nodes and connections in the system and plotted the resulting performance on a scatter plot. The results showed deficits in irregular noun pronunciation with spared regular verb pronunciation in some cases and deficits in regular verb pronunciation with spared irregular noun pronunciation. These results suggest that a single instance of double dissociation is insufficient to justify inference to multiple systems.&lt;ref&gt;Keren, G and Schuly (2003) "Two is not Always Better than One: a Critical Evaluation of Two System Theories" Perspectives on Psychological Science Vol 4 no 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter offers a theoretical case in which double dissociation logic can be faulty.&lt;ref&gt;Charter, N (2003)"How Much Can We Learn From Double Dissociations" Cortex 39 pp.176–179&lt;/ref&gt; If two tasks, task A and task B, use almost all of the same systems but differ by one mutually exclusive module apiece, then the selective lesioning of those two modules would seem to indicate that A and B use different systems. Charter uses the example of someone who is allergic to peanuts but not shrimp and someone who is allergic to shrimp and not peanuts. He argues that double dissociation logic leads one to infer that peanuts and shrimp are digested by different systems. John Dunn offers another objection to double dissociation.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, J (2003) "The elusive Dissociation" Cortex 39 no 1 21–37&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that it is easy to demonstrate the existence of a true deficit but difficult to show that another function is truly spared. As more data is accumulated, the value of your results will converge on an effect size of zero, but there will always be a positive value greater than zero that has more statistical power than zero. Therefore, it is impossible to be fully confident that a given double dissociation actually exists.

On a different note, Alphonso Caramazza has given a principled reason for rejecting the use of group studies in cognitive neuropsychology.&lt;ref&gt;Caramazza, A (1986) "On Drawing Inferences about the Structure of Normal Cognitive Systems From the Analysis of Patterns of Impaired Performance: the Case for Single Case Studies"&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of brain damaged patients can either take the form of a single case study, in which an individual's behavior is characterized and used as evidence, or group studies, in which a group of patients displaying the same deficit have their behavior characterized and averaged. In order to justify grouping a set of patient data together, the researcher must know that the group is homogenous, that their behavior is equivalent in every theoretically meaningful way. In brain damaged patients, this can only be accomplished ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' by analyzing the behavior patterns of all the individuals in the group. Thus according to Caramazza, any group study is either the equivalent of a set of single case studies or is theoretically unjustified. Newcombe and Marshall pointed out that there are some cases (they use Geschwind's syndrome as an example) and that group studies might still serve as a useful heuristic in cognitive neuropsychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;Newcombe and Marshall (1988)"Idealization Meets Psychometrics. The case for the Right Groups and the Right Individuals" Human Cognitive Neuropsychology edited by Ellis and Young&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single unit recordings===
It is commonly understood in neuroscience that information is encoded in the brain by the firing patterns of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;deCharms and Zandor (2000) "Neural Representations and the Cortical Code" Annual Review of Neuroscience 23:613–647&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the philosophical questions surrounding the neural code are related to questions about representation and computation that are discussed below. There are other methodological questions including whether neurons represent information through an average firing rate or whether there is information represented by the temporal dynamics. There are similar questions about whether neurons represent information individually or as a population.

===Computational neuroscience===
Many of the philosophical controversies surrounding computational neuroscience involve the role of simulation and modeling as explanation. Carl Craver has been especially vocal about such interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Craver, Carl Explaining the Brain. Oxford University Press New York, New York. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Love wrote an especially critical article targeted at Bayesian behavioral modeling that did not constrain the modeling parameters by psychological or neurological considerations&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Love (2011) "Bayesian Fundemantalism or Enlightenment? on the explanatory status and theoretical contribution of Bayesian models of cognition" Brain and Behavioral Sciences vol 34 no 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Eric Winsberg has written about the role of computer modeling and simulation in science generally, but his characterization is applicable to computational neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;Winberg, E (2003)"Simulated Experiments: Methodology for a Virtual World" Philosophy of Science.vol 70 no 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computation and representation in the brain==
The [[computational theory of mind]] has been widespread in neuroscience since the cognitive revolution in the 1960s. This section will begin with a historical overview of computational neuroscience and then discuss various competing theories and controversies within the field.

===Historical overview===
Computational neuroscience began in the 1930s and 1940s with two groups of researchers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The first group consisted of [[Alan Turing]], [[Alonzo Church]] and [[John von Neumann]], who were working to develop computing machines and the mathematical underpinnings of [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;Horst, Steven, "The Computational Theory of Mind", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/computational-mind/&lt;/ref&gt; This work culminated in the theoretical development of so-called Turing machines and the [[Church–Turing thesis]], which formalized the mathematics underlying computability theory. The second group consisted of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts who were working to develop the first artificial neural networks. McCulloch and Pitts were the first to hypothesize that neurons could be used to implement a logical calculus that could explain cognition. They used their toy neurons to develop logic gates that could make computations.&lt;ref&gt;Piccini, G (2009) "Computationalism in the Philosophy of Mind" Philosophical Compass vol 4&lt;/ref&gt; However these developments failed to take hold in the psychological sciences and neuroscience until the mid-1950s and 1960s.
Behaviorism had dominated the psychology until the 1950s when new developments in a variety of fields overturned behaviorist theory in favor of a cognitive theory. From the beginning of the cognitive revolution, computational theory played a major role in theoretical developments. Minsky and McCarthy's work in artificial intelligence, Newell and Simon's computer simulations, and Noam Chomsky's importation of information theory into linguistics were all heavily reliant on computational assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G (2003) "The Cognitive Revolution: a Historical Perspective" Trends in Cognitive Sciences. vol 7 no 3&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1960s, Hilary Putnam was arguing in favor of machine functionalism in which the brain instantiated Turing machines. By this point computational theories were firmly fixed in psychology and neuroscience.
By the mid-1980s, a group of researchers began using multilayer feed-forward analog neural networks that could be trained to perform a variety of tasks. The work by researchers like Sejnowski, Rosenberg, Rumelhart, and McClelland were labeled as connectionism, and the discipline has continued since then.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, James, "Connectionism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/connectionism/&lt;/ref&gt; The connectionist mindset was embraced by Paul and Patricia Churchland who then developed their "state space semantics" using concepts from connectionist theory. Connectionism was also condemned by researchers such as Fodor, Pylyshyn, and Pinker. The tension between the connectionists and the classicists is still being debated today.

===Representation===
One of the reasons that computational theories are appealing is that computers have the ability to manipulate representations to give meaningful output. Digital computers use strings of 1s and 0s in order to represent the content such as this Wikipedia page. Most cognitive scientists posit that our brains use some form of representational code that is carried in the firing patterns of neurons. Computational accounts seem to offer an easy way of explaining how our brains carry and manipulate the perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and actions that make up our everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, David, "Mental Representation", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/mental-representation/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While most theorists maintain that representation is an important part of cognition, the exact nature of that representation is highly debated. The two main arguments come from advocates of symbolic representations and advocates of associationist representations.

Symbolic representational accounts have been famously championed by Fodor and Pinker. Symbolic representation means that the objects are represented by symbols and are processed through rule governed manipulations that are sensation to the constitutive structure. The fact that symbolic representation is sensitive to the structure of the representations is a major part of its appeal. Fodor proposed the Language of Thought Hypothesis in which mental representations manipulated in the same way that language is syntactically manipulated in order to produce thought. According to Fodor, the language of thought hypothesis explains the systematicity and productivity seen in both language and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Aydede, Murat, "The Language of Thought Hypothesis", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/language-thought/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Associativist representations are most often described with connectionist systems. In connectionist systems, representations are distributed across all the nodes and connection weights of the system and thus are said to be sub symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel and Abrahamsen. Connectionism and the Mind. 2nd ed. Malden, Mass. : Blackwell, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that a connectionist system is capable of implementing a symbolic system. There are several important aspects of neural nets that suggest that distributed parallel processing provides a better basis for cognitive functions than symbolic processing. Firstly, the inspiration for these systems came from the brain itself indicating biological relevance. Secondly, these systems are capable of storing content addressable memory, which is far more efficient than memory searches in symbolic systems. Thirdly, neural nets are resilient to damage while even minor damage can disable a symbolic system. Lastly, soft constraints and generalization when processing novel stimuli allow nets to behave more flexibly than symbolic systems.

The Churchlands described representation in a connectionist system in terms of state space. The content of the system is represented by an n-dimensional vector where the n= the number of nodes in the system and the direction of the vector is determined by the activation pattern of the nodes. Fodor rejected this method of representation on the grounds that two different connectionist systems could not have the same content.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, N. "Content and its Vehicles in Connectionist Systems" Mind and Language. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Further mathematical analysis of connectionist system relieved that connectionist systems that could contain similar content could be mapped graphically to reveal clusters of nodes that were important to representing the content.&lt;ref&gt;Laakso, Aarre &amp; Cottrell, Garrison W. (2000). Content and cluster analysis: Assessing representational similarity in neural systems. Philosophical Psychology 13 (1):47–76&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Churchlands, state space vector comparison was not amenable to this type of analysis. Recently, Nicholas Shea has offered his own account for content within connectionist systems that employs the concepts developed through cluster analysis.

===Views on computation===
Computational neuroscience is committed to the position that the brain is some sort of computer, but what does it mean to be a computer? The definition of a computation must be narrow enough so that we limit the number of objects that can be called computers. For example, it might seem problematic to have a definition wide enough to allow stomachs and weather systems to be involved in computations. However, it is also necessary to have a definition broad enough to allow all of the wide varieties of computational systems to compute. For example, if the definition of computation is limited to syntactic manipulation of symbolic representations, then most connectionist systems would not be able to compute.&lt;ref&gt;Shagrir (2010)"Computation San Diego Style" Philosophy of science vol 77&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Grush distinguishes between computation as a tool for simulation and computation as a theoretical stance in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Grush"&gt;Grush, R (2001) "The semantic Challenge to Computational Neuroscience"In Peter K. Machamer, Peter McLaughlin &amp; Rick Grush (eds.), Theory and Method in the Neurosciences. University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For the former, anything that can be computationally modeled counts as computing. In the latter case, the brain is a computing function that is distinct from systems like fluid dynamic systems and the planetary orbits in this regard. The challenge for any computational definition is to keep the two senses distinct.

Alternatively, some theorists choose to accept a narrow or wide definition for theoretical reasons. [[Pancomputationalism]] is the position that everything can be said to compute. This view has been criticized by [[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini]] on the grounds that such a definition makes computation trivial to the point where it is robbed of its explanatory value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini, G]]. (2010). "The Mind as Neural Software? Understanding Functionalism, Computationalism, and Computational Functionalism." Philosophy and Phenomenological Research&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest definition of computations is that a system can be said to be computing when a computational description can be mapped onto the physical description. This is an extremely broad definition of computation and it ends up endorsing a form of pancomputationalism. Putnam and Searle, who are often credited with this view, maintain that computation is observer-related. In other words, if you want to view a system as computing then you can say that it is computing. Piccinini points out that, in this view, not only is everything computing, but also everything is computing in an indefinite number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;Piccinini, G. (2010b). "The Mind as Neural Software? Understanding Functionalism, Computationalism, and Computational Functionalism." Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 81&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is possible to apply an indefinite number of computational descriptions to a given system, the system ends up computing an indefinite number of tasks.

The most common view of computation is the semantic account of computation. Semantic approaches use a similar notion of computation as the mapping approaches with the added constraint that the system must manipulate representations with semantic content. Note from the earlier discussion of representation that both the Churchlands' connectionist systems and Fodor's symbolic systems use this notion of computation. In fact, Fodor is famously credited as saying "No computation without representation".&lt;ref&gt;Piccinini, G (2009) "Computation in the Philosophy of Mind" Philosophical Compass. vol 4&lt;/ref&gt; Computational states can be individuated by an externalized appeal to content in a broad sense (i.e. the object in the external world) or by internalist appeal to the narrow sense content (content defined by the properties of the system).&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;Piccinini, Gualtiero, "Computation in Physical Systems", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/computation-physicalsystems/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to fix the content of the representation, it is often necessary to appeal to the information contained within the system.
Grush provides a criticism of the semantic account.&lt;ref name="Grush" /&gt; He points out that appeal to the informational content of a system to demonstrate representation by the system. He uses his coffee cup as an example of a system that contains information, such as the heat conductance of the coffee cup and the time since the coffee was poured, but is too mundane to compute in any robust sense. Semantic computationalists try to escape this criticism by appealing to the evolutionary history of system. This is called the biosemantic account. Grush uses the example of his feet, saying that by this account his feet would not be computing the amount of food he had eaten because their structure had not been evolutionarily selected for that purpose. Grush replies to the appeal to biosemantics with a thought experiment. Imagine that lightning strikes a swamp somewhere and creates an exact copy of you. According to the biosemantic account, this swamp-you would be incapable of computation because there is no evolutionary history with which to justify assigning representational content. The idea that for two physically identical structures one can be said to be computing while the other is not should be disturbing to any physicalist.

There are also syntactic or structural accounts for computation. These accounts do not need to rely on representation. However, it is possible to use both structure and representation as constrains on computational mapping. Shagrir identifies several philosophers of neuroscience who espouse structural accounts. According to him, Fodor and Pylyshyn require some sort of syntactic constraint on their theory of computation. This is consistent with their rejection of connectionist systems on the grounds of systematicity. He also identifies Piccinini as a structuralist quoting his 2008 paper: "the generation of output strings of digits from input strings of digits in accordance with a general rule that depends on the properties of the strings and (possibly) on the internal state of the system".&lt;ref&gt;Piccinini (2008)"Computation without Representation" Philosophical Studies vol 137 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; Though Piccinini undoubtedly espouses structuralist views in that paper, he claims that mechanistic accounts of computation avoid reference to either syntax or representation.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; It is possible that Piccinini thinks that there are differences between syntactic and structural accounts of computation that Shagrir does not respect.

In his view of mechanistic computation, Piccinini asserts that functional mechanisms process vehicles in a manner sensitive to the differences between different portions of the vehicle, and thus can be said to generically compute. He claims that these vehicles are medium-independent, meaning that the mapping function will be the same regardless of the physical implementation. Computing systems can be differentiated based upon the vehicle structure and the mechanistic perspective can account for errors in computation.

Dynamical systems theory presents itself as an alternative to computational explanations of cognition. These theories are staunchly anti-computational and anti-representational. Dynamical systems are defined as systems that change over time in accordance with a mathematical equation. Dynamical systems theory claims that human cognition is a dynamical model in the same sense computationalists claim that the human mind is a computer.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. J. (1998) The dynamical hypothesis in cognitive science. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 21, 1–14&lt;/ref&gt; A common objection leveled at dynamical systems theory is that dynamical systems are computable and therefore a subset of computationalism. Van Gelder is quick to point out that there is a big difference between being a computer and being computable. Making the definition of computing wide enough to incorporate dynamical models would effectively embrace pancomputationalism.

'''Olympias''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] Ὀλυμπιάς, {{IPA-el|olympiás|pron}}; lived 3rd century BC) was daughter of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]] from his first wife [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]]. She was the wife of her own paternal half-brother [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander II]]. After his death she assumed the regency of the kingdom on behalf of her two sons, [[Pyrrhus II of Epirus|Pyrrhus II]] and [[Ptolemy of Epirus|Ptolemy]]; and in order to strengthen herself against the [[Aetolian League]] she gave before 239 BC her daughter [[Phthia of Macedonia|Phthia]] in marriage to [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]], king of [[Macedon]]ia. By this alliance she secured herself in the possession of the sovereignty, which she continued to administer till her sons were grown up to manhood, when she resigned it into the hands of Pyrrhus II. But the deaths of that prince and his brother Ptolemy followed in quick succession, and Olympias herself died of grief for her double loss.{{r|just_28.3}} Such is [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]]'s statement: according to another account Olympias had poisoned a [[Lefkada|Leucadian]] damsel named Tigris, to whom her son Pyrrhus was attached, and was herself poisoned by him in revenge.{{r|ath_13_phot}}

'''Pedro de Alvarado y Contreras''' ({{IPA-es|ˈpeðɾo ðe alβaˈɾaðo}}; [[Badajoz]], [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]], ca. 1485 &amp;ndash; [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[New Spain]], 4 July 1541) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] and governor of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="LovellLutzSwezey84p461"&gt;Lovell, Lutz and Swezey 1984, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the conquest of [[Cuba]], in [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s exploration of the coasts of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in the conquest of [[Mexico]] led by [[Hernán Cortés]].  He is considered the [[conquistador]] of much of [[Central America]], including [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. Although renowned for his skill as a soldier, Alvarado is known also for the cruelty of his treatment of native populations, and mass murders committed in the subjugation of the native peoples of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Portilla2006"&gt;León Portilla 2006, pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historiography portrays that indigenous people, both [[Nahuatl]]-speakers and speakers of other languages, called him ''[[Tonatiuh]]'', meaning "sun" in the Nahuatl language. Yet he was also called "Red Sun" in Nahuatl, which allows a variety of interpretations. Whether this [[epithet]] refers to Alvarado's red hair, some esoteric quality attributed to him, or both, is disputed.

==Character and appearance==
Pedro de Alvarado was flamboyant and charismatic,&lt;ref&gt;Myers 2004, pp. 19, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and was both a brilliant military commander&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 205, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and a cruel, hardened man.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p205"/&gt; His hair and beard were blond, which earned him the name of ''[[Tonatiuh]]'' from the Aztecs, the name of one of their sun gods.&lt;ref name="Burland73p216"/&gt; He was handsome,&lt;ref&gt;León Portilla 2006, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and presented an affable appearance, but was volatile and quick to anger.&lt;ref name="Burland73p216"&gt;Burland 1973, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; He was ruthless in his dealings with the indigenous peoples he set out to conquer. Historians judge that his greed drove him to excessive cruelty,&lt;ref name="Recinos86p205"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; and his Spanish contemporaries denounced his extreme brutality during his lifetime. He was a poor governor of territories he had conquered, and restlessly sought out new adventures.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

His tactical brutality, such as the [[massacre in the Great Temple]] of [[Tenochtitlan]], often undermined  strategic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused of cruelty against fellow Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarado was little suited to govern; when he held governing positions, he did little to establish stable foundations for colonial rule. His letters show no interest in civil matters, and he only discussed exploration and war.&lt;ref name="Recinos 86p209"/&gt; Alvarado stubbornly resisted attempts by the Spanish Crown to establish ordered taxation in Guatemala, and refused to acknowledge such attempts. As governor of Guatemala, Alvarado has been described by W. George Lovell et al. as "an insatiable despot who recognized no authority but his own and who regarded Guatemala as little more than his personal estate."&lt;ref name="LovellLutzSwezey84p461"/&gt;

American historian [[William H. Prescott]] described Alvarado's character in the following terms:

{{quote|Alvarado was a cavalier of high family, gallant and chivalrous, and &lt;nowiki&gt;[Cortes']&lt;/nowiki&gt; warm personal friend. He had talents for action, was possessed of firmness and intrepidity, while his frank and dazzling manners made the Tonatiuh an especial favourite with the Mexicans. But, underneath this showy exterior, the future conqueror of Guatemala concealed a heart rash, rapacious, and cruel. He was altogether destitute of that moderation, which, in the delicate position he occupied, was a quality of more worth than all the rest.|William H. Prescott 1922|History of the Conquest of Mexico: Book 4, Chapter 8, p. 54.}}

Spanish chronicler Antonio de Remesal commented that "Alvarado desired more to be feared than loved by his subjects, whether they were Indians or Spaniards."&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In his easy recourse to violence, Alvarado was a product of his time, and Alvarado was not the only ''conquistador'' to have resorted to such actions. Hernán Cortés and [[Francisco Pizarro]] carried out deeds of similar cruelty, but have not attracted as much criticism as Alvarado.&lt;ref name="Recinos 86p209"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Pedro de Alvarado was born in 1485 in the town of [[Badajoz]], [[Extremadura]].&lt;ref name="Recinos86p9"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Gómez de Alvarado,&lt;ref name="Recinos86p9-10"/&gt; and his mother was Leonor de Contreras, Gómez's second wife.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p9"/&gt; Pedro de Alvarado had a twin sister, Sarra, and four full-blood brothers, [[Jorge de Alvarado|Jorge]], [[Gonzalo de Alvarado#Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras|Gonzalo]], Gómez, and Juan.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p10"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Pedro had an illegitimate half brother, also named Juan, referred to in contemporary sources as ''Juan el Bastardo''.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 10, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little is known of Pedro de Alvarado's early life before his arrival in the Americas. During the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest of the Americas]], tales of his youthful exploits in Spain became popular legends, but their veracity is doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the tale then current that when he was a youth awaiting passage to the Americas, he climbed the church tower in [[Seville]] with some friends. A banner pole extended some {{convert|10|to|12|ft|m|order=flip}} from an upper window. One of his companions walked out to the end of the pole after removing his cloak and sword, and returned to the tower backwards. Alvarado, afraid of being mocked, walked out onto the pole with both sword and cloak, and turned around at the end to return to the tower facing it.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvarado's paternal grandfather was Juan Alvarado "el Viejo" ("the elder"), who was ''[[encomienda|comendador]]'' of [[Hornachos]], and his paternal grandmother was Catalina Messía.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p9"/&gt; Pedro de Alvarado's uncle on his father's side was Diego de Alvarado y Messía,&lt;ref name="Recinos86p9-10"&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the ''comendador'' of [[Lobón]], [[Puebla (disambiguation)|Puebla]], and [[Montijo, Spain|Montijo]], ''[[alcalde]]'' of [[Montánchez]], and lord of Castellanos and of Cubillana. Diego was a veteran of the [[Reconquista|campaigns]] against the [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="Recinos86p9"/&gt;

==First campaigns in the Americas==
Alvarado and his brothers crossed the Atlantic Ocean before 1511, possibly in 1510.&lt;ref&gt;Gall 1967, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1511 a system of licenses had been established in Spain to control the flow of colonists to the New World. The only one of the Alvarado brothers that appears in the registers is Juan de Alvarado, in 1511, leading to the assumption that the rest were already in the Americas by the time the licensing system was established.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alvarado brothers stopped off at [[Hispaniola]], but there are few mentions of their stay there in historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after arriving in [[Santo Domingo]], on Hispaniola, Pedro de Alvarado established a friendship with [[Hernán Cortés]], who at the time was serving as public scribe. Alvarado joined Cortés to participate in the conquest of [[Cuba]],&lt;ref name="Recinos86p16"/&gt; under the command of [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar|Diego de Velázquez]]. The conquest of Cuba was launched in 1511, and Pedro de Alvarado was accompanied by his brothers.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p17"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the invasion, Alvarado was managing a prosperous ''[[hacienda]]'' in the new colony.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p16"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; It is around this time that Pedro de Alvarado emerges into the historical record as a prosperous and influential ''hacienda''-owner, already well connected with Velázquez, who was now [[List of colonial governors of Cuba|governor of Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Recinos86p17"/&gt;

Diego Velázquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]]'s report of gold in the newly discovered [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759.&lt;/ref&gt; He organised an expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. Clendinnen 2003, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in overall command;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. Recinos 1986, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Pedro de Alvarado captained one of the ships.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The small fleet was stocked with [[crossbow]]s, [[musket]]s, barter goods, salted pork and [[cassava bread]].&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen 2003, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleet left Cuba in April 1518,&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt; and made its first landfall upon the island of [[Cozumel]],&lt;ref name="Clendinned87,03p15"/&gt; off the east coast of Yucatán.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt; The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish; the fleet then sailed south from Cozumel, along the east coast of the peninsula.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760Clendinner87,03p15"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 760.&lt;br&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish spotted three large [[Maya city|Maya cities]] along the coast. On [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Thursday]] the fleet discovered a large bay, which the Spanish named Bahía de la Ascensión.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 760.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north to loop around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula and sail down the west coast.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760Clendinner87,03p15"/&gt; At [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] the Spanish opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. The Maya remained hidden in the forest, so the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.&lt;ref name="Clendinned87,03p15"&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Champotón, Campeche|Champotón]], the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight.&lt;ref name="Clendinned87,03p15"/&gt; At the mouth of the [[Tabasco River]] the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen 2003, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the [[Aztec Empire]] to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire,&lt;ref name="Clendinned87,03p16"&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; sailing as far north as [[Pánuco River]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt;

At the [[Papaloapan River]], Alvarado ordered his ship upriver, leaving the rest of the small fleet behind to wait for him at the river mouth. This action greatly angered Grijalva, who feared that a lone ship could be lost. After this, the Spanish referred to the river as the ''Río de Alvarado'' ("Alvarado's River").&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A little further along the coast, the fleet encountered settlements under [[Aztec]] dominion, and was met by Aztec emissaries with gifts of gold and jewels sent by the Emperor [[Moctezuma II]].&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As punishment for entering the Papaloapan River without orders, Grijalva sent Alvarado with the ship ''San Sebastián'' to relay news of the discoveries back to Cuba. Alvarado made a triumphal entry to [[Santiago de Cuba]], with a great display of the wealth that had been gained from the expedition. His early arrival in Cuba allowed him to ingratiate himself with the Governor Velázquez before Grijalva's return.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p20"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the fleet put into the port of [[Havana]] five months after it had left.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt; Grijalva was coldly received by the governor, who Alvarado had turned against him, claiming much of the glory of the expedition for himself.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p21"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grijalva's return aroused great interest in Cuba. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hernán Cortés was placed in command;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt; Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers Jorge, Gómez and Juan "El Bastardo" joined the expedition. Cortés charged Pedro de Alvarado with gathering recruits from the inland estates of Cuba.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p21"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including [[Cristóbal de Olid]], [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] and [[Diego de Ordaz]]. Also aboard were [[Francisco de Montejo]] and [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], veterans of the Grijalva expedition.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt;

Alvarado once again commanded the ''San Sabastián'', with 60 men under his orders.&lt;ref&gt;García Añoveros 1987, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel, and remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p760"/&gt; From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p761"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tabasco, the fleet anchored at [[Potonchán]],&lt;ref name="Townsend92,95p16"&gt;Townsend 1995, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] town.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández et al 2010, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya prepared for [[Potonchán#Battle of Centla|battle]] but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome.&lt;ref name="Townsend92,95p16"/&gt; From Tabasco, the fleet continued to [[Cempoala]] in Veracruz, a subject city of the Aztec Empire,&lt;ref name="Townsend92,95p16"/&gt; and from there went on to conquer the Aztecs.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 1995, pp. 16ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castillo-de-Alvarado--Wall.jpg|thumb|200|The remains of the "Castillo de Alvarado", [[Chamela]], [[Jalisco]].]]
Alvarado commanded one of the eleven vessels in the fleet and also acted as Cortés' second in command during the expedition's first stay in the [[Aztec]] capital city of [[Tenochtitlán]].  Relations between the Spaniards and their hosts were uneasy, especially given Cortés' repeated insistence that the [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Aztecs desist from idol worship and human sacrifice]]; in order to ensure their own safety, the Spaniards took the Aztec king [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] hostage. When Cortés returned to the Gulf coast to deal with the newly arrived hostile expedition of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], Alvarado remained in Tenochtitlan as commander of the Spanish enclave, with strict orders to make sure that Moctezuma not be permitted to escape.&lt;ref name=CEpedro&gt;"Conquered Conquistadors", ''Florine G.L. Asselbergs'', First Edition, published 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}}

During Cortés' absence, relations between the Spaniards and their hosts went from bad to worse, and Alvarado ordered a [[Massacre in the Great Temple|preemptive slaughter]] of Aztec nobles and priests observing a religious festival.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|283–286}}  When Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan, he found the Spanish force under siege.  After Moctezuma was killed in the attempt to negotiate with his own people, the Spaniards determined to escape by fighting their way across one of the causeways that led from the city across the lake and to the mainland.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|286,294,296}}  In a bloody nocturnal action of 10 July 1520, known as [[La Noche Triste]], Alvarado led the rear-guard and was badly wounded.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|296–300}}  According to satirical verses by Gonzalo Ocampo, in reference to Alvarado crossing a causeway gap during the escape, Alvarado's escape became known as ''Salto de Alvarado'' ("Alvarado's Leap").&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|296–300}}

Pedro then participated in the [[Siege of Tenochtitlan]], commanding one of four forces under Cortes.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|315,319,333,351,355–356,358,360,363,369–370,372}}  Alvarado was wounded when Guatemoc attacked all three Spanish camps on the feast day of St. John.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|377–378,381,384–385,388–389}} Alvarado's company was the first to make it to the Tlateloco marketplace, setting fire to the Aztec shrines.

}}
Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado to [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|invade Guatemala]] with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58. Matthew 2012, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Pedro de Alvarado passed through Soconusco with a sizeable force in 1523, en route to conquer Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery;&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; there were also a great many indigenous allies from [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], Tenochtitlan, [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], [[Tlaxcala]], and [[Xochimilco]].&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado's letter to [[Hernán Cortés]] describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces.&lt;ref&gt;Gasco 1997, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lienzo de Tlaxcala Quetzaltenango.gif|thumb|300px|A page from the ''[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'' showing the conquest of [[Quetzaltenango]].]]
Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast unopposed until they reached the [[Samalá River]] in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' kingdom]], and a K'iche' army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K'iche'.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p764"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitlán by his Mexican allies (modern [[San Francisco Zapotitlán]]). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K'iche' archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 65. Gall 1967, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre mountains]] towards the K'iche' heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K'iche' warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K'iche', who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K'iche' and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764. Gall 1967, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524,&lt;ref name="Gall67p41"&gt;Gall 1967, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; a K'iche' army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated; many K'iche' nobles were among the dead.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765" /&gt; This battle exhausted the K'iche' militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital [[Q'umarkaj]], which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K'iche' intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q'umarkaj with his army.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p765"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Utatlan1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Q'umarkaj]] was the capital of the K'iche' kingdom until it was burnt by Alvarado's forces.|alt=Grass- and scrub-covered ruins set against a backdrop of low pine forest. A crumbling squat square tower stands behind to the right, all that remains of the Temple of Tohil, with the remains of the walls of the ballcourt to the left in the foreground.]]
In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q'umarkaj at the invitation of the remaining lords of the K'iche' after their catastrophic defeat,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 764–765. Recinos 1986, pp. 68, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; fearing that he was entering a trap.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 764–765.&lt;/ref&gt; He encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing the great number of K'iche' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q'umarkaj, he invited the leading lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the  king elect) to visit him in his camp.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 75. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 764–765.&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K'iche' warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers.&lt;ref name="Recinos 1952, 1986, p.75"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 74–5. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 764–765.&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction of Q'umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to [[Iximche]], capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p765" /&gt;

===Kaqchikel alliance and conquest of the Tz'utujil===
On 14 April 1524, soon after the defeat of the K'iche', the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 297. Guillemín 1965, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Recinos places all these dates two days earlier (e.g. the Spanish arrival at Iximche on 12 April rather than 14 April) based on vague dating in Spanish primary records. Schele and Fahsen calculated all dates on the more securely dated Kaqchikel annals, where equivalent dates are often given in both the Kaqchikel and Spanish calendars. The Schele and Fahsen dates are used in this section. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 386. n. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K'iche' resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz'utuhil kingdom.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitlán, [[Escuintla]] and [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlán]]. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July, Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala ("St. James of the Knights of Guatemala").&lt;ref name="autogenerated297"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 297. Recinos 1998, p. 101. Guillemín 1965, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lago de Atitlán 2009.JPG|thumb|300px|The Tz'utujil kingdom had its capital on the shore of [[Lake Atitlán]].|alt=View across hills to a broad lake bathed in a light mist. The mountainous lake shore curves from the left foreground backwards and to the right, with several volcanoes rising from the far shore, framed by a clear blue sky above.]]
The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p765" /&gt; Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 765. Recinos 1986, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p765" /&gt;

Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p82"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. This battle took place on 18 April.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p83"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p83" /&gt; Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 765–766. Recinos 1986, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain.&lt;ref name="Recinos86p84"&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaqchikel rebellion===
Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 [[peso]]s.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p25"&gt;Guillemin 1967 p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A ''peso'' was a Spanish coin. One peso was worth eight ''reales'' (the source of the term "pieces of eight") or two ''tostones''. During the conquest, a ''peso'' contained {{convert|4.6|g|oz}} of gold. Lovell 2005, p. 223. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 52. n. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel people abandoned their city and fled to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524. Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298" /&gt;

Two years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the ''[[Iximche#Political organisation|Ahpo Xahil]]'', sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 298, 310, 386n19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Recinos 1998, p. 19. gives ''sixty'' deserters.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years. On 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops,&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298" /&gt; A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at [[Ciudad Vieja]].&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298" /&gt;

===Pacific lowlands of Guatemala===
[[File:Lienzo de Tlaxcala Escuintla.gif|thumb|300px|A page from the ''[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'' depicting the conquest of Izcuintepeque.]]
On 8 May 1524, Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Most of these were native allies.&lt;/ref&gt; where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque near Izcuintepeque on 9 May.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler 1985, p. 41. Recinos 1998, p. 29. Matthew 2012, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day.&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes81p117" /&gt;

Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands.&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes81p117" /&gt;

According to Alvarado's letter to Cortés, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord.&lt;ref&gt;Batres 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days.&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes81p117"&gt;Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;Batres 2009, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moyuta.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pacific slope of [[Jutiapa]] was the scene of a number of battles with the [[Xinca people|Xinca]].]]
In [[Guazacapán]], Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca.&lt;ref name="Letona5"&gt;Letona Zuleta et al., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec.&lt;ref name="Letona6"&gt;Letona Zuleta et al., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population.&lt;ref name="Letona5" /&gt;

Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return. Messengers from the city of [[Pasaco|Pazaco]], in the modern department of Jutiapa,&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza Asencio 2011, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war. Alvarado's troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city's streets. From Pazaco, Alvarado crossed the [[Paz River|Río Paz]] and entered what is now El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Spanish conquest of El Salvador}}
Alvarado led the first effort by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of [[Cuzcatlan]] (in modern [[El Salvador]]), in June 1524. These efforts established many towns such as [[San José Acatempa]] in 1525 and [[Esquipulas]] in 1560. Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people known as the [[Pipils|Pipil]] and their Mayan speaking neighbors.  Despite Alvarado's initial success in the [[Battle of Acajutla]], the indigenous people of Cuzcatlán, who according to tradition were led by a warlord called [[Atlacatl]], defeated the Spaniards and their auxiliaries, and forced them to withdraw to Guatemala.

Alvarado was wounded on his left [[thigh]], remaining [[handicapped]] for the rest of his life. He abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions were required (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) to bring the Pipil under Spanish control.  In 1528 the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established.

==Titles and first marriage==
On 18 December 1527, the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|king of Spain]] named Alvarado as governor of Guatemala; two days later he granted him the coveted military title of ''[[Adelantado]]''. Alvarado's close friendship with Cortés was broken in the same year; Alvarado had promised Cortés that he would marry Cecilia Vázquez, Cortes' cousin. Alvarado broke his promise and instead married Francisca de la Cueva.&lt;ref name="García Añoveros 1987, p. 247"&gt;García Añoveros 1987, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisca de la Cueva was well connected at the royal court, being the niece of [[Francisco de los Cobos y Molina|Francisco de los Cobos]], the king's secretary, and a member of the powerful noble house of Albuquerque. This marriage gave Alvarado extra leverage at court and was far more useful to his long term interests; Alvarado thereafter maintained a friendship with Francisco de los Cobos that allowed him access to the king's favour. In 1528, by coincidence both Alvarado and Cortés were in Seville at the same time, but Cortés ignored him.&lt;ref name="García Añoveros 1987, p. 247"/&gt;

Francisca de la Cueva died shortly after their arrival in America. Alvarado remained governor of Guatemala until his death. He was made [[Knight]] of [[Order of Santiago|Santiago]] in 1527.

==Peru==
By 1532, Alvarado's friendship with Hernán Cortés had soured, and he no longer trusted him. At this time Alvarado requested permission from the king for an expedition south along the Pacific coast, to conquer any lands there that had not already been claimed for the Crown, and specifically rejected that Cortés should accompany him.&lt;ref name="GarcíaAñoveros87p248"&gt;García Añoveros 1987, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1534, Alvarado heard tales of the riches of [[Peru]], headed south to the [[Andes]] and attempted to bring the province of [[Quito]] under his rule.  When he arrived, he found the land already held by [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s  lieutenant [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]].  The two forces of Conquistadors almost came to battle; however, Alvarado bartered to Pizarro's group most of his ships, horses, and ammunition, plus most of his men, for a comparatively modest sum of money, and returned to Guatemala.&lt;ref name=CEpedro/&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}}

==Governor of Honduras==
{{see also|Spanish conquest of Honduras}}
In 1532, Alvarado received a [[Royal Cedula]] naming him Governor of the Province of Honduras. At that time, Honduras consisted of a single settlement of Spaniards in [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], but he declined to act on it.  In 1533 or 1534 he began to send his own work gangs of enslaved Africans and Native Americans into the parts of Honduras adjacent to Guatemala to work the placer gold deposits.

In 1536, ostensibly in response to a letter asking for aid from Andrés de Cereceda, then acting Governor of the Province of Honduras, Alvarado and his army of Indian allies arrived in Honduras, just as the Spanish colonists were preparing to abandon the country and go look for gold in Peru.  In June, 1536, Alvarado engaged the indigenous resistance led by Cicumba in the lower [[Ulúa River|Ulua river valley]], and won.  He divided up the Indian labor in ''repartimiento'' grants to his soldiers and some of the colonists, and returned to Guatemala.

During a visit to Spain, in 1537, Alvarado had the governorship of [[Honduras]] reconfirmed in addition to that of Guatemala for the next seven years. His governorship of Honduras was not uncontested.  Francisco de Montejo had a rival claim, and was installed by the Spanish king as Governor of Honduras in 1540. Ten years after being widowed, Alvarado married one of his first wife's sisters, [[Beatriz de la Cueva]], who outlived him.

After the death of Alvarado, de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times. She drowned a few weeks after taking office in the destruction of the capital city [[Ciudad Vieja]] by a sudden [[lahar|flow]] from the [[Volcán de Agua]] in 1541.

==Death in the Mixtón War, 1541==
[[File:Pedro de alvarado telleriano remensis.jpg|thumb|300px|Alvarado's death, depicted in the indigenous [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]]. The glyph to the right of his head represents his [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name, ''Tonatiuh'' ("Sun").]]
[[File:Antigua Guatemala, ruinas de la catedral 07.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Modern memorial stone in the ruins of [[Antigua Guatemala Cathedral|Antigua cathedral]], marking Pedro de Alvarado's tomb]]
Alvarado developed a plan to outfit an armada that would sail from the western coast of Mexico to [[China]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. At great cost, he assembled and equipped 13 ships and approximately 550 soldiers for the expedition.  The fleet was about to set sail in 1541 when Alvarado received a letter from [[Cristóbal de Oñate]], pleading for help against hostile Indians who were besieging him at [[Nochistlán]].&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.203}}

The siege was part of a major revolt by the [[Mixtón]] natives of the [[Nueva Galicia]] region of Mexico.  Alvarado gathered his troops and went to help Oñate. In a freak accident, he was crushed by a [[horse]] that was spooked and ran amok.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|Ch.203}}  He died a few days later, on July 4, 1541, and was buried in the church at Tiripetío, a village between [[Pátzcuaro]] and [[Morelia]] (in present-day [[Michoacán]]).

Four decades after Alvarado's death, his [[mestizo|mestiza]] daughter Leonor de Alvarado Xicoténcatl paid to transport his remains to Guatemala for reburial in the cathedral of the city of [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]], now [[Antigua Guatemala]].

==Family==

After the death of her husband, [[Beatriz de la Cueva]] maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times.&lt;ref name=UCIlist&gt;{{cite web|title=Conquistador and Colonial Elites of Central America (list)|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/linkages/datasets/p-connew.txt|publisher=University of California Irvine|author=Fabio Joseph Flouty|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616174716/http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/linkages/datasets/p-connew.txt|archivedate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvarado had no children from either of his legal marriages.  His life companion was his concubine Luisa de Tlaxcala (also called Xicoténcatl or Tecubalsi, her original names after Catholic baptism). She was a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] noblewoman, daughter of the [[Tlaxcallan]] Chief [[Xicotencatl the Elder]]. Luisa was given by her father in 1519 to [[Hernán Cortés]] as a proof of respect and friendship.  In turn Cortés  gave her ''in guard'' to Pedro de Alvarado,&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|178}} who quickly and unremarkably became her lover. Luisa followed Alvarado in his pursuit of conquests beyond central Mexico. Despite never being his legitimate wife, Luisa de Tlaxcala had numerous possessions and was respected as a Doña, both for her relationship with Alvarado and for her noble origin. She died in 1535 and was buried at the Guatemala Cathedral.

With Luisa de Tlaxcala Pedro de Alvarado had three children: 
* Leonor de Alvarado y Xicotenga Tecubalsi, born in the newly founded Spanish city of [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]], who married [[Pedro de Portocarrero (conquistador)|Pedro de Portocarrero]], a conqueror trusted by his father-in-law, whom he accompanied during the conquests of Mexico and Guatemala.  Portocarrero participated in numerous battles against the Indians.
: Leonor married a second time,&lt;ref&gt;According to the illustrious 17th-century historian father [[Domingo Juarros]] in his [[Compendio de la historia de la cuidad de guatemala]], pagina 347.&lt;/ref&gt; to Francisco de la Cueva y Guzman.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|178–179}}  The Alvarado fortune remained with their descendants for generations to come, in the family of Villacreces de la Cueva y Guzmán, governors of this part of Guatemala.
* Pedro de Alvarado, named for his father,&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|178}} who disappeared at sea when traveling to Spain
* Diego de Alvarardo, ''El [[Mestizo]]'', who died in 1554 in the civil wars of Peru.

By other women, in more casual relationships, he had two other children: 
* Gómez de Alvarado, without further notice
* Ana (Anita) de Alvarado

==References in modern culture==

*He is portrayed in [[Lew Wallace]]'s novel ''The Fair God''. One of Montezuma's daughters falls in love with him in a dream before she had ever seen him, when they do meet he returns her love and gives her an iron cross necklace so she can convert to Christianity. She is killed during the battle of La Noche Triste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Lew|title=The Fair God or the Last of the 'Tzins|date=1873|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[C. S. Forester]]'s 1937 novel ''[[The Happy Return]]'', set in Central America in 1808, features a character [[The Happy Return|El Supremo]] who claims to be a descendant of Alvarado by a (fictional) marriage to a daughter of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]].
*Pedro de Alvarado is a character in the opera ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'' (2005) by Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]], which depicts the major episodes of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] in 1521 and the subsequent destruction of the Aztec civilization.

'''Pinki Virani''' (born 30 January 1959) is an Indian writer, journalist, [[human-rights]] activist and author who has won critical acclaim for her books ''Once was Bombay'', ''Aruna's Story'', ''Bitter Chocolate: Child Sexual Abuse in India'' (which won the National Award), and ''Deaf Heaven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2009/07/19/stories/2009071950040200.htm|title=As we see ourselves
|author=R. Krithika|publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=19 July 2009 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fifth book is called ''Politics of the Womb -- The Perils of Ivf, Surrogacy &amp; Modified Babies''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/sunday-pioneer/special/the-egg-commerce.html |title=The Egg Commerce |publisher=Daily Pioneer |date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Virani was born in [[Mumbai]], India, to [[Gujarati Muslims|Gujarati Muslim]] parents. Her father owned a shop, and her mother was a teacher. She attended school in Mumbai, Pune and [[Mussoorie]]. She went to the US to study for a Masters in Journalism on the [[Aga Khan Foundation]] scholarship. She did an internship at ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', where she reported extensively on the race riots in Britain.

==Career==
She started working as a typist at the age of 18. When she returned to India after her scholarship, she worked as a reporter and went on to become India's first woman editor of an evening paper.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} She moved from daily journalism when she published her first book.

==Works==
Virani is the author of five books, four of which are non-fiction best-sellers.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

* ''Aruna's Story'' is about the rape of a nurse that left her in a coma. The book forms part of a 52-minute documentary, produced by the [[Public Service Broadcasting Trust|PSBT]], titled 'Passive Euthanasia: Kahaani Karuna Ki'. A play on this book has been performed by Lushin Dubey, directed by Arvind Gaur.
* ''Bitter Chocolate'' is about [[child sexual abuse]] in India. A play based on this book was performed by Sutradhar and directed by Vinay Varma. 
* ''Once Was Bombay'' is a sociology book which was cited by then Indian prime minister [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]] in his speech on collapsing cities.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!-- which speech, where and when? --&gt;
* ''Deaf Heaven'', her first work of fiction, experiments with form and style to warn off the danger of the tipping over of a modern country into neo-fascism. It was nominated for the Impac Dublin Literary Prize.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Outlook magazine placed it among the best ten books of the year.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* In ''Politics Of The Womb – The Perils Of Ivf, Surrogacy &amp; Modified Babies'' (2016), Virani criticises [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]] and other forms of assisted reproduction when used on women in aggressively repetitive cycles and calls for a worldwide ban on commercial surrogacy and other forms of third-party assisted reproduction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/pinki-virani-on-commercial-surrogacy-worst-kind-of-patriarchy-posturing-as-pro-woman-choice-2999272.html |title=Pinki Virani on commercial surrogacy: 'Worst kind of patriarchy posturing as pro-woman choice' |publisher=[[Firstpost]] |date=11 September 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virani's writings may have contributed to India's Parliament passing a law against sexual abuse of children (The Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences) in May 2012.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The law includes four of her suggestions to the Standing Committee, it also encompasses several suggestions from her book ''Bitter Chocolate: Child Sexual Abuse in India''. The book and a part of its contents has also been quoted in a Madras High Court judgement.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Aruna Shanbaug case==
{{Main|Aruna Shanbaug case}}
In 2009, Pinki Virani filed a petition in [[Supreme Court of India]] on behalf of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse working at the [[KEM Hospital]] in [[Mumbai]] on 27 November 1973 when she was sexually assaulted by a sweeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India court admits plea to end life of rape victim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8417549.stm |publisher=''[[BBC News]], Delhi''  |date=17 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the attack, Shanbaug was strangled with a chain, and the deprivation of oxygen left her in a vegetative state. She was treated at KEM following the incident and was kept alive by a feeding tube for 48 years, until her death of pneumonia in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aruna Shanbaug: Brain-damaged India nurse dies 42 years after rape|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32776897|publisher=BBC News |date=18 May 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Virani's 2009 petition, she argued that the "continued existence of Aruna is in violation of her right to live in dignity".

On 7 March 2011, the Supreme Court made its decision, in which it issued a set of broad guidelines legalizing [[passive euthanasia]] in India. These guidelines for passive euthanesia—''i.e.'' the decision to withdraw treatment, nutrition, or water—establish that the decision to discontinue life support must be taken by parents, spouse, or other close relatives, or in the absence of them, by a "next friend". This decision requires approval from the concerned High Court.

In its judgement, the court declined to recognize Virani as the "next friend" of Aruna Shanbaug, and instead treated the KEM hospital staff as the "next friend."

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not mean to decry or disparage what Ms. Pinky Virani has done.  Rather, we wish   to   express   our   appreciation   of   the splendid social spirit she has shown. We have seen on the internet that she has been espousing many social causes, and we hold her in high esteem.  All that we wish to say is that however much her interest in Aruna Shanbaug   may   be   it   cannot   match   the involvement of the KEM hospital staff who have been taking care of Aruna day and night for 38 years.&lt;ref name=scjudgement&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/wr1152009.pdf|title= Supreme Court decision on Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug versus Union of India|accessdate=11 September 2016 |publisher=Supreme Court of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127–128}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the KEM Hospital staff wished that Aruna Shanbaug be allowed to live, Virani's petition to withdraw life support was declined. However, the court further stipulated that the KEM hospital staff, with the approval of the Bombay High Court, had the option of withdrawing life support if they changed their mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, assuming that the KEM hospital staff at some future time changes its mind, in our opinion in such a situation the KEM hospital would have to apply to the Bombay High Court  for  approval  of  the  decision to  withdraw life support.&lt;ref name=scjudgement/&gt;{{rp|128}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a part of the judgement, the Supreme Court also expressed appreciation for Virani's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We also wish to express our appreciation of Ms. Pinki Virani who filed this petition.   Although we have dismissed the petition for the reasons given above, we regard her as a public spirited person who filed   the   petition   for   a   cause   she   bona   fide regarded as correct and ethical.   We hold her in high esteem.&lt;ref name=scjudgement/&gt;{{rp|140}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==

She is married to Shankkar Aiyar, who is a journalist and the author of ''Accidental India''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Virani saga |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090801/saturday/above.htm |publisher=''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' |date=1 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PsychoPy''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] software package, written in the [[Python programming language]], for the generation of experiments for [[neuroscience]] and [[experimental psychology]].&lt;ref name="psychopy2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peirce |first=Jonathan W. |date=15 May 2007 |title=PsychoPy—Psychophysics software in Python |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=162 |issue=1-2 |pages=8-13 |doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.11.017 |doi-access=free |pmid=17254636 |pmc=2018741 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027006005772 |via=ScienceDirect }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychopy2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peirce |first=Jonathan W. |date=15 January 2009 |title=Generating stimuli for neuroscience using PsychoPy |journal=Frontiers in Neuroinformatics |volume=2 |page=10 |doi=10.3389/neuro.11.010.2008 |doi-access=free |pmid=19198666 |pmc=2636899 |url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.11.010.2008/full |via=Frontiers Media }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most packages it provides users with a choice of interface; generate experiments by writing Python scripts or through a graphical interface which will generate a script for them (or by a combination of the two).

Its platform independence is achieved through the use of the [[wxPython]] widget library for the application and [[OpenGL]] for graphics calls. Psychopy grows in popularity and was started on more than 14,000 different computers in November, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce [http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php "'PsychoPy usage"], ''PsychoPy usage'', accessed January 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and versions==
PsychoPy is continually updated with 5-10 releases each year, containing new features and bug fixes. Here are some major releases in the history of PsychoPy:

*2002: PsychoPy was originally written by Peirce as a proof of concept - that a high-level scripting language could generate experimental stimuli in real time (existing solutions, such as Psychtoolbox, had to pre-generate movies or use CLUT animation techniques). The project was initially registered on sourceforge.net under the name "psychpy" on 14 March 2002.
*2003-2005: this was extended to be able to generate experiments in the author's lab at Nottingham University and made available as an open source project on the internet. At this time PsychoPy was a library (Python package) that could be imported by Python scripts. Installing was complex because of the dependencies.
*2006: An editor was added, so that users could use PsychoPy as an 'application' rather than a library
*April 2009: '''Version 1.0''' released, including all main features of the library (but with some bugs in the win32 installer)
*September 2009: '''Version 1.50''' released, including various bug fixes to the underlying library and preview of new GUI interface, to become PsychoPy2. This new interface, the ''Builder'' view, allowed users to generate a very wide range of experiments without a knowledge of programming.
*April 2011: Used for both research and undergraduate teaching at various universities. Over 1500 users per month worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce [http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php "'PsychoPy usage"], ''PsychoPy usage'', accessed April 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Still at '''Version 1.64''' (not yet v2.00), due to remaining issues especially with the Builder interface.
*June 2013: '''Version 1.77''' released, including ioHub for faster (asynchronous) polling of hardware.
*September 2014: '''Version 1.81''' released, including the ability to specify psychopy version in the experiment. Psychopy will then load this version, regardless of the version installed - also future versions.
*October 2015: '''Version 1.83''' released, including MovieStim3 which provides robust movie playback.
*March 2018: '''Version 1.90''' released, first version with Python 3 support.

==Key people==
There have been many contributors to the project. A complete list of contributors to the code can be found at https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/graphs/contributors.

'''''Receptaculites''''' is the name-bearing genus for an extinct group of conspicuous benthic marine genera, the [[Receptaculitidae]], that lived from the Early [[Ordovician]] through the [[Permian]] period, peaking in the Middle Ordovician. The group's phylogenetic origin has long been obscure, but the current understanding is that the Receptaculitidae were calcareous algae, probably of the Order [[Dasycladales]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;Byrnes, J.G. 1968.

''Receptaculites'' and its relatives have a double-spiral, radiating pattern of [[rhombus]]-shaped plates supported by spindle-like objects called meroms.  Fossils can usually be identified by the intersecting patterns of clockwise and counterclockwise rows of plates or stalk spaces, superficially similar to the arrangement of disk [[floret]]s on a [[sunflower]]—hence the common name "sunflower coral" (''sic'').

This includes violence against religious institutions, people, objects, or events when the violence is motivated to some degree by some religious aspect of the target or by the precepts of the attacker. Religious violence does not refer exclusively to acts committed by religious groups, but includes acts committed by secular groups against religious groups.

Violence is a very broad concept and it is also difficult to define since it can be used against non-human objects.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Furthermore, the term can denote a wide variety of experiences such as blood shedding, physical harm, forcing against personal freedom, passionate conduct or language, or emotions such as fury and passion.&lt;ref name="Ralph Tanner" /&gt;

Religion is a complex and problematic concept.&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; It is a modern western-compartmentalized concept that was not found anywhere before the 1500s and despite it being recently invented, there is no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; In general, religion is conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines, and sacred places even though the ancient cultures that wrote Holy Scriptures (e.g. Bible, Quran, etc) did not have such a concept in their holy scriptures, language, or history.&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have shown that the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs, is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent just like in all other domains of culture and life.&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, religious violence is perpetrated for a wide variety of [[ideology|ideological]] reasons and is generally only one of the contributing social and political factors that leads to unrest.

Studies of supposed cases of religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities rather than by religious worldviews.&lt;ref name="Omar"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|page=1|ref=Omar Peacemaking|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, scholars have questioned the very concept of "religious violence" and the extent to which religious, political, [[War#Economic|economic]], or [[ethnic conflict|ethnic]] aspects of a conflict are even meaningful.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Religious Violence|first=William|last=Cavanaugh |publisher=Oxford University Press US,|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observe that the very concept of "religion" is a modern invention and not something that is universal across cultures or historical and thereby makes "religious violence" a myth.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; Since all cases of violence and war include social, political, and economic dimensions and since there is no consensus on definitions of "religion" among scholars and no way to isolate "religion" from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions, it is incorrect to label any violent event as "religious".&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=39–44|chapter=Myth 8.

==History of the concept of religion==
{{main|Definition of religion}}

Religion is a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of religion is not found anywhere before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; Furthermore, parallel concepts are not found in many cultures and there is no equivalent term for "religion" in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2002). 'Sociological Definitions, Language Games and the "Essence" of Religion'. Method &amp; theory in the study of religion, vol 14, no. 1, pp. 61–83. [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Jason Ānanda. (2012) ''The Invention of Religion in Japan.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; and others rejecting the term entirely.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;Daniel Dubuisson, ''The Western Construction of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

The modern concept of "religion" as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of [[Christendom]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and more prevalent [[colonization]] or [[globalization]] in the [[Age of Discovery|age of exploration]] which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=022618448X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521892937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient sacred texts like the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]] did not have a concept of religion in their original languages and neither did their authors or the cultures to which they belonged.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt;
It was in the 19th century that the terms "[[Buddhism]]", "[[Hinduism]]", "[[Taoism]]", and "[[Confucianism]]" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Josephson |first1=Jason Ananda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no precise equivalent of "religion" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Judaism]] does not draw clear distinctions between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit, Abraham J. Edelheit,  [https://www.questia.com/library/book/history-of-zionism-a-handbook-and-dictionary-by-abfaham-j-edelheit-hershel-edelheit.jsp History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary], p.3, citing [[Solomon Zeitlin]], ''The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion?'' (Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of violence==

Violence is difficult to define because the term is a "thick concept" in that it broadly carries a descriptive and evaluative components which ranges from harming non-human objects to human self-harm.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Ralph Tanner cites the definition of violence in the Oxford English Dictionary as "far beyond (the infliction of) pain and the shedding of blood." He argues that, although violence clearly encompasses injury to persons or property, it also includes "the forcible interference with personal freedom, violent or passionate conduct or language (and) finally passion or fury."&lt;ref name="Ralph Tanner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Violence and Religion: Cross-cultural Opinions and Consequences |author= Ralph E.S. Tanner|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=2007 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xQXYpfe0cYC&amp;pg=PA5 |isbn= 9788180693762}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, Abhijit Nayak writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word "violence" can be defined to extend far beyond pain and shedding blood. It carries the meaning of physical force, violent language, fury, and, more importantly, forcible interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Review of Mission |first=Abhijit |last=Nayak |title=Crusade Violence: Understanding and Overcoming the Impact of Mission Among Muslims |volume=97|issue=386–387|pages=273–291 |date=July–October 2008|publisher=World Council of Churches |doi=10.1111/j.1758-6631.2008.tb00645.x |accessdate=2010-11-23 |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-10493656/Crusade-violence-understanding-and-overcoming.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Terence Fretheim writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others. In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://www2.luthersem.edu/word&amp;world/Archives/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relationships between religion and violence==

Charles Selengut characterizes the phrase "religion and violence" as "jarring," asserting that "religion is thought to be opposed to violence and a force for peace and reconciliation. He acknowledges, however, that "the history and scriptures of the world's religions tell stories of violence and war even as they speak of peace and love."&lt;ref name=Selengut&gt;{{cite book |title=Sacred fury: understanding religious violence |first=Charles |last=Selengut|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mOqtEkGlq0cC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22sectarian+violence%22+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sectarian%20violence%22%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7425-6084-0 |date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matthew Rowley, three hundred contributing causes of religious violence have been discussed by some scholars, however he notes that "violence in the name of God is a complex phenomenon and oversimplification further jeopardizes peace because it obscures many of the causal factors."&lt;ref name=Rowley1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowley|first1=Matthew|title=What Causes Religious Violence?|journal=Journal of Religion and Violence|date=2014|volume=2|issue=3|pages=361–402|doi=10.5840/jrv20153234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another piece, Matthew Rowley notes 15 ways to address the complexity of violence, both secular and religious, and notes that secular narratives of religious violence tend to be erroneous or exaggerated due to over simplification of religious people, their beliefs, thinking in false dichotomies, and ignoring complex secular causes of supposed "religious violence". He also notes that when discussing religious violence, one should also note that the overwhelming majority of religious people do not get inspired to engage in violence.&lt;ref name=Rowley2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowley|first1=Matthew|title=How Should We Respond to Religious Violence? Fifteen Ways To Critique Our Own Thoughts|journal=Ethics in Brief|date=2015|volume=21|issue=2|url=http://www.klice.co.uk/uploads/Ethics%20in%20Brief/EiB_Rowley_21_2_WEB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph Tanner similarly describes the combination of religion and violence as "uncomfortable", asserting that religious thinkers generally avoid the conjunction of the two and argue that religious violence is "only valid in certain circumstances which are invariably one-sided".&lt;ref name=Tanner2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence and religion: cross-cultural opinions and consequences|first= Ralph E. S. |last=Tanner |publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2007 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xQXYpfe0cYC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Christianity+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false|isbn= 9788180693762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Jerryson argues that scholarship on religion and violence sometimes overlook non-Abrahamic religions. This tendency provides considerable problems, one of which is the support of faulty associations. For example, he finds a persistent global pattern to align religious like Islam as a cause for violence and others like Buddhism as an explanation of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerryson|first=Michael|date=2015-05-06|title=Buddhists and Violence: Historical Continuity/Academic Incongruity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/rec3.12152/full|journal=Religion Compass|volume=9|issue=5|pages=141–150, 141|doi=10.1111/rec3.12152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many instances of political violence, religion tends to play a central role. This is especially true of [[terrorism]], which sees violence committed against unarmed noncombatants in order to inspire fear and achieve some political goal. Terrorism expert [[Martha Crenshaw]] suggests that religion is just a mask used by political movements to draw support. Crenshaw outlines two approaches in observing religious violence to view the underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Martha|date=1987-12-01|title=Theories of terrorism: Instrumental and organizational approaches|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402398708437313|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|volume=10|issue=4|pages=13–31|doi=10.1080/01402398708437313|issn=0140-2390}}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach, called the instrumental approach, sees religious violence as acting as a rational calculation to achieve some political end. Increasing the costs of performing such violence will help curb it. Crenshaw’s alternate approach sees religious violence stemming from the organizational structure of religious communities, with the heads of these communities acting as political figureheads. Crenshaw suggests that threatening the internal stability of these organizations (perhaps by offering a nonviolent alternative) will dissuade religious organizations from performing political violence. A third approach sees religious violence as a result of community dynamics rather than religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv-jBRlsSlcC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Terrorism+a+Communitarian+Approach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=knMnTfXJbo&amp;sig=YZBNEWvwT7EAAkUMjcC2xgK-wp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie1ZymlpzUAhWEOCYKHTBGCyYQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrorism%20a%20Communitarian%20Approach&amp;f=false|title=Building Terrorism Resistant Communities: Together Against Terrorism|last=Ekici|first=S.|last2=Ekici|first2=A.|date=2009|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=9781607500063|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symbolic interactionism|Systems of meanings]] developed within these communities allow for religious interpretation to justify violence, and so acts like terrorism happen because people are part of communities of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Terror_in_the_Mind_of_God.html?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520240117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, religious violence and terrorism are performances designed to inspire an emotional reaction from both those in the community and those outside of it.

While religion can be used as a means of rallying support for violence, religious leaders regularly denounce such manipulations as contrary to the teachings of their belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict apologises for Christian violence through the ages after condemning terrorism in the name of religion |author= Ralph E.S.

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that religions create violence over four scarce resources: access to divine will, knowledge, primarily through scripture; sacred space; group privileging; and salvation. Not all religions have or use these four resources.

==Challenges to the views that religions are violent ==

===Behavioral studies===

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent, as in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt;

===Myth of religious violence===

Others such as William Cavanaugh have argued that it is unreasonable to attempt to differentiate "religious violence" and "secular violence" as separate categories. Cavanaugh asserts that "the idea that religion has a tendency to promote violence is part of the conventional wisdom of Western societies and it underlies many of our institutions and policies, from limits on the public role of churches to efforts to promote liberal democracy in the Middle East." Cavanaugh challenges this conventional wisdom, arguing that there is a "myth of religious violence", basing his argument on the assertion that "attempts to separate religious and secular violence are incoherent".
&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Religious Violence|first=William|last=Cavanaugh |publisher=Oxford University Press US,|year=2009 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cavanaugh asserts:

* Religion is not a universal and transhistorical phenomenon. What counts as "religious" or "secular" in any context is a function of configurations of power both in the West and lands colonized by the West. The distinctions of "Religious/Secular" and "Religious/Political" are modern Western inventions.
* The invention of the concept of "religious violence" helps the West reinforce superiority of Western social orders to "nonsecular" social orders, namely Muslims at the time of publication.
* The concept of "religious violence" can be and is used to legitimate violence against non-Western "Others".
* Peace depends on a balanced view of violence and recognition that so-called secular ideologies and institutions can be just as prone to absolutism, divisiveness, and irrationality.

John Morreall and Tamara Sonn have argued that all cases of violence and war include social, political, and economic dimensions. Since there is no consensus on definitions of "religion" among scholars and no way to isolate "religion" from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions, it is incorrect to label any violent event as "religious".&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; They note that since dozens of examples exist from the [[European wars of religion]] that show that people from the same religions fought each other and that people from different religions became allies during these conflicts, the motivations for these conflicts were not about religion.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; Jeffrey Burton Russell has argued that the fact that these wars of religion ended after rulers agreed to practice their religions in their own territories, means that the conflicts were more related to political control than about people's religious views.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Russell" /&gt;

According to Karen Armstrong, so-called religious conflicts such as the Crusades, Spanish Inquisition, and the European wars of religion, were all deeply political conflicts at the core, not religious ones. Especially since people from different faiths constantly became allies and fought each other in no consistent fashion. She notes that the Western concept of separation of church and state, which was advocated first by the Reformer Martin Luther, laid a foundation for viewing society as divided when in reality religion and society were intermixed to the point that no one made such distinction nor was there a defining cut between such experiences in the past. During the Enlightenment, religion began to be seen as an individualistic and private thing and that modern secular ideals like equality of all human beings, intellectual and political liberty were things that were historically promoted in a religious idiom in the past.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Myth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=The Myth of Religious Violence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-karen-armstrong-religious-violence-myth-secular|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;          

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that " virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History|year=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History|year=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he argues that religion "may be more a marker of the [conflicting] groups than an actual point of contention between them".&lt;ref name="Anthropology of Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Introducing Anthropology of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-40896-7|quote=When a pure or hybrid religious group and/or its interests are threatened, or merely blocked from achieving its interests by another group, conflict and violence may ensue. In such cases, although religion is part of the issue and religious groups form the competitors, or combatants, it would be simplistic or wrong to assume the religion is the "cause" of the trouble or that the parties are "fighting about religion". Religion in the circumstances may be more a marker of the groups than an actual point of contention between them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John Teehan takes a position that integrates the two opposing sides of this debate. He describes the traditional response in defense of religion as "draw(ing) a distinction between the religion and what is done in the name of that religion or its faithful." Teehan argues, "this approach to religious violence may be understandable but it is ultimately untenable and prevents us from gaining any useful insight into either religion or religious violence." He takes the position that "violence done in the name of religion is not a perversion of religious belief... but flows naturally from the moral logic inherent in many religious systems, particularly monotheistic religions...." However, Teehan acknowledges that "religions are also powerful sources of morality." He asserts, "religious morality and religious violence both spring from the same source, and this is the evolutionary psychology underlying religious ethics."&lt;ref name=Teehan&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Teehan |title=In the Name of God: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Ethics and Violence |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2010 |pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as [[Jonathan Kirsch]] have made links between the European inquisitions, for example, and Stalin's persecutions in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, McCarthy blacklists, and other secular events as being the same type of phenomenon as the inquisitions.&lt;ref name="Grand Inquisitor's Manual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=Jonathan|title=The Grand Inquisitor's Manual: A History of Terror in the Name of God|year=2009|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0-06-173276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Robert Pape]], a political scientist who specializes in suicide terrorism, have made a case for secular motivations and reasons as being foundations of most suicide attacks that are oftentimes labeled as "religious".&lt;ref name="Dying to Win"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pape|first=Robert|title=Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-7338-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pape compiled the first complete database of every documented suicide bombing during 1980–2003. He argues that the news reports about [[suicide attack]]s are profoundly misleading &amp;mdash; "There is little connection between [[suicide terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or any one of the world's religions". After studying 315 suicide attacks carried out over the last two decades, he concludes that suicide bombers' actions stem fundamentally from political conflict, not religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pape|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secularism as a response==

Byron Bland asserts that one of the most prominent reasons for the "rise of the secular in Western thought" was the reaction against the religious violence of the 16th and 17th centuries. He asserts that "(t)he secular was a way of living with the religious differences that had produced so much horror. Under secularity, political entities have a warrant to make decisions independent from the need to enforce particular versions of religious orthodoxy. Indeed, they may run counter to certain strongly held beliefs if made in the interest of common welfare. Thus, one of the important goals of the secular is to limit violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Byron |last=Bland |title=Evil Enemies: The Convergence of Religion and Politics |url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |date=May 2003 |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202011617/http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William T. Cavanaugh]] writes that what he calls "the myth of religious violence" as a reason for the rise of secular states may be traced to earlier philosophers, such as Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/historically_speaking/summary/v012/12.2.yerxa.html Interview with William Cavanaugh]&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh delivers a detailed critique of this idea in his 2009 book ''The Myth of Religious Violence: Secular Ideology and the Roots of Modern Conflict''.

==Secular violence==

===Religion and secular===

According to John Carlson, excessive attention is often paid to acts of religious violence compared to acts of secular violence that do occur. This leads to a false essetializing of both religion as being prone to violence and the secular as being prone to peace, despite the abundant examples of secular violence that have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlson |first1=John |editor1-last=Murphy |editor1-first=Andrew |title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1405191317 |page=12 |chapter=1.

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that, because religions claim divine favor for themselves, over and against other groups, this sense of righteousness leads to violence because conflicting claims to superiority, based on unverifiable appeals to God, cannot be adjudicated objectively.&lt;ref name=FightingWords /&gt;

Similarly, Eric Hickey writes, "the history of religious violence in the West is as long as the historical record of its three major religions, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], with their involved mutual antagonisms and their struggles to adapt and survive the secular forces that threaten their continued existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of murder and violent crime |first=Eric W. |last=Hickey |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |page=217 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dDOW75aJMR8C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=Judaism+Christianity+Islam+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20Christianity%20Islam%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7619-2437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regina Schwartz]] argues that all [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]], including Christianity, are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those who are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz /&gt; Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn't just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy, but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wechsler|first=Lawrence|title=Mayhem and Monotheism|url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720030355/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Feiler]] writes that "Jews and Christians who smugly console themselves by claiming that Islam is the only violent religion are willfully ignoring their past. Nowhere is the struggle between faith and violence described more vividly, and with more stomach-turning details of ruthlessness, than in the [[Hebrew Bible]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where God was born: a journey by land to the roots of religion |first=Bruce S. |last=Feiler |publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aBVoWhUs-HoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Judaism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780060574871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tom O'Golo declares that religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] who use violence to further their cause contravene the root truth of all faiths:
{{quote|A genuine fundamentalist is also a radical, someone who tries to get the root of the matter. A major weakness of many or perhaps of most radicals is not that they don't dig, but that they don't dig deep enough. Consequently many fundamentalists end up defending or acting upon beliefs which are not really at the heart of their doctrine. For example any religious fundamentalist who harms others in the pursuit of his or her radicalism is strictly out of order because no true religion ever encounters anything but love, tolerance and understanding. 'Thou shalt not kill' is at the heart of all genuine faiths, certainly the three based upon [[Abraham]] and [[God]]. That trio comprehensively condemns intentional harm to others (and to the self as well) for what ever reason. Dying to protect one's faith is acceptable; killing to promote it isn't. Arguably, it is blasphemous to say that God needs an earthly army to fight Its battles, or perform Its revenge. God is quite capable of fighting His own battles.&lt;ref name=Golo&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ? No! Jesus?

Christianity: From Peacemaking to Violence to Home Again}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] developed a "Just War" concept, whereby limited uses of war would be considered acceptable in order to preserve the peace and retain orthodoxy if it was waged: for defensive purposes, ordered by an authority, had honorable intentions, and produced minimal harm. However, the criteria he used was already developed by Roman thinkers in the past and "Augustine's perspective was not based on the [[New Testament]]."&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt; St. Augustine's "Just War" concept was widely accepted, however, warfare was not regarded as virtuous in any way.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; Expression of concern for the salvation of those who killed enemies in battle, regardless of the cause for which they fought, was common.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] which began after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], there were increases in the level of violence due to political instability. By the 11th century, the Church condemned this violence and warring by introducing: the "Peace of God" which prohibited attacks on clergy, pilgrims, townspeople, peasants and property; the "Truce of God" which banned warfare on [[Sunday]]s, [[Friday]]s, [[Lent]], and [[Easter]]; and it imposed heavy penances on soldiers for killing and injuring others because it believed that the shedding of other people's blood was the same as shedding the blood of Christ.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt;
         
During the 9th and 10th centuries, multiple invasions occurred in some regions in Europe and these invasions lead them to form their own armies in order to defend themselves and by the 11th century, this slowly lead to the emergence of the Crusades, the concept of "holy war", and terminology such as "enemies of God".&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; By the time of the Crusades, "Despite all the violence during this period, the majority of Christians were not active participants but were more often its victims" and groups like the [[Franciscans]] were established which used nonviolent means to peacefully dialogue with Muslims.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt;

Today the relationship between [[Christianity and violence]] is the subject of controversy because one view advocates the belief that Christianity advocates peace, love and compassion while it has also resorted to violence in certain instances.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=FightingWords&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CKaCWCDIKWsC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Christianity+and+violence%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Christianity%20and%20violence%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon|chapter=Christianity and Violence|first=Miroslav|last=Volf|authorlink=Miroslav Volf|title=War in the Bible and terrorism in the twenty-first century |editor1-first=Richard S.|editor1-last=Hess|editor2-first=E.A.|editor2-last=Martens|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2008|isbn=978-1-57506-803-9|pages=1&amp;ndash;17|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching. However, Christians have struggled since the days of the [[Church fathers]] with the question of when the use of force is justified (e.g. the [[Just war theory]] of Saint Augustine). Such debates have led to concepts such as just war theory. Throughout history, certain teachings from the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]] and [[Christian theology]] have been used to justify the use of force against [[heretics]], [[sinners]] and external enemies. Heitman and Hagan identify the [[Inquisitions]], [[Crusades]], wars of religion, and [[antisemitism]] as being "among the most notorious examples of Christian violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International encyclopedia of violence research, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sMNbcU7UnywC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=Christianity+antisemitism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=9781402014666}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this list, [[Mennonite]] theologian J. Denny Weaver adds "warrior popes, support of [[capital punishment]], [[corporal punishment]] under the guise of 'spare the rod spoil the child,' [[Christianity and slavery|justifications of slavery]], world-wide [[colonialism]] under the guise of converting people to Christianity, the systemic violence against women who are subjected to the rule of men".{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2011}} Weaver employs a broader definition of violence that extends the meaning of the word to cover "harm or damage", not just physical violence per se. Thus, under his definition, Christian violence includes "forms of systemic violence such as [[poverty]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]]".&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J. Denny Weaver |quote=I am using broad definitions of the terms "violence" and "nonviolence". "Violence" means harm or damage, which obviously includes the direct violence of killing -- in war, capital punishment, murder --but also covers the range of forms of systemic violence such as poverty, racism, and sexism. "Nonviolence" also covers a spectrum of attitudes and actions, from the classic Mennonite idea of passive nonresistance through active nonviolence and nonviolent resistance that would include various kinds of social action, confrontations and the posing of alternatives that do not cause bodily harm or injury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians point to a strong [[doctrinal]] and historical imperative against violence that exists within Christianity, particularly [[Jesus]]' [[Sermon on the Mount]], which taught nonviolence and "love of enemies". For example, Weaver asserts that Jesus' pacifism was "preserved in the justifiable war doctrine which declares that all war is sin even when it is occasionally declared to be a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of [[Christian pacifism]]".&lt;ref name=Weaver2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J.

Many authors highlight the ironical contradiction between Christianity's claims to be centered on "love and peace" while, at the same time, harboring a "violent side". For example, [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] argues: "that despite its central tenets of love and peace, Christianity&amp;mdash;like most traditions&amp;mdash;has always had a violent side. The bloody history of the tradition has provided images as disturbing as those provided by [[Islam]] or [[Sikhism]], and violent conflict is vividly portrayed in the Bible. This history and these biblical images have provided the raw material for theologically justifying the violence of contemporary Christian groups. For example, attacks on abortion clinics have been viewed not only as assaults on a practice that Christians regard as immoral, but also as skirmishes in a grand confrontation between forces of evil and good that has social and political implications.",&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24011-1|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} sometimes referred to as [[spiritual warfare]]. The statement attributed to Jesus "I come not to bring peace, [[but to bring a sword]]" has been interpreted by some as a call to arms to Christians.&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;

[[Maurice Bloch]] also argues that Christian faith fosters violence because Christian faith is a religion, and religions are by their very nature violent; moreover, he argues that religion and politics are two sides of the same coin&amp;mdash;power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=Maurice|year=1992 |title=Prey into Hunter. The Politics of Religious Experience. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that religion and the exercise of force are deeply intertwined, but that religion may pacify, as well as channel and heighten violent impulses &lt;ref&gt;Andrew McKinnon.

In response to criticism that Christianity and violence are intertwined, Christian apologists such as Miroslav Volf and J. Denny Weaver reject charges that Christianity is a violent religion, arguing that certain aspects of Christianity might be misused to support violence but that a genuine interpretation of its core elements would not sanction human violence but would instead resist it. Among the examples that are commonly used to argue that Christianity is a violent religion, J. Denny Weaver lists "(the) crusades, the multiple blessings of wars, warrior popes, support for capital punishment, corporal punishment under the guise of 'spare the rod and spoil the child,' justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men". Weaver characterizes the counter-argument as focusing on "Jesus, the beginning point of Christian faith,... whose Sermon on the Mount taught nonviolence and love of enemies,; who faced his accusers nonviolent death;whose nonviolent teaching inspired the first centuries of pacifist Christian history and was subsequently preserved in the justifiable war doctrine that declares all war as sin even when declaring it occasionally a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of Christian pacifism."&lt;ref name=Weaver /&gt;

[[Miroslav Volf]] acknowledges that "many contemporaries see religion as a pernicious social ill that needs aggressive treatment rather than a medicine from which cure is expected." However, Volf contests this claim that "(the) Christian faith, as one of the major world religions, predominantly fosters violence." Instead of this negative assessment, Volf argues that Christianity "should be seen as a contributor to more peaceful social environments".&lt;ref name=BoardmanLecture&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=boardman|title=Christianity and Violence |first=Miroslav |last=Volf |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volf examines the question of whether Christianity fosters violence, and has identified four main arguments that it does: that religion by its nature is violent, which occurs when people try to act as "soldiers of God"; that monotheism entails violence, because a claim of universal truth divides people into "us versus them"; that creation, as in the [[Book of Genesis]], is an act of violence; and that the intervention of a "new creation", as in the [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]], generates violence.&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence /&gt; Writing about the latter, Volf says: "Beginning at least with Constantine's conversion, the followers of the Crucified have perpetrated gruesome acts of violence under the sign of the cross. Over the centuries, the seasons of Lent and Holy Week were, for the Jews, times of fear and trepidation; Christians have perpetrated some of the worst pogroms as they remembered the crucifixion of Christ, for which they blamed the Jews. Muslims also associate the cross with violence; crusaders' rampages were undertaken under the sign of the cross."&lt;ref name="Volf 2008 13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Volf|2008|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, Volf concluded that the Christian faith was misused in justifying violence. Volf argues that "thin" readings of Christianity might be used mischievously to support the use of violence. He counters, however, by asserting that "thick" readings of Christianity's core elements will not sanction human violence and would, in fact, resist it.&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence2&gt;{{cite web|first=Miroslav |last=Volf |url=

Volf asserts that Christian churches suffer from a "confusion of loyalties". He asserts that "rather than the character of the Christian faith itself, a better explanation of why Christian churches are either impotent in the face of violent conflicts or actively participate in them derives from the proclivities of its adherents which are at odds with the character of the Christian faith." Volf observes that "(although) explicitly giving ultimate allegiance to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, many Christians in fact seem to have an overriding commitment to their respective cultures and ethnic groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Social Meaning of Reconciliation |first=Miroslav |last=Volf|url=http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Volf_The%20Social_June%201998.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism====
{{Main|Mormonism and violence}}

[[Mormonism]] had an early history of violence. This began with religious persecution on the Mormons by well respected citizens, law enforcement, and government officials. Ultimately such persecution lead to several historically well-known acts of violence. These range from attacks on early Mormons, such as the [[Haun's Mill massacre]] following the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|Mormon Extermination Order]] to one of the most controversial and well-known cases of retaliation violence, the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. This was the result of an unprovoked response to religious persecution whereby an innocent party traveling through Mormon occupied territory was attacked on September 11, 1857.

[[File:HamidianSassounmassacres.jpg|thumb|240px|Sketch by an eye-witness of the [[Hamidian massacres|massacre of Armenians]] in Sasun in 1894]]

[[Islam]] has been associated with violence in a variety of contexts, especially in the context of [[Jihad]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word ''jihād'' translates into English as "struggle". Jihad appears in the Qur'an and frequently in the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of [[Allah]] ''(al-jihad fi sabil Allah)''".&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=[[Wendy Doniger]] | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] | year=1999 |isbn=0-87779-044-2}},''Jihad'', p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIC"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=[[Josef W. Meri]] | encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-96690-6}}, ''Jihad'', p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the word can be seen in its usage in Arabic translations of the New Testament such as in 2 Timothy 4:7 where St. Paul expresses keeping the faith after many struggles.&lt;ref name="Omar Islam" /&gt; A person engaged in jihad is called a ''[[mujahid]]''; the plural is [[mujahideen]]. Jihad is an important religious duty for Muslims. A minority among the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni scholars]] sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth [[Five Pillars of Islam|pillar of Islam]], though it occupies no such official status.&lt;ref name="jih"&gt;[[John Esposito]](2005), ''Islam: The Straight Path,'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a Islam]], however, Jihad is one of the ten [[Practices of the Religion]].
For some the Quran seem to endorse unequivocally to violence.&lt;ref name="Who Are the Moderate Muslims"&gt;Sam Harris [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/who-are-the-moderate-musl_b_15841.html Who Are the Moderate Muslims?]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some scholars argue that such verses of the Quran are interpreted out of context.&lt;ref&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Quran that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime."{{cite web |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from Gallup, most Muslims understand the word "Jihad" to mean individual struggle, not something violent or militaristic.&lt;ref name="Omar Islam"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Omar|first1=Irfan|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=MIchael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|chapter=1.

Islam has a history of nonviolence and negotiation when dealing with conflicts. For instance, early Muslims experienced 83 conflicts with non-Muslims and only 4 of these ended up in armed conflict.&lt;ref name="Omar Islam" /&gt;

The tension reached a climax on [[September 11th, 2001]] when Islamic terrorists flew hijacked commercial airplanes into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The “[[War on Terror]]” has triggered [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim sentiments]] within [[Christendom]] and throughout the rest of the world. [[Al-Qaeda]] is one of the most well known Islamic extremist groups, created by [[Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden]]. Al-Qaeda's goal is to spread the “purest” form of Islam and [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Based on his interpretation of the Quran, bin Laden needed to do “good” by inflicting terror upon millions of people. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, bin Laden praised the suicide bombers in his [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/binladentext_121301.html statement]: ''“the great action you did which was first and foremost by the grace of [[Allah]].

Controversies surrounding the subject include disagreements over whether terrorist acts are self-defense or aggression, national self-determination or Islamic supremacy; whether Islam can ever condone the targeting of non-combatants; whether some attacks described as Islamic terrorism are merely terrorist acts committed by Muslims or terrorist acts motivated by nationalism; whether [[Zionism]] and the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]] are at the root of Islamic terrorism, or simply one cause of it; how much support for Islamic terrorism exists in the Muslim world&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair, "Speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council", {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9948.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815061152/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9948.asp |archivedate=2006-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether support of terrorism is only a temporary phenomenon, a "bubble", now fading away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Third Bubble |author=Thomas L.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and violence}}

Burggraeve and Vervenne describe the Old Testament as full of violence and as evidence of both a violent society and a violent god. They write that, "(i)n numerous Old Testament texts the power and glory of Israel's God is described in the language of violence." They assert that more than one thousand passages refer to [[Yahweh|YHWH]] as acting violently or supporting the violence of humans and that more than one hundred passages involve divine commands to kill humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords into plowshares: theological reflections on peace |first1=Roger |last1=Burggraeve|first2=Marc |last2=Vervenne |publisher=Peeters Publishers |year=1991 |pages=82,109 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8KvY0W58eYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22violent+God%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22violent%20God%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9789068313727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of these passages in the [[Old Testament]], some Christian churches and theologians argue that Judaism is a violent religion and that the god of Israel is a violent god. Reuven Firestone asserts that these assertions are usually made in the context of claims that Christianity is a religion of peace and that the god of Christianity is one who only expresses love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond violence: religious sources of social transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |editor=Heft, James |publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rxiINuHNAIUC&amp;pg=PT96&amp;dq=Judaism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780823223350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars such as Deborah Weissman readily acknowledge that "normative Judaism is not pacifist" and that "violence is condoned in the service of self-defense."However, the Talmud prohibits violence of any kind towards one's neighbour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Co-existence of Violence and Non-Violence in Judaism|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd39-07.html |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Patout Burns asserts that, although Judaism condones the use of violence in certain cases, Jewish tradition clearly posits the principle of minimization of violence. This principle can be stated as "(wherever) Jewish law allows violence to keep an evil from occurring, it mandates that the minimal amount of violence must be used in order to accomplish one's goal." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War and its discontents: pacifism and quietism in the Abrahamic traditions |first=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; because the [[Torah]] states that the Israelites annihilated entire ethnic groups or tribes: the Israelites killed all Amalekites, including men, women, and children ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A1-20&amp;version=NIV 1 Samuel 15:1–20]); the Israelites killed all men, women, and children in [[The Battle of Jericho|the battle of Jericho]]([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+6%3A15-21&amp;version=NIV Joshua 6:15–21]), and the Israelites killed all men, women and children of several Canaanite tribes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+10%3A28-42&amp;version=NIV Joshua 10:28–42]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies'',  Donald Bloxham, A. Dirk Moses, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}} believe that these accounts in the Torah are exaggerated or metaphorical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Zionism|Zionist]] leaders sometimes used religious references as a justification for the violent treatment of [[Arabs]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;
Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007) "Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War" in ''Israel and the Palestinian refugees'', Eyal Benvenistî, Chaim Gans, Sari Hanafi (Eds.), Springer, p. 78:
:".. the Zionist movement, which claims to be secular, found it necessary to embrace the idea of 'the promised land' of Old Testament prophecy, to justify the confiscation of land and the expulsion of the [[Palestinians]]. For example, the speeches and letters of [[Chaim Weizman]], the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' ... describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found ...' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder. And were not the enemies of Zionism thieves, who wanted to steal from the Jews what God had granted them?' ''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl. S. Ehrlich (1999) "Joshua, Judaism, and Genocide", in ''Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century'', Judit Targarona Borrás, Ángel Sáenz-Badillos (Eds). 1999, Brill. pp. 117–124.
&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Palestinians have been associated with Biblical antagonists, the Amalekites. For example, [[Rabbi]] [[Israel Hess]] has recommended that Palestinians be killed, based on biblical verses such as 1 Samuel 15.&lt;ref&gt;

"Frequently Jewish fundamentalists refer to the Palestinians as the 'Amalekites' ... of today.... According to the Old Testament, the Amalek ... were regarded as the Israelites' inveterate foe, whose 'annihilation' became a sacred duty and against whom war should be waged until their 'memory be blotted out' forever (Ex 17:16; Deut 25:17–19).... Some of the [modern] political messianics insist on giving the biblical commandment to 'blot out the memory of the Amalek' an actual contemporary relevance in the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. In February 1980, Rabbi [[Israel Hess]] ... published an article [titled] 'The Genocide Commandment in the Torah' ... which ends with the following: 'The day is not far when we shall all be called to this holy war, this commandment of the annihilation of the Amalek'. Hess quotes the biblical commandment ... 'Do not spare him, but kill man and woman, baby and suckling, ox and sheep, camel, and donkey'.... In his book ''On the Lord's Side'' Danny Rubinstein has shown that this notion permeates the [[Gush Emunim]] movement's bulletins [one of which] carried an article ... which reads 'In every generation there is an Amalek.... The Amalekism of our generation finds expression in the deep Arab hatred towards our national revival ...'... Professor Uriel Tal ... conducted his study in the early 1980s ... and pointed out that the totalitarian political messianic stream refers to the Palestinian Arabs in three stages or degrees: ... [stage] (3) the implementation of the commandment of Amalek, as expressed in Rabbi Hess's article 'The Commandment of Genocide in the Torah', in other words 'annihilating' the Palestinian Arabs'"}}

=== Neo-paganism ===
In the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], [[Modern Paganism|neo-pagan beliefs]] have been associated with many terrorist incidents. Although the majority of neo-pagans oppose violence and [[racism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Racial issues|folkish factions of Odinism, Wotanism, and Ásatrú]] emphasize their Nordic cultural heritage and warrior idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odin.org/faq.html|title=odin.org (Wodanesdag Press)|website=odin.org|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, a 1999 [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] report on domestic terrorism titled [[Project Megiddo]] described Odinism as “[lending] itself to violence and [having] the potential to inspire its followers to violence”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3578/www.fbi.gov/library/megiddo/megiddo.pdf|title=Megiddo Report|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigations|date=1999|website=United States Government Publishing Office|accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has recognized at least two active neo-pagan [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups|hate groups]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/active-hate-groups-2016|title=ACTIVE HATE GROUPS 2016|last=|first=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[White supremacy|whhite supremacists]] (especially those in prison) are converting to Odinism at increasing rates, citing the impurity of Christianity and the failure of previous groups to accomplish goals as the primary reasons for their conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/07/24/viking-mythology-grows-as-religion-for-inmates.html|title=Viking Mythology Grows As Religion for Inmates|date=2006-07-24|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/the-new-religion-of-choice-for-white-supremacists-8af2a69a3440|title=The New Religion Of Choice For White Supremacists – ThinkProgress|date=2015-11-13|work=ThinkProgress|accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between Odinism and other extremist groups such as [[Christian Identity]] facilitate conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfBwCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;ots=ZHt9gJa754&amp;dq=1999%20fbi%20domestic%20terrorism%20odin&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q=1999%20fbi%20domestic%20terrorism%20odin&amp;f=false|title=DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT: Issues and Tactics|last=Vohryzek|first=Miki|last2=Olson-Raymer|first2=Gayle|last3=Whamond|first3=Jeffery O.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398083083|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets of neo-pagan violence are similar to those of [[White supremacist terrorism in the United States|white supremacist terrorists]] and [[Nationalist terrorism|nationalist terrorists]], but an added target includes Christians and churches.

Notable incidents:

==Conflicts and wars==

{{Main|Religious war}}

It has been noted that "religious" conflicts are not exclusively based on religious beliefs but should instead be seen as clashes of communities, identities, and interests that are secular-religious or at least very secular.&lt;ref name="Anthropology of Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irrational Atheist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dying to Win" /&gt;

Some have asserted that attacks are carried out by those with very strong religious convictions such as terrorists in the context of global religious war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-24-2002-30919.asp Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed may 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Pape, a political scientist who specializes in [[suicide terrorism]] argues that much of the modern Muslim suicide terrorism is secularly based.&lt;ref name="Dying to Win" /&gt; Although the causes of terrorism are complex, it may be safe to assume that terrorists are partially reassured by the religious views that God is on their side and that He will reward them in [[Heaven]] for punishing unbelievers.&lt;ref name=juerg /&gt;&lt;ref name=chrjhd&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp Christian Jihad: The Crusades and Killing in the Name of Christ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709000007/http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |date=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicts are among the most difficult to resolve, particularly when both sides believe that God is on their side and that He has endorsed the moral righteousness of their claims.&lt;ref name=juerg&gt;{{Cite book| last =Juergensmeyer  | first =Mark | authorlink = | title = Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence.

"''[[Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius]],''" or "Kill them all; God will recognize his."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml9442.htm |title=Kill Them All; For The Lord Knoweth Them That Are His Steve Locks (Reply) (9-00) |accessdate=2007-08-18 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015305/http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml9442.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual violence==
{{Further|ritual slaughter|human sacrifice|animal sacrifice}}
Ritual violence may be directed against victims (e.g., [[human]] and nonhuman [[animal sacrifice]] and [[ritual slaughter]]) or self-inflicted ([[Self-flagellation#Association with religion|religious self-flagellation]]).

According to the [[hunting hypothesis]], created by [[Walter Burkert]] in ''[[Homo Necans]]'', [[carnivorous]] behavior is considered a form of violence. Burkett suggests that the anthropological phenomenon of [[religion]] grew out of rituals that were connected with [[hunting]] and the associated feelings of guilt over the violence that hunting required.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. 1983.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2101">'''[[Roadkill]] [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]]''' is a game in which the pictures of 24 different [[animal]]s are placed randomly in a grid, printed on paper or cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sloan, [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-06-02-road-trip-products_x.htm Kids in the car? Take these along] USA Today 6/2/2005&lt;/ref&gt; The game is traditionally played in [[vehicles]] during long distance travel. 

When a dead specimen of one of these animals is spotted by a player, that square in the grid is marked off with either a bingo blotter or some other writing instrument. Small [[poker]] like chips may be used to designate spotted dead animals, however the jarring due to bumps in the road make this a less viable option. The Roadkill Bingo Company of Loveland, CO sells a version of the game that uses reusable static cling squares to cover the animals, old tires and smells on the game board. Roadkill Bingo is a registered trade name owned by the Roadkill Bingo Company.

As in regular bingo, the object of the game is to spot a sequence of five dead animals which are in the same row or column on the bingo card. At the instant that five in a row is achieved, that player is obligated to yell "bingo", loudly and clearly, and the player is said to have "got a bingo."  Prizes for bingos are typically decided upon before the commencement of play. Spotting five dead animals in a row whose pictures are along a diagonal of a card also counts as a bingo.  Four corners may also count as a bingo. The center square is often free, meaning that no dead animal need be spotted to mark it. Controversy may arise when a dead animal is spotted which may not technically be classified as roadkill, and when two players simultaneously spot the roadkill. Players in the front seat have a clear advantage, however, the driver must have someone else mark his or her card. 

To promote brevity of games, regional variations include animals more likely to be found dead in the particular locale.

'''Samuel Davis Wilson''' (August 31, 1881 – August 19, 1939) was an American politician; he served as the 112th [[Mayor of Philadelphia]] from 1936 until his death in 1939.

==Early Life and Career==
Wilson was born in [[Boston]] in 1881. He was educated at the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].

==Career==
He moved to [[Philadelphia]] in 1905 and by 1927 found work as an assistant to the city controller WillB Hadley. This brought him in contact with Philadelphia political community. In 1930, he worked as a campaign manager for the Republican [[Gifford Pinchot]]’s gubernatorial campaign. This elevated his profile, leading him to a successful candidacy for city controller in 1931. He explored a run for the governor’s mansion in 1931 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] but dropped out and supported [[George Howard Earle III|George Earle]], who won the election.&lt;ref name=''PSU''&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/download/24446/24215 |title=Philadelphia’s Forgotten Mayor: S. Davis Wilson |last=Rossi |first=John |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the race for mayor as a Republican after the Democratic Party selected [[John B. Kelly Sr.]], a former Olympic rower and the father of [[Grace Kelly]]. With the unusually strong challenge from Kelly, Wilson’s campaign at one point resorted to anti-Semitic rhetoric, accusing Kelly of being beholden to Jewish interests. Wilson won the election, but by only 45,000 votes, a strong result for the Democrats in the reliably Republican city.&lt;ref name=''PSU''/&gt; 

As mayor, he clashed with Republican leaders and took on the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company|Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company]] and [[UGI Corporation|UGI]], the city’s gas operator. In 1937, he re-registered to vote as non-partisan, breaking with the Republican party.&lt;ref name=''PSU''/&gt;

He ran in the Democratic primary election for [[United States Senate]] against Governor Earle. He had publicly blamed Earle for wiretaps on his secretary’s phone.&lt;ref name=''Worst''&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.phillymag.com/news/2011/11/08/worst-job-philadelphia-mayor/ |title=Worst 18th-Century Job: Philadelphia Mayor |publisher=Philadelphia Magazine |date=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;The race wasn’t close and Earle won handily by over 500,000 votes and failed to carry any wards in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=''PSU''/&gt;

Wilson’s actions cost him much of his political support. District Attorney for Philadelphia got an indictment against him for failure to stop widespread gambling in the city, but a judge dismissed the charges.&lt;ref name=''PSU''/&gt;

He became ill in 1939 and sent a letter to the City Council to have the council president assume his duties on August 11. He passed away on August 19, 1939 after a stroke. [[George Connell (mayor)|George Connell]] succeeded him as mayor and served out the rest of his term.&lt;ref name=''NYTimesObit''&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1939/08/20/archives/mayor-wilson-dies-ran-city-from-bed-ill-since-january-philadelphia.html |title=Mayor Wilson Dies; Ran City From Bed |publisher=New York Times |date=1939-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Bullhead'' (SS-332)''', a [[Balao class submarine|''Balao''-class submarine]], was the very last US Navy ship sunk by enemy action during World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Military-When-was-the-last-time-the-U-S-Navy-lost-a-ship-in-combat|title=Military: When was the last time the U.S. Navy lost a ship in combat? - Quora|website=www.quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably on the same day that [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima]].  She was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[bullhead (disambiguation)|bullhead]] (any large-headed fish, especially the [[catfish]], [[miller's thumb]], and [[sculpin]]).  Her keel was laid down by the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Electric Boat Company]] of [[Groton, Connecticut]].  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 July 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Howard R. Doyle, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] 4 December 1944 with Commander W. T. Griffith in command.

== Operations ==
''Bullhead'' served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]].

The war operations of ''Bullhead'' extended from 21 March to August 1945 during which time she completed two war patrols. Her area of operations included the [[Java Sea]] and [[South China Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Siam]].

=== First patrol ===

During the greater portion of her first war patrol ''Bullhead'' performed lifeguard services and on two occasions bombarded [[Pratas Island]], China, damaging enemy radio installations. She also rescued three airmen from a downed [[B-29 Superfortress]] following an air strike on the China coast.

=== Second patrol ===

On her second patrol, in May and June 1945 in the [[Gulf of Siam]] and the [[South China Sea]], ''Bullhead'' sank two small freighters, a schooner and a sub chaser totaling 1800&amp;nbsp;tons and damaged two more sub chasers and another small freighter, all in gun actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bullhead's 1945 records claims are one ship sunk 30 May; one ship sunk 18 June; one ship sunk and three damaged 19 June and one ship sunk 25 June; for confirmation of two ships sunk by Bullhead 18 &amp; 19 June – see [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1945.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third patrol and sinking ===

On 31 July 1945 ''Bullhead'' left [[Fremantle submarine base]], [[Western Australia]] to commence her third war patrol. Her orders were to patrol in a "[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]" with {{USS|Capitaine|SS-336|3}} and {{USS|Puffer|SS-268|3}} in the [[Java Sea]] until 5 September and then head for [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]].

''Bullhead'' reported on 6 August that she had passed through [[Lombok Strait]].  That was the last word received from ''Bullhead''.  On 12 August, ''Capitaine'', planning to arrive on 13 August, ordered ''Bullhead'' to take position the following day in a scouting line with ''Capitaine'' and ''Puffer''.  Receiving no reply, ''Capitaine'' reported on 15 August, "Have been unable to contact ''Bullhead'' by any means since arriving in area."

Since the British submarines {{HMS|Taciturn}} and [[HMS Thorough|''Thorough'']], were in the same general area as ''Bullhead'', and {{USS|Cod|SS-224|3}} and {{USS|Chub|SS-329|3}} passed through in transit at various times, it is difficult to determine precisely which of the many Japanese anti-submarine attacks was the one that sank ''Bullhead''.  However, one occurred on 6 August 1945, when a [[Mitsubishi Ki-51]] from the 73rd Independent Chutai (literally "company" or squadron) of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] attacked with [[depth charge]]s. It claimed two direct hits, and for ten minutes thereafter, there was a great amount of gushing oil and air bubbles rising in the water. Since the position given is very near the [[Bali|Balinese]] coast, it is presumed that the proximity of mountain peaks shortened ''Bullhead'''s radar range and prevented her receiving a warning of the plane's approach. 84 men were lost while serving on USS ''Bullhead'' during her service.

== Commendations ==

''Bullhead'' received two [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service.

'''Sir Victor Alexander Haden Horsley''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (14 April 1857 – 16 July 1916) was an accomplished scientist and professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Horsley, Sir Victor Alexander Haden|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=876|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA876}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Kensington]], [[London]]. He was educated at [[Cranbrook School, Kent]], and studied [[medicine]] at [[University College London]] and in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] (1881), and in the same year started his career as a house surgeon and registrar at the [[University College Hospital]]. From 1884 to 1890 Horsley was Professor-Superintendent of the [[Brown Institute]]. In 1886, he was appointed as Assistant Professor of Surgery at the [[National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy]], and as a Professor of Pathology (1887–1896) and Professor of Clinical Surgery (1899–1902) at University College London. He was a supporter for [[women's suffrage]], and was an opponent of tobacco and alcohol.

==Personal life==
Sir Victor Horsley was born in Kensington, London, the son of Rosamund Haden and [[John Callcott Horsley]] R.A.  His given names, "Victor Alexander", were given to him by [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 he became engaged to Eldred Bramwell, daughter of Sir [[Frederick Bramwell]].  Subsequently, on 4 October 1887, Victor and Eldred married at [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]].  They had two sons, Siward and Oswald, and one daughter, Pamela.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

He was knighted in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27494/pages/7165 The London Gazette]. 11 November 1902. Issue: 27494, p. 7165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Horsley was a champion of many causes. One of his primary life's crusades was the temperance movement. Having observed that many injuries admitted to the hospital were due to alcohol, Horsley threw himself into becoming a temperance reformer.  He soon rose up to the position of a vice-president of the [[National Temperance League]] and the president of the [[British Medical Temperance Association]].  In 1907, along with [[Mary Sturge|Dr. Mary Sturge]] he published a book on alcoholism called ''Alcohol and the Human Body''.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

According to his biographers, Tan &amp; Black (2002), "Horsley's kindness, humility, and generous spirit endeared him to patients, colleagues, and students. Born to privilege, he was nonetheless dedicated to improving the lot of the common man and directed his efforts toward the [[suffrage]] of women, medical reform, and free health care for the working class (...) An [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] of keen intellect, unlimited energy, and consummate skill, his life and work justify his epitaph as a "pioneer of neurological surgery."

==Medical career==

[[File:The blue plaque to Victor Horsley on Gower Street in London.JPG|thumb|250px|The blue plaque to Victor Horsley on Gower Street in London]]
Horsley specialized in [[surgery]] and in [[physiology]]. He was the first physician to remove a [[spinal tumor]], in 1887, by means of a [[laminectomy]]. He developed many practical neurosurgical techniques, including the hemostatic [[bone wax]], the [[skin flap]], the ligation of the [[carotid artery]] to treat cerebral [[aneurysm]]s, the transcranial approach to the [[pituitary gland]] and the intradural division of the [[trigeminal nerve]] root for the surgical treatment of [[trigeminal neuralgia]].

As a neuroscientist, he carried out studies of the functions of the [[brain]] in animals and humans, particularly on the [[cerebral cortex]]. His studies on motor response to faradic [[electrical stimulation]] of the cerebral cortex, [[internal capsule]] and [[spinal cord]] became classics of the field. These studies were later translated to his pioneering work in the [[neurosurgery]] for [[epilepsy]]. Horsley was also the first to use intraoperative electrical stimulation  of the cortex for the localization of epileptic foci in humans, between 1884 and 1886, preceding [[Fedor Krause]] and [[Wilder Penfield]].

He was also a pioneer in the study of the functions of the [[thyroid]] gland. He studied [[myxedema]] and [[cretinism]], which are caused by a decreased level of the thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), and established for the first time, in experiments with monkeys, that they could be treated with extracts of the gland.

Appointed in 1886 as secretary to a governmental commission formed to study the anti-rabies [[vaccine]] developed by [[Louis Pasteur]], Sir Victor Horsley corroborated his results and created a campaign to vaccine against [[rabies]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. As a pathologist, Sir Victor carried out research on bacteria and founded the ''[[Journal of Pathology]]''.

In June 1886 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=2&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27horsley%27%29 |title = Library and Archives catalog |publisher = The Royal Society |accessdate = 14 October 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 1891 delivered their [[Croonian Lecture]], jointly with his brother-in-law [[Francis Gotch]], on the subject of the mammalian nervous system. In 1894 he won their [[Royal Medal]] for ''his investigations relating to the physiology of the nervous system, and of the thyroid gland, and to their applications to the treatment of disease''.

Horsley, who had been a keen rifle shot when serving in the [[Artists' Rifles]] as a medical student, also investigated the effect of gunshot wounds on the brain, experimenting with animals provided by a butcher and using the recently issued [[Lee-Metford]] rifle.&lt;ref name=isvh&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jramc-152-03-02| title = In Search of Victor Horsley| journal = Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps| volume = 152| issue = 3| pages = 128–31| year = 2006| last1 = Parker | first1 = P. J.| pmid=17295007}} It dates the beginning of the experiments to 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;  He concluded that the immediate cause of death that follows is due to respiratory failure, not heart failure.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1912–1921|year=1922|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=271}} It dates beginning of the experiments to 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;

His best-known innovation is the [[Horsley–Clarke apparatus]] (developed together with Robert H. Clarke in 1908) for performing the so-called [[stereotactic surgery]], whereby a set of precise numerical coordinates are used to locate each brain structure.  He was a pioneer in neurosurgery, having operated upon 44 patients.

He authored the book ''Functions of the Marginal Convolutions'' (1884) and, as a co-author, ''Experiments upon the Functions of the Cerebral Cortex'' (1888) and ''Alcohol and the Human Body'' (1902).

==Political career==

He was a [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] supporter and contested the December 1910 General election as Liberal candidate for the [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University]] seat. The [[Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society]] campaigned against his election because of his involvement with vivisection.&lt;ref name=kean&gt;[http://www.hildakean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Damer-Dawson-bird-bath.pdf The Newly Restored Bird Bath Memorial near the Thomas Carlyle Statue], [[Hilda Kean]], hildakean.com&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election he was adopted as prospective Liberal candidate, first for [[Islington East (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington East]] and then in 1913 for [[Harborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Harborough]] in Leicestershire. Harborough was a Liberal seat and a general election, expected to take place in 1914 would most likely have seen him elected to parliament. However, he resigned as prospective candidate, citing opposition to his views on women's suffrage and temperance on the part of constituency officials,&lt;ref name=www&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who, 1916–1928|year=1947|publisher=A and C  Black|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; just before the [[First World War]] started.

He strongly supported the Liberals' welfare state initiative the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Insurance Act of 1911]], despite strong opposition from most of his medical colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Dunnill, "Victor Horsley (1857–1915) and National Insurance." ''[[Journal of Medical Biography]]'' 21.4 (2013): 249-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War service and death==
[[File:Sir Victor Horsley...Life and Work Wellcome L0025033.jpg|thumb|Grave of Victor Horsley at [[Amara War Cemetery]].]]
Sir Victor was commissioned in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in 1910 as captain in the 3rd London General Hospital of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]].&lt;ref name=kellys&gt;{{cite book|title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, 1916|publisher=Kelly's|page=782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he requested for active duty on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] where he was initially sent as surgeon at the British hospital at [[Wimereux]], France.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  He was next posted in May 1915 as a colonel and Director of Surgery of the British Army Medical Service in [[Egypt]], based at the 21st General Hospital in [[Alexandria]], in support of the [[Dardanelles Campaign]].&lt;ref name=isvh/&gt; In the following year he volunteered for field surgery duty in [[Mesopotamia]], where he died unexpectedly in [[Amarah]], [[Iraq]], on 16 July 1916, of [[heatstroke]] and severe [[hyperpyrexia]], at only 59 years of age.

==Namesakes==

Horsley was the first neurosurgeon appointed to the hospital in [[Queen Square, London]], now called the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] – the Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery is named in his honour. The [[Walton Centre]] for Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery NHS Trust in Liverpool, England, another leading Neurosurgical Hospital dedicated their Intensive Care Unit to Sir Victor Horsley and is called the Horsley ward. The British Medical Association has a series of lunchtime lectures at its Annual Representatives Meeting entitled The Victor Horsley Lectures.  After the second Gulf War, a British Field Hospital was established at Shaibah Logistics Base and the area of tented accommodation for hospital staff was known as Horsley Lines. Dr. Horsely is credited with the invention of the "Horsley Hook", a device which he used to avulse the trigeminal nerve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8360">'''Widow's succession''' was a political practice prominent in some countries in the early part of the 20th century, by which a politician who died in office was succeeded by his [[widow]], either through election or direct appointment to the seat.&lt;ref name=currell&gt;Melville Currell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HKM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22widow%27s+succession%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RKvGsfmGqx&amp;sig=8s312NYSUITq6JnLh3s6XBvU9Po&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vTlhSpbGE5CitgfRtPT9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 ''Political Woman''].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the earliest women to hold political office in the modern era attained their positions through this practice.

== Overview ==
In earlier years, women who held office through widow's succession rarely became prominent as politicians in their own right, but were regarded merely as [[Placeholder (politics)|placeholders]] whose primary role was to retain a seat and a vote for the party rather than risk a protracted fight for the nomination between elections.&lt;ref name=currell /&gt; The practice was also sometimes seen as a way to provide the woman with financial support due to the loss of her family's primary income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/ramsland_sarah_katherine_1882-_1964.html Sarah Ramsland] profile at the Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expectation was that a widow would serve only until the next election, at which time she would step down and allow her party to select a new candidate. Upon the retirement of [[Effiegene Wingo]] from the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1932, the ''[[New York Sun]]'' wrote,

{{cquote|Some of the women who have inherited a seat in Congress have demonstrated their individual ability, but of most of them it can be said that they submitted with dignity and good taste to a false code of chivalry, served unostentatiously and departed the Capitol quietly, wondering what the men who invented the term-by-inheritance thought they were doing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Essays/No-Lady/Widow-Familial/ "I'm No Lady; I'm a Member of Congress"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In one unusual Canadian instance, [[Martha Black]] succeeded her husband [[George Black (Canadian politician)|George Black]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] when he had not died, but merely stepped down temporarily for health reasons; in the next election, Martha stood down and George returned to office. Another unusual circumstance occurred in the United States when [[Katherine G. Langley]] was elected to her still-living husband [[John W. Langley]]'s former congressional seat after he was convicted of selling alcohol during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].

With the evolving role of women in politics, however, a number of women who first took office under widow's succession went on to build long and distinguished careers in their own right. [[Margaret Chase Smith]] became the longest-serving woman in the history of the [[United States Senate]] and the first woman ever to have her name placed in nomination for the [[Presidency of the United States]] at a major party's convention,&lt;ref name=currell /&gt; [[Edith Nourse Rogers]] became the longest-serving woman in the history of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and [[Mary Ellen Smith]] earned the distinction of becoming the first woman ever appointed to a cabinet position, as well as the first woman ever to become [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of a legislature, in both [[Canada]] and the entire [[British Empire]].

In Sri Lanka [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] who succeeded her assassinated husband was a long-serving Prime Minister and party leader.

While widows are occasionally still appointed or elected to political positions following their husbands' deaths, the practice is not as common in the modern era, in which women have been able to take on increasingly prominent roles in politics based on their own talents and experience rather than as "placeholders". Additionally, some figures, such as [[Sonia Gandhi]] in India and [[Grace MacInnis]] in Canada, have happened to hold political office and to be the widow of an earlier officeholder, but are not true "widow's successions" as they were not their late husband's immediate successor.
