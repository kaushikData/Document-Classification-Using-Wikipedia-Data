The '''Confederação Brasileira de Futebol Americano (CBFA)''' (translation: '''American Football Brazilian Confederation'''), is the main organization for [[American football]] in [[Brazil]]. Its goal is to help the growth of American football and its development in the country.&lt;ref name=hystory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afabonline.com.br/new/afab/ |title=Confederação Brasileira de Futebol Americano – CBFA |work=CBFA |date= |accessdate=16 March 2017 |language=pt |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430005510/http://afabonline.com.br/new/afab/ |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the summer of 1986, a small group of boys started playing American football on weekends on [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana beach]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Over the next six years, interest and attendance grew until a team was formed; the Rio Guardians was founded on January 4, 1992, becoming the first American football team in Rio de Janeiro. 

In 1994, Mel Owens organized a [[flag football]] workshop. This was the first time Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon appeared in the sport. The Mamutes, with their red shirts, became the first opponent on the beaches of Rio Guardians.

After some departures between 1994 and 1997, the nucleus of what eventually became the Association of [[Rio de Janeiro]] began organized play, starting a league and accompanying Carioca Bowl, with six teams.

After seven years, after expanding viewership with international broadcasts and demonstrations for [[National Football League|NFL]] stars such as [[Tony Gonzalez]], the Association of Rio grew to fourteen teams and a championship, playing more than 50 games per year. Its governing body is the Associação Brasileira de Futebol Americano (AFAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/218330-growth-of-american-football|title=The Growth of American Football: How Successful Can the Sport Be Overseas?|first=Chris |last=Johnson|publisher=''[[Bleacher Report]]''|date=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[baseball]], a '''bat flip''' is the throwing of a [[baseball bat]] in such a way that it rotates several times before landing. It is typically done by a batter to show off after hitting a [[home run]]. This is in contrast to the usual practice of dropping the bat straight down as the batter begins running to [[Baseball field#First base|first base]].{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

==Asia and Latin America==
Bat flipping is popular in Asian and [[Latin America]]n baseball leagues.&lt;ref name="akeh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/sports/baseball/bat-flip-bautista-blue-jays.html|title=Baseball reaches a flipping point|last=Keh|first=Andrew|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, the bat flipping tradition dates back to the 1990s,&lt;ref name="ESPN-LettingGo-Oct2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimes|first1=Mina|title=The Art of Letting Go: The great Korean bat flip mystery|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/17668845/korean-bat-flip|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has become increasingly frequent in the [[Korea Baseball Organization]].&lt;ref name=keh&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/sports/baseball/bat-flipping-draws-shrugs-in-south-korea-but-scorn-in-america.html|title=Bat flipping draws shrugs in South Korea but scorn in America|last=Keh|first=Andrew|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN-LettingGo-Oct2016"/&gt; In the [[Korean language]], bat flips are referred as ''ppa-dun'' ({{lang-ko|빠던}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the "first syllables of the words for 'bat' and 'throw'".&lt;ref name=keh /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN-LettingGo-Oct2016"/&gt; The practice is also common in Japan and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=keh /&gt; 

==United States and Canada==
In the United States, bat flips have traditionally been considered rude and inconsistent with baseball etiquette.&lt;ref name=keh /&gt; Traditional etiquette and the [[unwritten rules]] of baseball espouse humility and discourage actions which may be interpreted as arrogant or [[wikt:show up|showing up]] the opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebaseballcodes.com/tag/bat-flipping/|title=On the benefits of embracing the moment, or: Not all bat flips are created equal|last=Turbow|first=Jason|publisher=The Baseball Codes|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Torii Hunter]], a retired [[Major League Baseball]] player and fan of bat flips in Korean baseball, has stated that a player throwing a bat in such a manner during a game in the United States would likely face retaliation in a subsequent at bat, such as being [[Hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]].&lt;ref name=keh /&gt; In April 2015, [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] right fielder [[Yasiel Puig]] stated that he would flip his bat less frequently because he wanted "to show American baseball that [he's] not disrespecting the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-yasiel-puig-cut-bat-flips-20150414-story.html|title=Dodgers' Yasiel Puig wants to cut down on bat flips|last=Hernandez|first=Dylan|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===José Bautista bat flip===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:José Bautista bat flip, 14 October 2015.jpg|thumb|right|José Bautista's bat flip after hitting a home run in the bottom of the seventh inning of game 5 of the [[2015 American League Division Series]].]] --&gt;
During the rubber match of the [[2015 American League Division Series]] between the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] at the Blue Jays' home stadium of the [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Blue Jays [[right fielder]] [[José Bautista]] executed what Andrew Keh of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as possibly "the most ostentatious bat flip in MLB history" after hitting a go-ahead, three-run [[home run]] off Rangers relief pitcher [[Sam Dyson]].&lt;ref name="akeh" /&gt; Bautista wrote an article about the bat flip published in November 2015 in ''[[The Players' Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="Bautista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplayerstribune.com/jose-bautista-bat-flip/|title=Are you flipping kidding me?|last=Bautista|first=José|authorlink=José Bautista|others=The Players' Tribune staff|publisher=[[The Players' Tribune]]|date=November 9, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he "didn’t plan it. It just happened", and that he was "caught up in the emotion of the moment" when he flipped the bat.&lt;ref name="Bautista" /&gt; Bautista was criticized for the bat flip, which he attributed to a failure to understand differences in cultural backgrounds of players.&lt;ref name="meme"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/programs/metromorning/jose-bautista-defends-bat-flip-1.3314865|title=Jose Bautista says bat flip flap down to 'gap' between Dominican and North American players|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Rangers objected to the bat flip, with Rangers starting pitcher [[Derek Holland]] stating he did not object to a home run celebration, "but the way he did it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-rangers/headlines/20151020-derek-holland-not-a-fan-of-jose-bautista-s-on-the-field-and-personally-i-don-t-like-him-either.ece|title=Derek Holland not a fan of Jose Bautista on the field, and 'personally, I don't like him, either|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date= October 20, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the home run, Dyson approached Blue Jays designated hitter [[Edwin Encarnación]], the next batter in the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]], and "told him that Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game more".&lt;ref name="fraley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-rangers/headlines/20151014-fraley-jose-bautista-becomes-public-enemy-no.-1-after-rangers-intense-alds-vs.-toronto.ece|title=Fraley: Jose Bautista becomes Public Enemy No. 1 after Rangers' intense ALDS vs. Toronto |last=Fraley|first=Gerry|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date= October 14, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the post-game press conference, Rangers manager [[Jeff Banister]] stated that "we respect everybody", which the media interpreted as a strong suggestion of disapproval of Bautista's actions.&lt;ref name="fraley" /&gt;

The Bautista bat flip became an [[internet meme]].&lt;ref name="meme" /&gt; Fans posted numerous responses to the event on [[Twitter]], and shared videos on [[Vine (app)|Vine]] and other [[social media]] websites and mobile apps.&lt;ref name="akeh" /&gt; It was etched onto [[Jack-o'-lantern]]s for [[Halloween]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.es.mlb.com/cutfour/2015/10/18/154853842/jose-bautistas-bat-flip-is-now-a-jack-o-lantern|title=Jose Bautista's bat flip is now Halloween-ready as a jack-o'-lantern|last=Clair|first=Michael|publisher=Cut4 (Major League Baseball)|date=October 18, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; printed on T-shirts and [[Christmas sweater]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-rangers/headlines/20151015-scare-rangers-fans-at-halloween-with-new-jose-bautista-bat-flip-t-shirt.ece|title=Scare Rangers fans at Halloween with new Jose Bautista bat flip T-shirt|publisher=The Dallas Morning News|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/joey-to-the-world-bautistas-bat-flip-gets-christmas-sweater/|title=Joey to the World: Bautista’s bat-flip gets Christmas sweater|last=Singh|first=David|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|date=25 November 2015|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the subject of a thigh [[tattoo]] for an [[Oshawa]], Ontario man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2015/10/16/toronto-tattoo-artist-immortalizes-jose-bautista-bat-flip.html|title=Toronto tattoo artist immortalizes Jose Bautista bat flip|last=Kestler-D’Amours|first= Jillian|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.durhamregion.com/sports-story/6033390-oshawa-man-has-no-regrets-about-jose-bautista-bat-flip-tattoo/|title=Oshawa man has no regrets about Jose Bautista bat flip tattoo|last=Szekely|first=Reka|newspaper=Oshawa This Week|publisher=Metroland Media Group|date=October 23, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also commemorated on a [[Topps]] 2016 Series 1 [[baseball card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jose-bautista-bat-flip-topps-card-1.3432774|title=Jose Bautista's bat flip commemorated on Topps baseball card|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[corn maze]] in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]] was designed with the likeness of the Bautista bat flip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2016/08/31/198820618/joey-bats-bat-flip-is-memorialized-in-a-canadian-cornfield | title=The Joey Bats Bat Flip has now been memorialized in a Canadian cornfield | publisher = MLB | date=August 31, 2016 | accessdate=September 10, 2016 | author=Monagan, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bautista's bat flip is added to ''[[NHL 17]]'', which is an official [[National Hockey League]] [[simulation video game]], as a personal goal celebration, albeit with an [[ice hockey stick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2654700-jose-bautistas-legendary-bat-flip-added-to-nhl-17-as-goal-celebration | title=Jose Bautista's Legendary Bat Flip Added to 'NHL 17' as Goal Celebration | publisher=''[[Bleacher Report]]'' | date=July 29, 2016 | accessdate=September 10, 2016 | author=Newport, Kyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bautista's bat flip may be the impetus of the Jays–Rangers brawl on May 15, 2016 in the Rangers' home stadium of [[Globe Life Park]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], in which Rangers relief pitcher [[Matt Bush (baseball)|Matt Bush]] intentionally threw a pitch at Bautista, Bautista made an illegal slide to second base, and Rangers second baseman [[Rougned Odor]] punched Bautista in the face, thereby igniting the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chisholm |first1=Gregor |title=Tension boils over in Blue Jays-Rangers game |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/178354174/bautista-odor-fight-in-blue-jays-rangers-game |publisher=MLB |date=May 15, 2016 |accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bautista was suspended for one game for the incident, while Odor was suspended for eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/178630394/rougned-odor-jose-bautista-suspended|title=Odor, Bautista among 14 disciplined for brawl|last=Hagen|first=Paul|work=MLB.com|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017 in the [[Atlanta Braves]]' home stadium of [[SunTrust Park]] in [[Cobb County, Georgia]], Bautista did a bat flip on a home run in a five-run game that led to benches clearing. One day later, Braves starting pitcher [[Julio Teherán]] intentionally hit Bautista in the left thigh with a fastball, apparently as revenge. The next three batters had consecutive hits, allowing Bautista and a few other runners to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article/231070708/marcus-stroman-blue-jays-defeat-braves|title=Stroman, Blue Jays slug way to win in Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Nuremberg''' ({{Lang-pt|Batalha de Nuremberga}}, {{Lang-nl|Slag van Neurenberg}}; also known as '''Massacre of Nuremberg''') is the nickname of a [[Association football|football]] match played in the Round of 16 of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] between [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at the [[Max-Morlock-Stadion|Frankenstadion]] in [[Nuremberg]] on 25 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,423521,00.html|title=Portugal Defeats Holland at the Battle of Nuremberg|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]]n referee [[Valentin Ivanov (footballer, born 1961)|Valentin Ivanov]] issued a [[FIFA World Cup]] record four [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Red card (dismissal)|red cards]] and 16 [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Yellow card (caution)|yellow cards]], setting a new record for cards shown at any [[FIFA]]-administered international tournament.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200607/s1681791.htm|title=Fair play takes a dive|work=[[ABC Sport]]|date=8 July 2006|accessdate=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The match==
[[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] had met at the semi-final stage of the previous major tournament, [[UEFA Euro 2004]] held in Portugal, which had finished 2–1 to the host nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111125619/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=203251.html|archivedate=11 November 2017|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=203251.html | title = Maniche has final say against Oranje|deadurl=yes|publisher=UEFA|date=1 July 2004|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had not featured the same level of animosity between the players. A total of five Dutch and eleven Portuguese players who took some part in [[UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage#Portugal vs Netherlands|that fixture]] were also on the field in Nuremberg.

The match ended 1–0 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], with [[Maniche]] scoring in the 23rd minute;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=2260/match=84197/report=rp.html|title=''Oranje'' see red as Portugal prevail|publisher=UEFA|date=25 June 2006|accessdate=27 June 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513183537/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round%3D2260/match%3D84197/report%3Drp.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had also scored the winning goal in 2004. [[Mark van Bommel]] was booked in the second minute, and also before the goal Dutch defender [[Khalid Boulahrouz]] was booked for a foul which injured [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and would eventually force the substitution of Portugal's star winger before half time. Ronaldo left in tears, and proceeded to describe Boulahrouz's tackle as "clearly an intentional foul to get me injured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-392550/Ronaldo-cries-foul.html|title=Ronaldo cries foul|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Maniche had been booked for a foul on Van Bommel after 19 minutes.

Shortly after the goal, Portugal's defensive midfielder [[Costinha]] slid into Dutch veteran [[Philip Cocu]], receiving a yellow card. He was then the first to be sent off just before half time after being shown a second yellow card for a handball. After [[Petit (Portuguese footballer)|Petit]] had been cautioned in the 50th minute, [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and [[Luís Figo]] both received yellow cards, with Figo's coming as a result of a touchline melee with [[Mark Van Bommel]] during which Figo headbutted him.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ziegler|first1=Martyn|title=Figo escapes ban|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/figo-escapes-ban-6097105.html|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal manager [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] controversially gave his approval to this headbutt by stating after the match, "Jesus Christ may be able to turn the other cheek but Luís Figo isn't Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/26/worldcup2006.match3|work=[[guardian.co.uk|The Guardian]]|title=Holland exit in acrimony as four see red|first=Michael|last=Walker|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scolari also escaped punishment.

Boulahrouz was sent off in the 63rd minute with a second caution after fouling Figo, which sparked a melee on the [[touch-line]], involving Boulahrouz (who confronted [[Simão Sabrosa|Simão]]), [[André Ooijer]] and the Portuguese bench, necessitating the intervention of the fourth official [[Marco Antonio Rodríguez|Marco Rodríguez]]. Portugal's playmaker [[Deco]] roughly fouled Dutch defender [[John Heitinga]] and was booked; the Netherlands had not [[Sportsmanship|given the ball back]] after Portugal had cleared it into touch to allow a player to receive medical treatment, thus breaking one of football's unwritten rules. In the ensuing brawl, [[Wesley Sneijder]] pushed Petit to the ground and was also cautioned. The Netherlands' [[Rafael van der Vaart]] received a yellow card, apparently for dissent.

After that, Portugal's goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] (presumably for time wasting) and left-back [[Nuno Valente]] (for a rough foul) were punished. Deco received his second caution and was dismissed in the 78th minute for delaying the restart after a free-kick was awarded. Cocu escaped a caution for wrestling Deco to the ground in his attempt to retrieve the ball. In the 88th minute, Simão drew the ire of the Dutch goalie [[Edwin van der Sar]] after the Portuguese player's leg made contact with the custodian in his attempt to score a goal, but the referee decided against taking any disciplinary action. In injury time, Van Bronckhorst was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/results/matches/match=97410052/report.html|title=Match Report|work=[[FIFA]]|date=25 June 2006|accessdate=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene was shown on television footage during the match in which Boulahrouz, Deco, and Van Bronckhorst were sitting together on the sidelines after being sent off, the latter two having a discussion, both being teammates at [[FC Barcelona]]. Commentator [[Gary Bloom]] referred to the scene as the "Bad boys' corner".

==Aftermath==
{{Wikinews|Portugal overcome Netherlands 1-0 on way to quarter-final}}
In the aftermath of the match, referee Ivanov was criticised by [[FIFA]] president [[Sepp Blatter]], who suggested that Ivanov should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5116414.stm|title=Blatter criticises referee Ivanov|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blatter later regretted these words and promised to apologise officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/07/04/blatter-regrets-criticism-of-referee-ivanov-1152018514.html|title=Blatter regrets criticism of referee Ivanov|work=OneIndia News|date=4 July 2006|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Portugal faced [[England national football team|England]] in the subsequent quarter-final, they were without the suspended Deco and Costinha. Portugal managed to reach the semi-finals. However, they had two players suspended for that match due to accumulated yellow cards (including the ones against the Netherlands).

'''Beasley Coliseum''' is a general-purpose [[arena]] on the campus of [[Washington State University]] in [[Pullman, Washington]]. Opened {{Years or months ago|1973}} in June 1973,&lt;ref name=nwcexp/&gt;&lt;ref name=grd2/&gt; its current [[seating capacity]] is 11,671 for basketball.

==First games==
The building's inaugural event in 1973 was the university's commencement exercises on {{nowrap|June 3.&lt;ref name=nwcexp/&gt;&lt;ref name=grd2/&gt;&lt;ref name=wgopcol/&gt;&lt;ref name=copctr &gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mKFYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jvgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7252%2C678563 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=Washington |title=Ceremony opens center |agency=(photo) |date=June 4, 1973 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Its first sporting event was an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] exhibition game between [[1973–74 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle]] and [[1973–74 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland]] on September 25, [[1973–74 NBA season|1973]].&lt;ref name=sonics&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PxxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ouwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5542,2602595|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=Spokane, Washington|title= WSU books Russell, Sonics|date=August 22, 1973|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sonicw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W3VUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ao8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3837,4918915|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|location=(Washington)|title=Sonics finally win|agency=UPI|date=September 26, 1973|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friel Court==
Located on the east side of campus, the building includes '''Friel Court''', the name of the basketball playing surface. It honors {{nowrap|[[Jack Friel]]}} {{nowrap|(1898–1995),}} the longtime head coach of the WSU men's basketball team, who led the Cougars to 495 victories in thirty seasons.

==Entertainment==
The building's full name reflects the fact that it is used not only for [[concerts]], big-name speakers, dinners, and commencement, but also for basketball as mentioned above. The building may be reconfigured for seating capacities of 12,000 in the round to 9,000 in an end-stage configuration for concerts, to 2,500 in a theater configuration using an extensive system of fly-in curtains, an adjustable cloth scrim ceiling, and a portable proscenium stored under the floor.

The original opera house/theater configuration featured one of the first synthesized acoustical environments using surround speaker systems.  An onsite reverberation chamber tuned with fiberglass panels for the specific acoustical configuration was combined with the first commercial use of a digital delay line, the Lexicon DD1, then fed to the side and overhead speakers.  When properly set up, it was capable producing a very convincing acoustical rendition of a theater, an opera house, or by changing the delay settings and retuning the reverb chamber, even a cathedral.  Unfortunately, a sewer drain line had been installed from the southeast corner restroom facilities through the reverb chamber, and if a toilet flushed when the system was in operation, the resulting sound effect was extraordinary.  After discovering that, locking the restroom was a management priority whenever the theater was prepared for surround sound use. More recently full digital reverberation replaced the chamber.

The Coliseum's Hall of Fame—famous entertainers who have performed there—include comedians such as [[Bob Hope]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Jay Leno]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and musical stars or shows such as [[The Beach Boys]], [[The 5th Dimension]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Elton John]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Metallica]], [[Metal Church]], [[Van Halen]], [[Dana Carvey]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Montgomery Gentry]], [[Bill Engvall]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[Grease (musical)|Grease]] &amp; [[Cats (musical)|Cats]]. The [[Harlem Globetrotters]] have performed there five times.

The Coliseum has been the venue, for many years, for the Great Performances series, organized by [[Festival Dance and Performing Arts]] Association, of neighboring [[Moscow, Idaho]].

Overflow crowds attended lectures by [[Noam Chomsky]] on April 22, 2005, and by [[Jane Goodall]] on March 8, 2007.

On March 6, 2010, the arena hosted a [[WWE SmackDown]] [[house show]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3442">[[Image:Dwigth Howard olympics2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dwight Howard]] bends down the rim as he dunks the ball.]]
A '''breakaway rim''' is a [[basketball]] rim that contains a hinge and a spring at the point where it attaches to the backboard so that it can bend downward when a player [[slam dunk|dunks]] a basketball, and then quickly snaps back into a horizontal position when the player releases it. It allows players to dunk the ball without [[backboard shattering|shattering the backboard]], and it reduces the possibility of wrist injuries. Breakaway rims were invented in the mid-1970s and are now an essential element of high-level basketball.

In the early days of basketball, dunking was considered ungentlemanly, and was rarely used outside of practice or warm-up drills. A broken backboard or distorted rim could delay a game for hours. During the 1970s, however, players like [[Julius Erving]] and [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] popularized the dunk with their athletic flights to the basket, increasing the demand for flexible rims.&lt;ref name=Keilman&gt;John Keilman. "This gadget really was a slam-dunk ; In 1976, Arthur Ehrat invented a basketball rim that didn't break wrists or backboards". ''Chicago Tribune''. April 4, 2005. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While several men claim to have created the breakaway rim, Arthur Ehrat is recognized as the inventor by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention &amp; Innovation.&lt;ref name=Keilman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/fa_ehrat_index.aspx Arthur Ehrat Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720151909/http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/fa_ehrat_index.aspx |date=2008-07-20 }}. Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention &amp; Innovation. May 14, 2007. Retrieved on January 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A resident of [[Lowder, Illinois]], Ehrat worked at a [[grain elevator]] for most of his life and barely knew anything about basketball. In 1975, his nephew, an assistant basketball coach at [[Saint Louis University]], asked him to help design a rim that could support slam dunks. Using a spring from a [[John Deere]] [[cultivator]], Ehrat designed a rim that could bend and spring back after 125 pounds of force were applied to it. He called his device "The Rebounder". In 1982, he was awarded a patent for his invention, which was officially called a "deformation-preventing swingable mount for basketball goals".&lt;ref name=winn&gt;Luke Winn. "[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/basketball/ncaa/2007/12/breaking-away.html Breaking Away]". SI.com. December 23, 2007. Retrieved on January 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   

The breakaway rim was first used by the [[NCAA]] during the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978 Final Four]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=winn/&gt; Although [[Darryl Dawkins]] notoriously shattered two backboards with his dunks in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Chris Broussard.

February 15, 2004. Retrieved on January 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the old-style bolted rim structure was not phased out of the NBA until the 1981–82 season, when breakaway rims debuted as a uniform equipment upgrade.

In [[chess]], '''decoying''' is the [[chess tactic|tactic]] of ensnaring a piece, usually the king or queen, by forcing it to move to a poisoned square with a [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]] on that square.
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Example==
In the diagram, with Black to play, illustrates two separate decoys. First, the white queen is set up on c4 for a knight fork: '''1... Rxc4! 2. Qxc4'''. Next, the fork is executed by removing the sole defender of the a3-square: '''2... Qxb2!+ 3. Rxb2 Na3+ 4. Kc1'''. Finally, a [[zwischenzug]] decoys the king to b2: '''4... Bxb2+'''. After either 5.Kxb2 Nxc4+ 6.Kc3 Rxe4, or 5.Kd1 Nxc4, Black is two pawns ahead and should win comfortably.

Perhaps the most celebrated game featuring a decoy theme is [[Tigran Petrosian|Petrosian]] vs. [[Ludek Pachman|Pachman]], Bled 1961,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1104948 Petrosian vs. Pachman, Bled 1961] Chessgames.com&lt;/ref&gt; which also involved a queen sacrifice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9196">The '''domestic association football season''' in countries that [[association football]] is played [[Association football around the world|around the world]] varies in length and time of year contested. Most employ a single period in which the main league competition is contested alongside any cup competitions, although many Latin American leagues have two competitions contested in one season under the [[Apertura and Clausura]] system.

As a rule, the period of the domestic football season is ultimately dictated by the [[weather]], with most football games played on natural [[grass]] [[Association football pitch|pitches]] which are vulnerable to [[ice|freezing]] or becoming water-logged, although advances in [[artificial turf]] and pitch drainage/[[Under-soil heating|heating systems]] have improved pitch availability in many leagues.

In countries where association football competes with other football codes that are locally more popular, the season cycle can also be dictated by the scheduling of competing codes. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), which began in the [[United States]] and has since expanded into [[Canada]], has had to compete with [[American football]] from its inception, and now competes with [[Canadian football]] as well. When MLS began, most of its teams had to play in large American football stadiums that were used by teams in the [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[college football]]. This led to scheduling the season to begin in spring and end in fall (autumn), which put the bulk of the season outside that of American football. Stadium conflict has now been reduced with the advent of [[soccer-specific stadium]]s. In [[Australia]], the two most popular football codes are [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby league]], both of which are traditionally played in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Because all of the stadiums used by the [[A-League]] are also used for one or both of these two codes, that league chose to operate on a spring-to-autumn cycle, which placed most of its season outside those of Australian rules and rugby league.

The domestic season is preceded by a pre-season, in which clubs will require players to report back to the club by a set date to begin pre-season training, and will arrange [[Exhibition game|pre-season friendly]] games toward the start of the season to improve fitness and test team [[Formation (association football)|formations]] and [[Association football tactics and skills|tactics]], particularly if new playing staff have joined a club.

In many leagues, the dates of the domestic season dictate the opening and closing of a [[transfer window]], the periods when players can be [[Transfer (football)|transferred]].

The timing of a domestic season must be coordinated with international football competitions, which can see national teams with different domestic seasons playing each other at different times in their domestic season, although this can be less significant for certain countries where their best players, and hence the bulk of their national team, do not play in their international team's domestic league programme.

The world football governing body, [[FIFA]], which governs club as well as national football, mandates an international football calendar, whereby certain weeks in the year are reserved for national friendly and competitive matches, as well as regional club competitions. For dates which fall within a country's domestic season, league clubs are required to release any called up player for their international team a set number of days before a fixture. The date of the worldwide national team competition the [[FIFA World Cup]] is always in June/July, with the exception of the 2022 Qatar World Cup which will be played in November/December.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/25/2022-world-cup-qatar-fifa-dates-21-november-final-18-december 2022 World Cup Qatar: Fifa dates 21 November, final on 18 December]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enda McNulty''' (born 1977 in [[Mullaghbawn]], [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]) is an [[GAA All Stars Awards|All Star]] winning [[Gaelic football]]er for [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]]. He played football with his local club [[Mullaghbawn Cúchullain's GFC|Mullaghbawn Cúchullain's]] in Armagh and was a member of the [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]] senior football team from 1996 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/sport/orourke-leaves-out-duo-2425164.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802002150/http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/sport/orourke-leaves-out-duo-2425164.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-02 |title=O'Rourke leaves out duo |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his first and only [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medal in 2002, the same year in which he won his All Star award. He is also a [[Sport psychology|sports psychologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jamie|last=Ball|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/the-fitness-fallacy-you-can-t-outrun-a-mental-health-problem-1.3023266|title=The fitness fallacy: You can't outrun a mental-health problem|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=4 April 2017|accessdate=4 April 2017|quote=“There is a phenomenon happening at the moment with endurance sports in Ireland,” says performance coach, sport psychologist and former All Star-winning Armagh Gaelic footballer Enda McNulty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
McNulty played for Mullaghbawn alongside his brother [[Justin McNulty|Justin]] in his early years. Following a move to [[Dublin]], he later played for [[Ballyboden St Endas]] and [[Na Fianna GAA|Na Fianna]]. He made his debut on the [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]] senior inter-county in 1996, and helped them to their first All-Ireland title in 2002, when they defeated [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the final. He won his only [[GAA All Stars Awards|All Star]] for his efforts that season.

Having received a degree in Psychology, McNulty has become a well known coach, and he has made it well known in the last few months that his biggest achievement to date was meeting Trevor Clendenning in The Clyde Court Hotel, a life changing event he described recently. "Clendenning was like a man possessed on stage, he grabbed the microphone and gave it holly" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/sub-role-not-in-mcnultys-dna-2208957.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804052434/http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/sub-role-not-in-mcnultys-dna-2208957.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 |title=Sub role not in McNulty's DNA |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; advising a number of world class athletes and rugby players, including 400m runner [[David Gillick]], and several members of the [[Ireland national rugby union team]] which won the [[Six Nations Championship]] [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|grand slam]] in 2009.

'''Estádio do Buraco''' is a football [[stadium]] in [[Lobito]], [[Benguela Province]], [[Angola]].

It is owned by [[Académica Petróleos do Lobito]] and holds 5,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/desporto/2015/1/7/Futebol-Estadio-Buraco-volta-ser-palco-Girabola-quatro-anos-depois,0727f348-6f4e-429f-b309-c7a2f6dee5c3.html |title=Futebol: Estádio do Buraco volta a ser palco do Girabola quatro anos depois |publisher=ANGOP.com |date=12 Feb 2015 |accessdate=25 Jan 2017 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Estádio do Buraco was built in the 1970s, at the Bairro Santa Cruz.

In 1999, the stadium was the venue of the 1-2 home defeat of Académica to [[Atlético Sport Aviação]], a result that relegated Académica to the 2nd rank in the overall Girabola classification of that year.

On April 3rd 2003, the stadium was the venue for Académica's 2–3 home defeat to DRC's [[TP Mazembe]].

In 2004, Académica played their home games at the União da Catumbela-owned Estádio Comandante Fragoso de Matos in the neighboring town of Catumbela following a ban on dirt-pitch football stadiums issued by the [[Angolan Football Federation]].

In 2007, the stadium was reinaugurated with the installation of new grass, following a 7-year period of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/desporto/2007/5/26/Futebol-Academica-Lobito-reinaugura-hoje-campo-Buraco,f2b8bd6b-5331-4adb-9cda-86bc31f1d8cc.html |title=Futebol: Académica do Lobito reinaugura hoje campo do Buraco |publisher=ANGOP.com |date=30 Jun 2007 |accessdate=25 Jan 2017 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 110x68m stadium underwent a major rehabilitation in the wake of the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] hosted by Angola, with the installation of a new fence, four sets of led lights, new goal posts and a UK-imported natural grass. It now features three new dressing rooms as well. It was the training ground of the [[Morocco national football team]] in that event.

[[Image:Tarpaulin fly tent.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An improvised fly tent using a [[tarpaulin]]]]
[[Image:Dining fly (tent).svg|thumb|right|200px|Stand-alone fly]]
A '''fly''' refers to the outer layer of a tent or to a piece of material which is strung up using [[rope]] as a minimalist, stand-alone shelter.  In basic terms, a fly is a [[tent]] without walls. Purpose-made stand-alone flies are also sometimes referred to as bivouacs, bivvies, [[tarpaulin]]s, or hootchies.  Flies are generally used for keeping moisture (such as condensation or rain) or sun off people while they eat, rest or sleep.  They can also be used as [[Tent|groundsheets]], but this is not recommended since it creates wear and tear which can lead to holes.

A stand-alone fly is a multi-purpose tool and is very flexible.  For example, a fly can be put up in a wide variety of shapes depending on the environment and the weather, whereas a tent usually has a pre-set configuration for its structure which can be adjusted somewhat but not substantially.  A fly also has the advantage of being particularly light and portable.  

Disadvantages of flies include that a person is still exposed to the elements such as mosquitoes and cold weather and that it can be difficult to put a fly up if there are limited natural vertical structures such as trees in the camping area.  Flies, however, can be put up using poles or jury-rigged, for example, using [[paddles]].

A fly is also used to create shade as in the desert.  Then a traditional tent is erected under the fly.

'''''Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine''''' is a 2003 [[documentary film]] by [[Vikram Jayanti]] about the match between [[Garry Kasparov]], the highest rated [[chess]] player in history (at the time) and the [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] for 15 years (1985&amp;ndash;2000), and [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], a chess-playing computer created by [[IBM]].  It was coproduced by [[Alliance Atlantis]] and the [[National Film Board of Canada]].

==Synopsis==
Kasparov had beaten Deep Blue, a computer designed specifically to beat him, in a match played in 1996.&lt;ref name = "boston"/&gt; He agreed to offer a rematch the following year. Kasparov won the first game of the rematch easily with the white pieces.&lt;ref name = "boston"/&gt; In the second game, Kasparov was struggling with the black pieces, but set a trap that most computers fall for.&lt;ref name = "boston"/&gt; Deep Blue didn't fall for it and won to level the match. At the time it was reported that both Kasparov and Deep Blue missed a [[perpetual check]] that could have given Kasparov a draw,&lt;ref name = "boston"/&gt; but the strongest computer chess engines today, for example [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], don't consider the final position as draw, but as having better winning chances for white, contradicting the human analysis at the time that Kasparov missed an opportunity to enter into a perpetual check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://analysis.cpuchess.com/?fen=1r6%2F5kp1%2FRqQb1p1p%2F1p1PpP2%2F1Pp1B3%2F2P4P%2F6P1%2F5K2%20b%20-%20-%2014%2045&amp;lmove=Ra6 | title=Online computer analysis of the final position of game 2 | accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chess.com/blog/FirebrandX/kasparov---deep-blue-1997-everyone-was-wrong | title=Kasparov - Deep Blue 1997: History gets it wrong! | accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next three matches ended in draws, with Kasparov appearing to weaken psychologically. Deep Blue went on to win the decisive [[Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|sixth game]], marking the first time in history that a computer defeated the World Champion in a match of several games.

From this experience, particularly the second game of the match, Kasparov accused the IBM team of cheating. He suspected that a human player was used during the games to improve the strategic strength of the computer. As a metaphor for this suspicion, the film weaves in the story of [[the Turk]], a hoax involving a chess-playing automaton built in the eighteenth century, but secretly operated by human beings. The film also implies that Deep Blue's heavily promoted victory was a plot by IBM to boost the company's market value.

==Reception==
''Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine'' received mixed reviews from critics. Among the positive reviews, Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' called ''Game Over'' a "solid documentary" that is "fairly suspenseful".&lt;ref&gt;Review by Lou Lumenick, ''New York Post'', December 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Lim of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' called ''Game Over'' a "gripping documentary".&lt;ref&gt;Review by Dennis Lim, Village Voice, November 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Jami Bernard of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called it "a nail-biter".

Peter Hartlaub of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', however, called ''Game Over'' "a film with one big question and no visible attempt to find any answers."&lt;ref&gt;Review by Peter Hartlaub, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', February 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous reviewers criticized ''Game Over'' for being biased toward Kasparov and making accusations against IBM without presenting evidence for its claims, including Robert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921798.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Review by Robert Koehler], Variety&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Crust of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-game18mar18,1,4901468.story Review by Kevin Crust], ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Booth of ''[[The Denver Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Review by Michael Booth, ''Denver Post'', December 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Liam Lacey of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20050304.wxkasparov04%2FBNStory%2FEntertainment%2F&amp;ord=116139804&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true Review by Liam Lacey], ''Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; Janice Page of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',&lt;ref name = "boston"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=7540 |title=Showy moves don't go far in chess documentary 'Game Over'|first=Janice |last=Page|work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=January 14, 2005|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ned Martel of [[The New York Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/movies/when-superman-met-supermachine.html?mcubz=1|title=When Superman Met Supermachine|first=Ned|last=Martel|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 6, 2004|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HighPoint.com Stadium''' is the [[college football|football]] [[stadium]] at [[Rutgers-New Brunswick|Rutgers University]] in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]]. It is located on the [[Busch Campus (Rutgers University)|Busch Campus]] at Rutgers, and overlooks the [[Raritan River]] to the South. The stadium was opened as ''Rutgers Stadium'' on September 3, 1994,&lt;ref name=sk_stad_new&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Stadium History : The New Stadium | work = The Official Site of Rutgers Athletics | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | url = http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium3.asp | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090429090313/http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium3.asp# | archive-date = 2009-04-29 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] hosted the [[Kent State University]] [[Kent State Golden Flashes|Golden Flashes]]. It currently seats 52,454 spectators after a 2009 expansion.

==Current facilities==
HighPoint.com underwent significant reconstruction from 2008 to 2009 to increase its capacity to 52,454. The stadium features two 5,000-seat upper decks on each side of the playing field, as well as 968 [[Box (theatre)|loge]] and [[club seating|club seats]] on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level of the East side of the stadium. A two-story press box sits on the mezzanine level of the West side of the stadium.&lt;ref name= stadium_exp/&gt; Electronic ribbon scoreboards spanning the length of the field along the bottom of both upper decks were installed prior to the 2008 season, which complement the video [[scoreboard]] in the South end zone. Also located in the South end zone is the Brown Football Recruiting Pavilion and Welcome Center, part of the 2008–2009 expansion project.

The stadium also features light stanchions that allow for night games, a [[cannon]] for firing when Rutgers scores, concessions, and restrooms. Until 2004, the field maintained a grass surface, but has since been replaced with [[Field Turf]].

==History==
The [[1869 college football season|first intercollegiate football game]], in which Rutgers beat [[Princeton University|Princeton]] 6–4 on November 6, 1869, was played at '''College Field''', which is now the location of the [[College Avenue Gymnasium]] and its parking lot.&lt;ref name=sk_stad_early&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Stadium History : The Early Years | work = The Official Site of Rutgers Athletics | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | url = http://scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium.asp | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090130012940/http://scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium.asp# | archive-date = 2009-01-30 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1891 to 1938, the Rutgers football team played at '''Neilson Field''' on the College Avenue Campus in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=sk_stad_early/&gt;

With the aid of grants from the [[Works Progress Administration]], and after three years of construction, the original [[Rutgers Stadium (1938)|Rutgers Stadium]] was completed in 1938. The first game in the new stadium was against [[Hampden–Sydney College|Hampden-Sydney]] in front of an estimated crowd of about 10,000 persons. Rutgers was victorious in the contest, defeating Hampden-Sydney 32–0.&lt;ref name="sk_stad_dep"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Stadium History : The Depression Years | work = The Official Site of Rutgers Athletics | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | url = http://scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium1.asp | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081221021455/http://scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium1.asp# | archive-date = 2008-12-21 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was dedicated on November 5, 1938 in a game against Princeton. Rutgers would go on to win the game 20-18. It was the first time Rutgers had defeated Princeton since the first ever intercollegiate football game in 1869.&lt;ref name="sk_stad_ded"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Stadium History : The Dedication Game Through the Centennial Game | work = The Official Site of Rutgers Athletics | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | url = http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium2.asp | accessdate = May 4, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100113125935/http://scarletknights.com/football/history/stadium2.asp# | archive-date = 2010-01-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 1969, Rutgers and Princeton met for The Centennial Game at old Rutgers Stadium, which was played in front of 31,000 fans. Rutgers would win 29-0, their 10th win in 60 tries against the Tigers.&lt;ref name = "sk_stad_ded"/&gt;

The current stadium was built on the site of the original old Rutgers Stadium. During the construction of the current stadium, the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team played the [[1993 in sports|1993]] season at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], a facility operated by the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] (NJSEA). The NJSEA financed the construction of the stadium via the issuance of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].&lt;ref name=sk_stad_new/&gt; The Scarlet Knights had previously played several games at Giants Stadium, including the first college football game hosted at that venue: a 47-0 victory over [[Columbia University]] on October 23, 1976.&lt;ref name = "rut_col"&gt;{{cite news | last = White | first = Gordon S., Jr. | title = Passes Griffin as Pitt Rolls by 45-0; Rutgers Routs Columbia, 47-0, For 14 in Row | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 24, 1976 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F1EFD3B5D15768FDDAD0A94D8415B868BF1D3 | accessdate = January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Rutgers Stadium was originally constructed to accommodate 41,500 fans at its maximum capacity and was officially opened on September 3, 1994, in a game against Kent State University. Light stanchions were integrated into the design so night games could be played. A two-story press box that fits 200 reporters was also constructed and is still in use today. A free-standing scoreboard was built near the south end zone, which did not originally contain any seating areas. The original design of the stadium replicated the shape of a [[horseshoe]], with the "open" end located near the south end zone.&lt;ref name=sk_stad_new/&gt;

Heralded by many newspapers, sports writers, and Rutgers fans as the "most important game in Rutgers history", on November 9, 2006, a then record crowd of 44,111&lt;ref name="att_rec"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Stadium Records | work = The Official Site of Rutgers Athletics | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | url = http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/records-stadium.asp | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907030707/http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/records-stadium.asp# | archive-date = 2009-09-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; attended a football game between the Scarlet Knights and the [[2006 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville Cardinals]] at Rutgers Stadium. The Scarlet Knights were ranked #15 and the Louisville Cardinals #3 in the nation in the [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|Associated Press poll]] at the time. The game drew the ESPN's third-largest TV audience for a college football game up to that point in time.&lt;ref name = "espn_rec"&gt;{{cite news| last = Hiestrand | first = Michael | title = NBC benefits from flexible Sunday night football scheduling | work = [[USA Today]] | date = November 13, 2006 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-11-13-flex-schedule_x.htm | accessdate = January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official attendance exceeded the normal maximum capacity of the stadium due to the temporary addition of bleachers in the South end zone of the stadium. The bleachers were used to seat additional students.

===Stadium expansion (2008–2009)===
[[File:Rutgers Stadium expansion.jpg|thumb|left|The exterior of the stadium's expansion seen from River Road, under construction on September 26, 2009.]]
[[File:RutgersScoreboard.jpg|thumb|left|The newly expanded South End zone at Rutgers Stadium, pictured after the 2010 spring game. Note the Brown Football Recruiting Pavilion and Welcome Center located in the center of the seating area, as well as the brand new scoreboard.]]
In January 2008, the Board of Governors of Rutgers University announced a $102 million stadium expansion project in order to increase the stadium's [[seating capacity]] to nearly 56,000.&lt;ref name=sk_expansion&gt;{{cite press release | title = Rutgers Board of Governors Approves Stadium Expansion | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | date = January 29, 2008 | url = http://www.scarletknights.com/football/news/release.asp?prID=6088 | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623034459/http://www.scarletknights.com/football/news/release.asp?prID=6088# | archive-date = 2008-06-23 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scale of the project was slightly reduced due to a poor economy and financial difficulties, resulting in a new maximum capacity of precisely 52,454.&lt;ref name = "stadium_exp"/&gt;

The first phase of the project, which included  the addition 968 club seats and related infrastructure to the East mezzanine level of the stadium, was completed on time and within budget for the 2008 football season.&lt;ref name=stad_fund_2&gt;{{cite press release | title = Statements from the Administration | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | date = December 12, 2008 | url = http://www.scarletknights.com/stadium/president.html | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090126074839/http://scarletknights.com/stadium/president.html# | archive-date = 2009-01-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase included the addition of approximately 11,500 seats to the previously "open" South end zone, as well as supplementary restrooms and concession stands to the southern end of the stadium.&lt;ref name=stad_fund_2/&gt;  The second phase of the project also involved the addition of a large scoreboard in the South end zone, which is 38' tall by 112' wide, for a total surface area of 4,256 sq ft.&lt;ref name = "scuttle_article"&gt;{{cite news | title = Rutgers Scoreboard Among Biggest in Country | publisher = MyCentralJersey | date = August 17, 2009 | url = http://blogs.mycentraljersey.com/rutgers/2009/08/17/rutgers-scoreboard-among-biggest-in-country/ | accessdate = May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old scoreboard (since demolished) was 22' tall by 30' wide, for a total surface area of {{convert|660|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The sound system was also enhanced as a part of the second phase of the expansion.&lt;ref name=stadium_exp&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Stadium – Home of the Scarlet Knights | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | url = http://scarletknights.com/football/stadium/stadium.asp | accessdate = May 2, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100502053653/http://www.scarletknights.com/football/stadium/stadium.asp# | archive-date = 2010-05-02 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to adding seats, concession stands, and bathrooms to the south end zone, the stadium expansion project called for a new entrance off River Road.&lt;ref name= stadium_exp/&gt; The facade of the entrance is adorned with [[brownstone]], and as of May 2, 2010, was not fully completed.

====Brown Football Recruiting Pavilion and Welcome Center====
On July 14, 2009, the Rutgers Board of Governors unanimously approved a $5 million donation specifically appropriated for a recruiting lounge in the newly expanded end zone. The lounge had been included in the original expansion design, but was later deferred after the Board of Governors revised the expansion financing plan. The donation was provided by two Rutgers alumni. The lounge was named after one of the donors, [[Greg Brown (businessman)|Greg Brown]], who is the President and Co-CEO of [[Motorola]]. The second donor requested anonymity. Construction on the lounge commenced in August 2009, and was completed in December of that same year.&lt;ref name = "stadium_exp"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "recruiting_lounge"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers approves privately funded recruiting lounge as part of football stadium expansion | publisher = The Star Ledger | url = http://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2009/07/rutgers_approves_privately_fun.html | accessdate = July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility seats approximately 300 people and serves as a multi-purpose center for the university. The pavilion hosts and accommodates recruits around the year and also holds fundraising events for potential donors. The center is also used during tours for prospective students.&lt;ref name= stadium_exp/&gt;

====Expansion financing plan====
The $102 million price tag of the expansion project was to originally be financed via private fundraising ($30 million) and the issuance of bonds ($72 million).&lt;ref name=stad_fund_1&gt;{{cite press release | title = Statements from the Administration | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | date = January 29, 2008 | url = http://www.scarletknights.com/stadium/president.html | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090126074839/http://scarletknights.com/stadium/president.html# | archive-date = 2009-01-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The private fundraising effort, however, fell significantly short of the original goal.&lt;ref name = "sl_fundraise"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sherman | first = Ted |author2=Margolin, Josh | title = Fundraising for Rutgers Stadium falls far short | work = [[The Star-Ledger]] | date = September 10, 2008 | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/a_private_fundraising_effort_t.html | accessdate = January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation prompted the Board of Governors of Rutgers University to approve a new financing plan for the stadium expansion in which the entire amount of $102 million was to be borrowed. Specifically, the university issued $85 million in bonds, and borrowed the remaining $17 million by way of low-interest commercial paper.&lt;ref name=stad_fund_2/&gt; In addition, a few aspects of the stadium expansion project were scaled back, including a reduction in the number of new seats (the original plan called for 14,000 seats, but only 11,500 were actually added). Also included in the original expansion plan was the construction of new locker rooms in the South end zone. The construction of these locker rooms was deferred to a later date.&lt;ref name=stad_fund_2/&gt;

====Naming rights====
For decades, ''Rutgers Stadium'' had been the name of the school's football facility. However, in June 2010, Rutgers University put up for sale the naming rights to the stadium in order to bring in much needed revenue. Rutgers hired Brooklyn Sports &amp; Entertainment and IMG College to act as agents in making a deal, who had previously negotiated deals on the now-[[Brooklyn Nets]]' home arenas in [[Izod Center|New Jersey]] and [[Barclays Center|New York]].&lt;ref name = "naming_rights_northjersey"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers to sell naming rights to stadium, arena | work = NorthJersey.com | publisher = North Jersey Media Group Inc. | date = June 30, 2010 | url = http://www.northjersey.com/sports/063010_Rutgers_looking_to_name_stadium_athletic_center.html | accessdate = September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 2011, it was announced that High Point Solutions, based in Sparta, New Jersey, had purchased the rights, and that the stadium would be known as High Point Solutions Stadium. In May 2018, High Point Solutions announced they were rebranding the company to just be HighPoint.com. As a result, the name of the stadium was changed to HighPoint.com Stadium.

==Attendance records==
[[File:Rutgers Stadium.jpg|thumb|Scarlet Knights vs. Cincinnati Bearcats with 43,768 spectators.]]
The stadium attendance records were repeatedly broken throughout the 2006 and 2007 football seasons as the football program experienced a drastic resurgence. On October 18, 2007, a record 44,267 spectators attended a game in which the Scarlet Knights played against the then #2 ranked [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida Bulls]].&lt;ref name=att_rec/&gt;&lt;ref name="beat_usf"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rutgers Upends No. 2/3 South Florida 30-27 | work = Official Website of Rutgers Athletics.

The new record was set in the 2014 [[Big Ten Conference]] opener against the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]], when 53,774 people packed the venue to witness the first game in Big Ten Conference play after transferring from the [[American Athletic Conference]] before the 2014 season.&lt;ref name = "ru_PENN"/&gt; This record still stands today.

==Other events==
In addition to football, HighPoint.com Stadium has been the home of Rutgers' men's and women's lacrosse teams since 2014.

The stadium has also hosted [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] tournament [[college soccer|soccer]] and [[lacrosse (sport)#College lacrosse|lacrosse]] games, including the [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]] games in 1998, 2001, and 2002. It is also worth noting that, prior to 1994, the original Rutgers Stadium hosted the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship games in 1974, 1978, 1983, 1987, and 1990.

On September 25, 2005, Rutgers Stadium was the site of a lecture delivered by the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="dalai_lama"&gt;{{cite web | last = Alvarez | first = Ashanti | title = Dalai Lama charms, uplifts New Jersey | work = Rutgers Focus | publisher = Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey | date = October 10, 2005 | url = http://ur.rutgers.edu/focus/article/Dalai%20Lama%20charms,%20uplifts%20New%20Jersey/1639/ | accessdate = January 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081113132547/http://ur.rutgers.edu/focus/article/Dalai%20Lama%20charms,%20uplifts%20New%20Jersey/1639/# | archive-date = 2008-11-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was a host venue for the [[1995 U.S. Cup]] soccer tournament and hosted [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] vs. [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] on June 17, 1995 and the [[United States Men's National Soccer Team|United States]] vs. Colombia on June 25, 1995.

Every first weekend in December, Rutgers Stadium plays hosts to several championship games in the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association|NJSIAA]] state football playoffs. The stadium is one of two venues that hosts multiple championship games in one weekend ([[MetLife Stadium]] is the other). However, unlike MetLife Stadium that hosts games on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons, Rutgers hosts games on Sundays in addition to its Friday and Saturday games (MetLife Stadium is unavailable for Sunday games due to its [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments).

Every year in October, Rutgers Stadium hosts USBands Marching Band New Jersey State Championships.

Since 2011, University Commencement has been held in HighPoint.com Stadium each May. On May 15, 2016, President Obama addressed the class of 2016 and received an honorary degree of laws. Over 50,000 guests and graduates attended this historic day to celebrate the 250th Anniversary Commencement.

'''Hoshino Impul Co., Ltd.''', (known as '''Impul''') is a Japanese automotive aftermarket company based in [[Setagaya-ku]], Tokyo. Founded by [[Nissan]]'s factory driver, [[Kazuyoshi Hoshino]], the company exclusively produces aftermarket parts for Nissans, such as [[bodykit]]s, engine components as well as wheels.

==History==
The company was founded in 1980 by the [[Nissan]] works driver, [[Kazuyoshi Hoshino]] in Maruko-cho, [[Shizuoka Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teams|url=http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fn_eng/driversT/teams.php?t=05|publisher=F-Nippon (F-Japan)|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within months, Impul produced its first product, the ''IMPUL D-01'' wheel, which to promote it, it found its way on Hoshino's [[Group 5 (racing)|Gr. 5]] [[Nissan Silvia|Silvia]] racing competing in the Formula Silhouette, a [[Fuji Grand Champion]] support series, as well as starting a Tokyo-based sales center in Sayama-shi, [[Saitama-ken]]. A year later, that was relocated in [[Kichijōji]], Musashino-shi.

In 1983, Hoshino formed Hoshino Racing Limited, a racing team to help promote his products and because of expansion, he relocated his company in Shimorenjaku, [[Mitaka, Tokyo|Mitaka]] as well as establishing a depot nearby.

In 1987, Impul offered its first fully tuned car, the IMPUL 630R, a tuned Y31 [[Nissan Gloria|Gloria]]/[[Nissan Cedric|Cedric]].

In 2002, the racing relocated to [[Gotemba, Shizuoka]]. After that, the company began to focus on tuning cars and has since tuned the [[Infiniti M]], which became the Impul 6515,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tutu|first=Andrei|title=Infiniti M Becomes Impul 6515|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/infiniti-m-becomes-impul-651s-29679.html|publisher=AutoEvolution|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nissan Juke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radu|first=Mihnea|title=Tuning Overkill: Impul Gives Nissan Juke a Mugen Look|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/tuning-overkill-impul-gives-nissan-juke-a-mugen-look-36252.html|publisher=AutoEvolution|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples of Impul's tuning has changes to the bumpers, engines, brakes, tires, exhaust system, among other things. [[VIP style]] is the common element Impul has incorporated on.

==Motorsport==
Since 1983, the company ran its own racing team which found success in domestic series such as [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|JTCC]], [[Formula Nippon]] and [[Super GT]]. Hoshino was the first driver to win in the team's [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|R32 GT-R]] during a JTCC race in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calsonic/Team Impul Fairlady Nissan 350Z|url=http://www.turbomagazine.com/features/0505tur_fairlady_nissan_350z/|publisher=Turbo Magazine|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Hoshino, notable Impul drivers include [[Masahiko Kageyama]] (1993 Japanese Touring Car Championship winner), [[Satoshi Motoyama]] (2001, 2003 and 2005 Formula Nippon champion), [[Benoît Tréluyer]] (2006 Formula Nippon champion), [[Tsugio Matsuda]] (2007 and 2008 Formula Nippon champion), [[Yuji Ide]], and [[Kohei Hirate]]. Its primary sponsor since 1996 is auto parts supplier [[Calsonic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2929">[[Image:Bloemketerp072007 2.jpg|right|thumb|Girls playing 1-walled fronton]]

The '''International fronton''' is an ''indirect style'' [[ball game]] created to bring together some varieties (such as [[American handball]], [[Basque pelota]], [[Patball]], [[Gaelic handball]], [[Welsh handball|Pêl-Law (Welsh handball)]] and [[Valencian fronto|Valencian frontó]]), and to be played in the [[Handball International Championships]]. It is known as '''One Wall Handball'''.

== Courtfield ==
[[Image:Mkbaan.png|right|thumb|International Fronton courtfield]]
''International fronton'' takes back its courtfield to the most basic version of the indirect style: One wall where the ball must bounce.

This only wall, the [[Fronton (court)|fronton]], is 6,10m wide and 4,90m high. From the left and right corners two lines are drawn on the ground, 10,60m long, that mark the place into which the ball may bounce, this is the courtfield.

There must be some free space out the courtfield (1,80 wide) for the players to play balls that are risking to bounce twice.

At 4,90m from the fronton wall there is a line on the ground, the fault line. The serving player must throw the ball before that line, and the ball must surpass it after bouncing on the fronton.

At 10,60m from the fronton there is another line on the ground, the back line, which the ball may not bounce from.

In agreement with [[American handball]] (and unlike [[Basque pelota]] and [[Valencian fronto|Valencian frontó]]) there is no left or back wall, the ball may bounce on the lines, and, specially, there is no line on the fronton for the ball to ball over.

== Ball ==
The ''International fronton'' ball is a synthetic one, without any default colour. Diameter: 4,80&amp;nbsp;cm, weight: 65gr.

== Rules ==
Two players (1 against 1) or four players (2 against 2) play to score points until one of them attain two sets (composed by 21 points).

(In case of a tie, 1-1 sets, a third set is played, where the first service is done by the winner of the previous set)

Players strike the ball with the hand so that it bounces on the fronton and falls into the courtfield. Whoever fails to do so commits a fault and so loses a point, then the opponent serves.

A fault is committed if:
* The player hits the ball with any other part of the body but the hand,
* The ball doesn't bounce on the fronton,
* The ball's first bounce on the ground is out the courtfield,
* The player strikes the ball after a second bounce on the ground.

'''Jubilee Stadium''', also known as '''Kogarah Oval''', is a multipurpose stadium in [[Carlton, New South Wales|Carlton]], [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The stadium is primarily used for [[rugby league]] and secondary used for the [[A-League]], and is one of the home grounds of the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) team [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]]. The stadium has hosted [[association football|soccer]] matches, including hosting [[Sydney Olympic FC]] in the [[National Soccer League]] (2003-04 season) and currently [[Sydney FC]] in the [[A-league]] (2018-19 season).

The ground hosted its first game of rugby league in March 1936 when the [[St. George Dragons]] were defeated by the [[Newtown Jets|Newtown Bluebags]] in an exhibition match. The stadium has undergone several constructions over the years and one is still being planned for the foreseeable future. The first official game was played on 22 April 1950 in which the Dragons lost 17-15 to [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]].&lt;ref name="kogarah-firstmatch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kogarah.nsw.gov.au/about-kogarah/sporting-history/jubilee-oval | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219171505/http://www.kogarah.nsw.gov.au/about-kogarah/sporting-history/jubilee-oval | dead-url=yes | archive-date=19 February 2013 | title=Jubilee Oval - The history of Kogarah's iconic sports ground | publisher=Kogarah City Council | accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapping software &amp; websites when asked to find Kogarah Oval, Jubilee Stadium or Oval, often confuse the stadium with the Jubilee Park Oval located in [[Glebe, New South Wales]] on the [[Rozelle Bay]] foreshore.

==History==
Jubilee Stadium currently stands on part of the original grant of {{convert|87|acre|m2}} awarded on 23 December 1853 to Archibald McNab. Edmund English purchased the grant on 23 May 1854 for around 400 pounds. It officially became known as Kogarah Park when it was acquired by the Department of Lands on 1 July 1896 and dedicated as the first public park in [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]]. Control of the park was eventually passed to the Council of the Municipality of Kogarah on 29 August 1906.

During Kogarah’s Jubilee celebrations in 1935, Jubilee Stadium was constructed in Kogarah Park.

==Development==
The ground was closed from 1986 until the end of 1988 because of the construction of the new grandstand being built on the western side of the ground. During this time the Dragons played their home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]] and [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]], while using [[Belmore Oval]], the home of the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]], in [[1988 NSWRL season|1988]].

Since 2003, Jubilee Stadium has been steadily upgraded in a three-stage plan, funded by the NSW State Government and Federal Government. In 2006, the ground had been updated with new features to the seating around the grandstand and features directly out of the stadium including re-developments to the Hall of Fame walk and Kogarah Park in front of the stadium. Stage 1 consisted of new terraced seating at the north-western end, perimeter seating at the base of the hill, and a regrassed and raised hill area. Floodlights for televising night matches were also installed.

In 2007, the Dragons announced that they would not be playing home games at Kogarah for the [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008 season]] so that Stage 2 redevelopment of the ground could be completed with new roofed extension on the Southern side of the main grandstand increasing capacity by around 2000, and further upgrading to the hill area, including turnstile facilities and strengthening the retaining wall at the Southern Jubilee Avenue end. The Dragons returned for 2009 against the Sharks in round 3, and broke the club record for highest Crowd at the ground.

In 2010, the Dragons secured $13m from the NSW State Government to complete the Stage 3 Northern grandstand extension, with an additional 1580 seats and the replacement of 1730 seats in the existing main grandstand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/NewsViews/LatestNews/NewsArticle/tabid/10874/newsId/60603/Default.aspx $13 million Govt boost to upgrade WIN Jubilee Oval - NRL.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also included in the development are additional public toilets and facilities, refurbishment of the existing grandstand facilities including the team change rooms, a new passenger and service lift, additional corporate and multi purpose facilities, and a museum and merchandise store.

A new digital scoreboard and several satellite scoreboards, new security system, turnstiles and ticketing facilities at Gate B and a rainwater harvesting tank were also installed around the ground during 2010 and 2011. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons.com.au/default.aspx?s%3Darticle-display%26id%3D32333%26work-continuing-at-dragons-home-venues |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215012516/http://www.dragons.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&amp;id=32333&amp;work-continuing-at-dragons-home-venues |archivedate=15 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming Rights==
From 1950 until 2003, the ground was simply known as Jubilee Oval.

In 2003, printing and data communications company [[Oki Electric Industry|OKI]] signed a five-year sponsorship deal for naming rights to the ground with the name becoming OKI Jubilee Stadium. In October, 2008, OKI Printing Solutions decided not to renew the naming rights of Jubilee Oval, as the Dragons played at [[ANZ Stadium]] during the 2008 season due to re-developments at Jubilee. The naming rights ended on 31 October with the park reverting to its former name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135412/http://www.r2k.info/news/okiquitsjubilee2008.html|title=OKI quits Jubilee}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was officially announced on 25 December 2008, that [[WIN Corporation]] had bought the naming rights for Jubilee Oval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stgeorge.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/win-comes-to-jubilee-oval/1394165.aspx |title=WIN comes to Jubilee Oval |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226225835/http://stgeorge.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/win-comes-to-jubilee-oval/1394165.aspx |archivedate=26 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this agreement, WIN owned the naming rights to both of St. George Illawarra's home grounds, WIN Jubilee Oval and [[WIN Stadium]]. In early 2014, WIN backed out of this sponsorship, with the ground once again reverting to its original name. From 2016, the [[University of Wollongong]] held the rights to the ground for a two-year period, ending in late 2017. The ground was known as "UOW Jubilee Oval".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons.com.au/news/2016/05/11/uow_jubilee_oval_ann.html|title=UOW Jubilee Oval Announcement|publisher=www.dragons.com.au|date=11 May 2016|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Rugby league===

====St. George DRLFC====
The [[St. George DRLFC]] which commenced competing in Sydney's top level in the [[1921 NSWRFL season]], had an unsuccessful debut game at Jubilee Oval in 1936 when they were defeated by [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]] in an exhibition match as part of the Jubilee celebrations.&lt;ref name="kogarah-firstmatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smh-exhibition"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17317594 | title=Rugby League - Exhibition Match | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=16 March 1936 | accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gate-takings from the match were donated to the St. George Hospital. Saints at this stage were still based at Arncliffe’s [[Earl Park, Arncliffe|Earl Park]] and it wasn’t until 1950 that Saints returned home to Jubilee Stadium.

The Dragons played their first official match at the ground on 22 April 1950 against the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] before 12,500 fans. The Dragons lost a rather exciting match 17-15 but defeat would become quite a rare sight for the Dragons over the coming decades while at Kogarah.

St. George were based at Kogarah during their world record breaking 11 successive premierships from 1956 to 1966. They set a record at Kogarah and were not beaten at home for an astonishing twelve years: originally beaten by the [[Balmain Tigers]] on 26 June 1954 at Kogarah which was just before the beginning of the streak. It wasn’t until 31 July 1966, that they tasted defeat at Kogarah again, eventually losing 12-9 to the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].

In 1950, the Dragons began a permanent association with the ground. Around this time was also when St. George legend [[Norm Provan]] joined the club and he said of Kogarah:

{{cquote|The qualities of the club from Kogarah are not easy for me to put into words... Saints are special. I will certainly never forget my years at Kogarah, and at the club across the Princes Highway. At St.George I found qualities that enriched my life - friendship, unswerving loyalty, fair play and healthy ambition, the learning to win, and to lose.}}

The team was based at Jubilee Stadium right up until the completion of the 1985 season. They then chose to abandon the ground and relocated to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. The decision was one which they would come to dread. In 1985 St. George had been Club champions, 1st Grade Minor premiers, 1st Grade Runners-Up, Reserve Grade Premiers and Under-23s Premiers. In 1986 Saints missed the semi-finals in all 3 grades for the first time in 50 years. The fans of the club became angry at the club's decision and stayed away from the club in droves while the Dragons remained at the SCG for a further season.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In 1988 the opportunity came for the club to relocate again. Instead of moving back to Jubilee they decided to move to [[Belmore Sports Ground|Belmore Oval]]. Finally, in 1988 it was decided that the Saints would move home to Jubilee in 1989 with a new stand to be constructed for the 1990 season.

The club yet again moved in the late 90's and explained to fans the decision was on the basis that Jubilee was too small to accommodate a proposed $30 million stadium complex to meet [[National Rugby League|NRL]] requirements for playing venues. In a joint statement, Kogarah Council and St. George DRLFC stated that the scale of the proposed 20,000 seat stadium would exceed the size of Jubilee Oval and affect residents. The decision to leave Jubilee upset many of St George Illawarra's loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it and in July 2000 many supporters held a rally in support of the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

====St George Illawarra Dragons====
[[File:Jubilee Oval in 2018.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the ground prior to a match between the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] in August 2018.]]
The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], formed as the result of a merger between St George and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] in 1999, use Kogarah as one of their home grounds in the [[National Rugby League]], along with the Steelers former home, [[WIN Stadium]] in [[Wollongong]]. The newly formed Dragons used Kogarah in the [[1999 NRL season]], before moving their games to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (SFS) in 2000.

From 2000 until 2002, after many loyal Dragons supporters held a rally and Information Night to persuade the club to move back to Jubilee Stadium (while at the SFS, the team had continued using WIN Stadium), the club did so and would be yet again occupying the famous [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league ground]]. During these 3 years that the Dragons did not play at Kogarah, there were talks with the club that they would play at the nearby [[St George Soccer Stadium]], but plans fell through and the soccer stadium has since fallen into disrepair. The Dragons returned to Kogarah in 2003 after a high number of protests and rallies held by supporter group R2K (or Return to Kogarah).

Lights were installed at Kogarah in 2006, with the Dragons christening their first night game at the ground with an 8-1 win over the [[Parramatta Eels]] in Round 13 of the [[2006 NRL season|2006 season]]. The game was played in driving rain, which many gave as the reason for a crowd of only 9,075 in attendance.

The club did not play at the ground in [[2008 NRL season|2008]] because of renovations of the south-western end grandstand being built. During this time, the Dragons played at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]. They returned to Kogarah in [[2009 NRL season|2009]], where they have remained ever since.

===Soccer===
[[Sydney Olympic FC]] played at Jubilee Stadium in their 2003/2004 season, competing in the [[National Soccer League]].

On 4 December 2011, it marked the first time an [[A-League]] club played a first grade competition game at the venue, with [[Sydney FC]] playing [[Brisbane Roar FC]], in front of a crowd of 11,555.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121230125906/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/sydneyfc/news-display/Lavicka%20laments%20another%20slow%20start/43051 Lavicka laments another slow start], [[Football Federation Australia]], 28 November 2011. Retrieved on 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney won 2-0, and this game itself would be remembered as the game the Roar lost its first match in the last 36 matches.

In 2014, the [[St George FC|St George Saints]] got promoted to the [[NSW Premier League]], and moved to this ground as their home-ground stadium. Also, [[Sydney FC W-League|Sydney FC]] played a few games at this ground in the [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] during their 2013/2014 season.

The [[Socceroos]] have held several open training sessions at this ground since 2013.

Sydney FC are using this ground as their primary home venue for the 2018-2019 A-League season, as their usual home ground, the [[Sydney Football Stadium]], is being demolished and a new stadium built on its site. The fan base showed great support for this - having a sellout 19,081 attend their first home match there, against [[Melbourne Victory]] 25 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sydneyfc.com/news/sydney-fc-sell-out-bigblue-jubilee-stadium Sydney FC Sell Out #BigBlue At Jubilee Stadium] Sydney Football Club&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[Carlton railway station, Sydney|Carlton railway station]] is located a few hundred metres from the ground.

==Attendance record==
The ground record attendance for Jubilee Stadium was set in May 1975 when St. George took on South Sydney in front of 23,582 fans. In its modern form, the record attendance is 20,847 when the Dragons took on local rivals the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla Sharks]] in March 2009.

The record soccer match attendance was on 25 November, 2018, when Sydney FC took on Melbourne Victory in the A-League in front of a crowd of 19,081.

'''Kometal Gjorče Petrov Skopje''' ({{lang-mk|Ракометен Клуб Кометал Ѓорче Петров}}) was a female [[Team handball|handball]] club based in [[Skopje]], the capital of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].
== History ==

The club was founded in 1979 under the name ''Handball Club Gjorče Petrov''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrhl.info/2008072356/Newsflash/represent-kometal-gjorce-petrov.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907200345/http://www.wrhl.info/2008072356/Newsflash/represent-kometal-gjorce-petrov.html |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since  1992, it had won 17 national championships 16 national cups, losing only the cup in 1994.

'''Latham Baseball Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] [[Baseball field|venue]] located in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[South Carolina]], [[United States of America|USA]].  It is home to the [[Furman University|Furman]] Paladins [[college baseball]] team.  The venue opened in 1956 and has a capacity of 2,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="facil"&gt;[http://www.furmanpaladins.com/athletics/facilities/latham_baseball_stadium Latham Baseball Stadium], URL accessed December 11, 2010. [https://www.webcitation.org/5ututgHCN Archived] 12-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==

The stadium is named after Tommy Latham and his family.  Latham was an All-Conference baseball player at Furman.  The venue was renamed and dedicated to him and his family in May 2008 prior to a conference game against [[Davidson Wildcats|Davidson]], with the park's full name becoming '''John T. and Gloria Latham Baseball Stadium''' (John and Gloria Latham are the parents of the Paladin baseball player Tommy).  The Latham family made a contribution of [[USD|$]]1 million for the park to be renamed.&lt;ref name="dedication"&gt;[https://www.ncaa.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/043008aap.html Furman To Dedicate Latham Baseball Stadium This Saturday] at ncaa.com, URL accessed December 11, 2010. [https://www.webcitation.org/5utv3bsUg Archived] 12-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the renaming, the field had been known as '''Furman Baseball Stadium''' since its construction in 1956.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

==Features==
In 1997, the field's seating areas were renovated, with 300 permanent stadium seats being added behind [[home plate]].  In 2001, lights were added to the facility, allowing night games to be played for the first time.  The first night game was played on April 13, 2001, against [[UNC Greensboro Spartans|UNC Greensboro]].  In 2006, [[batting cage]] was added to the facility; it is located down the [[left field]] line.  The stadium also features a [[press box]], scoreboard, and expanded [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

The '''Lord's slope''' is a geographical gradient at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in London, England. The slope is in the cricket pitch and runs from the north end of the ground to the south end with a drop of {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/father-time-and-the-lords-slope/ |title=Father Time and the Lord's slope |publisher=MCC |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The land on which Lord's was built was originally near a duck pond on a hill in [[St. John's Wood]]. It was leased by [[Thomas Lord]] following a request from [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea]] to find a location where cricket could be played in relative privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/caaa0342-7261-11de-ba94-00144feabdc0.html |title=Grounded on terra firma |work=Financial Times |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord's was built around the slope and was enclosed by stands. In the 21st century, there were calls for the slope to be levelled as a result of the advent of [[drop-in pitch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/4776895/Slopes-future-in-balance.html |title=Slope's future in balance |work=Telegraph |date=2001-05-19 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller ridges in the pitch had previously been removed by surveyors.&lt;ref&gt;

During this work, several small deviations in the pitch were removed, but the slope remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchcare.com/magazine/mallinsons-win-bali-principal-award.html |title=Mallinsons win BALI Principal Award |work=Pitchcare Magazine |date=2003-11-27 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], when Lord's hosted the Archery tournament, there were suggestions that the slope would affect the archers. However, British archer [[Alison Williamson]] rejected this, stating that the slope was barely noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/archery/9408398.stm |title=British archer Alison Williamson not worried by slope |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket ==
The Lord's slope is often used to advantage by bowlers in cricket matches at Lord's. Because of the slope's angles, [[Seam bowling|seam bowlers]] from the [[Lord's Pavilion|Pavilion End]] and [[Swing bowling|swing bowlers]] from the Nursery End gain an advantage as the natural variation of the slope alters the bounce of the ball when bowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Geoffrey Boycott |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/geoffreyboycott/2383325/Harmisons-seamers-hold-key-to-exploiting-Lords-slope.html |title=Harmison's seamers hold key to exploiting Lord's slope |work=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gradient of the slope is noted to affect right-handed batsmen more than left-handed batsmen as the ball naturally moves towards left-handed batsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/henry-blofeld-hoggard-and-harmison-fall-foul-of-lords-slippery-slope-61394.html |title=Henry Blofeld: Hoggard and Harmison fall foul of Lord's slippery slope |work=The Independent |date=2004-05-21 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the advantages the slope gives to bowlers, some batsmen consistently make high scores when playing at Lord's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/10899005/Joe-Root-uses-some-sibling-rivalry-to-complete-historic-double-hundred-for-England-against-Sri-Lanka-at-Lords.html |title=Joe Root uses some sibling rivalry to complete historic double hundred for England against Sri Lanka at Lord's |work=Telegraph |date=2014-05-16 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lota Schwager''' is a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] professional team based in [[Coronel, Chile|Coronel]] that currently play in [[Segunda División de Chile|Segunda División Profesional]] (third-tier).

==History==
Following the merger between [[:es:Federico Schwager|Federico Schwager]] and Minas Lota (teams that competed in [[:es:Campeonato Regional de Concepción|Campeonato Regional de Concepción]] representing [[Lota, Chile|Lota]] and Schwager companies), the club was established on 10 May 1966 under the name of ''"Lota Schwager"'', making reference to both companies latest mentioned. Having their debut–season the same year (where they finished ninth, after a poor campaign), "The Little Lamp" under the coach [[:es:Isaac Carrasco|Isaac Carrasco]] achieved its first promotion to top-division in 1969, where Coronel-based team remained until 1980.

After they won their second [[Primera B (Chile)|Primera B]] title in 1986, Lota returned to first-tier thanks to manager [[:es:Juan Carlos Gangas|Juan Carlos Gangas]]' job, but they only stayed at [[Chilean Primera División|Primera División]] one season, after of defeat the Promotion Play-offs against [[O'Higgins F.C.|O'Higgins]] and [[Regional Atacama]]. Following Coronel mining-crisis of 1994, the club disappeared during seven years, starting out again in 2001 for play as an amateur team in [[Tercera División de Chile|Tercera División]], winning that in they first attempt to reach it.

In 2006, after a good campaign in secondgontier (where even so were four managers who coached Lota: [[:es:Leonardo Vinés|Leonardo Vinés]], Humberto López, Márcio da Silva and Jaime Nova), finishing third in the table behind the champion [[Deportes Melipilla]] and runner-up [[Ñublense]], the team played the Promotion Play-offs against [[Talca]]-based club [[C.S.D. Rangers|Rangers]], which won at their home stadium [[Estadio Federico Schwager|Federico Schwager]] on the penalties thanks to [[Cristián Limenza]]'s performances in the goal saving penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chile06.html |title=Chile 2006 |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McCormick Field''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. It is the home field of the [[Asheville Tourists]] [[minor league baseball]] team. As befits the hilly city of Asheville, the ballpark sits on a section of level ground partway up one of the city's hills, providing a picturesque atmosphere. &lt;ref name=Jarrett&gt;{{cite news |title=On Base with the Asheville Tourists|first=Keith|last=Jarrett|url=http://blogs.citizen-times.com/blogs/index.php?blog=12&amp;p=237&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|newspaper=[[Asheville Citizen Times]]|date=May 14, 2007|accessdate=April 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110812172245/http://blogs.citizen-times.com/blogs/index.php?blog=12&amp;p=237&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|archivedate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the oldest minor-league park in regular use.

==History==
The ballpark was built in 1924 and was named after Asheville resident Lewis McCormick; it is one of the oldest minor-league stadiums still in regular use. Lights were installed for nighttime play prior to the 1930 season.&lt;ref name="nlbpa_ballparks"/&gt; Since then, it has been home to the various incarnations of the Asheville Tourists team, and also served as home field for the [[Asheville Blues]] of the [[Negro Southern League (1945–51)|Negro Southern League]] during the 1940s.&lt;ref name="nlbpa_ballparks"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ballparks of the Negro Leagues and Barnstorming Black Baseball Teams|url=http://www.nlbpa.com/ballparks.html|publisher=Negro League Baseball Players Association|accessdate=June 17, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610073533/http://www.nlbpa.com/ballparks.html|archivedate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The facility was renovated in 1959, and then rebuilt in concrete between the 1991 and 1992 seasons, replacing the largely wood structure which had developed a leaky roof. The 1992 ballpark kept a similar layout to the original McCormick Field. The facility included new expanded restrooms and larger concession stands. New clubhouses were built and lights erected as player and field enhancements. The height of the fence behind the cozy right field area, which was in the vicinity of just {{convert|300|ft|m}} away from home plate, was more than tripled, as it now stands {{convert|36|ft|m}} tall (nearly the same height as [[Fenway Park]]'s "[[Green Monster]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of McCormick Field|first=Bill|last=Ballew|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20131119&amp;content_id=64045212&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_t573&amp;sid=t573|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=November 19, 2013|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McCormick Field from Memorial Stadium.JPG|left|thumb|150px]]

==Other uses==
The ballpark served as one of the settings for the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Local Men Recall 'Bull Durham' Roles|first=Keith|last=Jarrett|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20130616/SPORTS/306160059/|newspaper=[[Asheville Citizen Times]]|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue hosted the 2009 [[Big South Conference Baseball Tournament]], won by [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina]].&lt;ref name=09t&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Carolina Wins Big South Baseball Championship |url=http://www.bigsouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4800&amp;ATCLID=3742296 |publisher=Big South Conference |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531125623/http://www.bigsouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4800&amp;ATCLID=3742296 |archivedate=May 31, 2014 |date=May 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farther up the hill, behind the left field area, is Asheville Memorial Stadium, a football and soccer facility. Its bleacher seating structure is visible from McCormick Field.

The '''NBA All-Rookie Team''' is an annual [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) honor given since the [[1962–63 NBA season]] to the top [[rookie]]s during the regular season. Voting is conducted by the [[List of NBA head coaches|NBA head coaches]]; who are not allowed to vote for players on their own team.&lt;ref name="a2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/all_rookie_080513.html|title=Durant, Horford Headline T-Mobile All-Rookie Team|accessdate=August 13, 2008|date=May 14, 2008|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when [[Kawhi Leonard]], [[Iman Shumpert]], and [[Brandon Knight (basketball)|Brandon Knight]] tied in votes received. No respect is given to positions. For example, the first team had four [[Forward (basketball)|forwards]], and one [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in 2008, while the first team had four [[Center (basketball)|centers]] (two of which were [[forward-center]]s) and one guard in 2016.

'''PNG Football Stadium''' (known as Lloyd Robson Oval until 2015)&lt;ref name="PNG National Football Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|title=PNG National Football Stadium|url=http://populous.com/project/png-national-football-stadium/|publisher=Populous|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sporting ground in [[Port Moresby]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. It hosted 3 games for the [[1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup]]. It has been the home ground for the [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team]] since 1975. It has a total capacity of approximately 15,000 and is the National Stadium of Papua New Guinea. The stadium was completely redeveloped in preparation for the [[2015 Pacific Games]].&lt;ref name="PNG National Football Stadium"/&gt;

==History==
Lloyd Robson Oval hosted its first [[Rugby League]] international on 6 July 1975 when PNG played host to [[England national rugby league team|England]] who were on their way to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] for the down under leg of the [[1975 Rugby League World Cup|1975 World Cup]]. In front of an enthusiastic crowd of 12,000 England ran out 40-12 winners in what was the Kumuls international debut game.

PNG played the [[1982 Kangaroo tour|1982]] and [[1986 Kangaroo tour|1986]] [[Australian Kangaroos|Kangaroos]] at the oval. The Australians, unbeaten on both [[Kangaroo Tour]]s, won both games 38-2 and 62-12 respectively. The 1986 game saw the Oval's record attendance when 17,000 enthusiastic fans saw the Kangaroos defeat the Kumuls.

The opening Test match of the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]] was played at the Oval between Papua New Guinea and the British before a crowd of 12,107.

Lloyd Robson Oval was the primary venue of the [[2009 Pacific Cup]]. The four round-robin matches were played at the ground on 24–25 October and 31 October, with the final played on 1 November 2009.&lt;ref name="ARL-PacCup28-07-2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/news/article.php?id=1323 |publisher=Australian Rugby League |title=Pacific Cup announced |author=ARL (Press Release) |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913135900/http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/news/article.php?id=1323 |archivedate=2009-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oval is also home of the [[Gulf Isapea]], [[Hela Wigmen]], and [[Port Moresby Bulldogs]] who play in the [[Papua New Guinea National Rugby League|PNGNRL Digitel Cup]].

Lloyd Robson is also a regular host of the annual rugby league game between the Kumuls and an [[Prime Minister's XIII|Australian Prime Minister's XIII]] at the conclusion of the Australian-based [[National Rugby League]] season. These games are usually well attended, with 16,000 attending the game in 2012 won 24-18 by the [[Mal Meninga]] coached PM's XIII.

[[Soccer]] is also played at the Lloyd Robson Oval, with both the national men's and women's PNG teams playing matches at the ground, though they both generally use the [[Hubert Murray Stadium]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11665">In sports, the '''practice squad''', also called the '''taxi squad''' or '''practice roster''', is a group of players signed by a team but not part of their main roster. Frequently used in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], they serve as extra players during the team's practices, often as part of the [[Glossary of American football#scout team|scout team]] by emulating an upcoming opponent's play style.  Because the players on the practice squad are familiar with the team's plays and formations, the practice squad serves as a way to develop inexperienced players for promotion to the main roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Jeanna |date=September 2, 2017 |title=Here’s how NFL practice squads work |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/3/12773904/nfl-practice-squad-players-roster-rules-eligibility-primer |work=SB Nation |publisher=Vox Media |location=New York, NY |ref={{sfnRef|"Here’s how NFL practice squads work"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, it provides replacement players for the main roster when players are needed as the result of injuries or other roster moves, such as bereavement leave.{{sfn|"Here’s how NFL practice squads work"}}

==History==
During the 1940s, [[Cleveland Browns]] coach [[Paul Brown]] invented the "taxi squad," a group of promising scouted players who did not make the roster but were kept on reserve.  The team owner, [[Arthur B. McBride|Arthur "Mickey" McBride]], put them on the payroll of his taxi company, although they did not drive cabs.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=95}}  The name stuck, and the practice of retaining a squad of ready reserves spread throughout professional football.  However, the NFL did not officially recognize the existence of taxi squads until February 18, 1965.  On that date, the NFL team owners formally adopted a 40-man active roster supplemented by a taxi squad of unregulated size,&lt;ref name="T-P 2-9-1965"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 9, 1965 |title=NFL Player Limit Okayed |work=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans |at=sec.&amp;nbsp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was officially termed the "future list."&lt;ref name="T-P 9-29-1968"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roesler |first=Bob |date=September 29, 1968 |title=Behind the Sports Scene |work=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans |at=sec.&amp;nbsp;6, p.&amp;nbsp;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few seasons, the NFL gradually limited the allowable number of inactive players to seven, and regulations were established in relation to injured reserve and waiver practices.&lt;ref name="S-I 8-22-1968"&gt;{{cite news |last=Belloni |first=Nat |date=August 22, 1968 |title=Bliss Among the Tall Pines |work=New Orleans States-Item |location=New Orleans |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="T-P 5-6-1970"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roesler |first=Bob |date=May 6, 1970 |title=Behind the Sports Scene |work=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans |at=sec.&amp;nbsp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974, the NFL eliminated the taxi squad altogether, moving the seven inactive spots into an expanded 47-man active roster.&lt;ref name="T-P 9-11-1974"&gt;{{cite news |last=McMillen |first=Larry |date=September 11, 1974 |title=Williams Heads Cuts by Saints |work=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans |at=sec.&amp;nbsp;3, p.&amp;nbsp;1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1977, a more limited inactive system was introduced (often consisting of either two or four players, depending on the season), and these players were sometimes referred to as taxi squad members.&lt;ref name="S-I 9-13-1977"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Bob |date=September 13, 1977 |title=Four More Saints to Go Today |work=The States-Item |location=New Orleans |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TPSI 11-8-1982"&gt;{{cite news |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |date=November 8, 1982 |title=Rozelle: Super Bowl Rooms to be Released |work=The Times-Picayune/The States-Item |location=New Orleans |at=sec.&amp;nbsp;3, p.&amp;nbsp;3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NFL has since reintroduced larger reserve squads, now known as "practice squads."

==National Football League==
Starting in 2017, each NFL team may keep up to ten members on its practice squad in addition to the 53-member main roster. A majority of those on a practice squad are [[rookie]] draft picks and [[undrafted free agent]]s who were released prior to the regular season. A practice squad also includes veterans, up to four as of the {{nfly|2016}} season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Aaron|title=NFL changes rules for practice-squad members|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/NFL-changes-rules-for-practice-squad-members-8318574.php|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may be signed to a practice squad for several reasons: for lack of space on the team, due to injury, or because they require more development. Practice squad players can be signed to any team's 53-man active roster without compensation at any time during the season.

A player cannot participate on the practice squad for more than three seasons; he is eligible for a third season only if the team has at least 53 players on its active/inactive list for the duration of that player's employment, or have no prior accrued seasons in the NFL (an accrued season is six or more games on the active roster); or if he has accrued a year of NFL experience on a club's 53-man active roster. If the player was on the active list for fewer than 9 games during their "only accrued season(s)", he maintains his eligibility for the practice squad. Games in which a player is listed as the third-string quarterback do not count as being on the active list.&lt;ref name="nflpa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflplayers.com/images/fck/NFL%20COLLECTIVE%20BARGAINING%20AGREEMENT%202006%20-%202012.pdf |title=The NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement|accessdate=2009-09-10|publisher=NFL Players Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former quarterback [[Mike Quinn]], who was listed as the third-string quarterback for several teams throughout his career, is a notable example, being practice squad eligible during his 8th NFL season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YbENAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DXIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6787,390756&amp;dq=mike-quinn+steelers|title=Quarterback Quinn Signs Up for Practice Squad|last=Bouchette|first=Ed|date=September 22, 2004|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice squad players practice alongside regular roster players during the week, but they are not allowed to play in actual games. They can be paid considerably less than active squad players; in 2012, the minimum salary for a practice squad player was $5,700 per week, and the minimum rookie salary was $390,000. Some practice squad players are paid considerably more, however. In 2006, the [[New England Patriots]] paid third-year player [[Billy Yates (American football)|Billy Yates]] the full $425,000 he would have earned on the active roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2007/09/19/nfl_hunting_on_fox_leak/ |title=NFL hunting for answer on how Fox got Patriots video |publisher=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2009-07-02 | date=2007-09-19| first1=Mike| last1=Reiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many NFL players spent time on practice squads before finding success in the league, including [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]], [[Jason Peters]], [[Danny Amendola]], [[Danny Woodhead]], [[Arian Foster]] and [[Kyle Cook (American football)|Kyle Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Houston Texans - Arian Foster Profile|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/team/roster/arian-foster/723e6c0c-f534-4b7e-a392-bb3bd6b17e3c|website=Houston Texans|publisher=houstontexans.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patriots.com|url=http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/danny-amendola/108d28ff-135f-453e-8116-2f2f997f8356/|website=Patriots.com|publisher=New England Patriots|accessdate=21 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821194233/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/danny-amendola/108d28ff-135f-453e-8116-2f2f997f8356/|archivedate=21 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International players===
The practice squad has also been used by the NFL and their teams as a way to bring in and train players from outside the United States or Canada, where [[gridiron football]] is not a popular sport. The NFL has operated programs in which selected international players were assigned to teams' practice squads as an extra member who did not count towards a team's maximum practice squad size.

The first, called the International Practice Squad Program, began operation in 2004.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myespn.go.com/blogs/hashmarks/0-7-543/International-practice-squad-players-assigned.html |title=International practice-squad players assigned |last=Williamson |first=Bill |date=12 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911181235/http://myespn.go.com/blogs/hashmarks/0-7-543/International-practice-squad-players-assigned.html |archive-date=11 September 2009 |dead-url=yes |publisher=[[ESPN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Rolando Cantu]] of Mexico was promoted to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]' active roster after spending the previous season on the practice squad as a member of the program.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;[http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/seahawks/2008/05/23/nfl_expands_international_practice_squad NFL Expands International Practice Squad Program], ''[[The News Tribune]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Players from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Japan, and Russia also participated.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; In 2008, the program sponsored sixteen players, the largest amount to date.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; The program was discontinued for 2009. The rule allowing for an extra practice squad player of international origin, however, remained in the NFL's rulebook and teams attempted to use the rule even after the demise of the program. For example, in 2013 the [[Detroit Lions]] attempted to use it to add Norwegian kicker [[Håvard Rugland]] to their practice squad, but were rejected by the NFL, which stated that the rule was meant to be used for players from [[NFL Europe]], which folded after the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/12/kickalicious-says-league-rejected-lions-attempt-to-keep-him-on-practice-squad/|title=Kickalicious says league rejected Lions’ attempt to keep him on practice squad|author=|date=12 September 2013|website=nbcsports.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new program, the International Player Pathway, was created in 2017. This new initiative started as a trial involving only [[NFC South]] teams. Each team in the division was allowed to sign one international player to its practice squad who would not count against the normal 10-player limit, but would not be eligible to be activated during the season after being signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000811256/article/international-players-added-to-four-practice-squads |title=International players added to four practice squads |first=Kevin |last=Patra |work=Around the NFL |publisher=''[[NFL.com]]'' |date=May 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathway was expanded to 8 teams (NFC South and [[AFC North]]) for the 2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;https://apnews.com/7c9905f90480407eadd9010566852dc0&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, several international players have tried to find their starts in the NFL through spending time on teams practice squads without having been part of these programs, such as [[Efe Obada]], [[Moritz Böhringer]], and [[Jarryd Hayne]].

The '''Stadio Oreste Granillo''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Reggio Calabria]], Italy.  It is the home of [[Urbs Reggina 1914]]. The stadium was built in 1999 on the foundations of ''Comunale'' and holds 27,763. It is named after former Reggina president Oreste Granillo who led the club to [[Serie B]] for the first time and became mayor of the city.

==History==
The stadium was first built in 1932, then known as the Stadio Michele Bianchi. Then-Reggina president Giuseppe Vilardi was behind its construction. For years it was the only stadium in the city and changed names many times, mainly known as the Comunale.

Many renovations have been made on the structure, with the cover over the grandstand being built in the 60's and the Curva Nord, where Reggina fans stand today being built in the 80s'. The curva was not part of the original structure.

In order to accommodate a growing number of fans, coinciding with the success achieved by Reggina, the stadium was substantially renovated. In 1997, the old structure was demolished and two years later the new Stadio Oreste Granillo was completed, completely rebuilt on the same surface where the Michele Bianchi was first constructed, almost 70 years earlier.

==Location==
The stadium is located in the south of the city, only 1.8&amp;nbsp;km from the nearby railway station, Reggio Calabria Centrale. Upon leaving the station (Piazza Garibaldi), travel right along via Barlaam until you reach the entrance of the Calopinace bridge. From there, travel right along via Galileo Galilei which leads directly to the Granillo.

Those travelling from the [[Reggio Calabria Airport]], can take advantage of the 102 bus line which, starting from the airport itself, leads straight to the station.

A '''static rope''' is a [[rope]] that is not designed to stretch when placed under load, in contrast to a [[dynamic rope]]. Static ropes have a wide variety of uses, for instance in fire rescue operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Fire Protection Association|first=|title=Fundamentals of Fire Fighter Skills|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0Fx58bGuTQC&amp;pg=PT498|year=2008|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9780763753429|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[caving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkis|first1=Mike|last2=Subic|first2=Aleksandar J.|title=Materials in sports equipment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDmQF6alEq4C&amp;pg=PA288|year=2003|publisher=Woodhead|isbn=9780849317668|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[gridiron football]], a '''touchdown pass''' is a [[forward pass|pass]] thrown from the passer (usually the [[quarterback]]) to a [[Wide receiver|receiver]] that results in a [[touchdown]] being scored. The pass can either be caught in the [[end zone]] itself, resulting in an immediate touchdown, or in the field of play, followed by the receiver carrying the ball into the endzone himself for the score. Either way, the quarterback is credited in his statistics with the touchdown pass.

The term "touchdown pass" is mostly used for statistical purposes for the quarterback. The statistic is considered to be highly prestigious among quarterbacks, and is one of the four factors in determining the [[passer rating]]. 

In the game, the effect is simply the scoring of a touchdown (6 points). When a touchdown is achieved by running, the quarterback is not credited with a touchdown pass.

'''Towcester Greyhound Stadium''' is a [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] track located within [[Towcester Racecourse]] at [[Towcester]] in [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Search|url=http://www.gbgb.org.uk/find-a-track.aspx?id=48|publisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the home of the [[English Greyhound Derby]]. The stadium is currently in administration.

==Opening==
Towcester opened on 6 December 2014 becoming the first track in Britain to open since the 1995 openings of [[Harlow Stadium|Harlow]] and [[Central Park Stadium|Sittingbourne]]. The idea of a track inside the horse racing course was created by [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh|Lord Hesketh]] the racecourse owner and Chief Executive Kevin Ackerman. Former [[Walthamstow Stadium|Walthamstow]] Racing Manager Chris Page, Deputy Racing Manager Andy Lisemore and Steve Cale were recruited to run the operation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/30395903|title=Towcester opens greyhound track in £15m redevelopment|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
At a cost of £1.5 million the 420 metres circumference circuit was created by laying down 60,000 tonnes of soil so that the greyhound racing surface met the horse racing home straight at a level setting, resulting in a six-metre rise. The bends are very wide which assists the occasional eight dog race. The kennels were constructed inside unused horse stables and new trainers included five times [[Greyhound Trainer of the Year|champion trainer]] Mark Wallis, 2011 champion trainer Chris Allsopp, Kevin Hutton and Matt Dartnall. The distances are 260, 480, 500, 655, 686 and 906 metres and the first race was won by 4-1 shot Fairest Royal trained by Wallis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgb.org.uk/resultsRace.aspx?id=942212|title=Results|publisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A big screen situated on the home straight is a new feature to greyhound tracks.

==Achievements==
* Trainer [[Kevin Hutton]] won the prestigious [[Trainers Championship (greyhounds)|Trainers Championship]] in March 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgb.org.uk/news/2/2015/3/94/CHELSEA-GLASS-GTA-TRAINERS-CHAMPIONSHIP---SITTINGBOURNE|title=Chelsea Glass GTA Trainers' Championship - Sittingbourne|publisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2018 the stadium signed a deal with [[Arena Racing Company|ARC]] to race every Saturday morning and Sunday evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/arc-announce-2018-bags-fixtures/|title=Arc Schedule Released|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2018 administration ==
In August 2018 the future of Towcester racecourse was put in doubt. A statement released by the racecourse on 16 August read: "Towcester Racecourse Company Limited, proprietors of Towcester Racecourse, are currently experiencing trading difficulties and are in discussions with key stakeholders and professional advisers on the way forward. However, the directors have concluded that they have no alternative in the short term but to seek court protection and are now taking steps to place the company into [[administration (law)|administration]]. As a result, the last greyhound meeting was on 12 August.

On 23 August [[KPMG]] were appointed as administrators and 134 out of 137 members of staff at the racecourse were made redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barber |first1=Bill |title=BHA to decide fate of Towcester fixtures as 134 staff are made redundant |url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/latest/mass-redundancies-at-towcester-after-kpmg-appointed-as-administrators/343408 |website=Racing Post |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight trainers joined [[Henlow Stadium|Henlow]], including [[Mark Wallis]] and [[Nick Savva]] while [[Kevin Hutton]] joined [[Monmore Green Stadium|Monmore]].

On 13 November it was announced by the administrators that the racecourse's assets were being sold to a company called Fermor Land LLP.&lt;ref name=RP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/towcester-fate-to-be-known-in-new-year-after-racing-assets-sold-to-new-company/353599|title=Towcester racecourse assets sold to company linked to Hesketh family|publisher=Racing Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/sale-of-towcester/|title=SALE OF TOWCESTER – PRESS RELEASE FROM ADMINISTRATORS|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This company was formed on 18 October (26 days before the sale) and is headed by Lord Hesketh's brother-in-law Mark Westropp, a trustee of the Hesketh Family trusts.&lt;ref name=RP/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/company/OC424527-fermor-land-llp?page=people-contacts|title=Fermor Land LLP|publisher=Endole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Strongman Federation''' ("WSF") is a worldwide organization within [[strength athletics]], founded by Vlad Redkin, a prominent figure in the history of the [[International Federation of Strength Athletes]] and [[World Strongman Cup Federation]]. The WSF has organised a number of grand prix events and national championships featuring some of the world's leading strength athletes including 5 time [[World's Strongest Man]] winner [[Mariusz Pudzianowski]], [[Brian Shaw (strongman)|Brian Shaw]], [[Mikhail Koklyaev]], [[Krzysztof Radzikowski]], [[Tarmo Mitt]], [[Kevin Nee]], [[Stefan Solvi Petursson]], [[Laurence Shahlaei]] and [[Mark Felix]]. The WSF's flagship programme is the WSF World Cup.

==History==
The WSF was set up in 2007 by Vlad Redkin following a financial dispute with the [[World Strongman Cup Federation]]. Following Vlad's departure, the WSCF ceased to promote events and effectively disappeared from the strength athletics landscape. In September 2007 an event in [[Khanty-Mansijsk]] formerly affiliated to WSCF and featuring its athletes was promoted by [[Vlad Redkin]]. This event had its name changed at short notice from WSCF to the Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk (Russia) and in effect was the first WSF event. The reason given after the competition by Redkin was that a combination of financial reasons as well as concerns over WSCF's stated aim of forming closer ties with the [[International Federation of Strength Athletes]] led him to part company with WSCF. He initially planned to cooperate closely with [[Strongman Super Series]] in 2008, but in fact set up a new federation called the World Strongman Federation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2007/Sep/Vlad_Redkin_Leaves_WSMC____Stoyan_Todorchev_Wins_Contest_in_Russia.html Vlad Redkin Leaves WSMC . . . Stoyan Todorchev Wins Contest in Russia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the WSF organised a World Cup, it featured Mariusz Pudzianowski amongst others. However, the inaugural season failed to attract as many top tier names as planned and the WSF World Cup season was reduced in scale. By the end of 2008 the new federation was organising one off grand prix events largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, featuring fields of athletes confined to those countries.

In 2011 the WSF began to exert its presence globally once more and a WSF Asian World Cup event was organised, with [[Tarmo Mitt]] winning the event and also featuring the comeback event for [[Kevin Nee]] who finished third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfworldcup.org/news/wsf-asian-world-cup Tarmo Mitt Wins Asian World Cup Strongman by Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D. | ©2011 IronMind]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 Redkin stated that WSF had an agreement between 8 countries in that time and more were being approached in order to once again stage a WSF World Cup. This materialised and in August 2011 the 2011/12 World Cup was begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfworldcup.org/news/world-strongman-federation-5-stage-tour-planned World Strongman Federation: 5-Stage Tour Planned by Randall J.

===2013===
The 2013 WSF World Championships are scheduled to be held in December, and will also be the finals for the 2013 WSF World Cup.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The contest is scheduled to take place in the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk==
Originally, another event in [[Khanty-Mansijsk]] in September 2007 was affiliated to WSMC and featured its athletes. However, the promoter of the event, Vlad Redkin, changed the name from WSMC to the Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk (Russia). The reason given was that after the competition Redkin was parting company with WSMC due to his concerns over WSMC wanting closer ties with the [[International Federation of Strength Athletes]]. He also cited that he had lost money with WSMC. He initially planned to cooperate closely with the [[World Strongman Super Series]] in 2008, but in fact set up a new federation called the World Strongman Federation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
