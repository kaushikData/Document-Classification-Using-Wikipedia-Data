      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3033">The '''Agram Trial''' or '''Zagreb Trial''' (known as the "High treason trial" in Serbo-Croatian, ''veleizdajnički proces'') was the trial of 53 Serbs in [[Austria-Hungary]], accused of [[high treason]] – conspiracy to overthrow the state and place [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]] under [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian rule]].  The Austro-Hungarian government had discredited the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] and created an internal discussion accusing Serbs of massive conspiracy. The [[Pure Party of Rights]], led by [[Josip Frank]], participated in attacks on the accused Serbs (most supporters of the [[Serb Independent Party]]) and also the Croat-Serb Coalition, with government directives. Arrests were made during the [[Bosnian crisis]], made to justify the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some of the accused were held under bad circumstances, until the trial began in March 1909. The trial caused sensation across Europe, and was viewed as a blatant attempt to crush Serb minority politics in Croatia-Slavonia. Austria-Hungary pursued [[Trialism in Austria-Hungary|Trialism]], which clashed with the popular [[Yugoslavism]]. Minister [[János Forgách]] forged documents against the accused Serbs. 31 were convicted and given 184 years in October 1909. The obvious bias and unreliable evidence led to the defendants' later release after appeal.

The '''Condorcet paradox''' (also known as '''voting paradox''' or the '''paradox of voting''') in [[social choice theory]] is a situation noted by the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k417181|title=Essai sur l'application de l'analyse à la probabilité des décisions rendues à la pluralité des voix|authorlink=Marquis de Condorcet|language=French|format=PNG|accessdate=2008-03-10|author=Marquis de Condorcet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/political-theory-of-condorcet/oclc/20408445|title=The political theory of Condorcet|last=Condorcet|first=Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat|last2=Sommerlad|first2=Fiona|last3=McLean|first3=Iain|last4=|last5=|date=1989-01-01|publisher=University of Oxford, Faculty of Social Studies|year=|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=69–80, 152–166|quote=Clearly, if anyone's vote was self-contradictory (having cyclic preferences), it would have to be discounted, and we should therefore establish a form of voting which makes such absurdities impossible|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gehrlein|first=William V.|year=|title=Condorcet's paradox and the likelihood of its occurrence: different perspectives on balanced preferences*|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015551010381|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=52|issue=2|pages=171–199|doi=10.1023/A:1015551010381|issn=0040-5833|quote=Here, Condorcet notes that we have a 'contradictory system' that represents what has come to be known as Condorcet's Paradox.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which collective preferences can be cyclic, even if the preferences of individual voters are not cyclic. This is [[paradox]]ical, because it means that majority wishes can be in conflict with each other: Majorities prefer, for example, candidate A over B, B over C, and yet C over A. When this occurs, it is because the conflicting majorities are each made up of different groups of individuals.

Thus an expectation that [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] on the part of all individuals' preferences should result in transitivity of societal preferences is an example of a [[fallacy of composition]].

==Example==
[[File:Voting Paradox example.png|alt=3 blue dots in a triangle. 3 red dots in a triangle, connected by arrows that point counterclockwise.|thumb|250x250px|Voters (blue) and candidates (red) plotted in a 2-dimensional preference space. Arrows show the order in which voters prefer the candidates.]]
Suppose we have three candidates, A, B, and C, and that there are three voters with preferences as follows (candidates being listed left-to-right for each voter in decreasing order of preference):

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Voter !! First preference !! Second preference !! Third preference
|- 
! Voter 1 
| A || B || C
|- 
! Voter 2 
| B || C || A
|- 
! Voter 3 
| C || A || B
|}

If C is chosen as the winner, it can be argued that B should win instead, since two voters (1 and 2) prefer B to C and only one voter (3) prefers C to B.  However, by the same argument A is preferred to B, and C is preferred to A, by a margin of two to one on each occasion. Thus the society's preferences show cycling: A is preferred over B which is preferred over C which is preferred over A. A paradoxical feature of relations between the voters' preferences described above is that although the majority of voters agree that A is preferable to B, B to C, and C to A, all three coefficients of rank correlation between the preferences of any two voters are negative (namely, –.5), as calculated with [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman's rank correlation coefficient formula]] designed by [[Charles Spearman]] much later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssrn.com/abstract=2657942 Poddiakov, A., &amp; Valsiner, J. (2013). "Intransitivity cycles and their transformations: How dynamically adapting systems function". In L. Rudolph (Ed.), Qualitative Mathematics for the Social Sciences: Mathematical Models for Research on Cultural Dynamics (pp. 343–391). Abingdon, NY: Routledge.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardinal ratings ===
Note that in the graphical example, the voters and candidates are not symmetrical, but the ranked voting system "flattens" their preferences into a symmetrical cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://procaccia.info/papers/distortion.cia06.pdf|title=The Distortion of Cardinal Preferences in Voting|last=Procaccia|first=Ariel D.|last2=Rosenschein|first2=Jeffrey S.|date=2006-09-11|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783540385691|editor-last=Klusch|editor-first=Matthias|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|location=|pages=317–331|doi=10.1007/11839354_23|quote=agents' cardinal (utility-based) preferences are embedded into the space of ordinal preferences.

Range voting, which allows voters to express ''strength'' of preferences, would presumably succeed in choosing the best capital A.|last3=Smith|first3=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, under [[Range voting|score voting]], the ballots might be:&lt;ref&gt;In this example, the available scores are 0–6, and each voter normalizes their max/min scores to this range, while selecting a score for the middle that is proportional to distance.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!   !! A !! B !! C
|-
!     1 
| 6 || 3 || 0
|-
!     2 
| 0 || 6 || 1
|-
!     3 
| 5 || 0 || 6
|-
!Total: 
|11 || 9 || 7 
|}

Candidate A gets the largest score, and is the winner, as A is the nearest to all voters.

==Necessary condition for the paradox==

Suppose that ''x'' is the fraction of voters who prefer A over B and that ''y'' is the fraction of voters who prefer B over C. It has been shown&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Charles. "The voting paradox", ''The Mathematical Gazette'' 76, November 1992, 387–388.&lt;/ref&gt; that the fraction ''z'' of voters who prefer A over C is always at least (''x&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;y''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1). Since the paradox (a majority preferring C over A) requires ''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/2, a necessary condition for the paradox is that

:&lt;math&gt;x + y - 1 \leq z &lt; \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and hence} \quad x + y &lt; \frac{3}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Mathematical calculation of the probability of meeting the paradox. ==
For &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; voters providing a preference list of three candidates A, B, C, we write &lt;math&gt; X_n &lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt; Y_n &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; Z_n &lt;/math&gt;) the random variable equal to the number of voters who placed A in front of B (respectively B in front of C, C in front of A). The sought probability is &lt;math&gt; p_n = 2P (X_n&gt; n / 2, Y_n&gt; n / 2, Z_n&gt; n / 2) &lt;/math&gt; (we double because there is also the symmetric case A&gt; C&gt; B&gt; A). We show that, for odd &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; p_n = 3q_n-1/2 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; q_n = P (X_n&gt; n / 2, Y_n&gt; n / 2) &lt;/math&gt; which makes one need to know only the joint distribution of &lt;math&gt; X_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y_n &lt;/math&gt;.

If we put &lt;math&gt; p_{n, i, j} = P (X_n = i, Y_n = j) &lt;/math&gt;, we show the relation which makes it possible to compute this distribution by recurrence: &lt;math&gt; p_ { n + 1, i, j} = {1 \over 6} p_ {n, i, j} + {1 \over 3} p_ {n, i-1, j} + {1 \over 3} p_ {n, i, j-1} + {1 \over 6} p_ {n, i-1, j-1} &lt;/math&gt;.

The following results are then obtained:
{| class="wikitable"
!&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
!3
!101
!201
!301
!401
!501
!601
|-
|&lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt;
|5.556%
|8.690%
|8.732%
|8.746%
|8.753%
|8.757%
|8.760%
|}
The sequence seems to be tending towards a finite limit.

Using the [[Central Limit Theorem | Central-Limit Theorem]], we show that &lt;math&gt; q_n &lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt; q = {1 \over 4} P (| T |&gt; {\sqrt {2 } \over 4}) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is a variable following a [[Cauchy distribution]], which gives &lt;math&gt;q=\dfrac{1}{2\pi }\int_{\sqrt{2}/4}^{+\infty }\frac{dt}{1+t^{2}}=\dfrac{
\arctan 2\sqrt{2}}{2\pi }=\dfrac{\arccos \frac{1}{3}}{2\pi }&lt;/math&gt; (constant [[oeis: A289505 | quoted in the OEIS]]).

The asymptotic probability of encountering the Condorcet paradox is therefore &lt;math&gt;{{3\arccos{1\over3}}\over{2\pi}}-{1\over2}={\arcsin{\sqrt 6\over 9}\over \pi}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the value 8.77%.

In&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|
url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257651659_Condorcet%27s_Paradox_and_the_Condorcet_Efficiency_of_Voting_Rules |
title=Condorcet's Paradox and the Condorcet Efficiency of Voting Rules| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are some results for the case of more than three objects.

==Implications==

When a [[Condorcet method]] is used to determine an election, the voting paradox of cyclical societal preferences implies that the election has no [[Condorcet winner]]: no candidate who can win a one-on-one election against each other candidate. The several variants of the Condorcet method differ on how they [[Condorcet method#Circular ambiguities|resolve such ambiguities]] when they arise to determine a winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.opentextbookstore.com/mathinsociety/|title=Math in society|last=Lippman|first=David|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=1479276537|location=|pages=|chapter=Voting Theory|oclc=913874268|quote=There are many Condorcet Methods, which vary primarily in how they deal with ties, which are very common when a Condorcet winner does not exist.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that using only rankings, there is no fair and deterministic resolution to the trivial example given earlier because each candidate is in an exactly symmetrical situation.

Situations having the voting paradox can cause voting mechanisms to violate the axiom of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives#Criticism of IIA|independence of irrelevant alternatives]]—the choice of winner by a voting mechanism could be influenced by whether or not a losing candidate is available to be voted for.

One important implication of the possible existence of the voting paradox in a practical situation is that in a two-stage voting process, the eventual winner may depend on the way the two stages are structured. For example, suppose the winner of A versus B in the [[primary election#Types|open primary]] contest for one party's leadership will then face the second party's leader, C, in the general election. In the earlier example, A would defeat B for the first party's nomination, and then would lose to C in the general election. But if B were in the second party instead of the first, B would defeat C for that party's nomination, and then would lose to A in the general election. Thus the structure of the two stages makes a difference for whether A or C is the ultimate winner.

Likewise, the structure of a sequence of votes in a legislature can be manipulated by the person arranging the votes, to ensure a preferred outcome.

The structure of the Condorcet paradox can be reproduced in mechanical devices demonstrating [[intransitivity]] of relations such as "to rotate faster than", "to lift and be not be lifted", "to be stronger than" in some geometrical constructions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03869 Poddiakov, A. (2018). Intransitive machines. Cornell University. Series arxive "math". 2018. No. 1809.03869.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">The '''Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007''' ({{USBill|110|S|453}}) was a bill introduced in the [[110th Congress]] of the U.S. on January 31, 2007, by Sen. [[Barack Obama]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] of [[Illinois]] and Sen. [[Chuck Schumer]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  The bill was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] and on October 4, 2007 was referred to the Senate, although it never received a vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:S453:&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar version of this bill was introduced by Obama in the 109th Congress on November 16, 2006 ({{USBill|109|S|4069}}) "to protect Americans from tactics that intimidate voters and prevent them from exercising their right to vote on Election Day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://obama.senate.gov/press/061117-obama_introduces_legislation_to_criminalize_election-day_fraud/index.html Press Release] announcing introduction of Bill, Sen. Obama's Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], material was distributed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in predominantly African American counties in Maryland falsely claiming that prominent African-American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had endorsed the Republican candidates. The fliers were paid for and authorized by Senate candidate [[Michael S. Steele]] and Governor [[Robert Ehrlich]], and were widely decried as fraudulent by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111201084_pf.html|title=GOP Fliers Apparently Were Part Of Strategy|last=Mosk|first=Matthew|author2=Thomas-Lester, Avis|date=2006-11-13|work=The Washington Post|page=B1|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of our most sacred rights as Americans is the right to make our voice heard at the polls," said Obama in his introductory remarks on the 2006 bill. "But too often, we hear reports of mysterious phone calls and mailers arriving just days before an election that seek to mislead and threaten voters to keep them from the polls. And those who engage in these deceptive and underhanded campaign tactics usually target voters living in minority or low-income neighborhoods. This legislation would ensure that for the first time, these incidents are fully investigated and that those found guilty are punished."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=434&amp;Itemid=86&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deport Racism Organization''' ({{lang-el|Κίνηση Απελάστε το Ρατσισμό}}, sometimes referred to as KAR - by its Greek initials), founded in 2007, is an organization of immigrants and Greek citizens against racism and neo-fascism.

Their aims include the legalization of immigrants, asylum for refugees, citizenship for the children of immigrants, equal political and social rights for all, allowing migrant workers into trade unions and the dissolution of fascist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Largely gone are the disorderly rallies, colonial-era costumes and fixations on fringe issues, such as the provenance of the president's birth certificate. Instead, the movement has retooled into a loosely organized network of field operations that, as in Texas, pushes Republicans toward more strident conservative positions and candidates, while supplying ground troops across the country for candidates and big-money conservative groups, such as the [[Club for Growth]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]]."&lt;ref name="retool"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackmon |first=Douglas |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tea-party-retools-itself-pushing-republicans-toward-more-strident-conservative-positions/2012/07/30/gJQAGuG1KX_print.html|title=Tea party retools as network of field operatives, keeps pushing GOP rightward| newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the election cycle, Democratic allies had expressed confidence in the strength of their own ground game. In September 2011, [[Teamsters]] President [[James P.

The '''Expatriate Party of New Zealand''' is an unregistered [[political party]] that seeks to represent people who consider themselves [[New Zealanders]] but who do not reside in New Zealand. It contested one electorate, but not the party vote, at the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. 

== Policies ==
According to the party's Facebook page, the Expatriate Party seeks "to provide representation for, and to promote fairness in the treatment of all members of the mobile global workforce who identify as New Zealanders, irrespective of where they live or their residency or citizenship status."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/expatsnz/about/?mt_nav=1|title=The Expats - NZ Political Party - About|last=|first=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party put forward several policies during their 2014 campaign.

==Canada==
{{Further|Premier (Canada)}}
In [[Canada]], "''first ministers''" is a collective term that refers to all of the Canadian first [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], otherwise known as [[Head of Government|heads of government]], including the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial]] [[premier]]s.

==Norway==
The [[head of government of Norway]] was called ''first minister'' ({{Lang-no|førstestatsråd}}) between 1814 and 1873, while it was in [[personal union]] [[Union between Sweden and Norway|with Sweden]]. In 1893, 12 years prior to the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|dissolution of the union]], it was changed to [[prime minister]] (''statsminister'').

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the term ''first minister'' was once used interchangeably with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], such as when [[Winston Churchill]] stated: "I did not become His Majesty's First Minister so that I might oversee the liquidation of the British Empire!"

Nowadays, the term is used to describe the leaders of the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] governments of [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/People |title=About: People: Who runs the Scottish Government |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=10 March 2014 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

"'''Fossil fuels lobby'''" is the [[umbrella term]] used to name the [[Lobbying|paid representatives]] of large [[fossil fuel]] ([[petroleum industry|oil]], [[Natural gas|gas]], [[coal]]) and [[Electric utility|electric utilities]] corporations who attempt to influence governmental policy. So-called [[Big Oil]] companies such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[BP]], [[Total S.A.]], [[Chevron Corporation]], and [[ConocoPhillips]] are amongst the largest [[corporation]]s associated with the fossil fuels lobby. [[General Electric]], [[Southern Company]], [[FirstEnergy|First Energy]], and the [[Edison Electric Institute]] are also among the most influential electric utilities corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/main.htm|title=Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections = Welcome / Main entry page|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420005819/http://gasandoil.com/goc/main.htm|archivedate=20 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Electric power industry|electric companies]] and big oil and gas companies are consistently not among the ten highest-spending lobbyists – the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] is currently #1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2014&amp;indexType=s|title=Lobbying|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sector, "Energy/Nat Resource" comes fifth, behind "Misc Business", "Finance/Insur/RealEst", Health and "Communic/Electronics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2014&amp;indexType=c|title=Lobbying Spending Database - OpenSecrets|author=|date=|website=www.opensecrets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States elections, 2000|2000 elections]], over $34 million was contributed, with 78% of that money going to Republicans.  In 2004, oil and gas companies contributed over $25 million to political campaigns, donating 80% of that money to Republicans.  In the [[United States general election, 2006|2006 election]] cycle, oil and gas companies contributed over $19 million to political campaigns. 82% of that money went to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates, while the remaining 18% went to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  Electric utilities also heavily favor Republicans; their contributions have recently ranged between $15–20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.asp?cycle=2006&amp;ind=E08|title=Electric Utilities|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421041153/http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.asp?cycle=2006&amp;ind=E08|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.asp?cycle=2006&amp;ind=E01|title=Oil &amp; Gas|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421041147/http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.asp?cycle=2006&amp;ind=E01|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2003–06, the energy lobby also contributed $58.3 million to [[U.S. state|state]]-level campaigns. By comparison, [[alternative energy]] interests contributed around half a million dollars in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.followthemoney.org/press/Reports/200705231.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the [[United States elections, 2012|United States elections in 2012]] which includes the [[United States presidential election, 2012|presidential election]] there was much spending by the lobbies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/us/politics/fossil-fuel-industry-opens-wallet-to-defeat-obama.html ''Fossil Fuel Industry Ads Dominate TV Campaign''] September 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental influence in the United States===
{{Update|section|date=February 2018}}
Various [[scandal]]s involving prominent politicians have drawn attention to the close links between the energy lobby and the [[U.S. government]], particularly the influence wielded by the energy lobby in the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]. Lobbying continued after the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/07/22/oil-lobby-paid-washington-post-and-atlantic-to-host-climate-change-deniers-at-rnc/ |title=Oil Lobby Paid Washington Post and Atlantic to Host Climate-Change Deniers at RNC |last1=Emmons |first1=Alex |date=21 July 2016 |website=theintercept.com |publisher=[[The Intercept]] |access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2005, documents emerged that revealed that the Bush administration had consulted Exxon regarding its stance on the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "In briefing papers given before meetings to the U.S. [[Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs]], [[Paula Dobriansky]], between 2001 and 2004, the administration is found thanking [[Exxon]] executives for the company's ‘active involvement’ in helping to determine climate change policy, and also seeking its advice on what climate change policies the company might find acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange/story/0,12374,1501646,00.html|title=Revealed: how oil giant influenced Bush|author=Environment editor|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=6 April 2015|date=2005-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, documents revealed that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]’s [[Energy Task Force]] met with executives from large oil companies, although chief executives of those companies denied involvement before the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] Energy and Commerce committees.

The energy lobby has a history of conflict with international interests and democratic [[global governance]].  According to the [[International Sustainable Energy Organization]] for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency the second [[World Climate Conference]] "was sabotaged by the USA and oil lobbies"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniseo.org/blueprint.html|title=International Sustainable Energy Organization|author=|date=|website=www.uniseo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon [[UNISEO]] proceeded to set up a [[Global Energy Charter]] "which protects life, health, climate and the biosphere from emissions." According to the organization, these same "reactionary energy lobby groups tried to boycott this Charter with the help from oil- and [[Coal-mining region|coal]]-producing nations and succeeded to keep energy out of the Rio Conference on Environment &amp; Development ([[Earth Summit]]) in 1992, to continue this game in all Climate Conferences in [[Berlin]], [[Kyoto]], [[The Hague]] and [[Marrakech]], where the USA boycotted the [[Kyoto protocol]] and still ignores the Charter."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

During the 14th session of the [[United Nations]] [[Commission on Sustainable Development]], according to the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] ''Bulletin'', "One minister is said to have challenged the North’s [[renewable energy]] lobby with the words: why not “light up” the dark zones of the world by “extinguishing some of the candles” in yours?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/download/asc/enb05237e.txt|title=IISD Bulletin|author=|date=|website=iisd.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">The '''Freedom to Speak Up Review''' was a review into [[whistleblowing]] in the [[NHS in England]]. It was announced on 24 June 2014 and it was chaired by [[Robert Francis (barrister)|Sir Robert Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Borland Daily Mail (25 June 2014) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2668566/NHS-gripped-culture-fear-Inquiry-whistleblowing-set-barrister-investigated-Mid-Staffs.html NHS is still gripped by a culture of fear: Inquiry into whistleblowing set up by barrister who investigated Mid Staffs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/|title=Freedom to Speak Up Review|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150218150343/https://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/|archivedate=2015-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was originally expected to report in November 2014 but took longer because of a huge volume of input material: 17,500 online responses and 600 postal responses.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Borland Daily Mail (21 January 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2919200/Probe-NHS-whistleblowers-swamped-18-000-replies.html Probe into NHS whistleblowers is swamped by 18,000 replies: Officials tried to push back report after being deluged with comments by concerned staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was published on 11 February 2015.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11Feb2105"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/11/nhs-whistleblowers-report-offers-no-prescription-cover-up-culture |title=NHS whistleblowers report offers no prescription for ending cover-up culture |first=Denis |last=Campbell |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 February 2015 |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
Francis outlined twenty principles and associated actions, then concluded by making just two recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cri.sagepub.com/content/20/6/128.short |title=Francis’s ‘‘Freedom to Speak Up’’ review: An openness and transparency revolution or just another report? |first=Peter |last=Walsh |journal=Clinical Risk |date= November 2014 |volume=20 |issue=6 |page=128 |doi=10.1177/1356262215575958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# for all NHS organisations and regulators to implement all the principles and actions;
# for the Secretary of State to review progress annually.

The twenty principles to allow a consistent approach to raising concerns, while still allowing some flexibility, included:&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;Lizzie Parry Daily Mail (11 February 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2948871/NHS-staff-scared-speak-poor-care-Climate-fear-leaves-worried-bullied-lose-job-speak-up.html Climate of fear leaves NHS whistleblowers 'on the brink of suicide' says report but campaigners warn new measures to protect workers 'don't go far enough']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Culture of raising concerns - to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of any well-led NHS organisation.
* Culture free from bullying - freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training - every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them. 
* Support - all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "Freedom to Speak Up Guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS - where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

==Reactions==
Many campaigners claimed that the recommendations did not go far enough.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Sawer, Laura Donnelly The Telegraph (11 February 2015) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11405430/Whistleblowing-Its-still-not-safe-for-us-to-speak-out.html Whistleblowing: 'It's still not safe for us to speak out']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Sophie Borland, Claire Ellicott, Daniel Martin Daily Mail (12 February 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2949934/Whistleblower-whitewash-Health-staff-dare-speak-not-protected-says-report.html Whistleblower whitewash: Health staff who dare to speak out will still not be protected, says report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 11Feb2105"/&gt;

'''Giustizia e Libertà''' ({{IPA-it|dʒuˈstittsja e liberˈta}}; {{lang-en|Justice and Freedom}}) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[anti-fascist]] [[resistance movement]], active from 1929 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Wilkinson. ''The Intellectual Resistance Movement in Europe''. Harvard University Press, 1981. Pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was founded by [[Carlo Rosselli]].&lt;ref&gt;James D. Wilkinson. ''The Intellectual Resistance Movement in Europe''. Harvard University Press, 1981. Pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferruccio Parri]] &amp;ndash; who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]], and [[Sandro Pertini]] &amp;ndash; who later became [[President of Italy]] were among the movement's leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislao G. Pugliese. ''Carlo Rosselli: socialist heretic and antifascist exile''. Harvard University Press, 1999. Pp. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italian anti-fascist organization (1929&amp;ndash;1940) ==
[[File:Flag of Giustizia e Liberta.svg|thumb|left|Flag of ''Giustizia e Libertà'']]
[[File:Bandiera giustizia e liberta.jpg|thumb|right|Sleeve emblem ''Giustizia e Libertà'' Partisans]]
The anti-fascist organisation ''Giustizia e Libertà'' was founded in [[Paris]] in 1929 by the Italian refugees [[Carlo Rosselli]], [[Emilio Lussu]], [[Alberto Tarchiani]], and [[Ernesto Rossi (politician)|Ernesto Rossi]]. They began to organise the resistance against [[Italian Fascism]], forming clandestine groups in Italy and setting up an intense propaganda campaign, publishing under Lussu's maxim: "Insorgere! Risorgere!" (Rebel! Revive!). [[Carlo Levi]] was named a director of the Italian branch along with [[Leone Ginzburg]], a Russian Jew from Odessa who had emigrated with his parents to [[Turin]].

''Giustizia e Libertà'' was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime; the movement saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Di Scala. ''Italian socialism: between politics and history''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1996. Pp. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Di Scala. ''Italian socialism: between politics and history''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1996. Pp. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of arrests and trials, (including the conviction of Carlo Levi) the movement was forced in 1930 to curb this activity. In 1931 the organisation joined the ''[[Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana]]'' (Anti-Fascist Concentration), and in 1932 began promoting a plan that aimed not for the restoration of the pre-fascist political order but for a new [[social democracy]] centered around a [[Republic|Republican state]]. It called for economic rights and administrative decentralisation. The group produced its own journal, on which Salvatorelli, De Ruggiero and others collaborated. This journal reflected the politics of the group's leaders, who sought to distance themselves from [[communism]] and the [[Italian Communist Party]]. At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the organisation formed its own volunteer brigades to support the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

[[Carlo Rosselli]] and [[Camillo Berneri]] headed a mixed volunteer unit of anarchist, liberal, socialist, and communist Italians on the [[Aragon]] front, whose military successes included a victory against Francoist forces in the [[Battle of Monte Pelato]]. They popularised the slogan: "Oggi in Spagna, domani in Italia" (Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy). In 1937, Camillo Berneri was killed by communist forces during a purge of anarchists in Barcelona. With the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] in 1939, ''Giustizia e Libertà'' partisans were forced to flee back to France.

Several members of Giustizia e Libertà, including Aldo Garosci, Alberto Cianca, and Alberto Tarchiani, then emigrated to the [[United States]], where they helped form the antifascist [[Mazzini Society]] to promote a liberal democratic republic for Italy. They sailed to England in 1943 and set in operation the clandestine Giustizia e Libertà radio to denounce both Fascism and the monarchy for its complicity in Fascism.

== The military arm of Partito d'Azione (1942&amp;ndash;1945) ==
''Giustizia e Libertà'' was forced to cease public operations when German troops [[Battle of France|occupied France]] in 1940. Its members were dispersed, but largely reconstituted themselves as the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] (''Partito d'Azione'') in German-occupied Italy following the [[Armistice with Italy|Armistice of 1943]]. The military arms of the organisation, the partisan brigades, were still referred to as ''Giustizia e Libertà''.

After 8 September 1943, partisan units under the ''Giustizia e Libertà'' banner formed after the Italian capitulation to Allied forces and the creation of the [[Italian Social Republic]] [[puppet state]] of Nazi Germany. As the largest non-Communist partisan groups, they benefited from provisions and training that were denied to other units by the western Allies. Among the group's best known commanders was [[Ferruccio Parri]], who, using the nom-de-guerre "Maurizio," represented the Action Party in the Military Committee of the National Liberation Committee of Northern Italy ([[CLNAI]]). Centres of activity included [[Turin]], [[Florence]], and [[Milan]], where a resistance cell was headed by [[Ugo La Malfa]], [[Ferruccio Parri]], and [[Adolfo Tino]]. Parri was arrested in Milan and turned over to the Germans, but he was later exchanged for German officials imprisoned by the partisans. He returned in time to take part in the conclusive phase of the resistance and in the Milan uprising.

The writer [[Primo Levi]] was a member of the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] partisan group in [[Aosta Valley]]. He was captured by fascist forces in 1943, handed over to the Germans in 1944, and deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III (Monowitz)]].

''Giustizia e Libertà'' brigades were regarded as professional military units, which drew fighters from every social class. In the twenty months of the war, their units sustained 4,500 overall casualties, among them the greater portion of their leaders.

Globalization is a process that encompasses the causes, courses, and consequences of [[transnationalism|transnational]] and [[transculturalism|transcultural]] integration of human and non-human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Rodhan, Nayef RF, and Gérard Stoudmann. "Definitions of globalization: A comprehensive overview and a proposed definition." Geneva Centre for Security Policy (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; India had the distinction of being the world's largest economy in the beginning of the Christian era, as it accounted for about 32.9% share of world GDP and about 17% of the [[world population]]. The goods produced in India had long been exported to far off destinations across the world;&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of globalisation is hardly new to India.

India currently accounts for 2.7% of world trade (as of 2015), up from 1.2% in 2006 according to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/tp195_e.htm India's Trade policy review by the wto]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledgling economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while [[foreign direct investment]] was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector.&lt;ref name="see S.Sahoo"&gt;[http://jas.sagepub.com/content/49/1/3.abstract Globalization and Politics of the Poor in India]&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200M annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indian]]s.&lt;ref name="tn-srinivasan"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Srinivasan, T.N. | title=Economic Reforms and Global Integration | year=2002 | version=17 January 2002 | url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/%7Esrinivas/ec_reforms.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India's exports were stagnant for the first 15 years after independence, due to the predominance of tea, jute and cotton manufactures, demand for which was generally [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]]. Imports in the same period consisted predominantly of machinery, equipment and raw materials, due to nascent industrialisation. Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade has become more broad-based and has risen to {{nowrap|[[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px|link=Indian rupee sign]]}} 63,0801&amp;nbsp;billion in 2003–04 from {{nowrap|[[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px|link=Indian rupee sign]]}} 12.50&amp;nbsp;billion in 1950–51.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} India's trading partners are China, the US, the UAE, the UK, Japan and the EU.&lt;ref name="Datt-14"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Datt, Ruddar  |author2=Sundharam, K.P.M. | title=Indian Economy | pages = 767, 772–76 | chapter = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exports during April 2007 were $12.31 billion up by 16% and import were $17.68 billion with an increase of 18.06% over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commerce.nic.in/tradestats/indiatrade_press.asp INDIA’S FOREIGN TRADE: APRIL-DECEMBER 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922090944/http://commerce.nic.in/tradestats/indiatrade_press.asp |date=22 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is a founding-member of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) since 1947 and its successor, the [[World Trade Organization]]. While participating actively in its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the [[Developing country|developing world]]. For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of such matters as labour and environment issues and other ''[[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]]'' into the WTO policies.&lt;ref name="wto"&gt;{{cite web|title=India &amp; the World Trade Organization |url=http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/WTO/overview.html |accessdate=9 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050613080223/http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/WTO/overview.html |archivedate=13 June 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite reducing import restrictions several times in the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/696852.stm | work=BBC News | title=India eases trade restrictions | date=31 March 2000 | accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E0D61338F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=World Business Briefing – Asia: India: Trade Restrictions Eased | first=Saritha | last=Rai | date=29 January 2004 | accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; India was evaluated by the World Trade Organization in 2008 as more restrictive than similar developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and Russia.  The WTO also identified electricity shortages and inadequate transportation infrastructure as significant constraints on trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= 19 June 2008 at 2140 hrs IST |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/restrictive-trade-regime-gets-india-poor-wb-ranking/324548/0 |title=Restrictive trade regime gets India poor WB ranking |publisher=Financialexpress.com |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/tp195_e.htm India: June 2002].

WTO Trade Policy Review of India, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Its restrictiveness has been cited as a factor which isolated it from the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]] more than other countries, even though it experienced reduced ongoing economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99404776&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1006 Looking To Escape The Recession? Try Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payments==
Since independence, India's [[balance of payments]] on its [[current account]] has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India's exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in 1990–91. Although India is still a net importer, since 1996–97, its overall balance of payments (i.e., including the [[capital account]] balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indian]]s; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings. As a result, India's foreign currency reserves stood at $285 billion in 2008, which could be used in infrastructural development of the country if used effectively. In September 2017 India's foreign exchange reserves crossed $400 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.rbi.org.in//scripts/WSSView.aspx?Id=21669&lt;/ref&gt;

India's reliance on external assistance and commercial borrowings has decreased since 1991–92, and since 2002–03, it has gradually been repaying these debts. Declining interest rates and reduced borrowings decreased India's [[debt service ratio]] to 4.5% in 2007.

In India, [[external commercial borrowing]]s (ECBs) are being permitted by the government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] monitors and regulates these borrowings (ECBs) through ECB policy guidelines.

==Economy==
India's economy has grown drastically since it integrated into the global economy in 1991. It has drastic impact on India's economical condition. Its average annual [[Exponential growth|rate]] has grown from 3.5% (1950–1980) to 7.7% (2002–2012). That rate peaked at 9.5% from 2005–2008. Economic growth has also led to increases in the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), from $1,255 in 1978 to $3,452 in 2005, and finally to $3,900 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, Sumit K. "Globalization And Relative Compensation in India's Information Technology Sector." Information Technologies &amp; International Development 6.1 (2010): 21–33. Business Source Premier. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs in the technology and business sectors have many benefits. However, only people in those sectors are benefiting. The overall employment rate for the country has decreased, while the number of job seekers is increasing at a yearly rate of 2.5%. Despite those statistics, the GDP is increasing every year. Growth is limited to some [[states of India|states]], including [[Gujarat]], Maharashtra, [[Karnataka]], Andhra Pradesh, and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Other states like [[Bihar]], Uttar Pradesh (UP), [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Madhya Pradesh (MP), [[Assam]], and [[West Bengal]] remain poverty-stricken.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Shalendra D.

[[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) in India has reached 2% of GDP, compared with 0.1% in 1990, and Indian investment in other countries rose sharply in 2006.&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf |title=Economic survey of India 2007: Policy Brief |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606112149/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India is a preferred destination for FDI;&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/India-2nd-best-country-for-biz-investment-Survey/343344/ |title=India 2nd best country for biz investment: Survey - The Financial Express |publisher=Financialexpress.com |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has strengths in information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and jewelry. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies resulted in a significant hindrance. However, due to some positive economic reforms aimed at deregulating the economy and stimulating foreign investment, India has positioned itself as one of the front-runners of the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"/&gt; India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 50 million and represents a growing consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/mginews/bigspenders.asp Next Big Spenders: India's Middle Class]&lt;/ref&gt;

India's liberalised FDI policy as of 2005 allowed up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100 per cent FDI in the construction business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/25/stories/2005022506990100.htm The Hinduonline]&lt;/ref&gt; This automatic route has been permitted in townships, housing, built-up infrastructure and construction development projects including housing, commercial premises, hotels, resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.

A number of changes were approved on the FDI policy to remove the caps in most sectors. Fields which require relaxation in FDI restrictions include civil aviation, construction development, industrial parks, petroleum and natural gas, commodity exchanges, credit-information services and mining. But this still leaves an unfinished agenda of permitting greater foreign investment in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing. FDI inflows into India reached a record US$19.5bn in fiscal year 2006/07 (April–March), according to the government's Secretariat for Industrial Assistance. This was more than double the total of US$7.8bn in the previous fiscal year. The FDI inflow for 2007-08 has been reported as $24bn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=54c00804-3161-4609-ad33-b5307f3c1b2e&amp;ParentID=6d35884a-76ac-433c-af16-ccc72908c3e5&amp;MatchID1=4689&amp;TeamID1=4&amp;TeamID2=1&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1182&amp;PrimaryID=4689&amp;Headline=India+attracts+%24+25+billion+FDI+in+2007-08 Hindustan Times ''India attracts $ 25 billion FDI in 2007-08'']&lt;/ref&gt; and for 2008-09, it is expected to be above $35 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Economy/FDI_to_exceed_USD_35_bn_in_08-09/articleshow/3373887.cms Economic Times ''FDI inflows to exceed USD 35 billion target in 2008-09'']&lt;/ref&gt; A critical factor in determining India's continued economic growth and realising the potential to be an economic superpower is going to depend on how the government can create incentives for FDI flow across a large number of sectors in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Economic Superpower: Fiction or Future?|author=Jayashankar M.

===Remittances===
{{main|Remittances to India}}
[[Remittance]]s to India are money transfers from Indian workers employed outside the country to friends or relatives in India. Since 1991, India has experienced sharp remittance growth, and it is now is the world's leading receiver of remittances. In, 1991 Indian remittances totaled 2.1 billion [[USD]];&lt;ref name=Gupta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=577|title=The Rise in Remittances to India: A Closer Look|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|date=February 2007|accessdate=14 March 2009|last=Chishti|first=Muzaffar}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006, they were estimated at between $22 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Remittances-to-India-touch-$22-billion/181655/ |title=Remittances to India touch $22 billion|publisher=The Financial Express|date=26 October 2006|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $25.7 billion,&lt;ref name=nri/&gt; about 3% of India's GDP.&lt;ref name=nri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrirealtynews.com/stories/oct07/remittances-from-indians-abroad-push-india-to-top.php|title=Remittances from Indians abroad push India to the top|publisher=nrirealtynews.com|date=22 October 2007|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bNsS0C8K3UC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;vq=remittance#PPA8,M1| title=Macroeconomic Determinants of Remittances: Evidence from India|publisher=International Monetary Fund| accessdate=14 March 2009|last=Gupta| first=Poonam|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; India claimed more than 12% of the world's remittances in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India has the largest share in world remittances market|date=10 September 2008|url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/india_has_the_largest_share_in_world_remittances_market|work=Ecommerce Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===IT industry===
The [[technology integration|integration of technology]] in India has transformed [[skilled labor|jobs which required specialized skills]] and lacked decision-making skills to extensively-defined jobs with higher accountability that require new skills, such as numerical, analytical, communication and interactive skills. As a result of this, more job opportunities are created for people. Technology has also influenced many firms to give their workers more freedom inworkplace. For instance, workers who perform non-routine tasks benefit more than workers who do not.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, Sumit K. "Globalization And Relative Compensation in India's Information
Technology Sector." Information Technologies &amp; International Development 6.1 (2010): 21–33. Business Source Premier. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

One event that helped India immensely was when [[Netscape]] went [[initial public offering|public]] on 9 August 1995. Netscape provided globalization through technology in three major ways. First, Netscape made it possible for the [[web browser|browser]] to display images from websites. Second, the investment of billions in [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic telecommunications]] influenced by the [[dot-com boom]] and the [[dot com bubble]] poured a great deal of hard currency into the [[economy of India|Indian economy]]. Last, the over-investment in technology made it cheaper by creating a global [[fiber optics|fiber]] [[Internet|network]], which made it easier and faster to transmit data (5).&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "It's a flat world, after all." The New York Times 3 (2005): 33–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the Netscape IPO, more job opportunities were created for Indians, including ones outsourced from other countries. One of the milestones in job opportunities was when thousands of Indian engineers were hired to fix the [[Y2K]] bug. The job could have been given to many other companies, but it was outsourced to India. India was now seen in a different light, as being ready to join the workforce as well as able to compete against [[first-world]] countries for jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "It's a flat world, after all." The New York Times 3 (2005): 33–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Although India has had immense economic growth, not all sectors of the country have benefited. The funds that should have been directed to the agriculture sector were directed to private-sector enterprises. For instance, growth in the agricultural sector dropped from 3.8% in 2007 to 2.6% in 2008. This decline in growth has greatly affected farmers because production costs are very high, while [[commodity]] costs are low. This has resulted in over 150,000 [[peasant]] suicides since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Sahoo, Sarbeswar. "Globalization And Politics of the Poor in India." Journal of Asian &amp; African Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 49.1 (2014): 3–15. Historical Abstracts. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way globalization has affected the agricultural sector is through [[biofuel]] and medicinal cultivation. There is a food security crisis in India because a significant portion of the land has been designated to grow crops for biofuel. Crops like rice and wheat are often harvested in large quantities. However, the amount of crops that are used for biofuel is largely unregulated, with an inadequate amount going to the poor and needy.

===Women===
Technology has also increased access to education in India, especially to [[women's education|women]]. This has decreased the gap between men and women which was created by stratified [[gender role]]s. It has also empowered women in two ways. Technology has influenced more women to pursue advanced degrees in computer science and engineering instead of their traditional degrees in social sciences and the humanities. This has resulted in an increase in the number of women in competitive [[profession]]s.
Globalization expanded the need for higher education for both men and women. This, in turn, has had a tremendous impact on the life of the [[single woman]] in India.

The stigmatization and expectations on single women have decreased. For example, it is easier for single women to find living accommodations in cities like [[Kolkata]]. Society then puts less pressure on women to marry at a certain age because higher education is now more acceptable. India is promoting higher education for youth as well. New universities are being built, and advertisements on billboards have gone up around Kolkata to attract the growing population of high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Madhok, Bindu, and Selva J. Raj. "Globalization, Higher Education, And Women in Urban India: A Development Ethics Approach." Journal of Third World Studies 28.1 (2011): 141–154. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
India has also promoted higher education through the propagation of universities; however, funding to elementary education has declined. Sixty-three million children age 6 to 14 are out of school due the reduced education budget.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmanand, P. S., et al. "Challenges To Food Security in India." Current Science (00113891) 104.7 (2013): 841–846. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government has invested a lot in promoting higher education in the country, but more progress could be made with the help of private interests. The [[private sector]] has more than enough financial power to increase the [[literacy rate]] and access to higher education. It can be done through [[private university|private universities]] and learning centers. In addition, [[global university|global universities]] might be established in India so the global perspective can be fixed into the curriculum. Four aspects of [[global education]] that universities in India might focus on are a global curriculum, global [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], global degrees, and global interaction. These aspects would not only help promote higher education, but would help prepare India for the growing global competition that globalization is creating.&lt;ref&gt;KUMAR, C. RAJ. "Legal Education, Globalization, And Institutional Excellence: Challenges For The Rule Of Law And Access To Justice In India." Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies 20.1 (2013): 221–252. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Another sector the government has neglected is public health. India has one of the lowest ratios of public to private health expenditure. The [[infant mortality]] rate for the richest 20% of the population is only 38 per 1000 live births, while the rate for the poorest 20% is 97 per 1000. In addition, the rate of epidemics among the poor is increasing; it is common for outbreaks of [[contagious disease]]s like [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]/[[AIDS|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS) and [[malaria]] to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmanand, P. S., et al. "Challenges To Food Security in India." Current Science (00113891) 104.7 (2013): 841–846. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Thomas Friedman]], an American journalist, columnist, and author of "It's a Flat World After All" separates globalization into three stages; globalization 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. According to Friedman, globalization 1.0, which dates to 1492, involved [[nation|countries]] globalizing for natural resources. In globalization 2.0 (1800–2000), companies  globalized for labor and markets. In 3.0, the current stage, companies are seeking to globalize down to small groups of people, or even individuals.

Friedman first described the world's economy as being [[macroscopic]]. He explains that only countries interacted with each other, not individuals or small groups. Friedman then focused on how this has changed and improved within globalization 3.0. Under globalization 3.0, the world turned flat and individuals now had the opportunity to work and collaborate with other individuals from varying and diverse backgrounds. In addition, Friedman discussed how countries like India are using globalization to their advantage. The economies of countries similar to India are now blooming as the world is flattening and shrinking due to globalization.

Fifty years ago, countries such as India did not have a say in the [[global market]] and trade. America and other European powers who were once top players in the [[international market]] are now getting competition from countries like India, which is experiencing tremendous economic growth. Technology has played a major role in the advancement of globalization within India.

{{eastern name order|Dózsa György}}
[[File:Dózsa György.jpg|thumb|upright|A posthumous portrait of György Dózsa from 1913]]
'''György Dózsa''' (or ''György Székely'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;appears as "Georgius Zekel" in old texts&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ro|Gheorghe Doja}}; 1470 &amp;ndash; 20 July 1514) was a [[Székelys|Székely]] [[man-at-arms]] (and by some accounts, a [[Nobility and Royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|nobleman]]) from [[Transylvania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] who led a [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe|peasants' revolt]] against the kingdom's [[landed nobility]]. He was eventually caught, tortured, and executed along with his followers, and remembered as both a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[martyr]] and a dangerous criminal. During the reign of king [[Vladislas II of Hungary]] (1490–1516), royal power declined in favour of the magnates, who used their power to curtail the peasants’ freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/170596/Dozsa-Rebellion Dózsa Rebellion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==From peasant crusade to rebellion==
Dózsa was born in Dálnok (today [[Dalnic]]). During the wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], he was a [[Mercenary|soldier of fortune]] who won a reputation for valour.

In 1514, the Hungarian [[chancellor]], [[Tamás Bakócz]], returned from the [[Holy See]] with a [[papal bull]] issued by [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] authorising a [[crusade]] against the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed Dózsa to organize and direct the movement. Within a few weeks, Dózsa had gathered an army of some 40,000 so-called ''[[Hajduk (Kingdom of Hungary)|hajdú]]''{{Citation needed|reason=The number is too high for late medieval armies and see Kuruc article for the origin of the word|date=July 2015}}, consisting for the most part of peasants, wandering [[Medieval university|students]], [[friar]]s, and [[parish]] priests - some of the lowest-ranking groups of medieval society. They assembled in their [[Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]], and by the time he had provided them with some military training, they began to air the grievances of their status. No measures had been taken to supply these voluntary crusaders with food or clothing. As harvest-time approached, the [[landlord]]s commanded them to return to reap the fields, and, on their refusing to do so, proceeded to maltreat their wives and families and set their armed [[Retinue|retainers]] upon the local peasantry.

The volunteers became increasingly angry at the failure of the nobility to provide military leadership (the original and primary function of the nobility and the justification for its higher status in the society.)&lt;ref&gt;Norman Housley: Religious Warfare in Europe 1400-1536 (page: 70) Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellious, anti-landlord sentiment of these "Crusaders" became apparent during their march across the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Bakócz cancelled the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/topics/hungary/page4{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was thus diverted from its original object, and the peasants and their leaders began a war of vengeance against the landlords.

==Growing rebellion==
[[Image:Derkovits-dozsa05.jpg|thumb|upright|''Dózsa on the Wall'' from the "Dózsa woodcut series" by [[Gyula Derkovits]], 1928]]
By this time, Dózsa was losing control of the people under his command, who had fallen under the influence of the parson of [[Cegléd]], Lőrinc Mészáros.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The rebellion became more dangerous when the towns joined on the side of the peasants. In [[Buda]] and elsewhere, the [[cavalry]] sent against the ''Kuruc'' were unhorsed as they passed through the gates.

The rebellion spread quickly, principally in the central or purely [[Magyars|Magyar]] provinces, where hundreds of [[manor house]]s and [[castle]]s were burnt and thousands of the [[gentry]] killed by impalement, crucifixion, and other methods. Dózsa's camp at Cegléd was the centre of the ''[[jacquerie]]'', as all raids in the surrounding area started out from there.

In reaction, the papal bull was revoked, and [[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]] issued a proclamation commanding the peasantry to return to their homes under pain of death. By this time, the uprising had attained the dimensions of a [[revolution]]; all the [[vassal]]s of the kingdom were called out against it, and soldiers of fortune were hired in haste from the [[Republic of Venice]], [[Bohemia]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Meanwhile, Dózsa had captured the city and fortress of [[Csanád]] (today's Cenad), and signaled his victory by [[Impalement|impaling]] the [[bishop]] and the [[castellan]].

Subsequently, at [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], Lord Treasurer István Telegdy was seized and tortured to death. In general, however, the rebels only executed particularly vicious or greedy noblemen; those who freely submitted were released on [[parole]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Dózsa not only never broke his given word, but frequently assisted the escape of fugitives.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He was unable to consistently control his followers, however, and many of them hunted down rivals.

==Downfall and execution==
[[Image:GeorgheDoja.jpg|thumb|upright|Dózsa's execution (contemporary woodcut)]]
In the course of the summer, Dózsa seized the fortresses of Arad, [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]] (today Lipova) and [[Şiria, Romania|Világos]] (now Şiria), and provided himself with [[cannon]]s and trained gunners. One of his bands advanced to within 25 kilometres of the capital. But his ill-armed ploughmen were outmatched by the [[heavy cavalry]] of the nobles. Dózsa himself had apparently become demoralized by success: after [[Csanád]], he issued proclamations which can be described as [[Millenarianism|millenarian]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

As his suppression had become a political necessity, Dózsa was routed at Temesvár (today [[Timişoara]], [[Romania]]) by an army of 20,000&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[John Zápolya]] and [[István Báthory]]. He was captured after the battle, and condemned to sit on a smouldering, heated iron throne, and forced to wear a heated iron crown and sceptre (mocking his ambition to be king). While he was suffering, a procession of nine fellow rebels who had been starved beforehand were led to this throne. In the lead was Dózsa's younger brother, Gergely, who was cut in three despite Dózsa asking for Gergely to be spared. Next, executioners removed some pliers from a fire and forced them into Dózsa's skin. After tearing his flesh, the remaining rebels were ordered to bite spots where the hot pliers had been inserted and to swallow the flesh. The three or four who refused were simply cut up, prompting the others to comply. In the end, Dózsa died from the ordeal, while the rebels who obeyed were released and left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Barbasi p. 263-266&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt was repressed but some 70,000 peasants were tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkinhungary.com/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412180514/http://www.walkinhungary.com/history.html |archivedate=12 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; György's execution, and the brutal suppression of the peasants, greatly aided the [[Battle of Mohács|1526 Ottoman invasion]] as the Hungarians were no longer a politically united people. Another consequence was the creation of new laws, an effort in the Hungarian Diet led by [[István Werbőczy]]. The resulting Tripartitum elaborated the old rights of peasants, but also greatly enhanced the status of lesser nobility (gentry), erecting an iron curtain between Hungarians until 1848 when [[serfdom]] was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:HUF 20 1975 obverse.jpg|thumb|300px|Dózsa's portrait on the former 20 forint banknote]]
Today, on the site of the martyrdom of the hot throne, there is the statue of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|The Virgin Mary]], built by architect [[László Székely]] and sculptor [[György Kiss (artist)|György Kiss]]. According to the legend, during György Dózsa's torture, some monks saw in his ear the image of Mary. The first statue was raised in 1865, with the actual monument raised in 1906.  Hungarian opera composer [[Ferenc Erkel]] wrote an opera, ''[[György Dózsa (opera)|Dózsa György]]'', about him.

His revolutionary image and Transylvanian background were drawn upon during the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist]] regime of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]. The Hungarian component of his movement was downplayed, but its strong anti-feudal character was emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Emanuel Copilaş, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/139/art09-copilas.html "Confiscarea lui Dumnezeu şi mecanismul inevitabilităţii istorice"], ''Sfera Politicii'' 139, September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In Budapest, a square, a [[Dózsa György út|busy six-lane avenue]], and a [[List of metro stations in Budapest|metro station]] bear his name, and it is one of the most popular [[street name]]s in Hungarian villages. A number of streets in several cities of [[Romania]] were named ''Gheorghe Doja''. Also, a number of streets in serval cities of [[Serbia]] were named "Ulica Doža Đerđa".
Two Postage stamps were issued in his honor by Hungary on 12 June 1919&lt;ref&gt;colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/190132-György_Dózsa-Social_Revolutionists-Hungary&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 March 1947&lt;ref&gt;colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/179860-György_Dózsa_1474-1514-Hungarian_Freedom_Fighters-Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;, the latter in the "social revolutionists" series.

Hoplophobia is listed simply as a phobia in some medical dictionaries as a fear of weapons or firearms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_NcDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1009|title=Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine|first=Joseph|last=Segen|date=13 August 2010|publisher=BookBaby|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2imSyZZDh0C&amp;pg=PA557|title=The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties, Third Edition|first1=Ronald M.|last1=Doctor|first2=Ada P.|last2=Kahn|first3=Christine|last3=Adamec|date=12 May 2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDnvBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hoplophobia+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjapKjPkKnaAhXJy4MKHXJhCoUQ6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplophobia+&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|first=Andrew M.|last=Colman|date=7 April 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
American firearms expert and retired [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[colonel]] [[Jeff Cooper]] coined the word in 1962 to denigrate and anger proponents of [[gun control]] by implying that their thoughts were "aberrant" and unreasoning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I [[Etymology|coined]] the term "hoplophobia" in 1962 in response to a perceived need for a word to describe a mental aberration consisting of an unreasoning terror of gadgetry, specifically, weapons. The most common manifestation of hoplophobia is the idea that instruments possess a will of their own, apart from that of their user. This is not a reasoned position, but when you point this out to a hoplophobe he is not impressed because his is an unreasonable position. To convince a man that he is not making sense is not to change his viewpoint but rather to make an enemy. Thus hoplophobia is a useful word, but as with all words, it should be used correctly.&lt;ref name="cooper-commentaries-5-7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term was constructed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὅπλον – ''[[hoplon]]'', meaning, amongst other things, "arms," and φόβος – ''phobos'', meaning "fear."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper employed the term as just another alternative to other slang terms, stating: "We read of 'gun grabbers' and 'anti-gun nuts' but these slang terms do not [explain this behavior]." Cooper's conjecture was that "the most common manifestation of hoplophobia is the idea that instruments possess a will of their own, apart from that of their user."&lt;ref name="cooper-commentaries-5-7"/&gt; Writing in an opinion piece, ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' columnist Dimitri Vassilaros said that the term was intended by Cooper as tongue-in-cheek to mock those who think guns have free will.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Tribune-Review"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9443">The '''Inclosure Acts'''&lt;ref&gt;"Inclosure" is an old or formal spelling of the word now more usually spelled "enclosure". Both spellings are pronounced {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|n|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|ʒ|ər}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of Acts of Parliament that empowered [[enclosure]] of [[open field system|open fields]] and [[common land]] in England and Wales, creating legal property rights to land that was previously held in common. Between 1604 and 1914, over 5,200 individual enclosure acts were passed, covering {{convert|6.8|e6acre|ha km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enclosing the Land|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/landscape/overview/enclosingland/|work=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Enclosure}}
Prior to the enclosures in England, a portion of the land was categorized as "common" or "waste" or not in use. "Common" land was under the control of the lord of the manor, but a number of rights on the land (such as [[pasture]], [[pannage]], or [[estovers]]) were variously held by certain nearby properties, or (occasionally) held ''in gross'' by all manorial tenants. "Waste" was land without value as a farm strip – often very narrow areas (typically less than a yard wide) in awkward locations (like cliff edges, or inconveniently shaped manorial borders), but also bare rock, and so forth; "waste" was not officially used by anyone, and thus was often cultivated by landless peasants&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark|first=Gregory |author2=Anthony Clark|title=Common Rights to Land in England|journal=The Journal of Economic History |date=December 2001| volume=61| issue=04| page=1009-1036| doi=10.1017/S0022050701042061 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=104888&amp;jid=JEH&amp;volumeId=61&amp;issueId=04&amp;aid=104887&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession= |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The remainder of the land was organised into a large number of narrow strips, with each tenant possessing a number of disparate strips throughout the manor, as would the [[lord of the manor|manorial lord]]. Called the [[Open-field system|open field system]], it was administered by [[court baron|manorial courts]], which exercised some kind of collective control&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;. Thus what might now be considered a single field, would under this system have been divided among the lord and his tenants; poorer peasants ([[serfdom|serfs]] or [[copyhold|copyholders]], depending on the era) would be allowed to live on the strips owned by the lord, in return for cultivating his land.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|title=open-field system|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/429652/open-field-system/ |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system facilitated common grazing and crop rotation.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; 

Any particular individual might possess several strips of land within the manor, often separated by some distance from one another. In search of better financial returns, landowners looked for more efficient farming techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Motamed |first=Mesbah J. |author2=Raymond J.G.M Florax |author3=William A. Masters |title=Agriculture, Transportation and the Timing of Urbanization: Global Analysis at the Grid Cell Level |date=October 31, 2013| pages=4 |url=http://sites.tufts.edu/willmasters/files/2010/07/MFM_GeographyUrbanization_Rev31Oct2013.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;; enclosure Acts for small areas had been passed sporadically since the 12th century, but with the rise of new agricultural knowledge and technology in the 18th century, they became more commonplace. Because tenants (even copyholders) had legally enforcable rights on the land, substantial compensation was provided to extinguish them; as a result, many tenants were active supporters of enclosure, but the Acts enabled landlords to force reluctant tenants to comply with the process.

With legal control of the land, landlords utilised innovations in methods of crop production, increasing profits and supporting the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]; the higher productivity also enabled landowners to justify higher rents for the people working the land. In 1801, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act was passed to tidy up previous acts. In 1845, another General Inclosure Act allowed for the appointment of Inclosure Commissioners who could enclose land without submitting a request to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

The tenants displaced by the process often left the countryside to work in the towns. This contributed to the [[industrial revolution]] – at the very moment new technological advances required large numbers of workers, a concentration of large numbers of people in need of work had emerged; the former country tenants and their descendants became workers in industrial factories within cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enclosing the Land |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/landscape/overview/enclosingland/  |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science''' ({{lang-sv|Skytteanska priset}}) was established in 1995 by the Johan Skytte Foundation at [[Uppsala University]]. The foundation itself goes back to the donation in 1622 from [[Johan Skytte]] (1577-1645), politician and [[Chancellor of Uppsala University|chancellor of the university]], which established the Skyttean professorship of Eloquence and Government. 

The prize, 500,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] (approximately $70,000) is to be given "to the scholar who in the view of the Foundation has made the most valuable contribution to [[political science]]". Since its creation in 1995, the Johan Skytte Prize has garnered a prestigious reputation within the social science community, earning the nickname "the [[Nobel Prize]] for Political Science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economics.harvard.edu/news/congratulations-professor-amartya-sen-his-award-2017-johan-skytte-prize-political|title=Congratulations to Professor Amartya Sen on His Award of the 2017 Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science!|last=|first=|date=April 26, 2017|website=Harvard University Department of Economics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Democracy: Second Edition|last=Dahl|first=Robert|last2=Shapiro|first2=Ian|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reputation surveys conducted in 2013-2014 and 2018, it is the most prestigious international academic award in political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|publisher=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|location=Brussels|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Fan|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=The hierarchical status of international academic awards in social sciences|journal=Scientometrics|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s11192-018-2928-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Juntao|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=Mapping of important international academic awards|journal=Scientometrics|date=2015|volume=104|pages=763-791|doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justin Hopson''' is a retired [[New Jersey]] [[State Trooper]], licensed private investigator, whistle-blower, and author of "''Breaking the Blue Wall: One Man's War Against Police Corruption."'' As a rookie state trooper, Justin Hopson witnessed an unlawful arrest and false charges of a woman made by his training officer, so Hopson refused to testify in court supporting the arrest. As a result, Trooper Hopson was targeted by a rogue group of troopers known as the Lords of Discipline or "LOD." The LOD bullied and hazed fellow troopers for decades until Justin Hopson blew the whistle. Hopson brought tangible evidence and a written chronology of events that occurred to internal affairs and the attorney general's office...which sparked the largest internal investigation in state police history and high profile federal case (Hopson v State of New Jersey #1:03-CV-5817). "I was an ordinary cop with an extraordinary cause. My cause is constant - to unearth corruption by shining a light on integrity," says Hopson.

[[ABC News]], ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/opinion/nyregionopinions/NJtrooper.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''The Star-Ledger'', 20/20, and other media outlets have interviewed and featured Justin Hopson concerning police corruption. After retiring from the New Jersey State Police, Justin Hopson began a private investigative firm in South Carolina. He is a member of the South Carolina Association for Legal Investigators (SCALI). SCALI has since selected and appointed Mr. Hopson to its Ethics Committee and invited him to speak at its annual conference. In 2012, Justin Hopson was selected and appointed by the National Whistleblower Center to Co-chair the Coordinating Committee to designate July 30 of every year as National Whistle-blower Day. In 2013, Mr. Hopson was selected and appointed by Governor, Nikki Haley, to a South Carolina State Advisory Committee, That same year, Justin Hopson was featured on ABC News 20/20 and his book, ''"Breaking the Blue Wall"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.breakingthebluewall.com|title=Justin Hopson|website=www.breakingthebluewall.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; climbed to #14 on Amazon's true crime ranking.

Justin Hopson, Edward Snowden, Deep Throat, and Jeffrey Wigand were featured in the textbook, "Whistle-Blowers: Exposing Crime and Corruption"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lernerbooks.com|title=Nonfiction and Fiction Books and Digital Content for Children Grades K-12|website=www.lernerbooks.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published by Lerner Publishing Group in 2015. Justin Hopson has book signing events and speaks to universities, business conferences, media venues, and corporations nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justinhopson.com|title=Justin Hopson|website=www.justinhopson.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;[http://usatf.org]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements/09499/lords-of-discipline.html lawyersandsettlements.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nj.com/ledgerarchives/2006/04/probe_finds_troopers_abused_co.html blog.nj.com April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2007/10/a_state_police_whitewash.html blog.nj.com October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Mr. Hopson, authored the nonfiction book, ''IF the Fist Lady Hired Me...A Private Eye's Tell-All on Cheating in America.'' This provocative book takes readers behind the lens of a surveillance camera and untangles the web of deception cast from America's 45th President to a small-town love triangle. Hopson declares within the pages of his book that "cheating IS the kiss of death to marriage and monogamous relationships." High-profile lawyer, Elizabeth Lee Beck, who deposed Donald Trump in 2011 foreworded the book - {{ISBN|978-1-7323198-4-4}}. Most notably, ''IF the First Lady Hired Me...'' is the first book ever written to a First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS) and made national headlines in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2018/09/10/private-eye-reaches-out-to-melania-trump-with-new-book/&lt;ref&gt;and&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ny-ent-melania-trump-justin-hopson-20180725-story.html&lt;ref&gt;

Mr. Hopson is an enthusiast for middle-distance running and received a USA Track and Field Scholarship and Level 1 Certification at the University of South Carolina. He was then appointed to the USATF Grievance Review Board for South Carolina. Justin lives with his family along the South Carolina coast.

'''Land Reform''' refers to efforts to reform the ownership and regulation of land in India.

Land distribution has been part of India’s state policy from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Thorner, Daniel. 1976. Agrarian Prospect in India. New Delhi: Allied Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Independent India’s most revolutionary land policy was perhaps the abolition of the Zamindari system (feudal land holding practices). Land-reform policy in India had two specific objectives:
"The first is to remove such impediments to increase in agricultural production as arise from the agrarian structure inherited from the past…The second object, which is closely related to the first, is to eliminate all elements of exploitation and social injustice within the agrarian system, to provide security for the tiller of soil and assure equality of status and opportunity to all sections of the rural population.” (Government of India 1961 as quoted by Appu 1996&lt;ref&gt;Appu, P. S. 1996. Land Reforms in India: A Survey of Policy, Legislation and Implementation. New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Categories ==
There are four main categories of reforms: 
* Abolition of intermediaries (rent collectors under the pre-Independence land revenue system); 
* Tenancy regulation (to improve the contractual terms including security of tenure); 
* A ceiling on landholdings (to redistributing surplus land to the landless); 
* Attempts to consolidate disparate landholdings;
*encouragement of cooperative joint farming;
*settlement and regulation of tenancy.&lt;ref name="Besley 2010"&gt;Besley, Timothy and Burgess, Robin. 2000. “Land Reform, Poverty Reduction, and Growth: Evidence from India.” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 115: 389-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since its independence in 1947, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several states&lt;ref&gt;Appu, P. S. (1996).

Land Rights Formalization in India; Examining de Soto through the lens of Rawls theory of justice. FLOOR Working paper 18. p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Kerala]]. Other than these state sponsored attempts of reforming land ownership and control, there was another attempt to bring changes in the regime which achieved limited success; famously known as [[Bhoodan movement]] (Government of India, Ministry of Rural Development 2003, Annex XXXIX). Some other research has shown that during the movement, in Vidarbha region, 14 percent of the land records are incomplete, thus prohibiting transfer to the poor. 24 percent of the land promised had never actually become part of the movement. The Gramdan which arguably took place in 160,000 pockets did not legalise the process under the state laws ([http://www.rd.ap.gov.in/ikpland/mrd_committee_report_v_01_mar_09.pdf Committee on Land Reform 2009, 77, Ministry of Rural Development]).

After promising land reforms and elected to power in West Bengal in 1977, the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)) kept their word and initiated gradual land reforms, such as [[Operation Barga]]. The result was a more equitable distribution of land among the landless farmers, and enumeration of landless farmers. This has ensured an almost lifelong loyalty from the farmers and the communists were in power till 2011 assembly election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-13/news/29539868_1_trinamool-congress-assembly-elections-mamata-banerjee | work=The Times Of India | title=Assembly election 2011 West Bengal: Trinamool Congress rises like phoenix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[land reform in Kerala]], the only other large state where the CPI(M) came to power, state administrations have actually carried out the most extensive land, tenancy and agrarian labour wage reforms in the non-socialist late-industrialising world.&lt;ref&gt;[Heller, Patrick. 1999. The Labor of Development. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, Chapters 2 and 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful land reform program was launched in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] after 1947.

All in all, land reforms have been successful only in pockets of the country, as people have often found loopholes in the laws that set limits on the maximum area of land that is allowed to be held by any one person.&lt;ref name="Basu, Kaushik 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Abhijit V., Paul J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12648">[[File:Luis Durnwalder Südtirol.jpg|thumb|[[Luis Durnwalder]], ''Landeshauptmann'' of South Tyrol 1989–2014]]
'''Landeshauptmann''' (if male) or '''Landeshauptfrau''' (if female) ({{IPA-de|ˈlandəsˌhaʊptman|lang}}, "state captain", plural ''Landeshauptleute'') is the [[chairman]] of a [[state government]] and the supreme [[official]] of an [[States of Austria|Austrian state]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] autonomous provinces of [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]], corresponding to the title of [[minister-president]] or [[premier]]. Until 1933 the term was used in [[Prussia]] for the [[head of government]] of a [[province]],&lt;ref name="DDN"&gt;[[Duden]]; Definition of Landeshauptmann, in German. [http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Landeshauptmann]&lt;/ref&gt; in the modern-day states of Germany the counterpart to ''Landeshauptmann'' (governor) is the ''Ministerpräsident'' (minister-president).

==Origins==
Since the [[early modern period]], a ''Landeshauptmann'' originally served as governor under either a [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] or the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] himself, mainly in the territories of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (as for the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]), later also in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In the [[Austrian Empire]], according to the 1861 [[February Patent]], the title referred to the president of the ''[[Landtag]]'' assembly of a Habsburg [[crown land]] (called ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Landmarschall|de}}'' in [[Lower Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]), who also served as head of the provincial administration. The [[Imperial-Royal]] government in [[Vienna]] was represented by a ''[[Stadtholder|Statthalter]]'' or ''Landespräsident'' (governor).

With the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the proclamation of the [[Republic of German-Austria]] in 1918, provisional state assemblies and state governments were established, headed by a ''Landeshauptmann''. The 1920 [[Constitution of Austria|constitution]] of the [[First Austrian Republic]] (''Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz'') unified the office of a [[Austrian Federal Government|Federal Government]] representative and head of the state government. The title is today used in modern Austria as well as in South Tyrol and Trentino, autonomous provinces in Italy with strong linguistic and cultural ties to the neighbouring Austrian state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. In the [[Czech Republic]], a ''hejtman'' (German: ''Hauptmann'') represents each of the 13 self-governing regions (Czech ''kraj'', pl. ''kraje''). The title was also used by the [[German Empire]] for governors during the early stages of its [[colonialism|colonial]] rule over [[German South-West Africa]] (1893–1898), [[Togoland]] (1893–1898) and [[German New Guinea]] (1886–1889, 1892–1899).

==Austria==
In modern Austria, the title is used for the head of the executive of the nine Austrian states, equivalent to the position of a ''Ministerpräsident'' in [[States of Germany|German states]]. Outside of Austria, the title is usually translated as "[[governor]]," though as mentioned above the function corresponds more to that of minister-president or premier. 

The ''Landeshauptmann'' is elected by the ''[[Landtag]]'' state parliament of the respective state and sworn in by the [[President of Austria]]. In practice, he or she is almost always the leader of the majority party in the Landtag, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. As representative of the [[federated state]] on state level, he or she is also responsible for the enforcement of federal laws.

The [[List of mayors of Vienna|Mayor of Vienna]] also serves as a ''Landeshauptmann'', elected by the municipal assembly (''Wiener Gemeiderat und Landtag''). When [[Waltraud Klasnic]] ([[ÖVP]]) became governor of [[Styria]] in 1996, she preferred to be addressed as ''Frau Landeshauptmann'', whereas [[Gabi Burgstaller]] ([[SPÖ]]), governor of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] from 2004 to 2013, preferred ''Frau Landeshauptfrau''. Since 1 July 1988, the [[Constitution of Austria]] allows for, but does not prescribe, office designations to be [[gender]]-specific &lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Austria, Article 7,3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Tyrol and Trentino==
{{See also|List of Governors of South Tyrol|List of Presidents of Trentino}}
According to the 1946 [[Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement]] and the Second Autonomy Statute of 1972, the chief executives of the provincial governments ({{lang-it|Presidente della Provincia autonoma}}) of South Tyrol and Trentino are called ''Landeshauptleute'' in German.

The head of [[government of South Tyrol]] is elected by the provincial ''[[Landtag of South Tyrol|Landtag]]'' legislature. The ''Landeshauptmann'' represents the province to the outside and in meetings of the [[Regions of Italy|regions]] with the [[Politics of Italy|Italian government]]. He is also entitled to attend the sessions of the [[Cabinet of Italy|Council of Ministers]] as far as South Tyrolean issues are discussed. His two deputies have to represent the Italian and German language group.

Despite the German terms ''Landeshauptmann'' and ''Landtag'', South Tyrol and Trentino according to Italian conception are no [[federated state]]s (''Länder'') but merely subnational [[administrative division]]s (''enti territoriali''), though with considerable self-government responsibilities and legislative powers.

==Prussia==
From 1875 the territorial authority of the [[Prussian estates|estates]] in the twelve administrative [[Provinces of Prussia|provinces]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] were re-organised as ''Provinzialverbände''. Each of these [[Self-governance|self-governing]] bodies were represented in a ''Provinziallandtag'' assembly, whose members were delegated by the rural and urban [[Districts of Prussia|districts]] within the province. The districts organised through their elected deputees their utilities, such as construction and maintenance of provincial roads, hospitals, schools, public savings banks, waste disposal etc., in self-rule.

The provincial administration was initially headed by a ''Landesdirektor'', who was elected by the assembly for six-year terms (in [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]]: five years) and maximally two terms. The holder of the office presided over the ''Provinzialausschuss'', i.e. provincial government of self-rule, whereas the ''Oberpräsident'' was the [[List of monarchs of Prussia|king]]-appointed representative for the province, busy with implementing and supervising central prerogatives of the Prussian government.

In the following decades, ''Landeshauptmann'' gradually replaced the earlier expression ''Landesdirektor'' in all but one of Prussia's provinces. When the kingdom turned into a [[Free State of Prussia|free state]] in 1920, only the ''Landtag'' of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] had decided to keep the traditional expression.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. article: "Landesdirektor", in: ''Der Große Brockhaus: Handbuch des Wissens in zwanzig Bänden'': 21 vols. &lt;!--Sic! named in "zwanzig" vols., but in fact appeared 21--&gt;; Leipzig: Brockhaus, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;1928–1935; vol. 11 (1932), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; With the abolition of democratic self-rule on all government levels in the course of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover]] in 1933, the office-holders were furloughed or retired and the offices remained vacant.

===Klaipėda Region===
The [[Klaipėda Region]] ({{lang-de|Memelland}}), which was dissected from [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]] after [[World War I]] and annexed by [[Lithuania]] in the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] of 1923, continued the usage of the terms ''Landesdirektor'' (i.e. government member) and [[Directorate of the Klaipėda Region|Landesdirektorium]] ({{lang-lt|krašto direktorija}}; i.e. government). The head of government was given the title Landespräsident (state president).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10993">'''Limousine liberal''' and '''latte liberal''' are pejorative [[United States|American]] [[politics|political]] terms used to illustrate purported [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] behavior by political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] of [[upper class]] or [[upper middle class]] status; for example, calling for the use of mass transit while frequently using privately-owned luxury transportation, especially by [[limousines]] or [[private jet]]s in the case of the extremely affluent,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' . [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1599714,00.html "Limousine Liberal Hypocrisy"] by [[Charles Krauthammer]]. Published March 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming [[environmental consciousness]] but driving [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel inefficient]] sports cars or SUVs, attacking income inequality while being wealthy themselves, or ostensibly supporting public education while actually sending their children to private schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=130020147 NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Limousine liberal" is also a reference to celebrities who use their fame to influence others into agreeing with their political and societal points of view. Such celebrities' critics (including proponents of the pejorative) assert that their wealth and status keeps them out of touch with the American [[American middle class|middle]] and lower middle classes they purport to support, and that they are typically blind to this disconnect.

==Formation and early use==
===Procaccino campaign===
[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[New York City]] [[mayor]]al hopeful [[Mario Procaccino]] coined the term "limousine liberal" to describe incumbent  [[Mayor]] [[John Lindsay]] and his wealthy [[Manhattan]] backers during a heated [[New York City mayoral election, 1969|1969 campaign]].

It was a [[Populism|populist]] and [[producerism|producerist]] epithet, carrying an implicit accusation that the people it described were insulated from all negative consequences of their programs purported to benefit the poor, and that the costs and consequences of such programs would be borne in the main by [[working class]] or [[lower middle class]] people who were not so poor as to be beneficiaries themselves. In particular, Procaccino criticized Lindsay for favoring unemployed blacks over working-class [[white ethnic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]''. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02EFD61E38F936A15752C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/L/Lindsay,%20John%20V. "Mayoral Follies, The 1969 Edition "] Published January 25, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Procaccino campaign memo attacked "rich super-[[assimilation (sociology)|assimilated]] people who live on [[Fifth Avenue]] and maintain some choice [[mansions]] outside the city and have no feeling for the small [[middle class]] shopkeeper, home owner, etc. They preach the politics of confrontation and condone violent upheaval in society because they are not touched by it and are protected by their [[courtiers]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York'' by Vincent J. Cannato, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Upv5ezVPBOMC&amp;pg=PA428&amp;lpg=PA428&amp;dq=%22john+lindsay%22+%22limousine+liberal%22+mansions&amp;source=web&amp;ots=s5SlrUkR8H&amp;sig=4qK1rKY6qWYR_ceiCsh5JcXfh3k page 428].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' later stated that "Lindsay came across as all style and no substance, a 'limousine liberal' who knew nothing of the concerns of the same '[[Silent Majority (Politics)|Silent Majority]]' that was carrying [[Richard Nixon]] to the White House at the very same time."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Independent]].'' [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001222/ai_n14346783 "Obituary: John Lindsay "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107210317/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001222/ai_n14346783 |date=2008-01-07 }}.Written December 22, 2000 by Rupert Cornwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
In the 1970s, the term was applied to wealthy liberal supporters of open-housing and [[desegregation busing|forced school busing]] who didn't make use of public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060730/ai_n16647842 "A liberal interpretation: The current definition of right- and left-"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107210307/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060730/ai_n16647842 |date=2008-01-07 }} by Geoffrey Nunberg. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. Published July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], supporters of busing, such as Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], sent their children to private schools or lived in affluent [[suburb]]s. To some [[South Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]] residents, Kennedy's support of a plan that "[[racial integration|integrated]]" their children with blacks and his apparent unwillingness to do the same with his own children, was hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/01563014.htm News/Features |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024024419/http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/01563014.htm |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s and early 21st century, the term has also come to be applied to those who support [[environmentalist]] or "green" goals, such as [[mass transit]], yet  drive large [[SUVs]] or literally have a limousine and driver. ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' applied the term to [[Sheila Jackson-Lee|Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX 18)]] for being "routinely chauffeured the one short block to work--in a government car, by a member of her staff, at the taxpayers' expense."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/867aejst.asp Sheila Jackson Lee, Limousine Liberal]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used disparagingly in a 2004 episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' by [[Fred Thompson]]'s character, [[Arthur Branch]], to criticize the politics and beliefs of his more liberal colleague, [[Serena Southerlyn]]. ''[[South Park]]'''s creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] poked fun at the tendency of some liberals to be more concerned with image than actually helping the earth in the episode "[[Smug Alert!]]"

The ''[[New York Observer]]'' applied the term to 2008 Democratic presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] for paying $400 for a haircut and, according to the newspaper, "lectures about poverty while living in gated opulence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/2007/edwards-easy-mark Is Edwards An Easy Mark? | The New York Observer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107124004/http://www.observer.com/2007/edwards-easy-mark |date=2008-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the term was applied by many commentators to former Senate Majority Leader and then-Obama cabinet appointee [[Tom Daschle]] for failing to pay back taxes and interest on the use of a limousine service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleston.net/news/2009/feb/03/pull_this_limousine_liberal70391/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729165317/http://www.charleston.net/news/2009/feb/03/pull_this_limousine_liberal70391/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-29 |title=The Post and Courier &amp;#124; Charleston SC, News, Sports, Entertainment |publisher=Charleston.net |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2013-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsherald.com/articles/government_71658___article.html/pay_country.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217172235/http://www.newsherald.com/articles/government_71658___article.html/pay_country.html |title=Future generations will pay for our mistakes |publisher=Newsherald.com |date=February 8, 2009 |archivedate=February 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 4, 2013 |first=Ron |last=Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has often been applied to documentary filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] over the years by both critics on the left and right due to his habit of traveling around New York City in a limousine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/the-real-fun-at-the-michael-moore-afterparty-2009-9 Business Insider: The REAL Fun Was At The Michael Moore Afterparty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/3/30/212203.shtml Newsmax: Michael Moore: The Leni Riefenstahl of the Left] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523181057/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/3/30/212203.shtml |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Gore]] is often called a limousine liberal by his critics for his use of private jet planes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/06/al_gore_and_the_limits_of_recy.html |title=Articles - Al Gore and the Limits of Recycling |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=2006-06-02 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SUVs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malkin |first=Michelle |url=http://michellemalkin.com/2008/07/17/limousine-liberal-video-of-the-day-gore-and-his-gas-guzzling-fans-exposed/ |title=Limousine liberal video of the day: Gore and his gas-guzzling fans exposed!; Update: What global warming consensus? « |publisher=Michelle Malkin |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while giving speeches calling for reductions in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Gore_Generational_Challenge_speech"&gt;{{Cite video

 |accessdate=2013-03-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 16, 2007 edition of TIME magazine, the term was used in the allegation that "His (Gore's) Tennessee mansion consumes 20 times the electricity used by the average American home"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1599714,00.html |title=Limousine Liberal Hypocrisy |publisher=TIME |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Lexus liberal" is a variant on the term, used to describe an upper-middle class individual who supports the same ideas of the limousine liberals, but is still out-of-touch with the actual poor they purport to feel for. The term "Lexus" is used as these liberals might not have a limousine, but are wealthy enough to afford a luxury car or high-end vehicle, such as a [[Lexus]].

The '''Marihuana Tax Act of 1937''', {{USStatute|75|238|50|551|1937|8|2}}, was a [[United States]] Act that placed a tax on the sale of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. The H.R. 6385 act was drafted by [[Harry Anslinger]] and introduced by Rep. [[Robert L. Doughton]] of [[North Carolina]], on April 14, 1937. The seventy-fifth Congress held hearings on April 27, 28, 29th, 30th, and May 4, 1937. Upon the congressional hearings confirmation, the H.R. 6385 act was redrafted as H.R. 6906 and introduced with House Report 792. The Act is now commonly referred to, using the modern  spelling, as the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. This act was overturned in 1969 in ''[[Leary v. United States]]'', and was repealed by Congress the next year.&lt;ref&gt;For repeal, see section 1101(b)(3), Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, 1292 (Oct. 27, 1970) (repealing the Marihuana Tax Act which had been codified in Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Regulations and restrictions on the sale of cannabis sativa as a drug began as early as 1906 (see [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States]]). The head of the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] (FBN), [[Harry J. Anslinger]], argued that, in the 1930s, the FBN had noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana.&lt;ref name="anslinger"&gt;[http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/murd3.htm Harry J. Anslinger, U. S. Commissioner of Narcotics and Will Oursler : The Murderers, the story of the narcotic gangs, Pages: 541-554, 1961]&lt;/ref&gt; He had also, in 1935, received support from president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for adoption of the [[Uniform State Narcotic Act]], state laws that included regulations of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

The total production of [[hemp]] fiber in the United States had in 1933 decreased to around 500 tons/year. Cultivation of hemp began to increase in 1934 and 1935 but production remained at very low volume compared with other fibers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametec.com/hemp/fiberwars/chp8fr.html David P. West: Fiber Wars: The Extinction of Kentucky Hemp chapter 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/mhc3.htm STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. WRIGHT, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/nugent1.htm  H.T. NUGENT: COMMERCIALIZED HEMP (1934-35 CROP) in the STATE OF MINNESOTA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanfstengel.jpg|thumb|left|Hemp, bast with fibers. The stem, that can become hemp hurds, in the middle.]]

Some parties have argued that the aim of the Act was to reduce the size of the hemp industry&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129"&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Laurence|author2=Magdaleno Manzanárez|title=NAFTA &amp; neocolonialism: comparative criminal, human &amp; social justice|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|pages=129|isbn=978-0-7618-2890-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ozF1Yg-c4MC&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding marijuana: a new look at the scientific evidence|author=Mitchell Earlywine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-518295-8|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9wPbxMAG8cC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peet|first=Preston|title=Under the influence: the disinformation guide to drugs|publisher=The Disinformation Company|year=2004|pages=55|isbn=978-1-932857-00-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely as an effort of businessmen [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Randolph Hearst]], and the [[Du Pont family]].&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55" /&gt; The same parties have argued that with the invention of the [[decorticator]], hemp had become a very cheap substitute for the [[paper pulp]] that was used in the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bound in twine: the history and ecology of the henequen-wheat complex for Mexico and the American and Canadian Plains, 1880-1950|author=Sterling Evans|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58544-596-7|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wFkZgyuGFAC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parties argue that Hearst felt that this was a threat to his extensive timber holdings. Mellon, [[Secretary of the Treasury]] and the wealthiest man in the US, had invested heavily in the Du Pont family's new synthetic fiber, [[nylon]], a fiber that was competing with hemp.&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt; In 1916, [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and [[Lyster Hoxie Dewey|Lyster H. Dewey]] created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 "Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material", in which they concluded that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood".&lt;ref&gt;Lyster H. Dewey and Jason L. Merrill [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17855 ''Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material''] [[USDA]] Bulletin No. 404, Washington, D.C., October 14, 1916, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and Merrill believed that hemp hurds were a suitable source for paper production. However, later research does not confirm this. The concentration of cellulose in hemp hurds is only between 32% and 38% (not 77%, a number often repeated by [[Jack Herer]] and others on the Internet).&lt;ref name="Werf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01213.html |title=Hayo M.G. van der Werf : Hemp facts and hemp fiction |publisher=Hempfood.com |accessdate=2011-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711162333/http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01213.html |archivedate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manufacture of paper with hemp as a raw material has shown that hemp lacks the qualities needed to become a major competitor to the traditional paper industry, which still uses wood or waste paper as raw material. In 2003, 95% of the hemp hurds in the [[European Union|EU]] were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material.&lt;ref name="michael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a902981619~frm=titlelink |title=Michael Karus: European Hemp Industry 2002 Cultivation, Processing and Product Lines.

They argue that the purpose of developing the nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with [[silk]] and [[rayon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caimateriali.org/index.php?id=32 Prof. L.

The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) opposed the act because the tax was imposed on physicians prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and [[medical cannabis]] [[Cannabis cultivation|cultivation]]/manufacturing. The AMA proposed that cannabis instead be added to the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm|title=Statement of Dr. William C.

July 12, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; He doubted their claims about marijuana addiction, violence, and overdosage; he further asserted that because the word ''Marijuana'' was largely unknown at the time, the medical profession did not realize they were losing cannabis. "Marijuana is not the correct term&amp;nbsp;... Yet the burden of this bill is placed heavily on the doctors and pharmacists of this country."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The bill was passed on the grounds of different reports&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/t10a.htm The Marijuana Tax Act, Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; and hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/taxact.htm The Marijuana Tax Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Anslinger also referred to the [[International Opium Convention]] that from 1928 included cannabis as a drug not a medicine, and that all states had some kind of laws against improper use of cannabis (for ex. the [[Uniform State Narcotic Act]]). By 1951, however, new justifications had emerged, and the [[Boggs Act]] that superseded the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was passed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In August 1954, the [[Internal Revenue Code]] of 1954 was enacted, and the Marihuana Tax Act was included in Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the 1954 Code.

==Operation of the act==

Shortly after the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act went into effect on October 1, 1937, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Denver City police arrested Moses Baca for possession and [[Samuel R. Caldwell|Samuel Caldwell]] for dealing. Baca and Caldwell's arrest made them the first marijuana convictions under U.S. federal law for not paying the marijuana tax.  Judge Foster Symes sentenced Baca to 18 months and Caldwell to four years in [[Leavenworth Penitentiary]] for violating the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act.

After the Philippines fell to Japanese forces in 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the US Army urged farmers to grow fiber [[hemp]].  Tax stamps for cultivation of fiber hemp began to be issued to farmers. Without any change in the Marihuana Tax Act, {{convert|400,000|acre|km2}} were cultivated with hemp between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/content/hemp.mj.html David P. West:Hemp and Marijuana:Myths &amp; Realities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, President Johnson's [[President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice|Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice]] opened, "The Act raises an insignificant amount of revenue and exposes an insignificant number of marijuana transactions to public view, since only a handful of people are registered under the Act. It has become, in effect, solely a criminal law, imposing sanctions upon persons who sell, acquire, or possess marijuana."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/special/king/dhu/dhu12.htm Balancing the Grass Account&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 in ''[[Leary v. United States]]'', part of the Act was ruled to be unconstitutional as a violation of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], since a person seeking the tax stamp would have to incriminate him/herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/e1960/learyvus.htm ''Timothy Leary v. United States'', 395 U.S. 6, 89 S. Ct. 1532 (1969)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/features/weed-between-the-lines/marihuana-tax-act-of-1937-rises-from-the-dead/|title=Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 rises from the dead - Boulder Weekly|last=Kriho|first=Laura|date=2013-10-31|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response the Congress passed the [[Controlled Substances Act]] as Title II of the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|91|513|84|1236|1970|10|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which repealed the 1937 Act.

==Etymology==
{{main|Marijuana (word)}}

Although the spelling "marijuana" is more common in current usage, the actual spelling used in the Marihuana Tax Act is "marihuana". "Marihuana" was the spelling most commonly used in Federal Government documents at the time.

In addition, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 legitimized the use of the term "marijuana" as a label for hemp and cannabis plants and products in the US and around the world. Prior to 1937, "marijuana" was slang; it was not included in any official dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New International Dictionary, p. 1318, G. &amp; C. Merriam Company (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''marijuana'' is probably of Mexican origin.  Mexico itself had passed prohibition for export to the US in 1925, following the International Opium Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MEXICO BANS MARIHUANA.; To Stamp Out Drug Plant Which Crazes Its Addicts.|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 1925|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/12/29/archives/mexico-bans-marihuana-to-stamp-out-drug-plant-which-crazes-its.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years leading up to the tax act, it was in common use in the United States, "smoked like tobacco", and called "ganjah", or "ganja".&lt;ref&gt;The American Agriculturist Family Cyclopaedia, 751 Broadway, New York, copyright:1888, by A.L.Burt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New International Dictionary, 1921, published by G.&amp; C. Merriam Co., Springfield Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; After the enactment, illegal immigrants and US citizens could be arrested for possession of cannabis.

==The La Guardia Committee Report==
The only authoritative voice that opposed [[Anslinger]]'s campaign against cannabis was that of [[New York City|New York]] Mayor, [[Fiorello La Guardia]], who appointed in 1938 a commission of investigation, and in 1944 strongly objected to Anslinger's campaign with the [[La Guardia Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/lag/lagmenu.htm The La Guardia Committee Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14110">'''McDonaldization''' is a term developed by [[sociologist]] [[George Ritzer]] in his book ''[[The McDonaldization of Society]]'' (1993).  For Ritzer McDonaldization becomes manifested when a society adopts the characteristics of a [[fast-food]] restaurant. 

McDonaldization is a reconceptualization of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[scientific management]]. Where [[Max Weber]] used the model of the bureaucracy to represent the direction of this changing society, Ritzer sees the fast-food restaurant as a more representative contemporary [[paradigm]] (Ritzer, 2004:553). The process of McDonaldization can be summarized as the way in which "the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate more and more sectors of [[American society]] as well as of the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;(Ritzer, 1993:1)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The McDonaldization thesis in its cultural version is a comparatively recent idea about the worldwide [[wikt:homogenize|homogenization]] of cultures due to [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Pieterse, Jan Nederveen. Globalization and Culture: Global Melange. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2009.3.28&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aspects==
Ritzer highlighted four primary components of McDonaldization:

* [[wikt:Efficiency|Efficiency]] – the optimal method for accomplishing a task. In this context, Ritzer has a very specific meaning of "efficiency".    In the example of McDonald's customers, it is the fastest way to get from being hungry to being full.  Efficiency in McDonaldization means that every aspect of the organization is geared toward the minimization of time.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book

| title = The McDonaldization of Society

| location = Los Angeles
| isbn = 0-7619-8812-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Calculation|Calculability]] – objective should be quantifiable (e.g. sales) rather than subjective (e.g. taste).  McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product.  This allows people to quantify how much they're getting versus how much they're paying. Organizations want consumers to believe that they are getting a large amount of product for not a lot of money.  Workers in these organizations are judged by how fast they are instead of the quality of work they do.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;
* [[Predictability]] – [[standardization|standardized]] and uniform services.  "Predictability" means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product every time when interacting with the McDonaldized organization.  This also applies to the workers in those organizations.  Their tasks are highly repetitive, highly routine, and predictable.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;
* [[Social control|Control]] – standardized and uniform employees, replacement of human by non-human technologies

With these four principles of the fast food industry, a strategy which is rational within a narrow scope can lead to outcomes that are harmful or irrational. As these processes spread to other parts of society, modern society’s new social and cultural characteristics are created. For example, as McDonald’s enters a country and consumer patterns are unified, cultural hybridization occurs.

==Irrationality of Rationality==
Ritzer also outlines Irrationality of Rationality as a fifth aspect of McDonaldization. 
"Most specifically, [[irrationality]] means that rational systems are unreasonable systems. By that I mean that they deny the basic humanity, the human reason, of the people who work within or are served by them." (Ritzer 1994:154)

Ritzer introduces this during Chapter Two (The Past, Present, and Future of McDonaldization: From the Iron Cage to the Fast-Food Factory and Beyond) of his book "The McDonaldization of Society" in the sub-section Irrationality and the "Iron Cage." He states that "Despite the advantages it offers, [[bureaucracy]] suffers from the irrationality of rationality. Like a fast-food restaurant, a bureaucracy can be a dehumanizing place in which to work and by which to be served." In short; "settings in which people cannot always behave as human beings".

A further problem with the irrationality of rationality is that this can lead to inconsistencies; fast food is no longer fast, there are long lines and it is at the expense of taste.

He further states that beyond [[dehumanization]] further irrationalities emerge; including the inefficient masses of red tape, over quantification leading to low quality work, unpredictability as employees grow unclear about what they are supposed to do, or the loss of control due to other things.

==De-McDonaldization==
Organizations have been making an effort to deny the rationalization of McDonaldization. Efforts are related to focusing on quality instead of quantity, enjoying the unpredictability of service and product and employing more skilled workers without any outside control.
Protests have also been rising in nation-states in order to slow down the process of McDonaldization and to protect their localization and traditional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=The McDonaldization of Society|year=2008|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=07619-8812-2|pages=351–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also some local case studies show how the rational model of McDonald's adjust to local cultural preferences and the result is a diminution of the original McDonald's product. In fact, the more the company adjusts to local conditions the more appeal the scientific calculations of the specifically American product may be lost. At the end of the day, McDonald's is a contributing factor to [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Bryan S. McDonaldization Linearity and Liquidity in Consumer Cultures. Sage Journals University at Cambridge, 2003, June 4, 2012 &lt;http://abs.sagepub.com/content/47/2/137.full.pdf+html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Junk food news]], defined here as inoffensive and trivial news served up in palatable portions, is an example of McDonaldization. Another example could be McUniversities, which features modularized curricula, delivering degrees in a fast-track pick-and-mix fashion to satisfy all tastes. The diminished quality of these products can only be disguised by extensive advertising which constantly repackages them to look new.&lt;ref&gt;GORDON MARSHALL. "McDonaldization." A Dictionary of Sociology. 1998. Encyclopedia.com. 8 Apr. 2013 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In penology, there has been a shift from punishments and treatment tailored to individual offenders, to attempting to control classes of offenders who are considered to be at high risk of recidivism through standardized penalties, such as those specified by [[three-strikes law]]s or [[sentencing guideline]]s. Offenders are [[Prison#Inmate_security_classifications|classified by security level]] and sent to facilities deemed capable of adequately [[incapacitation (penology)|incapacitating]] prisoners in their risk category. Technology such as [[electronic surveillance]], [[electronic monitoring]], [[urinalysis]], and [[computer-based offender tracking system]]s are often used in place of humans in the penal system.&lt;ref name=mcdonaldization&gt;{{cite journal|title=Three Strikes as a Public Policy: The Convergence of the New Penology and the McDonaldization of Punishment|author=Shichor, David|date=1 October 1997|volume=43|issue=4|pages=470-492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of McDonald's==
The response from [[McDonald's]], expressed by its representatives in the [[United Kingdom]], is that Ritzer, like other commentators, uses the company's size and brand recognition to promote ideas that do not necessarily relate to the company's business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McDonald's UK|title=Questions Answered|work=Make up your own mind|url=http://www.makeupyourownmind.co.uk/questions/what-are-you-doing-about/mcdonaldization/|accessdate=2007-09-15|quote=Due to the global scale of the McDonald’s business, many commentators seek to use its brand and international presence to support various positions and theories that they wish to put forward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
It has been argued by a westerner that an example of the phenomenon of McDonaldization can be seen in education, where there is seen to be increasing similarity between that of Western classrooms and the rest of the world. Slater&lt;ref name="Slater 1999"&gt;Slater (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the class size, layout and pedagogy in Peru closely resemble that of America, with clear examples of Western culture focused on efficiency of transfer of knowledge in other parts of the world. Furthermore, Slater&lt;ref name="Slater 1999"/&gt; goes on to demonstrate that the McDonaldization of education could have many negative side effects; particularly that it does not promote inquiry or creativity. Therefore, schools will become less effective at educating children as they will fail to develop creative thinkers.

According to Wong, the influence of McDonaldization has also affected Higher Education classrooms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wong (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Efficiency - Computer graded exams limit the amount of time necessary for instructors to grade their students. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Calculability - Letter Grades and Grade Point Averages are used and calculated to measure a student’s success over the course of their academic career. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Predictability - Course availability and requirements have become more standardized amongst universities. Making it easier to find similar courses and content at different locations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Control - Courses are structured very specifically and must meet certain requirements and follow certain guidelines. Courses begin and end at the same time on the same predetermined days and last for a specific amount of weeks. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by Carroll on "[http://eprints.teachingandlearning.ie/1951/1/Carroll%20McDonalization%20of%20Education%202013.pdf E-learning – the McDonaldization of education]" describes how e-learning has become one of the biggest phenomena of educational literature in recent years. Although the potential promise of e-learning is often expected within the process of learning, much of the emphasis is in fact on the electronic issues to facilitate learning, with little regard for its consequences on the learning process. Consequently, this often erodes the human factor in learning – making the learning process a more isolated experience. This article suggests that academics should become more cautions with their acceptance of facilitating learning through e-learning platforms without fully understanding the impact on students learning experiences. It also explores the changing role of students in discovering, questioning, and seeking knowledge to that of ‘consumers of pre-packed education.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, N. (2013). E-learning–the McDonaldization of education. European Journal of Higher Education, 3(4), 342-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The McDonaldization of Education is not only limited to physical classroom settings. It is predicted by George Ritzer&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ritzer, (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; that MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) will make future education even more McDonaldized. While it is possible to create a new original MOOC every semester, it is more likely a basic structure will be created and subsequently altered each time in order to make their creation more efficient. Over time as the interest and quality of MOOCs increases, the same pre recorded MOOCs may be used by many different universities, creating predictable content for MOOC students. Computer graded exams will be used more frequently than written essay exams to make it more efficient for the instructors. Yet since MOOCs limit the amount of contact between student and teacher, it will be difficult to engage the course on a deeper and more meaningful level. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Levi uses historical analysis, scientific data, and on-the-ground reporting to establish that America’s energy future need not be a [[zero-sum game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=America's Energy Future: Meet the Frackers|journal=The Economist|date=15 June 2013|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21579431-making-sense-americas-new-energy-resources-meet-frackers|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that the best path forward lies in a strategy that increases "opportunities for energy production of all kinds, while penalizing dangerous energy consumption that would worsen climate change and sustain U.S. dependence on oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levi|first=Michael|title=America's Energy Opportunity: How to Harness the New Sources of U.S. Power|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May–June 2013|volume=92|issue=3|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139111/michael-levi/americas-energy-opportunity?page=show|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5872">The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] '''Ministry of Agriculture and Food''' was established in 1929 and known prior to 1946 as the '''People's Commissariat for Agriculture''' - Narkomzem).

==History==
[[File:1930-33grainUSSRandUkrSRRgraincollection.jpg|thumb|Graph for the Soviet Union and Ukrainian SRR (share state grain procurement from 1930-1933 harvests. Figures derived from ''The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia'' Volume 5: The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture 1931-1933&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Industrialisation-Soviet-Russia-Volume/dp/0230238556 |title=The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia Volume 5: The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture 1931-1933 (9780230238558): R. W. Davies, Stephen G. Wheatcroft: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The commissariat united all republican commissariats of the Soviet Union. It was formally known as the '''People's Commissariat for Agriculture''' ({{lang-ru|Народный комиссариат земледелия}} - Narkomzem) was set up in [[Petrograd]] in October 1917. [[Vladimir Milyutin]] was appointed the first People's Commissar of Agriculture. He was a member of the [[Council of People's Commissars]].

Despite having signed the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC), the [[Soviet Union]] continued development and mass production of offensive [[biological weapon]]s. These activities were conducted by the main directorate — "[[Biopreparat]]" — along with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and several other Soviet ministries and agencies (Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Health, [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], the [[KGB]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Alibek]] and K Handelman (1999), ''Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World Trade From the Inside by the Man Who Ran It'', New York, NY: [[Random House]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the Ministry of Agriculture successfully developed variants of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and [[rinderpest]] against [[cow]]s, [[African swine fever]] for [[pig]]s, and [[psittacosis]] to kill [[chicken]]. These agents were prepared to be sprayed down from tanks attached to aeroplanes over hundreds of miles. The secret program was code-named "Ecology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alibek|first1=Ken|title=Biohazard|date=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781407010724|page=37-38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HACFzeD1ad0C|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry was abolished in November 1985 with the creation of the [[State Agro-Industrial Committee]], which took over the functions of the Ministry for Agriculture, the [[Ministry for Fruit and Vegetable Production]], the [[Ministry for the Meat and Dairy Industry]], the [[Ministry of the Food Industry]] and the [[Ministry for Rural Construction]].&lt;ref name="dyker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyker|first1=David A.|title=The Soviet Union Under Gorbachev (Routledge Revivals): Prospects for Reform|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135018917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UjdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offices==
It took over the Narkomzem offices located at Orlikov Pereulok, 1, [[Moscow]], designed by [[Aleksey Shchusev]] in 1928. This building is currently occupied by the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Russia)|Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation]].

[[File:Woking - Peace Memorial Garden (geograph 5274107).jpg|thumb|The reflecting pool and memorial stone]]
The '''Muslim Burial Ground''', in the town of [[Woking]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Surrey]], was the original resting place of two dozen [[Muslim]] soldiers who died during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. It is now a peace garden dedicated to all the Muslim soldiers of the [[British Indian Army]] who died during both wars. The site measures about {{convert|120|ft|m}} by {{convert|100|ft|m}} and is located in the southeast corner of [[Horsell Common]] about {{convert|100|m|ft}} off Monument Road. It is a Grade II [[listed building]].&lt;ref name=helbl&gt;{{cite web |title=Muslim Burial Ground - Woking |url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1236560 |publisher=[[Historic England]] |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2018 |archivedate=20 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220132847/https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1236560 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpgo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-34792865 |title=Muslim Burial Ground Peace Garden in Woking opened |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=12 November 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2018 |archivedate=20 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220132828/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-34792865 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of men from the Indian subcontinent fought on the Western Front during [[World War I]]. Some of those who were injured were moved to hospitals on the English south coast including one at [[Brighton Pavilion]]. Of those, nineteen Muslims died and were buried here. The burial ground was created, at least in part, to counteract German propaganda that Muslim Indian soldiers were not being buried according to their religious rites. The site was on land compulsorily purchased from the [[Earl of Onslow]] and chosen for its proximity to the [[Shah Jahan Mosque, Woking|Shah Jahan Mosque]], the first purpose-built mosque in the [[United Kingdom]]. A further five men who died during [[World War II]] were also buried here.&lt;ref name=helbl/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpgo/&gt;&lt;ref name=hcpspg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.horsellcommon.org.uk/sites/the-peace-garden/ |title=The Peace Garden |publisher=Horsell Common Preservation Society |accessdate=20 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220141504/http://www.horsellcommon.org.uk/sites/the-peace-garden/ |archivedate=20 February 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s the site was becoming subject to vandalism so in 1968 the bodies were transferred to the Military Cemetery at [[Brookwood Cemetery|Brookwood]]. However this also meant that the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] ceased further maintenance of the site, which became overgrown and further vandalised. Ownership reverted to the Horsell Common Preservation Society, the owners of the surrounding common in succession to the Earl of Onslow.&lt;ref name=helbl/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpgo/&gt;&lt;ref name=hcpspg/&gt; 

In the 1990s work was undertaken to clear the vegetation and stabilised the walls, as a result of financial support from a local resident of [[Woking]], the musician [[Paul Weller]]. In 2011, Woking Borough Council, working in conjunction with the Horsell Common Preservation Society, received a grant from [[English Heritage]], which enabled the restoration of the walls and chatri. In November 2015, the empty interior of the burial ground was landscaped to create a Peace Memorial Garden, dedicated to all the Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in World War I and II.&lt;ref name=helbl/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpgo/&gt;&lt;ref name=hcpspg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martinson |first=Jane |title=Muslim cemetery finds a saviour Punk rocker's gift gets restoration out of a jam |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden brings together the cultural expression of the traditional Islamic Garden with the natural elements of the Common. The original walls and [[chhatri]] of the burial ground were retained and now surround a reflecting pond fed by a rill and small waterfall from an upper pool. By this is a memorial stone engraved with the names of the original burials, which acts as the garden’s focus. [[Himalayan Birch]] trees planted around the pool also symbolise the servicemen who died.&lt;ref name=hcpspg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrafirmaconsultancy.com/landscape-architect-blog/muslim-burial-ground-peace-garden-opening-ceremony-by-lionel/ |title=Muslim Burial Ground Peace Garden opening ceremony |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2018 |archivedate=20 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220132903/http://www.terrafirmaconsultancy.com/landscape-architect-blog/muslim-burial-ground-peace-garden-opening-ceremony-by-lionel/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J5oexbHZ2k |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313104328/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J5oexbHZ2k |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 March 2016 |title=BBC One Documentary on the Muslim Burial Ground Peace Memorial |publisher=BBC |date=3 January 2016 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7793">'''National champion''' is a governmental policy in which large organizations are expected not only to seek profit but also to "advance the interests of the nation"; the government sets policies which favor these organizations. The policy is practiced by many governments, in some sectors more than others (such as [[National security|defense]]), but by giving an unfair advantage against [[market competition]], the policy promotes [[economic nationalism]] domestically and [[globalisation|global pre-eminence]] abroad contrary to the [[free market]].  The policy also deters or prevents [[venture capital]]ism.

As the policy is the collective form of inequality of opportunity, it is irreconcilable with the paradigm [[liberal economy]] advocated by 18th century economist [[Adam Smith]].  It was a key plank of the [[Dirigisme|Dirigiste]] policy of 1945-1975 France.

==Definition==
{{See also|Dirigisme}}
Under a '''National champion''' policy, governments expect one domestic corporation or an [[oligopoly]] of such corporations, typically in strategic sectors (whether private or [[state capitalism|state-sponsored]]) to seek profit and to "advance the interests of the nation". The policy is practised or acquiesced to by every country in certain sectors (typically national defence and security and the printing of [[banknote]]s and often in the philanthropic, performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies and through those National Institutes which produce marketable innovations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/features/2013/06/the-myth-of-the-meddling-state-nothing-ventured/ |title=The Myth of the "Meddling" State |author=Mariana Mazzucato |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=Public Finance International |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By allowing corporations a real or perceived [[monopoly]] due to the [[amalgamation (business)|amalgamation]] of enterprises and the active or supportive suppression of domestic and foreign-based [[market competition]], the policy over time operates as a form of [[economic nationalism]] as it is contrary to the [[free market]] and enhanced innovation.  Academics often cite post-[[World War II]] [[Charles de Gaulle|Gaullist]] ''[[dirigisme]]'' in [[France]] as the pinnacle of the national champion policy. Other examples include the creation of the [[British Steel Corporation]] by the [[United Kingdom]] which acquired the country's largest 14 domestic steel companies in 1967.

The risk involved with such policies is exemplified by the unsuccessful challenges to IBM’s period of dominance of the [[innovation economics|innovative]] computer market by UK’s [[International Computers Limited|ICL]], France’s [[Groupe Bull|Bull]], and Italy’s [[Olivetti]] during the 1970s. Successful and rewarding challenges however are shown to be possible in recent years, as exemplified by European aircraft champion [[Airbus]], and Chinese train champion [[CRRC]].

As the policy is a form of inequality of opportunity it is irreconcilable with the paradigm [[liberal economy]] advocated by 18th century economist [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Aaron, ''What's Right?'' (Dural, Australia: Rosenberg Publishing, 2003), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Renewal==
{{Putin sidebar}}

The policy is evident variously in the 21st century: Russia is its maximal exponent among the world's [[G-20 major economies|G-20]]. Other examples are the merger of [[E.ON]] with Ruhrgas backed by the German government in 2000 or the merger of [[Gaz de France|GDF]] with [[Suez (company)|Suez]] backed by the French government in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=background note in OECD roundtable on "competition policy, industrial policy and national champions"|year=2009|publisher=OECD|location=Paris|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/50/44548025.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] has made "national champions" a central axis of his policy. 
The concept was introduced by Putin in his 1997 dissertation "Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Resource Bases". Putin, in turn, may have gotten the idea from a textbook by [[University of Pittsburgh]] analysts [[William King (analyst)|William King]] and David Cleland.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt; Putin later expanded on the subject in an article published in 1999 in the Journal of the St. Petersburg Mining Institute.&lt;ref name="champion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=3827|title=The Stereotypical Champion|last=Crotty|first=Ivor|date=2009-10-06|publisher=Russia Profile|accessdate=2009-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711101553/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=3827|archivedate=2009-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles de Gaulle]] had also advocated similar ideas when he was the president of [[France]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Marshall I.|title=Petrostate: Putin, Power and the New Russia|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|chapter=Chapter 5|isbn=978-0-19-534073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical integration==
In his dissertation, Putin wrote: "The process of restructuring the national economy must have the goal of creating the most effective and competitive companies on both the domestic and world markets."

Putin's 1999 article proposes that the state should closely regulate and develop the natural resources sector through creating companies with close links to the power vertical, making the firms big enough to compete with multinationals. These companies would become “national champions”, representing the state’s interest in international commerce.&lt;ref name="champion"/&gt; &lt;!-- 'power vertical'? --&gt;

Most national champions are likely to be 50% or more owned by the Russian government, but there is no reason why predominantly private companies could not also serve as national champions, given the right guidance and pressure.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt;

==Advancing national interests==
Instead of allowing the country's oligarch-controlled corporations to focus exclusively on making profit, Putin proposed that they should be used instead to advance the country's national interests, suggesting that Russia should reclaim some of the assets that were privatized during Yeltsin, and integrate them vertically into industrial conglomerates so they could compete better with Western multinational corporations.

{{quote|Regardless of who is the legal owner of the country's natural resources and in particular the mineral resources, the state has the right to regulate the process of their development and use. The state should act in the interests of society as a whole and of individual property owners, when their interests come into conflict with each other and when they need the help of state organs of power to reach compromises when their interests conflict.|Vladimir Putin&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt;}}

One example of the concept is that energy corporations such as [[Gazprom]] should keep the prices inside Russia low, as a form of subsidy for the public, and only strive for maximal profit in foreign countries.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt;

'''Nuamthong Praiwan''' ({{lang-th|นวมทอง ไพรวัลย์}}; {{RTGS|Nuamthong Phraiwan}}) (1946–1 November 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070121184910/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php Taxi driver 'sacrificed himself for democracy']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/world/asia/01iht-asia.3356016.html Briefly: Government troops hit rebel positions from air - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Thai people|Thai]] taxi driver who drove his taxi into a [[army tank|tank]] in protest after the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military coup of 2006]]. He was later found hanging from a [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road|pedestrian footbridge]]. Officials found a suicide note and later ruled his death a suicide. His sacrifices were praised by several democracy activists.

==Driving taxi into tank==
At 6 am, Saturday 30 September 2006, Nuamthong drove his taxi, spray painted with the words "[CDR is] destroying the country," and "Sacrificing life", into an M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Bangkok's Royal Plaza. Nuamthong was severely injured and taken to a police station nearby. "I did it intentionally to protest the junta that has destroyed our country, and I painted all the words myself," noted Nuamthong to reporters from his bed at Vachira Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015059 A man collides his taxi with tank], 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matichon, [http://www.norsorpor.com/go2.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matichon.co.th%2Fbreaking-news%2Fbreaking-news.php%3Fnid%3DMjAwNjA5MzAtMTYwNTA4 Matichon Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuamthong was charged with damaging state property.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015091.php Protesting driver rams taxi into Army tank], 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities downplayed the incident, saying that Nuamthong was drunk and no messages were sprayed on the taxi. However, several newspapers reported on the legibility of the words painted on the car.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/30/headlines/headlines_30015065.php A taxi slammed into a tank], 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akkara Thiproj]], deputy spokesperson for the [[Council for Democratic Reform|military junta]], expressed scepticism about Nuamthong's intentions in crashing into the tank, and claimed that "Nobodies’ ideals are so great that they would sacrifice their lives for them."&lt;ref name="sensitivity"&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017812.php Suicide is treated with sensitivity by officials], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Prachatai, [http://www.prachatai.com/05web/th/home/page2.php?mod=mod_ptcms&amp;ContentID=5677&amp;SystemModuleKey=HilightNews&amp;System_Session_Language=Thai เครือข่าย 19 กันยาฯ ออกแถลงการณ์ไว้อาลัย ‘นวมทอง ไพรวัลย์’], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nuamthong's taxi.jpg|thumb|200px|Driving taxi into tank]]
He was released from the hospital on 12 October, and attended the 33rd anniversary of the [[History of Thailand (1932-1973)#The 1973 democracy movement|14 October 1973 democratic uprising]].

==Death==
Nuamgthong's body was found hanging, with a hood covering his face, from a footbridge on [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road|Vibhavadi Rangsit road]] near the headquarters of [[Thai Rath]] newspaper in [[Bangkok]] on 1 November 2006. Police ruled the death a suicide after forensic tests were stated to have shown no traces of a physical assault or struggle. Although Nuamthong's body was found with a suicide note, family members testified that he had given no hint of being depressed or about to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bact.blogspot.com/2006/11/nuamthong-praiwal.html bact' is a name: Nuamthong Praiwal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Prachatai, [http://www.prachatai.com/05web/th/home/page2.php?mod=mod_ptcms&amp;ContentID=5657&amp;SystemModuleKey=HilightNews&amp;System_Session_Language=Thai จดหมายจากใจแท็กซี่พลีชีพ “ชาติหน้าเกิดมาคงไม่พบเจอการปฏิวัติอีก], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nuamthong wore a black T-shirt with a drawing of the [[Democracy Monument (Bangkok)|Democracy Monument]] and a poem about the power of the masses. Newspaper clippings about his crash into the army tank were also found on his body. His wife, Boonchu, said he had given no farewells or done anything that would suggest he was planning to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;The Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.net/News/02Nov2006_news03.php Taxi driver hangs self in protest at coup d'etat], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30017724 Surayud believes there will be no copycat of suicide taxi driver], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife noted, "I couldn't be more sad losing the love of my life and the leader of my family. I didn't think he would be this brave, but I'm very proud of him for sacrificing for the country."&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php Taxi driver 'sacrificed himself for democracy'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121184910/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php |date=2007-01-21 }}, 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
Funeral rites were held at [[Wat]] Bua Kwan in [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]]'s Muang district. A score of senior police showed up at his funeral at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi to "keep the peace" while pro-democracy groups sent representatives and flower wreaths to honour his death.

His wife later attempted to transport his coffin to the 14 October 1973 Memorial on Ratchadamnoen road for bathing rituals. Police prevented her van from arriving at the Memorial.

About 200 people attended the second night of Nuamthong's funeral at Wat Bua Kwan. Among them were military and police officers, politicians from the Thai Rak Thai Party and [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commissioner]] Jaran Dithapichai. [[Sant Hathirat]] read a statement declaring Nuamthong a "democracy martyr."&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/03/national/national_30017926.php iTV rapped for report on driver's final words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115134158/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/03/national/national_30017926.php |date=2006-11-15 }}, 3 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also praised by activist and former senator Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, who noted, "Uncle Nuamthong has made the biggest sacrifice for democracy. I fought for democracy all my life but don't have the courage to do as much as he did."

Junta deputy spokesperson [[Akara Tipparoj]] apologised for his earlier claim that nobody would hurt themselves for political ideals and claimed he planned to attend the funeral.

The Young People for Democracy Movement (YPD) condemned Akara's views as ignorant and noted that "His remark is an insult, as Thailand has a long history of people dying to defend democracy from dictatorship."

Prime Minister General [[Surayud Chulanont]] said he was saddened by the news but doubted there would be copycat suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="sensitivity" /&gt;

After his death, an interview Nuamthong had earlier given was partially aired by [[iTV (Thailand)|iTV]]. The broadcast came to an abrupt end after the Director of Army-owned [[Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5|Channel 5]] called to give a warning.&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt; Additional troops were dispatched [[Censorship in Thailand|to keep order at the station]].

== Last letter ==

Dear my respected friends and people. A reason of my second suicide by destroying myself is avoiding mischief like the first time, in order to resist the speech of Mr. Vice Spokesman of the CDR ([[Council for National Security|Council for Democratic Reform]]) [...], "No one devotes their death for their ideologies". ...| Goodbye and meet me in next life. &lt;br&gt; Nuamthong Praiwan &lt;br&gt; October 29, 2006}}

The Empire entered into subsequent loans, partly to finance railway construction and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditure of the Imperial court.&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6667a18a-b888-11dc-893b-0000779fd2ac.html|title=An Ottoman warning for indebted America|author=[[Niall Ferguson]]|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the French and British banks which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gold for the Sultan: Western Bankers and Ottoman Finance, 1856–1881", by Christopher Clay, London, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the OPDA for collecting various tax and customs revenues within the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;

A '''Parlimentaire''' (also '''Parlementaire''') is defined by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] as "an agent employed by a commander of belligerent forces in the field to go in person within the enemy lines for the purpose of communicating or negotiating openly and directly with the enemy commander".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/p/04035.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Even in war the [[belligerent]]s sometimes need to communicate, or [[negotiate]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] [[herald]]s were used to deliver [[declarations of war]], and [[ultimatum|ultimata]] as a form of one-sided communication. But for two-sided communication agents were needed that could also negotiate. These usually operated under a [[flag of truce]] and enjoyed temporary inviolability according to the  customs and [[laws of war]]. Breaches of the customary protection of parlimentaires were deemed [[perfidy]].

==International Law==
Later, these customs and protections were codified in [[international law]].  Articles 32-34 of the [[Hague Conventions (1907)]] state:

:'''Article 32
:''An individual is considered a parlementaire who is authorized by one of the belligerents to enter into communication with the other, and who carries a white flag. He has a right to inviolability, as well as the [[trumpeter]], [[bugler]], or [[drummer]], the [[flag-bearer]], and the [[interpreter]] who may accompany him.

:'''Article 33
:''The Chief to whom a flag of truce is sent is not obliged to receive it in all circumstances.
:''He can take all steps necessary to prevent the envoy taking advantage of his mission to obtain information.
:''In case of abuse, he has the right to detain the envoy temporarily.

:'''Article 34
:''The envoy loses his rights of inviolability if it is proved beyond doubt that he has taken advantage of his privileged position to provoke or commit an act of treachery.

Contraventions of these articles constitute [[war crimes]] that may be prosecuted before the [[International Criminal Court]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14443">A '''Permanent secretary''', is the most senior [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|civil servant]] of a [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], charged with running the department on a day-to-day basis.

Permanent secretaries (known by other names in some departments; see below) are the non-political civil service heads (and "accounting officers") or chief executives of government departments, who generally hold their position for a number of years (thus "permanent") at a ministry as distinct from the changing political [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|secretaries of state]] to whom they report and provide advice.
== History ==
When [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] took office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1830, [[Sir John Barrow]] was especially requested to continue serving as Secretary in his department (the [[Admiralty]]), starting the principle that senior civil servants stay in office on change of government and serve in a non-partisan manner. It was during Barrow's occupancy of the post that it was renamed permanent secretary.
== Role ==
Permanent secretaries are the accounting officers for departments, meaning that they are answerable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] for ensuring that the department spends money granted by parliament appropriately. Permanent secretaries are thus frequently called for questioning by the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] and [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committees]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The permanent secretary usually chairs a department's management board which consists of executive members (other civil servants in the department) and non-executive directors. In the 1960s the permanent secretary to [[Tony Benn]] when he was [[Secretary of State for Industry]] was Peter Carey. After Benn spent government money on worker cooperatives, notably a motorbike company (Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative), Carey went before the Public Accounts Committee and expressed the opinion that his minister's expenditure had been ''[[ultra vires]]''.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Benn was soon moved to the Department of Energy, while Peter Carey received a knighthood in the following [[honours list]].

Some larger departments also have a second permanent secretary who acts as deputy. In the early 1970s, in a major reorganisation of Whitehall, many smaller ministries were amalgamated into larger departments.  Following this reorganisation, virtually all departments had second permanent secretaries for a time, though this is no longer as common.

The most senior civil servant is the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]], currently Sir [[Mark Sedwill]]; he is also the [[Head of The Home Civil Service|Head of the Home Civil Service]]. The holder of this office is distinct from other officials of permanent secretary rank within the Cabinet Office. By convention, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] is [[Minister for the Civil Service]] and as such makes regulations regarding the service and has authority over it. These duties are delegated to the [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]].

== Honours ==
Permanent secretaries are usually created a Knight or Dame Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] after five or more years of service in the grade or on retirement if not already holding the title (although the Permanent Secretary of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] will be created a Knight or Dame Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] instead). The most senior permanent secretaries, such as the [[Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary|Secretary of the Cabinet]], may be created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and even be given a [[life peer]]age after retirement. For salary comparison purposes, the permanent secretary is deemed broadly equivalent to a [[General officer|general]] and to a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]].

== Outside the UK ==
In some countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the popular term for the equivalent position is now “principal secretary”.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In Australia, the position is called the "[[departmental secretary]]", “secretary of the department”, or “director-general of the department” in some states and territories.

In Canada, the position is a "[[Deputy minister (Canada)|deputy minister]]", as the political head of a department/ministry is generally called a [[Minister (government)|minister]].

In India, the equivalent position is called [[Secretary to Government of India|secretary to the Government of India]] and is the highest ranking permanent civil servant in a department.

In Germany, the equivalent office is called ''[[Secretary of state#Germany|staatssekretär]]'' (state secretary).

In Hong Kong, heads of policy bureaux, secretaries, were filled by civil servants until their titles were changed to permanent secretaries in 2002, when political appointees filled the positions of secretaries under the second [[Tung Chee Hwa]] government. Since August 2005, the Office of the Chief Executive also has a permanent secretary. His ranking is, however, lower than most other permanent secretaries according to the pay scale.

In the Republic of Ireland, the position of "secretary-general" of a department is almost identical to that of a permanent secretary in the British civil service, with the exception that since the introduction in the mid-1990s of the ''Strategic Management Initiative'', the post is no longer permanent, but carries a seven-year time limit. This coincided with the introduction of the change of title from the previous title of “secretary”. Irish government departments may also have a “second secretary”, which is equivalent to the Second Permanent Secretary grade in the British civil service. See also [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland]].

In Italy the highest civil service official in a ministry or department is either a ''segretario generale'' (secretary-general) or a ''direttore generale'' (director-general), while the position of ''sottosegretario di stato'' (under-secretary of state) is a political one and ranks below the ''ministro segretario di stato'' (minister-secretary of state, the head of a ministry or department) or the ''vice ministro'' (deputy-minister), both political posts as well.

The Japanese equivalence are the administrative vice-ministers.

In New Zealand, the civil service head of a ministry is ordinarily entitled “chief executive”, though there are still some positions which still carry the title of secretary (Secretary of Education, Secretary of Justice, Secretary of Transport). In some cases (such as the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service]], Ministry for Primary Industries, Department of Conservation, Ministry of Health) the title is “director-general”. Organisations with enforcement powers, such as the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] and the [[New Zealand Police]], are headed by [[commissioner]]s. The New Zealand Customs Service is headed by the Comptroller of Customs. Civil service heads are officially employed by the [[State Services Commission]], further separating them from the politicians who hold ministerial positions.

In Singapore, permanent secretaries have to retire after a 10-year term even if they are younger than the official retirement age of 62, starting in 2000 when the Public Service Leadership scheme was introduced. This is to provide opportunities for younger officers from the Administrative Service — the elite arm of the Civil Service — to rise up the ranks.

In Sri Lanka, the post of permanent secretary is the civil service head of the ministry. Normally referred to as secretary, non civil service, political appointees are regularly appointed.

It is frequently used to increase the [[dietary fiber]] content of food, to replace sugar, and to reduce calories and fat content. It is a multi-purpose food ingredient synthesized from dextrose (glucose), plus about 10 percent [[sorbitol]] and 1 percent [[citric acid]]. Its [[E number]] is '''E1200'''. The FDA approved it in 1981.

It is 0.1 times as sweet as sugar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sugar-and-sweetener-guide.com/polydextrose.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Commercial manufacture of edible polydextrose originated with a process developed by [[Hans H. Rennhard]] of Pfizer, Inc. Rennhard began investigating the potential of polysaccharides as low-calorie replacements for sugar, fat, flour, and starch. In 1965, he created polydextrose, a polymer of dextrose, produced from the naturally occurring components: glucose, sorbitol, and citric acid.

== Commercial uses ==
Polydextrose is commonly used as a replacement for [[sugar]], [[starch]], and [[fat]] in commercial beverages, [[cake]]s, [[candy|candies]], [[dessert]] mixes, breakfast cereals, [[gelatin]]s, frozen desserts, [[pudding]]s, and [[salad dressing]]s. Polydextrose is frequently used as an ingredient in [[low-carb]], sugar-free, and [[diabetic]] cooking recipes. It is also used as a [[humectant]], [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabiliser]], and [[thickening agent]].

Polydextrose is a form of soluble fiber and has shown healthful [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] benefits when tested in animals. It contains only 1 kcal per gram and, therefore, is able to help reduce calories.

However, polydextrose is not universally well tolerated. Doses as low as 10g cause significantly more intestinal gas and flatulence than even [[psyllium]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomlin J1, Read NW.

[[Image:Quickscript.png|right|thumb|The front page of the Quikscript manual. The Quikscript text reads, "This is the way to do it."]]
'''Quikscript''' (also known as the '''Read Alphabet''' and '''Second Shaw''') is an [[alphabet]] (and [[phonemic orthography]]) specifically designed for the [[English language]]. Quikscript replaces traditional English orthography, which uses the [[Latin alphabet]], with completely new letters. It is phonemically regular, compact, and designed to be comfortably and quickly written. There are also Quikscript alphabets adapted for other languages, using the same letters for sounds which do not exist in English.

==Origins and history==
{{See also|Shavian alphabet}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], the writer, critic and playwright, was a highly vocal critic of English spelling because it lacked a coherent system for representing the phonemes of English accurately. As a result, for years he wrote his literary works using [[Pitman shorthand]].  However, he found its limitations frustrating as well and realized that it was not a suitable replacement for the Latin alphabet, being difficult to use to produce printed material and impossible to type.  A shorthand is, by definition, more specialized than an alphabet, which represents the standard written form of a language.  Shaw desired and advocated a phonetic reworking of written English, and this called for a new alphabet.

To that end, Shaw placed in his will provisions instructing his executor to organize a world-wide competition to design an improved English alphabet.  A British designer, [[Ronald Kingsley Read]], who had corresponded extensively with Shaw for several years regarding just such an alphabet, was selected along with three other finalists as the winners of the competition. Read was chosen to design the final form of the alphabet.  The "Shaw Alphabet" or "[[Shavian]]", as it is now generally known, was the result.

To provide field testing of the new alphabet, Read organized a lengthy public testing phase of Shavian by some 500 users from around the world who spoke different dialects of English. Once he had analyzed the results of those tests, Read decided to revise Shavian to incorporate a number of changes to improve the alphabet and make it both easier and faster to write.  He called the revised alphabet "Quikscript".  In 1966 he published the Quikscript manual which set out the alphabet's rationale, and briefly discussed different possible methods of alphabet reform.  The heart of the manual provided comprehensive instructions regarding the use of the alphabet along with reading samples.

==Description==
[[Image:Quickscript alphabet revised names.png|thumb|right|240px|Alphabet chart with names for all letters and ligatures.]]
Each Quikscript letter represents one, and only one, English phoneme. There are 25 consonants and 15 vowels, totaling in all 40 letters. The letters are also designed to be written easily and each of them only requires a single (usually curved) stroke of pen.

* Just as in the Roman alphabet, there are short letters, a, c, e, m, and n, written between the base writing line and the "upper parallel" (as Read calls it), tall letters, b, d, f, k, and t, which ascend above the top of the short letters, and deep letters, g, j, p and y, which descend below the base writing line. Quikscript, however, makes better use of these possibilities by using 11 tall, 11 deep, and 18 short letters. All vowels are short letters, just as they are in the Roman alphabet.
* The most common phonemes have the simplest letter shapes.
* Similar sounding phonemes have similar letter shapes. Examples:
** Long vowels and glides are written with a larger bend or loop, while short vowels have a simpler shape.
** Every voiced consonant is written with a deep letter similar in shape to the corresponding voiceless consonant which in turn is written with a tall letter.
* While the Roman alphabet has two distinct forms in common use, which are designated as lower and upper case, this concept does not exist in the Quikscript alphabet.  There is only one form for the majority of the letters. Names and proper nouns are preceded with a mid-line dot (called a name-dot) which is sufficient to distinguish them from ordinary words.
* Beginners learn Junior Quikscript first.  Each word is spelled "as it is spoken".  Each letter is written separately from the next so that it is equivalent to what is termed "printing" in the Roman alphabet.  Some people may prefer Junior Quikscript for printed texts as readers are used to the Roman alphabet being printed in that manner.
* Senior Quikscript introduces a number of advanced techniques which save time in writing. The most obvious difference between the two is that Senior encourages the connection of one letter to the next as long as the shapes of the letters are not altered.  The design of the alphabet fosters these natural connections, as each Quikscript letter either begins or ends on the base line or the upper parallel.  This structure permits letters to connect easily yet maintains the shapes of the individual letters because there are no connecting strokes between letters as there are in cursive Roman alphabet writing. It is common that Senior writing will have several letters in a row which are connected to each other, but when such a connection is not possible, the letters are simply left unconnected.  Read added a very small number of alternative letter forms, which permit even more letters to connect easily.  It is the writer's choice whether to use them or not.
* Senior Quikscript also introduces the concept of half-letters.  Read recognized that the top half of several tall letters and the bottom half of several deep letters clearly distinguish those letters.  Therefore, the portion of the vertical shafts of those letters which lie between the base line and upper parallel can be discarded without legibility being affected.  Using half-letters increases the number of letters which can connect with each other.  This produces several benefits:  1) it speeds up handwriting because fewer pen-lifts are required;  2) the alphabet takes on a more cursive and fluid appearance, which is artistically attractive; and 3) most importantly, it increases the variability of the word-shapes.  Fluent readers do not sound out words letter by letter.  They recognize a familiar word-shape without conscious thought of the individual letters.  Anything that increases the distinctiveness of the word-shapes should promote the legibility of the script and the average reading speed.  The use of Quikscript's half-letters creates more varied and distinctive word-shapes than Junior Quikscript, which may make reading fluency in Quikscript easier to achieve and ultimately lead to faster reading speeds.  If this proves to be true in actual usage, then it should encourage the use of Senior Quikscript in printed texts rather than Junior Quikscript.
* Senior Quikscript also introduces a number of abbreviations for the most common English words, which writers may choose to use. These further reduce the space requirement for printed material and hence the costs.

==Modern day use==
Quikscript computer fonts have been developed so that the alphabet can be used with computers and the Internet. There is also a computer program which will transliterate Latin alphabet text into Quikscript text.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==References in literature==
Book two of the popular ''Cole's Funny Picture Books'', published in [[Australia]] by [[Edward William Cole|E. W. Cole]] at the turn of the 20th century, was revised in 1979 to include an article introducing Quikscript under the name Second Shaw.

'''Raphael Wong Ho-ming''' ({{zh-t|黃浩銘}}; 24 October 1988) is a [[Hong Kong]] social activist and politician. He is currently vice-chairman of the [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) and was one of the leaders in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].

==Family and education==
Wong was born in Hong Kong in 1988. His father, Wong Yu-choi is a [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] rural politician, belonging to the [[Civil Force]] and holding the position of member of the Sha Tin Rural Committee and resident representative of the Ha Wo Che village in [[Sha Tin]].

Raphael was educated at the [[Shatin Pui Ying College]] and graduated from the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] with a bachelor's degree in social science and the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] with a master's degree in social policy.

==Politics and protests==
Wong first got interested in politics in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|2008 Legislative Council election]], when [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) chairman [[Wong Yuk-man]] chanted "[[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong|DAB]] the most shameless" in an election forum. He started listening to Wong's internet radio and joined the LSD despite his father's opposition. He participated in the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2009|1 July demonstration]] in 2009 for the first time.&lt;ref name="squid"&gt;{{cite news|title=齊請梁振英食豉椒炒魷|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=18 June 2013|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20130618/18302292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 July 1 demonstration, he joined the sit-in at the [[Former Central Government Offices|Central Government Offices]] after the demonstration. On 1 July 2011, he was one of the protesters blocked the [[Connaught Road Central]].&lt;ref name="squid"/&gt;

On 1 March 2011, Wong and another protestor Wong Chun-kit protested against [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]] when Tsang was on his way to the [[Hong Kong Museum of History]] in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. Wong held a box of rice with fish in corn sauce and ran towards Tsang. They were charged of hitting Tsang but later was found innocent by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='No evidence of attack on Tsang'|date=20 July 2011|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/973945/no-evidence-attack-tsang|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2012 during [[PRC president|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]]'s visit in Hong Kong, five LSD members including Wong protested at the [[North Lantau Highway]] where Hu's car passed by. They climbed over a metal fence, scrambling onto a slope to hold up two banners reading: "Vindication of the [[Tiananmen Square crackdown|June 4th crackdown]]"; and "Give me back [[Li Wangyang|[Li] Wangyang]]". They were later charged and fined for improper use of an expressway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LSD members fined for highway protest|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1296167/lsd-members-fined-highway-protest|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2014, Wong was charged along with [[Scholarism]] convenor [[Joshua Wong Chi-fung|Joshua Wong]], former secretary general of [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] [[Nathan Law]] and [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] legislator [[Albert Chan]] for obstructing police officers when they burnt replicas of Beijing's white paper interpreting Hong Kong's [[one country, two systems]] principle during a protest outside the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office]]. They were later found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joshua Wong and activists not guilty of obstructing police officers in 'white paper' burning|date=7 June 2016|first=Kris|last=Cheng|work=Hong Kong Free Press|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/07/joshua-wong-activists-proven-not-guilty-obstructing-police-officers-burning-white-paper/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a veteran activist, Wong was one of the leaders during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], which often called as "Umbrella Revolution". He was deeply involved in the movement and was later arrested with Joshua Wong, the main leader of the protests and Chinese University's Student Union member Jason Szeto Tze-long on 25 November during the police clearance of the Mong Kok sit-in site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Breaking: Student Leaders Joshua Wong, Lester Shum Arrested in Mong Kok Clearing|first=Larry|last=Ong|newspaper=Epoch Times|date=25 November 2014|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1104645-hong-kong-breaking-joshua-wong-and-lester-shum-arrested-in-mong-kok-clearing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Wong became the vice-chairman of the LSD.

In 2011 and 2015, Wong ran in the District Council elections in his neighbourhood [[Lek Yuen (constituency)|Lek Yuen]] but was both defeated. In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], he will run in the [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]] with incumbent legislator Albert Chan of the People Power standing in the second place of his ticket.

A '''scare-line''', '''scare-head''', or '''scare headline''' is a word or phrase that is presented (often as a [[quotation]] and as a headline or other emphasized text, such as a [[pull quote]]) to scare the reader,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Alice Yeager |title=Reproductions of Banality: Fascism, Literature, and French Intellectual Life |volume=36 |series=Theory and History of Literature |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=1986 |ISBN=9781452901497 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fAC2Thie090C&amp;hl=en&amp;v=snippet&amp;q=scare%20quotes&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=scare%20quotes&amp;f=false |access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a [[smear campaign]] against an opposing political candidate,&lt;ref name="McWilliams"&gt;{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jcCrQC8rBPgC&amp;pg=PA298 |page=298 |title=Southern California: An Island on the Land |isbn=9780879050078 |last=McWilliams |first=Carey |year=1946 |access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to cause an estrangement or cause something to seem unfamiliar in a supernatural way.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harries |first=Martin |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QWGzfQ5caI4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=smear&amp;pg=PA3#v=snippet&amp;q=scare%20quotes&amp;f=false |title=Scare Quotes from Shakespeare: Marx, Keynes, and the Language of Reenchantment |publisher=Stanford University Press |date=2000 |ISBN=9780804736213 |page=6 |access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''scare quote''' is sometimes also used to refer to scare-lines that are direct quotations,&lt;ref name="Harries" /&gt; but more often refers today to [[Scare quotes|use of dismissive quotation marks]] around a term to imply doubt, irony, or scorn. 

== Origin of the terms ==
The terms ''scare-line'' and ''scare-head'' derive from ''[[Fear mongering|scare]]'' + ''[[headline]]''; the longer name ''scare headline'' has sometimes been used.&lt;ref name="Sinclair 1"&gt;{{cite book |pages=91, 214, 285 |last=Sinclair |first=Upton |author-link=Upton Sinclair |title=The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism |publisher=University of Illinois Press |date=1928 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pZXZRxCVAZwC&amp;q=scare-line#v=snippet&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' notes the use of the shorter expressions ''scare-line'' and ''scare-head'', the latter as early as 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Craigie |editor1-first=W. A. |editor2-last=Onions |editor2-first=C. T. |date=1933 |title=The Oxford English Dictionary: A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''scare quote'' in the same sense dates back to at least 1946.&lt;ref name="McWilliams" /&gt; The term ''scare line'' also refers to "a means of directing fish towards the main, holding part of a net by frightening the fish into movement",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=scare+line |title=scare line |work=[[FishBase]] |publisher=Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences|editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Pauly |editor2-first=Rainer |editor2-last=Froese |date=2017 |access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term is not well known outside of commercial fishing (and bird hunting, where a similar technique is used to flush birds into flight), so an influence on the journalism term is dubious despite a conceptual similarity. 

== In newspaper journalism ==
Scare-lining increases newspaper sales predictably, and this has been known for several generations.  [[Upton Sinclair]] wrote in ''The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism'' (1928): "I knew for instance, sitting at my desk, just how many extra papers I could sell with a scare-line on a police scandal."&lt;ref name="Sinclair 2"&gt;{{cite book |page=419 |last=Sinclair |first=Upton |title=The Brass Check |date=1928 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pZXZRxCVAZwC&amp;q=scare-line#v=snippet&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice has also been criticized as manipulative and of [[Yellow journalism|questionable journalistic integrity]] since the same era.&lt;ref name="Sinclair 1" /&gt;

== In modern women's magazines ==
[[Women's magazine]]s, especially from the early 1990s onward, have published an increasing number of "scare stories"&lt;ref name="Blyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blyth |first=Myrna |author-link=Myrna Blyth |title=Spin Sisters: How the Women of the Media Sell Unhappiness and Liberalism to the Women of America |publisher=Macmillan |date=2007 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2gO_48UAq2IC&amp;q=scare#v=snippet&amp;q=scare&amp;f=false |access-date=25 January 2017 |pages=116, 120, 122–127, 136–137, 140, 299}} The block quotations are from pp. 123–124, 125, and 127, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; about health, most often using alarming headlines and "[[News style#Billboard|billboard]]" text that are not quotations. For example, ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine in the year 1990 had no health cover stories, but in 2002 had at least one scare-line in almost every issue, e.g. "It's Common, It Can Kill: Why Aren't Doctors Telling Us about This Women-only Disease?" (from the April 2002 issue).&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|124}}  [[Myrna Blyth]], a [[Feminism|feminist]], [[Media criticism|media critic]], and former editor-in-chief of ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', characterizes the trend as the selling of unhappiness and fear about health. Her 2007 book ''Spin Sisters'' observes the following, based on one-year, three-year, and ten-year studies of articles in women's magazines:&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|123–127}}
{{quote|text=Two thirds of the articles reviewed in the [one-year] study never mentioned that the actual risks from any of these threats were extremely small, and even more important, that the alarmist views in many of the articles actually disagreed with mainstream science. ...{{paragraph break}}What women's magazines really specialize in are stories that make you afraid to cross the threshold of a hospital, trust your doctor, or take your medicine. In looking at ten years of cover lines ... one can see a dramatic acceleration of bad-doctor stories during the 1990s. ...{{paragraph break}}Women's magazines also package fear ... by "exposing" frightening and imminent threats to women, especially when it comes to health. Our survey of women's magazines found that when it comes to scare stories, the least substantiated ones were about health. In fact, over the three years' worth of stories we reviewed, 258 health stories about everything from food contamination to mercury poisoning to rare diseases earned space in America's magazines for women—many overly dependent on anecdotal evidence and devoid of any valid risk assessment. Often, a hint of conspiracy was added ("10 Urgent Health Risks Doctors Don't Tell You About") to ratchet up the fear factor....}}
She concludes that women acting as the effective gatekeepers of family health is why they have been increasingly targeted by this sort of writing and marketing,&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|125}} often based on "confusing, [[Pseudo-science|junk-science]] statistics"&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|122}} and the replacement of rigorous reporting with personal opinion and vague, exaggeratory implications with a lot of "wiggle room".&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|126}}  Such articles also appear to be the leading source of unreasonable [[Vaccine controversies|fears about vaccines]]&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|121–123}} (e.g., the [[MMR vaccine controversy|debunked but persistent idea]] that childhood vaccination causes [[autism]]).  Blyth concedes that her own former publication also ran such scare-lines, such as "Dangerous Medicine: When Cures Harm Instead of Heal", and "Foods that Can Kill".&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;{{rp|127}}

The '''United Homeless Organization''' (UHO) was a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] homelessness charity based in [[New York City]]. It was disbanded in 2010 after it was ruled to be operating fraudulently.

Founded in 1985 by Stephen Riley, who ran the organization from his apartment in [[the Bronx]],&lt;ref name="nypost_20081207" /&gt; UHO solicited money at sidewalk tables at various locations in [[Manhattan]].  Soliciters paid UHO $15 per shift (with 3 to 4 shifts per day) to rent a table and collection jug; any remaining funds raised they could keep for themselves.&lt;ref name="nypost_20081207"&gt;{{citation | last=Klein | first=Melissa | last2=Boniello | first2=Kathianne | title='Jug Band' Keeps Your Change | publisher=[[New York Post]] | date=2008-12-09 | url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12072008/news/regionalnews/jug_band_keeps_143071.htm | accessdate=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to UHO, more than three-quarters of its soliciters are homeless, and all have been homeless at one time.&lt;ref name="nyt_20010701"&gt;{{citation | last=Schneider | first=Daniel B. | title=F.Y.I. | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=2001-07-01 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/01/nyregion/fyi-027065.html | accessdate=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, New York State Attorney General [[Andrew Cuomo]] filed suit in [[Manhattan Supreme Court]] against the group, charging that the founders kept most of the change collected. The suit charged that Riley and director Myra Walker used the money to buy items for their personal use, and to pay bills unrelated to UHO.&lt;ref name="nyp_20091123"&gt;{{citation | title=Homeless beggar jars a sham: AG | publisher=[[New York Post]] | date=2009-11-24 | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/suit_put_cork_in_it_jugheads_GvF3qaHCib8Xh5AY86i68O?offset=16#comments#ixzz0Xmpl4OA1 | accessdate=2009-11-24 | first1=Melissa | last1=Klein | first2=Kevin | last2=Fasick | first3=Chuck | last3=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 2010, Judge Barbara R. Kapnick ruled that UHO be permanently shut down and further banned Riley and Walker from ever engaging in non-profit work again.&lt;ref name="UHO Shut Down"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/judge_rules_hucksters_permanently_ahPPxEVrVEHlimCcLjlQ4I|title=Judge rules to permanently shut down faux homeless charity, but hucksters still out in force|last=Bennett|first=Chuck|date=|work=New York Post|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''When Corporations Rule the World''''' is an [[anti-globalization]] book by [[David Korten]].  Korten examines the evolution of [[corporation]]s in the United States and argues that "corporate libertarians" have 'twisted' the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]'s  view of the role of private companies.

Korten critiques current methods of economic development led by the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions and asserts his desire to rebalance the power of [[multinational corporation]]s with concern for environmental sustainability and what he terms “people-centered development”.  He advocates a 50% tax on [[advertising]].

Korten criticises [[consumerism]], market [[deregulation]], [[free trade]], [[privatization]] and what he sees as the global consolidation of [[corporate power]].  Above all he rejects any focus on money as the purpose of economic life. His prescriptions include excluding corporations from political participation, increased state and global control of international corporations and finance, rendering financial [[speculation]] unprofitable and creating local economies that rely on local resources, rather than international trade.

==Responses==
In a review of the book in ''Left Business Observer'' #71 in January 1996, Doug Henwood observed that Korten "offers a vision of 'a market economy composed primarily, though not exclusively, of family enterprises, small-scale co-ops, worker-owned firms, and neighborhood and municipal corporations.'  Much of this is desirable. But it would be impossible to run a complex economy on this scale only; it's easy to imagine furniture being made this way, but not trains and computers. If Korten means to do away with trains and computers, he should tell us." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Globalization.html |title=Antiglobalization |publisher=Leftbusinessobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
