'''''A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy''''' is a book by [[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade]], also known as Gurudev Ranade, who was an eminent scholar of the [[Upanishads]] who specialised in [[Greek philosophy]] and emphasized the centrality of a psychological approach as opposed to a theological approach for the proper understanding of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nalini Bhushan |author2=Jay L. Garfield |title=Indian Philosophy in English: From Renaissance to Independence |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ebo8NpbpNk0C&amp;pg=PA245 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-991128-8 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first published in 1926 by Oriental Books Agency, [[Pune]], under the patronage of Sir Parashuramarao Bhausaheb, Raja of [[Jamkhandi State|Jamkhandi]]. It was later republished by [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jashan P. Vaswani |title=Sketches of Saints Known and Unknown |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0JPT6s07l-IC&amp;pg=PA199 |year=2008 |publisher=Sterling Paperbacks Ltd. |isbn=978-81-207-3998-7 |pages=197–202 |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranade wrote the book on the basis of his various lectures on Upanishads and the [[Bhagavad Gita]] that were delivered in 1915. In that year, inspired by a lecture of Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, he had first conceived the idea of a presentation of Upanishadic philosophy in terms of modern thought. He took into consideration of the place of the Upanishads in Indian philosophy, and examined the opinions of the Orientalists with a view to put into hand of the Orientalists and those interested a new method for treating the problems of Indian philosophy, and into the hands of European philosophers a new material for exercising their intellects on, to serve the main intended spiritual purpose. He employed "the method of construction through a systematic exposition of all the problems that emerge from the discussion of Upanishadic thought in their manifold bearings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R.D.Ranade |title=Preface to A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sE8pAAAAYAAJ| edition = 1968 |year=1968 |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |pages=vii-xix |location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is broadly divided into seven chapters. First he deals with the background of Upanishadic Speculation, then with the development of Upanishadic Cosmogony. He discusses the varieties of psychological reflection and the roots of later philosophies, before taking up the problem of the Ultimate Reality in the Upanishads. He covers the ethics of the Upanishads, and finally the intimation of self-realisation. It is a wide-ranging study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Stephen |title=Aurobindo's Philosophy of Brahman |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H9gUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 |year=1986 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=90-04-07765-0 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; that through Jnanamarga leads to the inference that dualism or pluralism is only apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vitsaxis |first=Vassilis |title=Thought and Faith |url=https://books.google.com/?id=52b-A2l7QbwC&amp;pg=PA89 |year=2009 |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |isbn=978-1-935244-05-9 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Klaus K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">[[File:Antinous Mandragone profil.jpg|thumb|The [[Antinous Mondragone]], the head from an acrolithic [[cult image]] of the deified [[Antinous]]]]

An '''acrolith''' is a composite [[sculpture]] made of stone and other materials, as in the case of a figure whose clothed parts are made of wood, while the exposed flesh parts such as head, hands, and feet are made of marble. The wood was covered either by drapery or by gilding.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Acroliths|volume=1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sturgis23"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgis|first1=Russell|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Building, Volume I|date=1901|publisher=Macmillan|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of statuary was common and widespread in [[Classical antiquity]].

[[Greek etymology]]: ''acros'' and ''lithos'', [[English language|English translation]]: "height" or "extremity" and "stone".

Similarly, [[chryselephantine sculpture]] used [[ivory]] instead of marble, and often gold on parts of the body and ornaments. Acroliths are frequently mentioned by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2nd century AD), the best known example being the Athene Areia ("Warlike Athena") of the [[Plataea]]ns.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt;

== Examples of acrolithic sculptures ==
*Athene Areia of the Plataeans
*[[Colossus of Constantine]]
*[[Antinous Mondragone]]
*[[Hera Farnese]]
*[[Augustus]], [[dea Roma]], [[Tiberius]], [[Livia]] from [[Leptis Magna]] in [[Libya]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23797">The following is a partial '''list of unproduced Alfred Hitchcock projects''', in roughly chronological order. During a career that spanned more than half a century, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] [[Alfred Hitchcock filmography|directed over fifty films]], and worked on a number of others which never made it beyond the [[pre-production]] stage.

== ''Number 13'' (1922) ==
{{Main|Number 13 (film)}}
This was to be Hitchcock's directorial debut, after working in the art department on twelve films previously, but budgetary problems canceled the production after only a few scenes were shot. Studio records indicate that its title was to be ''Mrs. Peabody''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== ''Forbidden Territory'' (1933–1934) ==
British thriller writer [[Dennis Wheatley]] had been a guest on the set of many of the early Hitchcock movies, and when ''The Forbidden Territory'' was published in January 1933, he presented the director with a copy.  Hitchcock so enjoyed the book that he wanted to make a film of it, but he was just in the process of moving to Gaumont-British studios to work for Michael Balcon; he asked Wheatley to hold onto the rights until he could persuade his new employer to purchase them.   When the time came, however, Balcon wasn't interested and instead insisted that Hitchcock direct the musical ''[[Waltzes from Vienna]]''.   Hitchcock then approached Richard Wainwright, a distinguished producer who had been head of UFA films in Germany, and had recently relocated to Britain.   Wainwright was keen to pick up a promising subject for his first British film, and immediately bought the rights.  Although there was a verbal understanding that Hitchcock was to direct, Balcon refused to release him, and instead began production of ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.  Wainwright, committed to studio space, technicians and actors, had no alternative but to proceed without him, and placed [[Forbidden Territory|the film]] into the hands of American director Phil Rosen. In 1936, at Hitchcock's instigation, Wheatley wrote a screenplay ''The Bombing of London'', but the controversial project could find no backer and was shelved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== ''Greenmantle'' (1939–1942) ==
Hitchcock very much wanted to direct a follow-up to ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and he felt that ''[[Greenmantle]]'' by [[John Buchan]] was a superior book. He proposed that the film would star [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]], but the rights from the Buchan estate proved too expensive.&lt;ref name="ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com"&gt;[http://ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com/dubi/2008/03/films-hitchco-1.html] from Ordinary Least Square&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unnamed ''Titanic'' project (1939) ==
Hitchcock remarked in a British film journal interview just before leaving for Hollywood that he hoped to make a film about the tragic loss of RMS ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', as the inherent drama of the ocean liner's sinking appealed to him.  He went on to make ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' instead.

== ''Escape'' (1940) ==
Hitchcock desperately wanted to direct [[Norma Shearer]], [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], and [[Conrad Veidt]] in one of the first [[World War II]] dramas, ''[[Escape (1940 film)|Escape]]''. Hitchcock, a long-time admirer of Shearer's acting, had sought for years to find a suitable project for her. However, Hitchcock was shut out of the project when the novel ''Escape'' by Ethel Vance (pen name of [[Grace Zaring Stone]]) was purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Hitchcock knew he could never work for the notorious MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]], who selected [[Mervyn LeRoy]] to produce [[Escape (1940 film)|the film]], which indeed starred Shearer and was released in late 1940. Years later, Hitchcock made the statement about the lack of true Hollywood leading ladies with the quote, "Where are the Norma Shearers?"

== Unmade Nazi documentary (1945) ==
{{Main|German Concentration Camps Factual Survey}}
In 1945, Hitchcock was brought in as a supervising director for a [[documentary film]] about Nazi crimes and Nazi [[Internment|concentration camps]]. The film was originally to include segments produced by military film units from the United Kingdom, United States, France, and the Soviet Union. [[Cold War]] developments meant that the USSR segment was withdrawn, and the film remained uncompleted, with some footage kept in the collection of the [[Imperial War Museum]]. 

However, a reconstruction of the film was aired as ''Memory of the Camps'' in 1984–1985 in the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States version was shown on the PBS series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' on May 7, 1985. In October 2014, a new documentary about the unfinished film, ''Night Will Fall'', premiered at the [[BFI London Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="BBC1945"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29249780 |title=Documentary tells of abandoned Hitchcock Nazi film |access-date=18 September 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Hamlet'' (late 1940s) ==
In the late 1940s, Hitchcock had plans to make a modernized version of the Shakespeare story. Hitchcock's Shakespearean vision was of a "psychological melodrama" (set in contemporary England, and starring Cary Grant in the title role[[Prince Hamlet|)]]. The project was scrapped when Hitchcock's studio caught wind of a potential lawsuit from a professor who had already written a modern-day version of Hamlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hitchcock's notebooks: an authorized and illustrated look inside the creative mind of Alfred Hitchcock|last = Aulier|first = Dan|publisher = Spike|year = 1999|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Bramble Bush'' (1951–1953) ==
''The Bramble Bush'' would have been an adaptation of a 1948 novel by [[David Duncan (writer)|David Duncan]] about a disaffected [[Communism|Communist]] agitator who, on the run from the police, is forced to adopt the identity of a murder suspect. The story would be adapted to take place in [[Mexico]] and [[San Francisco]]. 

The project, originally to come after ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) as a [[Transatlantic Pictures]] production to be released by [[Warner Bros.]], had a high budget which made it a difficult project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf5l0qtZabMC&amp;pg=PA456&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=david+duncan+the+bramble+bush&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U8psC0NI4c&amp;sig=3EM1D6BRMmJQou9rE3kkGA1GlmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxC-TIfDDoyqsAPSpqD7DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20duncan%20the%20bramble%20bush&amp;f=false Patrick McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light'' (2002) via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock did not feel that any of the scripts lifted the movie beyond an ordinary chase story, and Warner Brothers allowed him to kill the project and move on to ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954). 

The theme of the hero assuming a dangerous new identity would become the kernel of the script for ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s  film ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975) tells a similar story, but is not based on Duncan's book.&lt;ref name="ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com"/&gt; The 1960 film ''[[The Bramble Bush]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Barbara Rush]], and released by Warner Bros., was based on a Charles Mergendahl novel, and had no relation to Duncan's book.

== ''Flamingo Feather'' (1956) ==
This was to be a big-budget adaptation of [[Laurens van der Post]]'s novel of political intrigue in [[Southern Africa]]. [[James Stewart]] was expected to take the lead role of an adventurer who discovers a concentration camp for Communist agents; Hitchcock wanted [[Grace Kelly]] to play the love interest. 

After a disappointing research trip to [[South Africa]] where he concluded that he would have difficulty filming, especially on a budget &amp;ndash; and with confusion of the story's politics and the impracticability of casting Kelly, Hitchcock deferred the project and instead cast Stewart in ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]). Hitchcock travelled to Livingstone at The Victoria Falls and was a guest of Harry Sossen one of the prominent inhabitants of this pioneer town. Hitchcock and Sossen were photographed together at the newly opened Livingstone Airport and the event was recorded in the local papers. Sossen was also in communication with Laurens van der Post who gave him a signed copy of the book ''Flamingo Feather'' during a visit to the Falls (staying at the [[Victoria Falls Hotel]]). Sossen's daughter Marion is in possession of the book today and a number of letters between her father and van der Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/books/beginnings/9908/making.of.psycho Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ''Psycho''] from CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''No Bail for the Judge'' (1958–1961) ==
''No Bail for the Judge''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2007/43/hitchcock-thriller-no-bail-judge/ No Bail for the Judge] from sensesofcinema.com&lt;/ref&gt; was to be an adaptation of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel by [[Henry Cecil Leon|Henry Cecil]] about a London [[barrister]] who, with the assistance of a gentleman thief, has to defend her father, a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge, when he is accused of murdering a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. In a change of pace from his usual blonde actresses, [[Audrey Hepburn]] would have played the barrister, with [[Laurence Harvey]] as the thief, and [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as the Hepburn character's father. Some sources, including ''Writing with Hitchcock'' author Steven DeRosa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writingwithhitchcock/nobailforthejudge.html No Bail for the Judge]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from writingwithhitchcock.com&lt;/ref&gt; say that Hitchcock's interest in the novel started in the summer of 1954 while filming ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', and that Hitchcock hoped to have [[John Michael Hayes]] write the screenplay. Hepburn was an admirer of Hitchcock's work and had long wanted to appear in one of his films.

[[Samuel A. Taylor]], scenarist for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', wrote the screenplay after [[Ernest Lehman]] rejected it. The Taylor screenplay included a scene, not in the original novel, where the heroine disguises herself as a prostitute and has to fend off a [[rape|rapist]]. Hepburn left the film, partly because of the near-rape scene, but primarily due to a pregnancy. (Hepburn suffered a miscarriage during the filming of the 1960 film ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' and then gave birth to son Sean Ferrer in July 1960.) Laurence Harvey still ended up working with Hitchcock in 1959, however, on an episode that Hitchcock directed of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.

Without Hepburn, the project didn't have the same appeal for Hitchcock. Changes in British law concerning prostitution and entrapment&amp;nbsp;— changes that took place after the novel was published&amp;nbsp;— made some aspects of the screenplay implausible. Hitchcock told [[Paramount Pictures]] it was better to write off $200,000 already spent on the film's development than to spend another $3 million for a film he no longer cared for. In the fall of 1959, a Paramount publicity brochure titled "Success in the Sixties!" had touted ''No Bail for the Judge'' as an upcoming feature film starring Hepburn, to be filmed in [[Technicolor]] and [[VistaVision]].

== ''The Wreck of the Mary Deare'' (1959) ==
The [[Hammond Innes]] [[The Wreck of the Mary Deare|novel]] was optioned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] with the intention of having Hitchcock direct and [[Gary Cooper]] star. Hitchcock had long wanted to work with Cooper, but after developing the script with Ernest Lehman for several weeks, they concluded that it couldn't be done without turning the movie into "a boring courtroom drama". 

Hitchcock and Lehman made an appearance before MGM executives telling the story of ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and said that MGM would get two films out of Hitchcock under his contract with MGM. However, eventually Hitchcock abandoned the idea of ''Mary Deare'' and went ahead with ''North by Northwest'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2003), pg. 543, 548-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Blind Man'' (1960) ==
Following ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', Hitchcock re-united with Ernest Lehman for an original screenplay idea: A blind pianist, Jimmy Shearing (a role for [[James Stewart]]), regains his sight after receiving the eyes of a dead man. Watching a [[American frontier|Wild West]] show at [[Disneyland]] with his family, Shearing would have visions of being shot and would come to realize that the dead man was in fact murdered and the image of the murderer is still imprinted on the retina of his eyes. The story would end with a chase around the ocean liner [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']]. [[Walt Disney]] reputedly barred Hitchcock from shooting at [[Disneyland]] after seeing ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Stewart left the project, Lehman argued with Hitchcock, and the script was never shot.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gore ''The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999, p.36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Village of Stars'' (1962) ==
Hitchcock bought the rights to the 1960 novel ''Village of Stars'' by [[Arthur David Beaty|David Beaty]] (written under the pen name Paul Stanton) after ''The Blind Man'' project was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gore, ''The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made'' (New York: [[St. Martin's Press]], 1999), pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows a [[Royal Air Force]] [[V bomber]] crew given an order to drop a nuclear bomb, only to have the order aborted. Unfortunately, the bomb is resisting attempts to defuse it and the plane can only stay in flight for a limited time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stanton (David Beaty) ''Village of Stars'', London: Michael Joseph, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Trap for a Solitary Man'' (1963) ==
''Trap for a Solitary Man'' was scheduled to be directed by Hitchcock in widescreen by [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Spoto, ''The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock'' (Boston: Little, Brown, 1983 {{ISBN|0-316-80723-0}}), pg. 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Gottlieb, "Unknown Hitchcock: the Unrealized Projects;" featured in ''Hitchcock: Past and Future'' (London: Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-27525-3}}), pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The story, based on the French play ''Piege Pour un Homme Seul'' by M. Robert Thomas, follows a young married couple on holiday in the Alps. The wife disappears, and after a prolonged search the police bring back someone they claim to be her; she even says she is the man's wife, but the man has never seen her before. The play was later adapted three times as [[television film]]s: ''[[Honeymoon With a Stranger]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 1969), ''[[One of My Wives Is Missing]]'' (ABC, 1976) and ''[[Vanishing Act (1986 film)|Vanishing Act]]'' ([[CBS]], 1986).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064438/movieconnections Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  It had previously been broadly adapted (without attribution) as the 1958 [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British-Pathé]] feature ''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/ccorcos/lawctr/TOPTENMOVIES.htm "Top Ten Law-Related Movies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Mary Rose'' (1964) ==
Hitchcock had long desired to turn [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1920 play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' into a film. In 1964, after working together on ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', Hitchcock asked [[Jay Presson Allen]] to adapt the play into a screenplay. Hitchcock would later tell interviewers that his contract with [[Universal Pictures]] allowed him to make any film, so long as the budget was under $3 million, and so long as it was not ''Mary Rose''. Whether or not this was actually true, [[Lew Wasserman]] was not keen on the project, though Hitchcock never gave up hope of one day filming it.&lt;ref name="Francois Truffaut 1985"&gt;François Truffaut, Hitchcock Revisited (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Three Hostages'' (1964) ==
In 1964, Hitchcock re-read another [[Richard Hannay]] novel by John Buchan, ''[[The Three Hostages]]'', with a mind to adapting it. As with ''Greenmantle'' a quarter of a century earlier, the rights were elusive. But also the story was dated, very much rooted in the 1930s, and the plot involved a villain whose blind mother [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the hero. Hitchcock, in interviews, said that he felt that the portrayal of hypnosis did not work on film, and that films that attempted this portrayal, in Hitchcock's opinion, turned out poorly.&lt;ref&gt;François Truffaut ''Hitchcock Revisited'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Frenzy'' (a.k.a. ''Kaleidoscope'') (1964–1967) ==
Although Hitchcock made a film called ''[[Frenzy]]'' in 1972, that film's title and some plot points came from an idea Hitchcock had a few years earlier for a [[prequel]] to ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenderosa.com/writingwithhitchcock/frenzy.html Frenzy] from stevenderosa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock approached many writers including [[Samuel A. Taylor|Samuel Taylor]], [[Alec Coppel]], and ''Psycho'' writer [[Robert Bloch]], but in the end engaged an old friend, [[Benn Levy]] to flesh out his sketchy idea.

The story (inspired by English serial killers [[Neville Heath]] and [[John George Haigh]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barber |first1=Nicholas |title=Why Hitchcock’s Kaleidoscope was too shocking to be made |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180620-why-hitchcocks-kaleidoscope-was-too-shocking-to-be-made |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 June 2018 |language=en |date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; would have revolved around a young, handsome bodybuilder  who lures young women to their deaths, a version of the character known as 'Merry Widow Murderer' in ''Shadow of a Doubt''. The [[New York City Police Department|New York police]] set a trap for him, with a policewoman posing as a potential victim. The script was based around three [[set piece|crescendos]] dictated by Hitchcock: the first was a murder by a waterfall; the second murder would take place on a mothballed warship; and the finale, which would take place at an oil refinery with brightly colored drums.

Hitchcock showed his script to his friend [[François Truffaut]]. Though Truffaut admired the script, he felt uneasy about its relentless sex and violence. Unlike ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', these elements would not be hidden behind the respectable veneer of [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] and psychological [[suspense]], and the killer would be the main character, the hero, the eyes of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock'' by [[Donald Spoto]] (1983, {{ISBN|0-316-80723-0}}; 1999 paperback reprint {{ISBN|0-306-80932-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal vetoed the film, despite Hitchcock's assurances that he would make the film for under $1 million with a cast of unknowns, although [[David Hemmings]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Michael Caine]] had all been suggested as leads. The film&amp;nbsp;— alternatively known as ''Frenzy'' or the more "sixties"-esque ''Kaleidoscope''&amp;nbsp;— was not made.

Test footage from this project can be viewed here [https://www.flickr.com/photos/49597617@N02/4629223639/] and is included in the 1999 TV documentaries ''Dial H For Hitchcock: The Genius Behind the Showman'' ([[Starz Encore|Encore]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=35173 1999 Universal TV press release]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Reputations: Alfred Hitchcock'' ([[A&amp;E Networks|A&amp;E]]/[[BBC Two]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The silent eloquence of the Master of Suspense," ''The Independent'', 6 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''R.R.R.R.'' (1965) ==
Hitchcock approached Italian comedy-thriller writers [[Agenore Incrocci]] and [[Furio Scarpelli]] ([[Age &amp; Scarpelli]]), writers of ''[[Big Deal on Madonna Street]]'', to write a screenplay around an original idea Hitchcock had carried in his head since the late 1930s. A [[New York City]] hotel is run by an Italian immigrant who is unaware that his family are using the hotel as cover for crimes, including the theft of a valuable coin from a guest of the hotel. (R.R.R.R. is the highest value of coin.)

The Italian screenwriters struggled with the story, and were not helped by the language barrier.  Universal Pictures were not keen on the idea and persuaded Hitchcock to move on to something else.&lt;ref name="Francois Truffaut 1985"/&gt;

== ''The Short Night'' (1976–1979) ==
{{Main|The Short Night}}
Hitchcock's last, unfinished project was ''[[The Short Night]]'', an adaptation of the spy thriller of the same name by [[Ronald Kirkbride]]. A British double agent (loosely based on [[George Blake]]) escapes from prison and flees to [[Moscow]] via [[Finland]], where his wife and children are waiting. An American agent &amp;ndash; whose brother was one of the traitor's victims &amp;ndash; heads to Finland to intercept him but ends up falling for the wife. It was Hitchcock's third attempt &amp;ndash; after ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' &amp;ndash; to produce a "realistic [[James Bond|Bond]] film". [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Sean Connery]] were possible male leads. [[Liv Ullmann]] was asked to play the double agent's wife. [[Catherine Deneuve]] was also asked to star.  [[Walter Matthau]] was considered for the villain role.  [[Ed Lauter]] was also discussed for a role as one of Matthau's prison mates.  

The first writer assigned to the picture, [[James Costigan]], quarreled with the director, who asked for him to be paid off. Then [[Ernest Lehman]] agreed to work on the script. Lehman felt the story should focus on the American spy, and left out the double agent's jailbreak. Lehman left the film too, and Hitchcock asked old friend [[Norman Lloyd]] to help him write a long [[Film treatment|treatment]]. Lloyd, like Universal, was concerned that Hitchcock's failing health meant that the movie might not get made. When Hitchcock suggested moving straight on to the screenplay, Lloyd objected, saying they were unprepared. Hitchcock reacted angrily, fired Lloyd, and worked on the treatment alone.

After a while, Hitchcock accepted that he needed another writer to work with him, and Universal suggested [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Freeman helped Hitchcock complete the treatment and wrote the screenplay. He wrote about his experiences in the 1999 book ''The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock'', which includes his completed screenplay. The circumstances surrounding Hitchcock's retirement were given by producer [[Hilton A. Green]] during the documentary ''Plotting "Family Plot"''. According to Green, during [[pre-production]] for ''The Short Night'' Hitchcock met Green to tell him that his poor health would prevent him from making the film that was to be the follow-up to ''[[Family Plot]]''. After trying to talk Hitchcock out of his decision, Green agreed to Hitchcock's request to bring the news of his decision to retire to studio head [[Lew Wasserman]], a long-time friend of Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0455182|Plotting "Family Plot"}}. [[Hilton A. Green|Hilton Green]] tells the story about the circumstances that led to Hitchock's retirement, beginning at approximately 44 minutes and 12 seconds into the documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the sequel to the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and the second installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]. The film follows Weaver's character [[Ellen Ripley]] as she returns to the moon where her crew encountered the hostile [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] creature, this time accompanied by a unit of [[space marine]]s. Additional roles are played by Carrie Henn, [[Michael Biehn]], [[Paul Reiser]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Jenette Goldstein]], [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]], [[Al Matthews (actor)|Al Matthews]], and [[Bill Paxton]].

[[Gordon Carroll]], [[David Giler]], and [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] of [[Brandywine Productions]], who produced the first film and its later sequels, served as executive producers on ''Aliens''. They were interested in a follow-up to ''Alien'' as soon as its 1979 release, but the new management at [[20th Century Fox]] postponed those plans until 1983. Brandywine picked Cameron to write after reading his script for ''[[The Terminator]]''; when that film became a hit in 1984, Fox greenlit ''Aliens'' with Cameron as director and a budget of approximately {{Nowrap|$18 million}}. It was filmed in England at [[Pinewood Studios]] and at [[Acton Lane Power Station|a decommissioned power plant]] in [[Acton, London]].

''Aliens'' was released on July 18, 1986 and grossed {{Nowrap|$180 million}} worldwide. It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]], including a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] nomination for Sigourney Weaver, winning both [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Sound Effects Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Visual Effects]]. It won eight [[Saturn Awards]] ([[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Paxton, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Goldstein, and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] for Cameron), and a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]]. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine voted it the 'Greatest Film Sequel Of All Time'. ''Aliens'' was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 1986 in North America.

A sequel, ''[[Alien 3]]'', was released in 1992, with Weaver reprising her role as Ripley and Henriksen as Bishop in the film.

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per Wikipedia Guidelines, please do not expand this summary any further.--&gt;
Ellen Ripley has been in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] in a shuttle for 57 years. She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation; they are skeptical of her claims that an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|alien]] creature killed her entire crew and forced her to destroy her ship the ''Nostromo'', and they subsequently revoke her flight officer license.

The [[exomoon]] LV-426, where the ''Nostromo'' initially encountered the derelict ship containing alien eggs, is now home to the [[terraforming]] colony Hadleys Hope. When contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Despite suffering from recurring nightmares about her original experience with the alien, she eventually joins the expedition on Burke's word that their mission is to exterminate the creatures. Aboard the spaceship [[Sulaco (fictional spacecraft)|USS ''Sulaco'']], she is introduced to the Colonial Marines and the [[android (robot)|android]] Bishop, toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android [[Ash (Alien)|Ash]] aboard the ''Nostromo.''

A [[Dropship (science fiction)|dropship]] delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies, two live [[facehugger]]s in containment tanks in the medical lab, and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt, the sole survivor, who used the extensive ventilation system to evade the aliens. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the [[fusion power]]ed atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.

At the center of the station, the Marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. When the Marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzbowski, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, causing it to crash into the station. The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.

Ripley discovers that Burke sent the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the ''Nostromo'' crew first encountered the eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering alien specimens for use as [[biological weapon]]s. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group that the power plant was damaged by the dropship crash along with the previous firefight that ruptured the cooling system and will soon explode with the force of a 40-megaton [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapon]]. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the ''Sulaco''{{'}}s remaining dropship to the surface.

Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two "facehuggers", which have been released from their tanks. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the Marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers so that they would impregnate her and Newt, allowing him to smuggle the embryos past Earth's quarantine, and of planning to kill the rest of the Marines so that no one could contradict his version of events. Before the Marines can kill Burke, the power is cut, and aliens assault through the ceiling.  In the ensuing firefight, Burke attempts to flee but is cornered by an alien, while Hudson is dragged away after covering the others' retreat.  Gorman and the injured Vasquez detonate a grenade and sacrifice themselves; Hicks is injured, and Newt is captured.

Ripley and Hicks reach Bishop in the second dropship, but Ripley refuses to abandon Newt. The group travels to the processing station, allowing a heavily armed Ripley to enter the hive and rescue Newt. As they escape, the two encounter the alien queen in her egg chamber. When an egg begins to open, Ripley uses her flamethrower to destroy the eggs and the queen's [[ovipositor]]. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt reunite with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship. All four escape moments before the station explodes with the colony consumed by the nuclear blast.

On the ''Sulaco'', the group is ambushed by the queen, who stowed away in the ship's landing gear. The queen tears Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley battles the creature using an [[Powered exoskeleton|exosuit]] cargo-loader and expels it through an [[airlock]] into space. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and the critically damaged Bishop enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.

[[Paul Maxwell]] portrays Van Leuwen, the head of the review board that revokes Ripley's flight license, and Carl Toop portrays the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|aliens]] and alien queen.

Cameron opted to hire actors who had, or could imitate, American accents. After over 3,000 individuals in the United Kingdom were unsuccessfully auditioned, American actors were chosen instead, including three who had previously worked with Cameron on ''The Terminator'': Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Michael Biehn. Actors who played Marines were asked to read [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' and undergo military training, which included running, lifting weights, learning salutes, marches, deployments, and maneuvers, for two weeks. Cameron wanted the Marines to train together so that they would form bonds that would show on-screen. Sigourney Weaver, William Hope, and Paul Reiser were absent from training because of other obligations, but Cameron felt that this suited their characters as "outsiders" in the film.&lt;ref name="casting" /&gt;

==Development==

===Conception===
[[David Giler]] declared in 1979 [[Brandywine Productions]] were intent on "immediately making a sequel" to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', having the full support of [[20th Century Fox]] president [[Alan Ladd Jr.]]. However, that year Ladd left amid Fox's transition to new owners [[Marc Rich]] and [[Marvin Davis]], and the new studio management had no interest in the sequel.&lt;ref name="57 years"/&gt; Giler accused new president Norman Levy of being the one that held back the film's production; Levy would later declare that "It was a movie I wanted to make," but he felt another ''Alien'' would prove too costly. In the meantime, Giler and partners [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] and [[Gordon Carroll]] sued Fox regarding the disbursement of the ''Alien'' profits. By the time the lawsuit was settled in 1983, Fox had new executives that got interested in continuing ''Alien''.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-24/entertainment/ca-31415_1_gordon-carroll|title='Aliens': A Battle-scarred Trek Into Orbit|author=Friendly, David T.|date=July 24, 1986|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giler pitched the project to one of the executives as a cross between Hill's ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' and ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.&lt;ref name="57 years"/&gt;

While the producers and development executive Larry Wilson sought a writer for ''Alien&amp;nbsp;II'', Wilson came across [[James Cameron]]'s screenplay for ''[[The Terminator]]'', and passed the script to Giler, feeling Cameron was right for the job.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Giler then approached Cameron, who was completing pre-production of ''The Terminator''. A fan of the original ''Alien'', Cameron was interested in crafting a sequel and entered a self-imposed seclusion to brainstorm a concept for ''Alien&amp;nbsp;II''.&lt;ref name="schickel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961839,00.html |title=Cinema: Help! They're Back! |date=July 28, 1986 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=Schickel |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Schickel |accessdate=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After four days Cameron produced an initial 45-page treatment, although the Fox management put the film on hiatus, as some disliked the pitch, and they felt that ''Alien'' had not generated enough profit to warrant a sequel.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="schickel" /&gt; A scheduling conflict with actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] caused filming of ''The Terminator'' to be delayed by nine months (as Schwarzenegger was filming ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''), allowing Cameron additional time to write a script for ''Aliens''. While filming ''The Terminator'', Cameron wrote 90 pages for ''Aliens'', and although the script was not finished, Fox's new president [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Larry Gordon]] was impressed and told him that if ''The Terminator'' was a success, he would be able to direct ''Aliens''.&lt;ref name="57 years"&gt;''57 Years Later - Continuing the story, Superior Firepower''. ''Alien Anthology'' Blu-Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Cameron even declared that he spent production of ''The Terminator'' thinking on which elements of that film could "make a good [[Dry run (testing)|dry run]]" for the ''Alien'' sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-11/entertainment/ca-20111_1_aliens|title='Aliens' Into Scary Space Once More|date=July 11, 1986|author=Mathews, Jack|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''The Terminator'', Cameron and producing partner [[Gale Anne Hurd]] were given approval to direct and produce the sequel to ''Alien'', scheduled for a 1986 release. Cameron was enticed by the opportunity to create a new world and opted not to follow the same formula as ''Alien'', but to create a worthy combat sequel focusing "more on terror, less on horror".&lt;ref name="Audio com" /&gt; Sigourney Weaver, who played Ripley in ''Alien'', had doubts about the project, but after meeting Cameron she expressed interest in revisiting her character. 20th Century Fox, however, refused to sign a contract with Weaver over a payment dispute and asked Cameron to write a story excluding Ripley.&lt;ref name="57 years" /&gt; He refused on the grounds that Fox had indicated that Weaver had signed on when he began writing the script. With Cameron's persistence, Fox signed the contract, and Weaver obtained a salary of {{Nowrap|$1 million}}, a sum 30 times what she was paid for the first film&lt;ref name="corliss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961869,00.html|title=The Years of Living Splendidly|date=1986-07-28|publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss|accessdate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation |US|1000000 |1985|r=-5}}}} in present-day terms). Weaver nicknamed her role in the ''Alien'' sequel "Rambolina", referring to [[John Rambo]] of the [[Rambo (film series)|''Rambo'' series]], and stated that she approached the role as akin to the titular role in [[Henry V (play)|''Henry&amp;nbsp;V'']] or [[List of women warriors in folklore#Historical China|women warriors in Chinese classical literature]].&lt;ref name="corliss" /&gt;

Cameron drew inspiration for the ''Aliens'' story from the [[Vietnam War]], a situation in which a technologically superior force was mired in a hostile foreign environment: "Their training and technology are inappropriate for the specifics, and that can be seen as analogous to the inability of superior American firepower to conquer the unseen enemy in Vietnam: a lot of firepower and very little wisdom, and it didn't work."&lt;ref name="schickel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Don. "Aliens." ''[[Cinefex]]''. Vol 27. {{Nowrap|August 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of the Colonial Marines was influenced by the Vietnam War; they are portrayed as cocky and confident of their inevitable victory, but when they find themselves facing a technologically inferior but more determined enemy, the outcome is not what they expect.&lt;ref name="Audio com" /&gt; Cameron listed [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' as a major influence that led to the incorporation of various themes and phrases, such as the terms "the drop" and "bug hunt" as well as the cargo-loader exoskeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aliens: The Illustrated Screenplay|chapter=Mothers With Guns|author=Cameron, James|editor=Sammon, Paul M.|pages=10–20|publisher=Orion|year=2001|isbn=0752831933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Gale Ann Hurd and James Cameron.jpg|thumb|left|The producing team behind ''Aliens'', James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd]]
''Aliens'' was filmed over ten months on a budget of {{Nowrap|$18 million}} at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England.&lt;ref name="schickel" /&gt; Cameron, bound by a low budget and a deadline, found it difficult to adjust to what Paxton called the "indentured" working practices of the British crew, such as the tea breaks that brought production to a halt. Many of the crew had worked on ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and were fiercely loyal to Ridley Scott, and they believed the 31-year-old Cameron was too young and inexperienced to direct. In response, he arranged a screening of ''The Terminator'', which had not yet been released in the UK, but many of the crew did not attend.&lt;ref name="war"&gt;''This Time It's War - Pinewood Studios, 1985, Superior Firepower''&lt;/ref&gt; They also mocked producer Gale Anne Hurd, insisting that she was only receiving the producer credit because she was married to Cameron. Cameron clashed with the original director of photography [[Dick Bush]] when Bush started production saying the schedule couldn't be met and when he insisted on lighting the alien nest set brightly. Cameron insisted on a dark, foreboding nest, relying on the lights from the Marines' armor. After Bush was fired, the crew walked out. Hurd managed to coax the team back to work, and [[Adrian Biddle]] was hired as Bush's replacement.&lt;ref name="war" /&gt;

Some scenes of the alien nest were shot at the decommissioned [[Acton Lane Power Station]] in [[Acton, London]]. The crew thought it was a perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove [[asbestos]] from the station.&lt;ref name="concept" /&gt; The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Movie Minutiae: Aliens"&gt;{{cite web |title=Movie Minutiae: ''Aliens'' |author=Kemble, Gary |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=2005-12-02 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200511/s1513926.htm |accessdate=2008-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222042921/http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200511/s1513926.htm |archivedate=2007-12-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Aliens (soundtrack)}}
Music composer [[James Horner]] felt he was not given enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to be completed and to write the score in six weeks, which he thought was a sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor [[Ray Lovejoy]] was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]], a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.&lt;ref name="JH"&gt;The Final Countdown – Music, editing and sound, ''Superior Firepower''&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks from theatrical release, no [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] had taken place and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd did not have much music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated he had been able to achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days.&lt;ref name="JH" /&gt; Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.

Horner stated that tensions between himself and Cameron were so high during post-production that he assumed they would never work together again. Horner believed that Cameron's film schedules were too short and stressful. The two parted ways until 1997 when Cameron, impressed with Horner's score for ''[[Braveheart]]'', asked him to compose the score for ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.&lt;ref name="JH" /&gt;

==Design==
[[File:AH-1 Cobra helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|The [[AH-1 Cobra]] used in Vietnam served as inspiration for the design of the dropship]]
Early concept art was created by [[Syd Mead]], who had previously worked on ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', and ''[[Tron]]''. One of the original designs for the spaceship ''Sulaco'' was spherical, but it was redesigned as the ship would be out of frame due to the film's [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. Cameron showed Mead his own concept art, and the final result was described as "rocket gun that carries stuff". Concept artists were asked to incorporate subliminal acknowledgments to the Vietnam War, which included designing the dropship as a combination of a [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom&amp;nbsp;II]] and [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobra]].&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;''Building Better Worlds - From concept to construction, Superior Firepower''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Because of its influence on the structure, its name was attributed to the UD4L.&lt;ref name="A:CMTM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brimmicombe-Wood, Lee|title=[[Aliens: Colonial Marines Technical Manual]]|year=1996|page=159|isbn=0-06-105343-0|publisher=HarperPrism|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is a UD4L?, telling the reader would be nice = The use of a [[gatling gun]] was inspired by the [[GAU-8 Avenger]], used on the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[A-10 Thunderbolt&amp;nbsp;II]], alongside the [[F-4 Phantom&amp;nbsp;II]]'s body, tail, and engine vents, which served as cosmetic elements of the UD4L.&lt;ref name="SupFire"&gt;{{cite video|title=Superior Firepower: The Making of [[Aliens (film)|Aliens]], [[Alien Quadrilogy#DVD features|Alien Quadrilogy, Disc 4]]|medium=[[documentary film |Documentary]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiding this section – too technical, confusing mentioning all types of planes/guns yet no explanation of a UD4L is given--&gt;

[[File:Aliens (film) APC.jpg|thumb|left|The armored personnel carrier (APC) was built upon the chassis of a Hunslet ATT 77 Aircraft Towing Tractor.]]

[[British Airways]] was re-equipping several of its [[Pushback#Tractor types|aircraft tug tractors]], and the crew managed to purchase a 635 [[Horsepower|hp]] [[Hunslet Engine Company|Hunslet]] ATT 77&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%201142.html|title=england - stand - tel - 1970 - 1142 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; tug to use as the [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]]. It initially weighed {{convert|70|ST|kg}}, and although the crew removed {{convert|35|ST|kg}} of lead ballast, the power station floor had to be reinforced to support the weight. The crew used many "junk" items in the set designs, such as Ripley's toilet, which came from a [[Boeing 707]]. Lockers, helicopter engines, and vending machines were used as set elements in the opening hypersleep scene. Production designer Peter Lamont was asked to reduce the cost of several scenes, including the not-yet-filmed Colonial Marine hypersleep sequence. Gale Hurd wanted to cut the scene altogether, but Lamont and Cameron felt it was important to the sequence of the film. To save on cost, only four hypersleep chambers were created, and a mirror was used to create the illusion that there were twelve in the scene. Instead of using hydraulics, the chambers were opened and closed by wires operated by puppeteers.&lt;ref name="concept" /&gt;

Weapons used by the Colonial Marines were based on fully functional weapons. British armorers used guns they found to be the most reliable when firing blanks and those which looked futuristic. The 'pulse rifles' were created from a [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson SMG]], with an attached forend of a [[Spas 12|Franchi SPAS-12]] shotgun and a Remington 12 Gauge Model 870P receiver with barrel. The 'smart guns' carried by Vasquez and Drake were based on the German [[MG 42]] machine gun and were maneuvered with [[Steadicam]]-like harnesses created using old motorcycle parts. The crew found [[flamethrower]]s the most difficult weapon to create and use, as they were the heaviest and most dangerous.&lt;ref name="actionweps"&gt;The Risk Always Lives - Weapons and action, ''Superior Firepower''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Queen|alien queen]], designed by Cameron himself, the aliens were inspired by [[H. R. Giger]]'s designs for the original.&lt;ref name="bitch"&gt;"Beauty and the Bitch: Power Loader vs. Alien Queen" Featurette. ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD Set, Disc 4 - ''Aliens'' Supplemental. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The only change was removing the translucent dome that gave the creature's head its sleek shape in ''Alien'', exposing the ridged, spined cranium beneath. Cameron felt the dome was too fragile for the practical effects,&lt;ref name="Bug hunt"&gt;"Bug Hunt: Creature Design" Featurette. ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD Set, Disc 4 - ''Aliens'' Supplemental. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and also felt that the cranium design was more visually interesting without it.&lt;ref name="Audio com" /&gt;

[[File:Alien (1986) - Alien queen.jpg|thumb|right|Ripley meets the alien queen. The life-sized queen mock-up was operated by 14 puppeteers.]]

===Visual effects===
Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak were hired to supervise the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several [[Roger Corman]] movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were, on average, six feet tall and three feet wide.&lt;ref name="Visual effects" /&gt; Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron said he had to pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene.&lt;ref name="Visual effects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://filmschoolrejects.com/36-things-we-learned-from-the-aliens-commentary-45fc526346e0/ "36 Things We Learned From the ‘Aliens’ Commentary"] Film School Rejects&lt;/ref&gt; Practical effects supervisor [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]] (who won a [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|special effects Oscar]] for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the [[forklift]] power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.&lt;ref name="bitch"/&gt;

The alien suits were made more flexible and durable than the ones used in ''Alien'' to expand on the creatures' movements and allow them to crawl and jump. Dancers, gymnasts, and stunt men were hired to portray the aliens. Various {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mannequins also were created to make aliens that stood in inhuman poses, and could have their bodies exploded to simulate gunshot wounds. Stan Winston's team created fully articulated facehuggers that could move their fingers; these were moved by wires hidden on the scenery or the actors' clothing. The one that walked towards Ripley had a mechanism akin to a [[Pullback motor|pull toy]], with pulleys that moved the fingers, and its jump combined three models shot separately: the walking facehugger, a stationary model dangling on a table leg, and another model being pulled towards the camera.&lt;ref name="Bug hunt"/&gt;

According to production staff, scenes involving the alien queen were the most difficult to film. A life-sized [[mockup]] was created by [[Stan Winston]]'s company in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at {{convert|14|ft}} tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full-size queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation.&lt;ref name="Visual effects"&gt;''The Power of Real Tech - Visual effects, Superior Firepower''&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proparchives.com/science-fiction/science-fiction-1980s/aliens/screen-used-movie-prop-special-effects-miniature-of-the-alien-queen-from-aliens Prop Archives website listing for miniature alien queen.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094537/http://www.proparchives.com/science-fiction/science-fiction-1980s/aliens/screen-used-movie-prop-special-effects-miniature-of-the-alien-queen-from-aliens |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aliens'' was first released on [[VHS]] in 1987, finishing as the tenth-best-selling title of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1989 International Television and Video Almanac|publisher=Quigley|year=1990|page=25|isbn=0900610409|editor=Klain, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "special edition" of ''Aliens'' that restored 17 minutes of deleted footage was released in the UK on VHS on April 5, 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Aliens' Could Set Scene for 'Special Editions' Genre|date=March 28, 1990|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US on [[LaserDisc]] in 1991 and on VHS the following year. These additions include a segment showing Newt's family first encountering the derelict spacecraft on LV-426, Ripley's learning that her daughter died during the years she was in hypersleep, a scene in the operations building in which the Marines use [[sentry gun]]s against the aliens, and several extended dialogue scenes between Ripley and the Marines.&lt;ref name="Audio com" /&gt; These scenes had been deleted from the original theatrical release as 20th Century Fox representatives thought the film was showing "too much nothing" and spent an unnecessary amount of time building suspense.&lt;ref name="Audio com"&gt;Aliens: Special Edition audio commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the special edition's footage was first seen when the film made its broadcast television debut on CBS in 1989, but two additional sequences concerning Burke's transmission to the colony about the derelict, and the Jorden family's subsequent discovery of the same, were added to the initial Laserdisc release. According to Cameron, the visual effects for the scene were incomplete, so he went back to the Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences. All currently available versions of the special edition contain these scenes.

The special edition was released as part of ''The Alien Legacy'' 20th Anniversary Edition [[DVD]] box set in 1999 along with ''Alien'', ''[[Alien 3]]'', and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]''.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Aliens'' received nearly universal acclaim. Test and pre-screenings were unable to take place due to the film not being completed until its week of release.&lt;ref name="reaction"&gt;''Aliens Unleashed - Reaction to the film, Superior Firepower''&lt;/ref&gt; Once it was released in cinemas, critical reaction was generally positive to very positive. Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and called it "painfully and unremittingly intense" and a "superb example of filmmaking craft." He also stated "when I walked out of the theater, there were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence."&lt;ref name="Ebert review"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=Aliens (review)|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| pages=|date=1986-07-18|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860718/REVIEWS/607180301/1023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Goodman of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it was a "flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."&lt;ref name="Goodman review"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goodman|first=Walter|author-link=|title = Movie Review: Aliens (1986) - Film: Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|pages = |date = 1986-07-18|url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9A0DE7DA1731F93BA25754C0A960948260&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine featured the film on the cover of its {{Nowrap|July 28}}, 1986, issue, calling it the "summer's scariest movie".

Some people have praised the technical excellence of ''Aliens''. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-08-08/entertainment/8602270452_1_flicks-film-ditch|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=Flick Of Week: `Vagabond` One Of Finest Films In Years|author=Siskel, Gene|authorlink=Gene Siskel|accessdate=February 1, 2014|date=August 8, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of the film have remained mostly positive over the years. In a 2000 review, film critic [[James Berardinelli]] said "When it comes to the logical marriage of action, adventure, and science fiction, few films are as effective or accomplished as ''Aliens''."&lt;ref name="Berardinelli review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aliens (review)|author=Berardinelli, James|publisher=[[James Berardinelli|Reelviews.net]]|year=2000|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/aliens.html|accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' contributor Marjorie Baumgarten labeled the film in 2002 as "a non-stop action fest."&lt;ref name="Baumgarten review"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baumgarten|first=Marjorie|author-link=|title=Aliens (review)|newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]|pages=|date=2002-06-07|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3a140686}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, James Charisma of ''[[Playboy]]'' ranked the film #6 on a list of ''15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than the Originals''.&lt;ref name="Playboy"&gt;{{cite web | title = Revenge of the Movie: 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals | publisher = [[Playboy]] | url = http://www.playboy.com/articles/15-sequels-better-than-the-original | author = Charisma, James | date = March 15, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160726093750/http://www.playboy.com/articles/15-sequels-better-than-the-original | archive-date = 2016-07-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a 99% "Certified Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 66 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "While ''Alien'' was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, ''Aliens'' packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver."&lt;ref name="Aliens reviews"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Aliens''|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000617_aliens|accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds a score of 84 out of 100 based on 22 critics on [[Metacritic]], indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Aliens'' Reviews, Ratings, and More...|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/aliens|accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aliens'' was also featured in Empire Magazine's 500 Greatest films of All Time poll at #30 in 2008, in Empire's 301 Greatest Films of All Time poll at #19 in 2014 and in Empire's recent 100 Greatest films of All Time poll at #15.

==Cultural impact==

===Interpretation and analysis===
Philosopher [[Stephen Mulhall]] has remarked that the four ''Alien'' films represent an artistic rendering of the difficulties faced by the woman's "voice" to have itself heard in a masculinist society because Ripley continually encounters males who try to silence her and to force her to submit to their desires. Mulhall sees this depicted in several events in ''Aliens'', particularly the inquest scene in which Ripley's explanation for the deaths and destruction of the ''Nostromo'' as well as her attempts to warn the board members of the Alien danger are met with officious disdain. However, Mulhall believes that Ripley's relationship with Hicks illustrates that ''Aliens'' "is devoted&amp;nbsp;… to the possibility of modes of masculinity that seek not to stifle but rather to accommodate the female voice, and modes of femininity that can acknowledge and incorporate something more or other of masculinity than our worst nightmares of it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Mulhall]], "In Space, No-One Can Hear You Scream: Acknowledging the Human Voice in the Alien Universe," in ''Film as Philosophy: Essays on Cinema After Wittgenstein and Cavell'', editors Read, Rupert and Jerry Goodenough; [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2005, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Several movie academics, including [[Barbara Creed]], have remarked on the color and lighting symbolism in the ''Alien'' franchise, which offsets white, strongly lit environments (spaceships, corporate offices) against darker, dirtier, "corrupted" settings (derelict alien ship, abandoned industrial facilities). These black touches contrast or even attempt to take over the purity of the white elements.&lt;ref&gt;''Alien and the Monstrous-Feminine'' – Creed, Barbara; from ''Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema'', Editor Kuhn, Annette; [[Verso Books|Verso]], 1990, Page 129&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Kile M. Ortigo of [[Emory University]], agree with this interpretation and point to the ''Sulaco'' with its "sterilized, white interior" as representing this element in the second film of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art17-alienresurrection.html Ripley and Alien] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825060245/http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art17-alienresurrection.html |date=August 25, 2012 }}'' – Ortigo, Kile M. in ''"I'm a Stranger Here Myself": Forced Individuation in Alien Resurrection'', Department of Psychology, [[Emory University]], Georgia, United States. Accessed 2008-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some claim that the shape of the ''Sulaco'' was based on a submarine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starshipmodeler.com/tech/othr_ref.htm Alien&lt;nowiki&gt;[s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] (from the 'starshipmodeler.com' website. Accessed 2008-05-20.)&lt;/ref&gt; the design has most often been described as a "gun in space" resembling the rifles used in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/05/16/syd-meads-sulaco-shi.html Syd Mead's "Sulaco" ship from Aliens just a big gun] ''[[Boing Boing]]'' Accessed 2008-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Roz Kaveney called the opening shot of the ship traveling through space "fetishistic" and "shark-like", "an image of brutal strength and ingenious efficiency"—while the militarized interior of the ''Sulaco'' (designed by [[Ron Cobb]]) is contrasted to the organic interior of the ''Nostromo'' in the first movie (also designed by Cobb).&lt;ref&gt;''Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film'' – Kaveney, Roz; [[I.B. Tauris]], 2005, Page 159&lt;/ref&gt; David McIntee noted the [[Homage (arts)|homage]] the scene pays to the opening tour through the ''Nostromo'' in ''Alien''.&lt;ref&gt;''Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorized Guide to the Alien and Predator Movies'' – McIntee, David; [[Telos Publishing]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Luckhurst]] in his 2014 book on the original ''Alien'' film, compared its underlying worldview to that of ''Aliens'' stating, "Even if ''Alien'' was a piece of leftist science fiction, the core of (its) myth could be inflected the other way. James Cameron's ''Aliens'' would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story—pumped, militarized, libertarian and driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family."&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger (2014). ''BFI Classics: Alien''. Palgrave MacMillan. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The android character [[Bishop (Alien)|Bishop]] has been the subject of literary and philosophical analysis as a high-profile fictional android conforming to [[science fiction]] author [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]] and as a model of a compliant, potentially self-aware machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=G|last=Buttazzo|date=May 2000|title=Can a Machine Ever Become Self-Aware?|booktitle=Artificial Humans, an historical retrospective of the Berlin International Film Festival 2000|editor=R.

|accessdate=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His portrayal has been studied by writers for the [[University of Texas Press]] for its implications relating to how humans deal with the presence of an "Other",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|authorlink=|title=The Mulatto Cyborg: Imagining a Multiracial Future

===Merchandise===
In 2013, [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA) released the first wave of highly detailed human and alien action figures from the respective film. NECA's Reel Toys worked directly with actors from the Alien franchise to release realistic figures based on select characters they portrayed in the films. NECA has released seven-inch figures based on characters such as Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson, and Bishop. During winter 2014, it was announced there would be multiple figures of Ripley, Sigourney Weaver's character from the ''Alien'' films. NECA worked directly with Weaver to develop these action figures, which are the first to feature her likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2012/12/toy-news-for-12122012-neca-aliens.html|title=Stinny's Toy &amp; Action Figure News Network: Toy News for 12/12/2012 - NECA - Aliens - Series 1 - Hudson, Hicks &amp; Alien Warrior|first=John|last=Stinsman|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amate''' ({{lang-es|amate}} {{IPA-es|aˈmate|}} from {{lang-nah|āmatl}} {{IPA-nah|ˈaːmat͡ɬ|}}) is a type of bark [[paper]] that has been manufactured in [[Mexico]] since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|precontact times]]. It was used primarily to [[Maya codices|create codices]].

Amate paper was extensively produced and used for both communication, records, and ritual during the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]; however, after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], its production was mostly banned and replaced by European paper. Amate paper production never completely died, nor did the rituals associated with it. It remained strongest in the rugged, remote mountainous areas of northern [[Puebla]] and northern [[Veracruz]] states. Spiritual leaders in the small village of [[San Pablito, Puebla]] were described as producing paper with "magical" properties. Foreign academics began studying this ritual use of amate in the mid-20th century, and the [[Otomi people]] of the area began producing the paper commercially. Otomi craftspeople began selling it in cities such as [[Mexico City]], where the paper was revived by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] painters in [[Guerrero]] to create "new" indigenous craft, which was then promoted by the Mexican government.

Through this and other innovations, amate paper is one of the most widely available [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican indigenous handicrafts]], sold both nationally and abroad. Nahua paintings of the paper, which is also called "amate," receive the most attention, but Otomi paper makers have also received attention not only for the paper itself but for crafts made with it such as elaborate [[Papercutting|cut-outs]].

==History==
Amate [[paper]] has a long history. This history is not only because the raw materials for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted to the needs and restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.&lt;ref name="lopez808"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 8, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Hispanic period===

The development of paper in [[Mesoamerica]] parallels that of China and Egypt, which used rice and [[papyrus]] respectively.&lt;ref name="curativo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Papel amate, arte curativo |author= Lizeth Gómez De Anda  |url= http://www.razon.com.mx/spip.php?article29277 |newspaper= La Razón |location=Mexico City |date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amate paper, curative art }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly where or when [[papermaking]] began in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="lopez0207"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 2-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicontepec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=661 |title=El Papel Amate Entre los Nahuas de Chicontepec |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amate paper among the Nahuas of Chicontepec |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309150849/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=661 |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known amate paper dates back to 75 CE. It was discovered at the site of [[Huitzilapa]], Jalisco. Huitzilapa is a [[shaft tomb culture]] site located northwest of [[Tequila Volcano]] near the town of [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco|Magdalena]]. The crumpled piece of paper was found in the southern chamber of the site's shaft tomb, possibly associated with a male scribe. Rather than being produced from ''[[Trema micrantha]]'', from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from ''[[Ficus tecolutensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benz et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the [[Olmec]] site of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known surviving book made from amate paper may be the [[Grolier Codex]], which [[Michael D. Coe]] and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.&lt;ref name="newitz ars technica"&gt;Annalee Newitz (12 September 2016). "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/confirmed-mysterious-ancient-maya-book-grolier-codex-is-genuine/ Confirmed: Mysterious ancient Maya book, Grolier Codex, is genuine: 900 year-old astronomy guide is oldest known book written in the Americas]."

Arguments from the 1940s to the 1970s have centered on a time of 300 CE of the use of bark clothing by the Maya people. Ethnolinguistic studies lead to the names of two villages in Maya territory that relate the use of bark paper, Excachaché ("place where white bark trusses are smoothed") and Yokzachuún ("over the white paper"). Anthropologist Marion mentions that in [[Lacandones Region|Lacandones]], in [[Chiapas]], the Maya were still manufacturing and using bark clothing in the 1980s. For these reason, it was probably the Maya who first propagated knowledge about bark-paper-making and spread it throughout southern Mexico, [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], and [[El Salvador]], when it was at its height in the pre-classic period.&lt;ref name="lopez81"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="papiro"&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title= Amate y Papiro… un diálogo histórico |trans-title=Amate and Papyrus… a historic dialogue |journal= National Geographic en español |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |url= http://ngenespanol.com/2008/05/amate-y-papiro%E2%80%A6-un-dialogo-historico-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according researcher [[Hans Lenz]], this Maya paper was likely not the amate paper known in later Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; The [[Mayan language]] word for book is ''hun'' {{IPA-myn|hun|}}.&lt;ref name="boot" &gt;Boot, E. (2002). ''[http://www.mesoweb.com/resources/vocabulary/vocabulary.pdf A Preliminary Classic Maya-English / English-Classic Maya Vocabulary of Hieroglyphic Readings]''. Leiden University, the Netherlands. Retrieved September 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amate paper was used most extensively during the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] Empire.&lt;ref name="lopez80"&gt;López Binnqüist, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was manufactured in over 40 villages in territory controlled by the [[Aztecs]] and then handed over as tribute by the conquered peoples. This amounted to about 480,000 sheets annually. Most of the production was concentrated in the modern state of [[Morelos]], where [[Ficus]] trees are abundant because of the climate.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez90"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was assigned to the royal sector, to be used as gifts on special occasions or as rewards for warriors. It was also sent to the religious elites for ritual purposes. The last share was allotted to royal scribes for the writing of codices and other records.&lt;ref name="lopez89"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the paper's manufacture in the pre-Hispanic period. Stone beaters dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to macerate the fibers. These beaters are still used by [[Otomi people|Otomi]] artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers and pounded into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.&lt;ref name="lopez121122"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tribute item, amate was assigned to the royal sector because it was not considered to be a commodity. This paper was related to power and religion, the way through which the [[Aztec]]s imposed and justified their dominance in Mesoamerica. As tribute, it represented a transaction between the dominant groups and the dominated villages. In the second phase, the paper used by the royal authorities and priests for sacred and political purposes was a way to empower and frequently register all the other sumptuary exclusive things.&lt;ref name="lopez115"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Amate paper was created as part of a line of technologies to satisfy the human need to express and communicate. It was preceded by stone, clay and leather to transmit knowledge first in the form of pictures, and later with the [[Olmec]]s and Maya through a form of [[Maya script|hieroglyphic writing]].&lt;ref name="lopez81"/&gt; Bark paper had important advantages as it is easier to obtain than animal skins and was easier to work than other fibers. It could be bent, shirred, glued and melded for specific finishing touches and for decoration. Two more advantages stimulated the extensive use of bark paper: its light weight and its ease of transport, which translated into great savings in time, space and labor when compared with other raw materials.&lt;ref name="lopez83"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aztec era, paper retained its importance as a writing surface, especially in the production of chronicles and the keeping of records such as inventories and accounting. Codices were converted into "books" by folding into an accordion pattern. Of the approximately 500 surviving codices, about 16 date to before the conquest and are made of bark paper. These include the [[Dresden Codex]] from the Yucatán, the [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer Codex]] from the [[Mixteca]] region and the [[Borgia Codex]] from [[Oaxaca]].&lt;ref name="lopez84"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

However, paper also had a sacred aspect and was used in rituals along with other items such as incense, [[copal]], [[Agave americana|maguey]] thorns and rubber.&lt;ref name="lopez84"/&gt; For ceremonial and religious events, bark paper was used in various ways: as decorations used in fertility rituals, yiataztli, a kind of bag, and as an amatetéuitl, a badge used to symbolize a prisoner's soul after sacrifice. It was also used to dress idols, priests and sacrifice victims in forms of crowns, stoles, plumes, wigs, trusses and bracelets. Paper items such as flags, skeletons and very long papers, up to the length of a man, were used as offerings, often by burning them.&lt;ref name="lopez86"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Another important paper item for rituals was paper cut in the form of long flags or trapezoids and painted with black rubber spots to depict the characteristic of the god being honored. At a certain time of year, these were also used to ask for rain. At this time, the papers were colored blue with plumage at the spearhead.&lt;ref name="lopez87"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period to 20th century===
When the Spanish arrived, they noted the production of codices and paper, which was also made from maguey and palm fibers as well as bark. It was specifically noted by Pedro Mártir de Anglería.&lt;ref name="lopez82"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], indigenous paper, especially bark paper lost its value as a tribute item not only because the Spanish preferred European paper but also because bark paper's connection to indigenous religion caused it to be banned.&lt;ref name="lopez90"/&gt; The justification for the banning of amate was that it was used for magic and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; This was part of the Spaniard's efforts to mass convert the indigenous to Catholicism, which included the mass burning of codices, which contained most of the native history as well as cultural and natural knowledge.&lt;ref name=lopez80/&gt;

Only 16 of 500 surviving codices were written before the Conquest. The other, post-conquest books were written on bark paper although a few were written on European paper, cotton, or animal hides. They were largely the work of missionaries, such as [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], who were interested in recording the history and knowledge of the indigenous people. Some of the important codices of this type include [[Codex Sierra]], [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis|Codex La Cruz Badiano]] and [[Codex Florentino]]. The [[Codex Mendoza|Codex Mendocino]] was commissioned by viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza]] in 1525 to learn about the tribute system and other indigenous practices to be adapted to Spanish rule. However, it is on European paper.&lt;ref name="lopez9192"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bark paper was banned, it did not completely disappear. In the early colonial period, there was a shortage of European paper, which made it necessary to use the indigenous version on occasion.&lt;ref name="lopez9192"/&gt; During the evangelization process, amate, along with a paste made from corn canes was appropriated by missionaries to create Christian images, mostly in the 16th and 17th century.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tierra"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-papel-de-la-tierra-en-el-tiempo.html |author=Beatriz M. Oliver Vega |title= El papel de la tierra en el tiempo |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title="Earth" paper over time |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, among the indigenous, paper continued to be made clandestinely for ritual purposes. In 1569, friar Diego de Mendoza observed several indigenous carrying offerings of paper, copal and woven mats to the lakes inside the [[Nevado de Toluca]] volcano as offerings.&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt; The most successful at keeping paper making traditions alive were certain indigenous groups living in the [[La Huasteca]], [[Ixhuatlán del Café, Veracruz|Ixhuatlán]] and [[Chicontepec de Tejada|Chicontepec]] in the north of Veracruz and some villages in Hidalgo. The only records of bark paper making after the early 1800s refer to these areas.&lt;ref name="lopez80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez9394"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these areas are dominated by the Otomi and the area's ruggedness and isolation from central Spanish authority allowed small villages to keep small quantities of paper in production. In fact, this clandestine nature helped it to survive as a way to defy Spanish culture and reaffirm identity.&lt;ref name="lopez115"/&gt;

===Latter 20th century to the present===
[[File:Aztec calendar on Amate.jpg|thumb|The [[Aztec calendar stone]] painted on amate]]
[[File:CitlalliArreguinGarros02.jpg|thumb|Painting on amate by Citlalli Arreguín in an exhibit at [[Garros Galería]], Mexico City]]
By the mid-20th century, the knowledge of making amate paper was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez94"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla as many of the villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals.&lt;ref name="lopez9497"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 94-97&lt;/ref&gt; The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the [[shaman]]s, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used for cutting gods and other figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture.&lt;ref name="lopez104"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of amate paper was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing amate paper in rituals.&lt;ref name="lopez103115105"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 103, 115, 105&lt;/ref&gt; One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the commercial value of the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts.&lt;ref name="lopez104"/&gt;

What the sale of these figures did was to make the bark paper a commodity. The paper was not sacred until and unless a shaman cut it as part of a ritual. The making of the paper and non ritualistic cutting did not interfere with the ritual aspects of paper in general. This allowed a product formerly reserved only for ritual to become something with market value as well. It also allowed the making of paper to become open to the population of San Pablito and not only to shamans.&lt;ref name="lopez10311580"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 103, 115, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most amate paper is sold as the backing for paintings made by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] artists from [[Guerrero]] state. There are various stories as to how painting on bark paper came about but they are divided between whether it was a Nahua or an Otomi idea. However, it is known that both Nahua and Otomi sold crafts at the Bazar del Sábado in [[San Ángel]] in [[Mexico City]] in the 1960s. The Otomi were selling paper and other crafts and the Nahua were selling their traditionally painted pottery.&lt;ref name="lopez106"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"&gt;{{cite news |title= A punto de extinguirse, el árbol del amate en San Pablito Pahuatlán: Libertad Mora |author= Tania Damián Jiménez |url= http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2010/10/13/puebla/eco304.ph|newspaper= La Jornada del Orienta |location=Puebla |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A the point of extinction:the amate árbol in San Pablio Pahuatlán:Libertad Mora }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahua transferred many of their pottery painting designs onto amate paper, which is easier to transport and sell.&lt;ref name="lopez105"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahua called the paintings by their word for bark paper, which is "amatl." Today, the word is applied to all crafts which use the paper. The new painting form found great demand from the start, and at first, the Nahua would buy almost all of the Otomi's paper production. Painting on bark paper quickly spread to various villages in Guerrero and by the end of the 1960s, became the most important economic activity in eight Nahua villages [[Ameyaltepec]], [[Oapan]], [[Ahuahuapan]], [[Ahuelican]], [[Analco]], [[San Juan Tetelcingo]], [[Xalitla]] and [[Maxela]]. (page 106)  Each Nahua village has its own painting styles developed from the tradition of painting ceramics, and this allowed works to be classified.&lt;ref name="lopez105" /&gt;

The rise of amate paper occurred during a time when government policies towards rural indigenous people and their crafts were changing, with the latter being encourage especially to help develop the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="lopez106"/&gt; [[FONART]] became part of the consolidation of distribution efforts for amate paper.  Much of this involved buying all of the Otomi production of bark paper to ensure that the Nahua would have sufficient supplies. Although this intervention lasted for only about two years, it was crucial for developing sales of amate crafts in national and international markets.&lt;ref name="lopez107"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, while the Nahua are still the principle buyers of Otomi amate paper, the Otomi have since branched out into different types of paper and have developed some of their own products to sell. Today, amate paper is one of the most widely distributed Mexican handcrafts nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; It has received artistic and academic attention at both levels as well. In 2006, an annual event called the Encuentro de Arte in Papel Amate was begun in the village, which includes events such as processions, [[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Voladors]], [[Huapango]] music and more. The main event is the exhibition of works by various artists such as [[Francisco Toledo]], Sergio Hernández, Gabriel Macotela, Gustavo MOnrroy, Cecilio Sánchez, Nicolás de Jesús, David Correa, Héctor Montiel, José Montiel, Laura Montiel, Santiago Regalado Juan Manuel de la Rosa, Ester González, Alejandra Palma Padilla, Nicéforo Hurbieta Moreles, Jorge Lozano and Alfonso García Tellez.&lt;ref name="pahuatlan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Pahuatlán: Una historia en papel amate  |author= Ernesto Romero   |url=http://www.periodicodigital.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14283&amp;Itemid=67  |newspaper= Periodico Digital |location=Puebla |date=April 13, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pahuatlán:history in amate paper }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular]] and the Egyptian embassy in Mexico held an exhibition in 2008 on amate and [[papyrus]] with over sixty objects on display comparing the two ancient traditions.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; One of the most noted artists in the medium is shaman Alfonso Margarito García Téllez, who has exhibited his work in museums such as the [[San Pedro Museo de Arte]] in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name="exhiben"&gt;{{cite news |title= Exhiben el uso curativo del papel amate en el pueblo de San Pablito Pahuatlán |author= Paula Carrizosa |url= http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2010/12/06/puebla/cul212.php |newspaper= El Sur de Acapulco |location=Acapulco |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Pablito==
While amate is made in a few small villages in northern Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo state]], only [[San Pablito, Puebla|San Pablito in Puebla]] manufactures the paper commercially.&lt;ref name="lopez0207"/&gt; San Pablito is a village in the municipality of [[Pahuatlán]] located in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]]. [[Tulancingo]], Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself is on the side of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo.&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt; The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt; The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work.&lt;ref name="lopez148"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt; The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez10"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper making has not only brought money into the Otomi population of the community but political clout as well. It is now the most important community economically in the municipality of Pahuatlán, and the last three municipal governments have been headed by an Otomi, which had not happened before.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez9"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the paper making is done by women. One reason for this is that many men still migrate out of the community to work, mostly to the United States. These two sources of income are combined in many households in San Pablito.&lt;ref name="lopez105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez146"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic problems of the late 2000s cut sales by about half forcing more to migrate out for work. Before the crisis, the inhabitants of the village were making two thousand sheets per day.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

==Ritual use==
While the paper has been commercialized in San Pablito, it has not lost its ritual character here or in other areas such as [[Texcatepec]] and [[Chicontepec de Tejada|Chicontepec]], where it is still made for ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; In these communities, the making and ritual use of paper is similar. Figures are cut from light or dark paper, which each figure and each color having significance. There are two types of paper. Light or white paper is used for images of gods or humans. Dark paper is connected with evil characters or sorcery.&lt;ref name="lopez99101"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 99–101&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicontepec, the light paper is made from [[mulberry]] trees, and the dark paper is made from classic amate or fig trees. The older the tree the darker the paper.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;

Ritual paper acquires a sacred value only when [[shaman]]s cut it ritually.&lt;ref name="lopez116"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 116&lt;/ref&gt; The cutting technique is most important, not necessarily artistic although many have aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; In San Pablito, the cut outs are of gods or supernatural beings related to the indigenous worldview, but never of Catholic figures. Most of the time, the cut out ceremonies relate to petitions such as good crops and health, although as agriculture declines in importance economically, petitions for health and protection have become more important. One particularly popular ceremony is related to young men who have returned from working abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez99101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez116"/&gt; In Chicontepec, there are cut outs related to gods or spirits linked to natural phenomena such as lightning, rain, mountains, mangos seeds and more, with those cut from dark paper called "devils" or represent evil spirits. However, figures can also represent people living or dead.  Those made of light paper represent good spirits and people who make promises. Female figures are distinguished by locks of hair. Some figures have four arms and two heads in profile, and other have the head and tail of an animal. Those with shoes represent mestizos or bad people who have died in fights, accidents or by drowning, also women who have died in childbirth or children who disrespect their parents. Those without shoes represent indigenous people or good people who have died in sickness or old age. Bad spirits represented in dark paper are burned ceremoniously in order to end their bad influence. Those in light paper are kept as [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;

The origin of the use of these cut outs is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] invention, after the Spanish destroyed all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs.&lt;ref name="lopez101102"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These cut outs are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made in order to keep the ritual aspect separate.&lt;ref name="lopez116"/&gt;

In San Pablito, the making and cutting of paper is not restricted to shamans, as the rest of the villagers may engage in this. However, only shamans may do paper cutting rituals and the exact techniques of paper making is guarded by the residents of the village from outsiders.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; The best known shaman related to cut out ritual is Alfonso García Téllez of San Pablito.&lt;ref name="curativo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tributo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166 |title= Tributo a las deidades |first= Luis Alberto |last= Martínez Álvarez |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=State of Puebla |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tribute to the gods |accessdate=April 15, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521160510/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166| archivedate= 21 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly states that the cutting rituals are not witchcraft, but rather a way to honor the spirits of the natural world and a way to help those who have died, along with their families.&lt;ref name="exhiben"/&gt;  García Téllez also creates cut out books about the various Otomi deities, which he has not only sold but also exhibited at museums such as the [[San Pedro Museo de Arte]] in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name="exhiben"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tributo"/&gt;

==Amate products==
[[File:AmatePaperCutOutMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Otomi amate paper cut out on display at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]]
While amate paper is one of a number of paper crafts of Mexico, along with [[papel picado]], [[papier-mâché]]  (such as Judas figures, [[alebrije]]s or decorative items such as strands of [[chili pepper]]s called [[ristra]]s). However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="lopez808"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bercovitch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2621-the-mexican-art-forms-of-ristras-papel-amate-and-papel-picado |title= The Mexican art forms of ristras, papel amate and papel picado |author=Helen Bercovitch |date=June 2001 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican handcraft]] designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both [[Otomi people|Otomi]] artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers.&lt;ref name="lopez827111"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 80, 2-7, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers.  Although the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] people of [[Guerrero]] remain the principal buyers of Otomi paper,&lt;ref name="lopez135"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; other wholesale buyers  have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks,  furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and  more.&lt;ref name="lopez1710111114"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 2-7,10,111, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, standard quality and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.&lt;ref name="lopez111142"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 111, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The Otomi paper makers generally sell their production to a limited number of wholesalers, because of limited Spanish skills and contact with the outside. This means about ten wholesalers controlling the distribution of about half of all Otomi production.&lt;ref name="lopez135"/&gt; These wholesalers, as well as artisans such as the Nahua who use the paper as the basis of their own work, have many more contacts and as a result, retail sales of the product are wide-ranging and varied both within Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez10"/&gt; Amate paper products are still sold on the streets and markets in Mexico, much as commercialization of the produce began in the 20th century, often in venues that cater to tourists.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt; However, through wholesalers, the paper also ends up in handicraft stores, open bazaars, specialty shops and the Internet. Much of it is used to create paintings, and the finest of these have been exhibited in both national and international museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez10"/&gt; The paper is sold retail in the town to tourists as well as in shops in cities such as [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], [[Tijuana]], Mexico City, [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]], [[Monterrey]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. It is also exported to the United States, especially to [[Miami]].&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

However, about fifty percent of all Otomi paper production is still done in standard 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm size and sold to Nahua painters from Guerrero, the market segment which made the mass commercialization of the product possible.&lt;ref name="lopez111135142"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 111, 135, 142 105&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy percent of all the craft production of these Otomi and Nahuas is sold on the national market with about thirty percent reaching the international market.&lt;ref name="lopez142"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; As most amate paper is sold as the backing for these paintings, so many consumers assume the Nahua produce the paper as well.&lt;ref name="lopez112"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The amate paper paintings are a combination of Nahua and Otomi traditions. The Otomi produce the paper, and the Nahua have transferred and adapted painting traditions associated with ceramics  to the paper. The [[Nahuatl]] word "amate" is applied to both the paper and the paintings done on the paper. Each Nahua village has its own painting style  which was developed for ceramics, originally commercialized in [[Acapulco]] and other tourist areas as early as the 1940s. The adaption of this painting to amate paper came in the 1960s and quickly spread to various villages until it became the primary economic activity in eight Nahua villages in Guerrero, Ameyaltepec, Oapan, Ahuahuapan, Ahuelican, Analco, San Juan Tetelcingo, Xalitla and Maxela.&lt;ref name="lopez105106"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is that it evokes Mexico's pre-Columbian past in addition to the customary designs painted on it.&lt;ref name="lopez109"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of these paintings led to the Nahuas buying just about all of the Otomis' paper production in that decade. It also attracted the attention of the government, which was taking an interest in indigenous crafts and promoting them to tourists. The FONART agency became involved for two years, buying Otomi paper to make sure that the Nahua had sufficient supplies for painting. This was crucial for the development of national and international markets for the paintings and the paper.&lt;ref name="lopez105106"/&gt; It also worked to validate the "new" craft as legitimate, using symbols of past and present minority peoples as part of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="lopez109"/&gt;

The paintings started with and still mostly based on traditional designs from pottery although there has been innovation since then. Painted designs began focusing on birds and flowers on the paper. Experimentation led to landscape painting, especially scenes related to rural life such as farming, fishing, weddings, funerals and religious festivals. It even has included the painting of picture frames.&lt;ref name="lopez110"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; Some painters have become famous in their own right for their work. Painter [[Nicolás de Jesús]], from Ameyaltepec has gained international recognition for his paintings, exhibiting abroad in countries such as France, Germany, England and Italy. His works generally touch on themes such as death, oppression of indigenous peoples and various references to popular culture in his local community.&lt;ref name="rosado"&gt;{{cite news |title= El arte en amate, tradición olmeca que continúan indígenas de Guerrero y Puebla |author= Xavier Rosado |url= http://www.suracapulco.com.mx/anterior/2002/diciembre/03/pag2.htm |newspaper= El Sur de Acapulco |location=Acapulco |date=December 3, 2002 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art in amate, Olmec tradition that the indigenous of Guerrero and Puebla continue }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have innovated ways to speed up the work, such as using [[silk-screen]] techniques to make multiple copies.&lt;ref name="lopez125"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nahua paintings remain the most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate cut out figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature cut outs of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; The Otomi still sell cut outs in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper.&lt;ref name="lopez112" /&gt; These cut outs include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these cut outs are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and cut outs of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] hearts with painted flowers. Most cut outs are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting.&lt;ref name="lopez113"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far north and south of Mexico and even from abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez138"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period.&lt;ref name="lopez123124"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig ([[Ficus]]) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are considered sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper.&lt;ref name="lopez9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floema"&gt;{{Cite report |title=El uso del floema secundario en la elaboración de papel amate |url=http://www.izt.uam.mx/contactos/n69ne/papel.pdf |author=Alejandro Quintanar-Isáis |author2=Citlalli López Binnqüist |author3=Marie Vander Meeren |year=2008 |publisher=1Depto. de Biolog´ıa, UAM-I, Centro de Investigaciones Tropicales, Universidad Veracruzana, Instituto Nacional de Antropolog´ıa e Historia |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |docket= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522171508/http://www.izt.uam.mx/contactos/n69ne/papel.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary species used include ''[[Ficus cotinifolia|F. cotinifolia]],'' ''[[Ficus padifolia|F. padifolia]]'' and ''[[Ficus petiolaris|F. petiolaris]]'', the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as [[Morus celtidifolia]], Citrus [[anurantifolia]] and [[Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose]].&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt; However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez17"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well.&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark.&lt;ref name="lopez123"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 123&lt;/ref&gt; These bark collectors generally come to the village at the end of the week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors.&lt;ref name="lopez8"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.&lt;ref name="lopez125"/&gt;

From the beginning of commercialization, the making of a paper brought in most of the village's population into the process in one way or another. However, in the 1980s, many men in the area began to leave as migrant workers, mostly to the United States, sending remittances home. This then became the main source of income to San Pablito, and made paper making not only secondary, but mostly done by women.&lt;ref name="lopez123125"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 123,125&lt;/ref&gt; The basic equipment used are stones to beat the fibers, wooden boards and pans to boil the bark. All of these come from sources outside San Pablito. The stones come from [[Tlaxcala]]. The boards come from two nearby villages of Zoyotla and Honey and the boiling pans are obtained by local hardware stores from [[Tulancingo]].&lt;ref name="lopez130"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre Hispanic period, the bark was first soaked for a day or more to soften it before it was worked. An innovation documented from at least the 20th century is to boil the bark instead, which is faster. To shorten the boiling time, ashes or [[lime (material)|lime]] were introduced into the water, later replaced by industrial [[caustic soda]]. With the last ingredient, the actual boiling time is between three and six hours, although with set up the process takes anywhere from half to a full day. It can only be done during certain weather conditions (dry days) and it requires constant attention. The amount boiled at one time ranges from 60 to 90&amp;nbsp;kg with 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg of caustic soda. The bark needs to be stirred constantly. After boiling, the bark is then rinsed in clean water.&lt;ref name="lopez124125"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

The softened fibers are kept in water until they are processed. This needs to be done as quickly as possible so that they do not rot.&lt;ref name="lopez124127"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, [[chlorine]] bleach may be added to either lighten the paper entirely or to create a mix of shades to create a marbled effect. This step has become necessary due to the lack of naturally light bark fibers.&lt;ref name="lopez126"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; If the paper is to be colored, strong industrial dyes are used. These can vary from purple, red, green or pink, whatever the demand is.&lt;ref name="lopez127"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden boards are sized to the paper being made. They are rubbed with soap so that the fibers do not stick. The fibers are arranged on wooden boards and beaten together into a thin flat mass. The best paper is made with long fibers arranged in a grid pattern to fit the board. Lesser quality paper is made from short masses arranged more haphazardly, but still beaten to the same effect.&lt;ref name="lopez8124127"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 8, 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt; This maceration process liberates soluble carbohydrates that are in the cavities of the cell fibers and act as a kind of glue. The Ficus tree bark contains a high quantity of this substance allowing to make for firm  but flexible paper.&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; During the process, the stones are kept moist to keep the paper from sticking to it. The finished flat mass is then usually smoothed over with rounded orange peels. If there are any gaps after the maceration process, these are usually filled in by gluing small pieces of paper.&lt;ref name="lopez12129"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 12, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining on their boards, the pounded sheets are taken outside to dry. Drying times vary due to weather conditions. On dry and sunny days, this can take an hour or two, but in humid conditions it can take days.&lt;ref name="lopez124128"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124, 128&lt;/ref&gt; If the dried sheets are to be sold wholesale, they are then simply bundled. If to be sold retail, the edges are then trimmed with a blade.&lt;ref name="lopez129"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The production process in San Pablito  has mostly evolved to make paper as quickly as possible, with labor being divided and specialized and new tools and ingredients added towards this end.&lt;ref name="lopez117"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all production facilities are family based, but the level of organization varies. Most paper making is done inside the home by those who are dedicated to it either full or part-time.  If the paper is made only part-time, then the work is done sporadically and usually only by women and children. A more recent phenomenon is the development of large workshops which hire artisans to do the work, supervised by the family which owns the enterprise. These are often established by families who have invested money sent home by migrant worker into materials and equipment.&lt;ref name="lopez131132"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the production of all these facilities is plain sheet of 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm, but the larger workshops make the greatest variety of products including giant sheets of 1.2 by 2.4 meters in size.&lt;ref name="lopez129132"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 129,132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological concerns ==
The commercialization of amate paper has had negative environmental effects. In pre-Hispanic times, bark was taken only from the branches of adult trees, allowing for regeneration.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; [[Ficus]] trees should be optimally no younger than 25 years old before cutting. At that age the bark almost peels off by itself and does less damage to the tree. Other trees such as mulberry do not have to mature as much.&lt;ref name="rosado"/&gt;  The pressure to provide large quantities of bark means that it is taken from younger trees as well.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; This is negatively affecting the ecosystem of northern Puebla and forcing harvesters to take bark from other species as well as from a wider range, moving into areas such as [[Tlaxco Municipality, Puebla|Tlaxco]].&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuevatec"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Nueva tecnología, garantiza producción sustentable de Papel Amate en la Sierra Norte de Puebla |publisher=[[FONART]] |date=April 6, 2011 |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=142 |language=Spanish |trans-title=New technology guarantees sustainable production of Amate paper in the Sierra Norte de Puebla |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the introduction of caustic soda and other industrial chemicals into the process, which not only gets into the environment and water supply, can also directly poison artisans who do not handle it properly.&lt;ref name="nuevatec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113:produccion-sustentable-de-papel-amate&amp;catid=37:noticias-de-portada&amp;Itemid=113 |title= Investigación interinstitucional garantiza producción sustentable de papel amate |year=2010 |publisher=[[FONART]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Inter-institutional research guarantees sustainable production of amate paper |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías]] (FONART), the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]]-Iztapalapa, the [[Universidad Veracruzana]] and the [[Instituto de Artesanías e Industrias Populares]] de Puebla have been working on ways to make amate paper making more sustainable. One aspect is to manage the collection of bark. Another is to find a substitute for caustic soda to soften and prepare the fibers without losing quality. Not only is the soda polluting, it has had negative effects on artisans' health. As of 2010, the group has reported advances in its investigations such as ways of including new types of bark from other species.&lt;ref name="nuevatec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avanza"&gt;{{cite news |title= Avanza producción sustentable de papel amate en San Pablito |author= Ángel A.

In addition, the [[Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología Social]] (CIESAS) is urging a reforestation plan in order to implement a more sustainable supply of bark.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

[[Image:American Progress (John Gast painting).jpg|300px|thumb|''American Progress'' (1872)]]
'''''American Progress''''' is an 1872 painting by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]], a [[Prussia|Prussian]]-born painter, printer, and [[lithography|lithographer]] who lived and worked most of his life in [[Brooklyn]], New York. ''American Progress'', an allegory of [[Manifest Destiny]], was widely disseminated in chromolithographic prints. It is now held by the [[Autry Museum of the American West]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.theautry.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=M545330;type=101 Museum website entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than he painted ''American Progress'', and that he was born December 21, 1842, in [[Berlin]], and died July 26, 1896, in Brooklyn,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in the ''Brooklyn Eagle'', July 27, 1896, p. 7, c. 2&lt;/ref&gt; little else is known about Gast's life.

== Description ==
''American Progress'' has become a seminal example of American Western art. The painting serves as an allegory for the Manifest Destiny and American [[westward expansion]]. The 12.75 by 16.75 inch painting was commissioned in 1872 by George Crofutt, a publisher of American Western travel guides, and has been frequently reproduced. The woman in the center is called "Progress", and on her head is what Crofutt calls "The Star of the Empire". Progress moves from the light-skied east to the dark and treacherous West, leading white settlers who follow her either on foot or by [[stagecoach]], horseback, [[conestoga wagon]], [[wagon train]], or riding [[steam train]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/97507547/|title=American Progress|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress lays a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] wire with one hand and carries a school book in the other. As she moves westward, indigenous people and a herd of [[American Bison|buffalo]] are seen fleeing her and the settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://picturinghistory.gc.cuny.edu/john-gast-american-progress-1872/|title=John Gast, American Progress, 1872|last=Sandweiss|first=Martha A.|date=|website=|access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Progress'' visually portrays the process of American westward expansion. The figure of Progress is ushering an era of modernization, development, and advancement to the West, which in the painting is portrayed as a dark and savage place, especially when compared to the eastern side of the painting. But, with the ushering in of these developments, the indigenous people living in the West and their way of life is cast out.

The extent can deviate to customs in a certain school of art, directives of the assigner, etc.&lt;ref name="Rosen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Rosen|title=Freedom and the Arts: Essays on Music and Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1SjAx7tY8IC|date=4 April 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06549-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gover2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

''Artistic freedom'' should not be confused to the ''freedom of art'' (e.g. ''[[:de:Kunstfreiheit|Kunstfreiheit]]'' in Germanic countries), where it is a constitutional provision to prevent political [[censorship]].&lt;ref name="Barendt2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Barendt|title=Academic Freedom and the Law: A Comparative Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBLcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=19 November 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84731-610-3|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barendt2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Barendt|title=Freedom of Speech|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnRCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR6-IA30|date=11 August 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102174-9|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A related colloquial term is ''[[artistic license]]'', the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of grammar or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an artist for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Peacock1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry W.

In [[theatre lighting]], a '''bastard color''' is a color, typically in a [[color gel]], wherein the predominant color is blended with small amounts of complementary colors; for example, a "bastard orange" gel would produce predominantly [[orange (color)|orange]] light with undertones of [[blue (color)|blue]]. Bastard colors appear warmer and more natural than pure colors and are used to replicate [[Sunlight|natural light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnta.com/lighting/gels/e-colour-004-med-bastard-amber/ |title=Rosco E-Colour #004: Medium Bastard Amber |accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''bbodance''', formerly the '''British Ballet Organization''' ('''BBO'''), is a dance [[examination board]] based in London, England.

== Overview ==
Formerly known as the British Ballet Organization, bbodance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Jessica |url=http://blog.dancedirect.com/2016/05/31/new-bbodance/ |title=The new bbodance - Dance Direct Blog |publisher=Blog.dancedirect.com |date=2016-05-31 |accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in England in 1930 by [[Edouard Espinosa]] and [[Eve Louise Kelland]], both noted dance teachers.  It was established as a dance teaching society and developed a syllabus of Classical Ballet training.  The BBO is now one of the leading dance examination boards in the United Kingdom and provides an examination syllabus in [[classical ballet]], [[Tap dance|tap]], [[Jazz dance|jazz]] and [[modern dance]], with a teacher training programme that qualifies people to work as dance teachers in the private and state sectors.  The BBO is a registered dance awarding body of the Council for Dance Education and Training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdet.org.uk/professional.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050206063644/http://www.cdet.org.uk/professional.php |archivedate=6 February 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its qualifications are accredited by the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] in England, the [[Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills]] (DCELLS) in Wales, and the [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment]] (CCEA) in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/files/BBO_Final_PAM_Report.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Nunn]] and [[William Trevitt (dancer)|William Trevitt]], [[BalletBoyz]] founders, became new artistic directors of the British Ballet Organization, at the time when the company went through a major rebrand in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hemley |first=Matthew |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/michael-nunn-and-william-trevitt-to-modernise-rebranded-british-ballet-organisation/ |title=Michael Nunn and William Trevitt to modernise rebranded BBO |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date=2016-05-09 |accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BlockedLaceScarf.JPG|thumb|knitted scarf during blocking]]
In [[knitting]], [[crochet]] and other [[textile arts]], '''blocking''' is a final stage of handmade textile production that adjusts the shape of the finished piece. Not all pieces need blocking; however, blocking is standard for [[lace]] work and is not uncommon in sweaters, socks, and other solid projects. Through [[heat]] and [[moisture]], blocking sets the [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es and standardizes the final dimensions, and may enhance the drape.&lt;ref&gt;Edie Eckman, ''The Crochet Answer Book'', North Adams, Massachusetts: Storey Publishing, 2005, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hand manufacture places natural stresses on fabrics that may result in deviations from its intended shape and size.  Blocking is only effective on natural fibres&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Stoller, ''Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker'' New York: Workman Publishing, 2006, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; but a technique called [[#.22Killing.22|"killing"]] may be used on synthetic fibres to achieve an effect similar to blocking.

The degree of malleability is determined by the type of [[yarn]] used, with [[wool]] providing the most flexibility.  For projects that are produced in sections, blocking is normally done prior to final assembly.

==Blocking methods==

[[File:Lace knitting 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Unblocked lace stole still on the needles. This item will expand significantly after pinning and blocking.]]Blocking can be done in several different ways.  Depending on the method, the crafter may use rustproof [[pin]]s, blocking wires, a steamer, or a [[steam iron]].  A stable flat surface and [[towel]]s are standard.  Fibres that tolerate water well may be wet blocked, shaping moist fabric into the desired shape and then allowing it to air dry.  Cold blocking uses no heat and less water to achieve the same result by spraying water upon the material instead of immersing the fabric.  Steam blocking uses a steamer or steam iron, but without applying direct pressure to the item.&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wet blocking ===

Wet blocking is done by saturating a garment in warm water and allowing it to dry. Some items (especially lace) are stretched while wet with the use of pins and/or blocking wires, while others may be gently shaped without stretching.

=== Steam blocking ===

Steam blocking is done by hovering a hot, steaming iron over the fabric. Hovering the iron about 1 or 2 inches above the fabric flattens the stitch, makes it thinner, and allows it to hold its shape better.  This is the only method that works for blocking synthetics, like acrylic.

=== Spritz blocking ===

Spritz blocking involves spraying the garment with water. This relaxes the fibres more than steam blocking but less than wet blocking. Most often, a spray bottle is used.

=== "Killing" ===
It is possible to "set" synthetic fibres through a process known as "killing", wherein the item is pinned in place and carefully steamed to achieve a very slight controlled melt of the fibres. "Killed" fabrics are permanently set and cannot be returned to their original form through washing.

'''The Botanical garden of Thutmose III''' ({{lang-fr|Jardin botanique de Thoutmôsis III}}) is an artistic representation of [[fauna]] and especially [[flora]] during the [[Egyptian empire]] at its peak. The remarkably detailed reliefs are located on the walls of the room next to the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]], in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], [[Karnak]].&lt;ref name="Ratié1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratié|first=Suzanne|title=La reine Hatchepsout: sources et problèmes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWxZpn63tdMC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1979|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-06064-7|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; On land at the rear of the shrine, the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] built the Festival Hall of Thutmose III, also known as the ''Akh-menu''. The walls were then used by royal artists who, by order of the [[pharaoh]], engraved in stone some of the most beautiful pastoral representations of Egypt.

Thutmose III, the great warrior pharaoh who expanded the boundaries of Egypt in the north and the south, collected a considerable collection of rare species of animals and lush plants. His animals and botanical collection are found engraved on the walls of the sanctuary. Through the royal artists, the pharaoh boasts of the scenic beauty, the lush flora and rich fauna he discovered during his victorious campaigns against Asiatics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5352">'''Concepción Méndez Cuesta''' (Madrid, 27 July 1898 – Coyoacán, Mexico, 7 December 1986) was a leading [[Spain|Spanish]] poet and dramatist and member of the [[Generation of '27]] who became known in the literary world under the name ''Concha Mendez''.

==Early life==
Concha was born into a well-to-do family and was educated in a [[France|French]] school, studying music and art. She was highlighted as a gymnast and became a champion swimmer. In 1919 she decided to travel the world spending time in [[London]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]]. When she was nineteen she met [[Luis Buñuel]] while vacationing in [[San Sebastián]] who became her first boyfriend. They were formally engaged for five years&lt;ref&gt;John Baxter, ''Buñuel'', 1994, p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; until she became tired of his insufferable character.&lt;ref&gt;http://portugues.agonia.net/index.php/author/0028634/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Through this artistic atmosphere she became friends with [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Federico García Lorca]], and [[Luis Cernuda]] who encouraged her to join their group which become the [[Generation of '27]]. Concha and [[Rafael Alberti|Alberti]] shared a love for the sea and later in her life she considered him to be her mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Altamirano, "Out of the Glass Niche and into the Swimming Pool". In ''Mirrors and Echoes: Women's Writing in Twentieth-Century Spain'', 2007, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; She published her first collection of poetry, ''Inquietudes'' (Concerns) in 1926.

In 1931 [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] introduced her to the poet and publisher from [[Málaga]], [[Manuel Altolaguirre]] They were married the following year and together founded the printing press ''Verónica'' which edited the publication, ''Héroe'' (for which [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]] contributed lyrical character portraits of Spanish heroes) and ''1616''. The name ''1616'' commemorates the year of the deaths of [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[William Shakespeare]] and to foster literary relations between [[England]] and [[Spain]] the poems were published in their original language as well as the translation. [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Luis Cernuda]], [[Jorge Guillén]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and [[José Moreno Villa|Moreno Villa]] were collaborators.

==Spanish Civil War and Exile==
From 1933 to 1935 Concha and Manuel lived in [[London]] where their first child died in infancy and their daughter Paloma was born. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] they lived in [[England]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. At the end of the Civil War they went into exile in [[Paris]] where they met [[Paul Éluard]]. In 1939 they left Paris and traveled to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] and reestablished their printing press, ''Verónica'', publishing a poetry collection called ''El ciervo herido'' (The Wounded Deer) between 1939 and 1943.

In 1944 they both went to [[Mexico]] and later [[Manuel Altolaguirre|Manuel]] divorced Concha, leaving her for the Cuban actress/producer, María Luisa Gómez Mena. They were both killed in a car accident while returning from the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]] on 23 July 1959.

From 1944 to 1979 she ceased publication except for a poetry anthology in 1976. Her last book, ''Vida o río'' (Life or River), appeared in 1979.

In 1990 ''Memorias habladas, memorias armadas'' (Spoken Memories,  Armed Memories) was published in Madrid. This was a work drawn from tapes that had been recorded by her granddaughter Paloma Ulacia Altolaguirre.

In [[Málaga]], [[Spain]] the ''Calle Poeta Concha Méndez'' is named after her.

'''David Arugete''' (3 April 1921 – 1 December 1968), commonly known under his stage name '''Darío Moreno''',  was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] singer, an accomplished [[composer]], [[lyricist]], and [[guitarist]]. He attained fame and made a remarkable career centred in France which also included films, during the 1950s and the 1960s. He became famous with his 1961 song ''Brigitte Bardot''.

==Biography==

Darío Moreno was born to a large [[Jewish]] family. He was orphaned in early childhood when his father, who worked in a train station in [[Aydın]], was shot dead under tragic circumstances. He was placed in the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] orphanage of Izmir (Nido De Guerfanos&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkisrael.org/TurkishMain/index3.htm "Nido de Guerfanos para kriaturas sin padre o madre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009073319/http://www.turkisrael.org/TurkishMain/index3.htm |date=2013-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) by his mother and remained there until he was four.

After a primary education in the Jewish educational establishments of Izmir, he had many odd jobs during his early youth. He put great effort into continuing his education while simultaneously working to make a living. He started working as an errand boy in the law firm of the city's prominent lawyers, and he was eventually trained to become a clerk in the office. In the evenings, he would study [[French language|French]] in Izmir's Central Library. With a guitar that had fallen into his hands by chance, he also learned to play the guitar, mainly on his own with occasional tutoring from acquaintances.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:DarioMorenoSokağı.jpg|thumb|200px|Dario Moreno Street near [[Asansör]] in [[Izmir]], where the house he lived in his twenties is situated.]] --&gt;
He started singing at [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzva]] celebrations as a second job. In his early twenties, he had already become a well-known singer in Izmir, and particularly among the Jewish community. During his military service in the [[Turkish Army]], he was employed as a singer in officers' quarters in various garrisons and became more focused on music. His first truly professional musical performance started in his hometown right after his discharge, and was arranged through connections established while in the army. When he started making money with his music, he moved to the better-off Jewish quarter of [[Karataş, Izmir|Karataş]] to a house in a street leading to the historical building of [[Asansör]], one of the city's landmarks (and which literally means the "Elevator", people taking an actual elevator to go to the higher part of the quarter, this part being separated by the coastal strait with a steep slope). Nowadays this street is named ''Dario Moreno Sokağı'' (Dario Moreno Street) in his legacy.

A hyperactive personality, Darío Moreno died of a heart attack in a taxi on the way to the airport in Istanbul on 1 December 1968. He was only 47. According to his will he wanted to be buried in [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]] but he was buried in [[Holon]], [[Israel]], by his mother Madam Roza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=66884,3 Akşam Gazetesi: Batı müziğini ülkemize getiren Moreno anıldı] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020838/http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=66884,3 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ya Mustafa==

''[[Ya Mustafa]]'' is one of the most remembered of Moreno's songs. It was very famous in the 1950s and early 1960s. The original version of this catchy song (having a Greek style music) and the identity of its composer are disputed. It appeared in one of the films of the Egyptian actor [[Ismail Yassin]] in the 1950s and in another Egyptian film of [[Sabah (singer)|Sabah]] from the same era. Dario Moreno performed it in the late 1950s. In Europe, the song became popular with the help of [[Bob Azzam]] (a Lebanese singer who was born in Egypt in 1925 and died in Monte Carlo 2004), who released it in 1960 in France with lyrics consisting of at least 3 languages: "Chérie je t'aime, chéri je t'adore – come la salsa del pomodoro" (Darling, I love you, darling, I adore you – like tomato sauce). [[Bruno Gigliotti]], (Orlando) the brother of famous singer [[Dalida]], also covered the song. This song, with its Greek style music and polyglotic lyrics, can be considered a historical documentation of the cosmopolitan era in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. During that era, a large cosmopolitan polyglotic community, mainly Greeks, Jews and Italians, lived in the Egyptian city. A sizable portion lived in the [[Attareen]] district, where the events of the song take place.

[[File:The Triumph of Fame; (reverse) Impresa of the Medici Family and Arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni Families MET DP164870.jpg|thumb|''Triumph of Fame'' on the Medici–Tornabuoni ''desco da parto'' painted for the birth of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], 1449]]
A painted '''''desco da parto''''' (a '''birth tray''' or '''birth salver''') was an important symbolic gift on the occasion of a successful birth in late medieval and [[Early Modern]] [[Florence]] and [[Siena]].  The surviving painted ''deschi'' represented in museum collections were commissioned by elite families, but inventories show that birth trays and other special birth objects like embroidered pillows were kept long after the successful birth in families of all classes: when [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] died, the inventory shows that the ''desco da parto'' given by his father to his mother, [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]], at her [[lying-in]],&lt;ref&gt;The Medici–Tornabuoni ''desco da parte'', painted by Giovanni di Ser Giovanni, called "Scheggia", the brother of [[Masaccio]], with a ''Triumph of Fame'', is conserved at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], acc. no. 1995.1995.7.&lt;/ref&gt; was hanging in his private quarters to the day of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 1998 note 3 quotes from a 1475 inventory "''3 paia di schodelle'' [pairs of soup plates] ''di [[Maiolica|maiolicha]] da donna di parto''", at a time when the testator's children were fifteen and sixteen years old.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A ''desco da parto'' need not be specially commissioned; they were produced in workshops in series for stock, often being personalised with a coat-of-arms when they were bought.  There was a distinctive repertoire of [[iconography]] for the trays, the [[recto]] (top) sides sharing much with that for the painted [[cassone]] chests often used as gifts at marriage, but also with [[verso]] sides often showing scenes of mothers after [[childbirth]] or pin-up figures of boy toddlers, accompanied by the [[coats of arms]] of both parents.  After being used as a tray in the [[post partum]] period they could be hung on a wall as a painting.

==Usage==
[[Infant mortality]] was highest during the crucial first days, when the mother might also succumb to [[Puerperal fever|childbed fever]]. A successful childbirth was lavishly celebrated. Sons would one day assert the family interests, whether in modest workshop or banking house; daughters would share the household's work until they were married and would cement the  [[Exogamy|exogamous ties]] that stabilized Tuscan family position at every social level. Painted childbirth trays began to appear about 1370, in the generation following the [[Black Death]], when the tenuousness of life was more vivid than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 1998:140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifteenth century, D.C. Ahl found, at least one appears in almost half of all inventories she surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ahl, "Renaissance birth salvers and the Richmond ''Judgment of Solomon''", ''Studies in Iconography'' '''7''' (1981:157-84) p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mother was expected to remain "[[Lying-in|lying in]]" enjoying a period of [[bed rest]] during a [[postpartum period]] of variable duration, but probably lasting at least a week. No fixed term of lying-in is recommended in Renaissance manuals on family life (unlike in some other cultures), but it appears from documentary records that the mother was rarely present at the [[baptism]], in Italian cities usually held within a week of the birth at the local [[parish church]], normally a few minutes walk from any house.  During this period the mother and child were visited in the bedroom by family and female friends, and presented with presents.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A; traditionally, a Chinese mother was not allowed to leave the house for a month, or receive visitors for 12 days.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tray, often covered with a protective cloth, was used for serving delicacies to the visitors, perhaps including some they had brought as presents: a maid brings a cloth-covered ''desco'' with two carafes of water and wine to fortify [[Saint Anne]] in [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco of the ''Birth of the Virgin'' (1436), in the Chapel of the Annunciation, Duomo of Prato,&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Musacchio 1998:141; the fresco is illustrated in Georges Duby, ed. ''A History of Private Life, II: Revelations of the Medieval World'' (1988) following p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Raiment might be ceremoniously brought into the specially-decorated [[bedchamber]] where the new mother lay: in [[Nativity (Masaccio)|a ''desco da parto'' by Masaccio]] of 1427,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]; illustrated in Duby 1988 p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; the tray and a covered cup are preceded by a pair of trumpeters flying banners with the Florentine ''[[Fleur de lis|gigli]]''. In fact in patrician households the bed was often placed in a reception room for the occasion (if there was not one already in such a room, after the fashion of the French and Burgundian courts), and the mother lay there while receiving visits from her friends over several days.

==Iconography==
For the painted trays made for the elite on these joyous occasions, in general, both sides of the tray are painted, the upper side (or [[recto]]) generally with a crowded figure scene, usually secular, such as a scene from [[classical myth]] or a suitable [[allegory]].  Scenes from the [[Old Testament]] or the Christian religious repertoire also appear in some cases.  Birthing scenes were popular.  These might be the ''[[Nativity of Mary|Birth of the Virgin]]'' or that of Florence's patron saint, [[John the Baptist]], but only a halo or two distinguishes these from other scenes apparently showing a birth scene as a [[genre painting]]. A tray in the [[New York Historical Society]] shows a genre birthing scene but is closely copied from a drawing of the birth of John the Baptist by [[Lorenzo Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/bartolom/fruosino/desco1.html Web Gallery of Art, "Desco da parto (recto)], 1428, Tempera on panel, diameter 59 cm, 
New York Historical Society, New York]; the verso is illustrated here&lt;/ref&gt;  

In all these the mother sits up in bed receiving gifts from a stream of female visitors, while at the front of the scene the child is washed or wrapped in [[swaddling]] by more women.  In one male pageboys serve the guests.  Another tray shows boys and men playing a local fighting game in the street (see gallery).  The earliest painted illustration of a ''[[novella]]'' of [[Boccaccio]] is on a Florentine ''desco da parto'' with the arms of a Pisan family, made c. 1410 and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bifa/ho_26.287.1,2.htm on-line catalogue entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The survivals include three allegorical scenes of the ''[[Triumph of Love (musical)|Triumph of Love]]'', derived from [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Triumphs]]'', and one ''Triumph of Venus''.

The underside or [[verso]] generally has a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes [[heraldry]], with the arms of both parents shown.&lt;ref&gt;The Medici–Tornabuoni tray is painted with the feather device of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and the coats of arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni families.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes with one or two naked boy toddlers, with the [[coats of arms]] of both parents at the sides, are especially popular.  The arms of the mother's family traditionally take the right hand side, but in some examples the arms have been changed by overpainting them.&lt;ref&gt;Christies&lt;/ref&gt;  Inscriptions in the field or round the rim sometimes provide the date of the fortunate event,&lt;ref&gt;A ''desco da parto'' dated 25 April 1428, in the [[New-York Historical Society]] collection (illustrated here), is attributed to the prolific manuscript illuminator and occasional panel painter, the Florentine [[Bartolomeo di Fruosino]], in Paul F. Watson, "A Desco da parto by Bartolomeo di Fruosino" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''56'''.1 (March 1974:4–9); another ''desco'' by Bartolomeo is Musacchio 1998 fig. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; providing art historians with a useful fixed point.  Like some other types of art, such as the [[Old master prints#The earliest Italian engravings|"Otto prints"]], desci were mostly expected to be decorated in what was considered to be feminine taste, although how the design was selected is unclear.  In an example painted by [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi|Masaccio's brother]] two boys wrestle, with certainly one and probably both using the hold of pulling on the other's penis with one hand and hair with the other (see gallery).&lt;ref&gt;Conceivably the one on the right could be a girl, which would be an exception in these images&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Renaissance it was believed that the sights a pregnant woman saw affected her pregnancy and even what it produced – [[Martin Luther]] told the cautionary story of a woman frightened by a mouse in pregnancy, who then gave birth to a mouse. Manuals advised keeping images with a positive impact in the sight of pregnant women, and it is in this context that the recurrent naked boys, and the scenes showing the end of a successful childbirth, should be seen.  This was also a factor in the display of images of the [[Virgin and Child]], which were ubiquitous in bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the desci were hung with the verso displayed during pregnancy, to promote the production of a similar healthy boy.

==Artists and history==
Workshops that produced ''deschi da parto'' were often also [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], as for example [[Bartolomeo di Fruosino]], an illuminator who also produced panel paintings, and painters of the panels that were incorporated into the fronts and ends of ''quattrocento'' ''[[Cassone|cassoni]]''. Such a workshop was that of the "Master of the Adimari cassone", now usually identified as Masaccio's brother [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi]] (or "Lo Scheggia", "the Splinter"), which also produced the ''desco da parto'' showing youths playing at ''civettino'' in an urban setting, in [[Palazzo Davanzati]], Florence,&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated in Duby 1988, p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; and other examples.  A divided verso showing two naked boys fighting realized $482,500 at auction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists remain unidentified, and were clearly not of the first rank, but, given the significant names represented among the tiny proportion of survivors, it appears that many artists took an occasional break from larger projects to produce ''desci''.  The circular [[tondo (art)|tondo]] shape in normal [[panel painting]]s, which became fashionable in the mid-fifteenth century in Florence, may have developed from the smaller desci.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

The format of the desco, usually about 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm across, is with twelve or sixteen sides, or from about 1430, round,&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 1998:141; Robert Olson, ''Florentine Tondo'', 2000:29, compares ''deschi'' with the circular format of a [[tondo (art)|tondo]].&lt;/ref&gt; enclosed within a slightly raised lip integral to the panel.  Some examples that are now round seem to have originally been twelve-sided.  Some have dates that record the day of the birth (or marriage) concerned. Only about two dozen desci survive, some now with the surfaces sawn apart by dealers in modern times, to create two works.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue entry for example in San Francisco: Nash, Steven A.; ''Masterworks of European painting in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor'', pp. 38–39, Hudson Hills, 1999, {{ISBN|1-55595-182-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55595-182-5}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=u9Et3Te5KqgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=birthing+tray&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=hCTCSumMFoWyNpy5_NUD#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; In inventories they are often described as "broken" or "old", and most apparently were used as trays until too scruffy to keep.  As the 15th century continued they were gradually replaced as gifts by pieces of [[Maiolica|majolica]], often special "birthing sets" with similar iconography, although the [[Uffizi]] has an example of 1524 by [[Jacopo Pontormo]], and others are even later. Examples from the 16th-century tend to have a more raised bowl-like profile, as in the Pontormo, as if echoing the new maiolica shapes.  Production of painted cassoni ceased over the same decades. 

Jacqueline Marie Musacchio rejects the common assumption that these trays were made to celebrate a marriage; she never encountered a ''desco da nozze'' in any 15th-century inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 98, note 24&lt;/ref&gt;  But a Sienese wedding casket (''cofanetto nuziale'') in wood in the Louvre has a round top with a ''Triumph of Venus'' by [[Giovanni di Paolo]] (dated 1421) that is effectively identical to the desci form.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Giovanni di paolo, cofanetto nuziale col trionfo di venere, siena 1421, 01.JPG|Image]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, if they were presented at the time of the marriage, though certainly regarded as associated specifically with pregnancy and childbirth, this would both explain how such elaborate objects were available for use very soon after an uncertain event, and mean that the beneficial images of boys could exert their positive influence throughout the important first pregnancy.

==Example in San Francisco==
The [[San Francisco Legion of Honor Museum]] has an example painted about 1400 by [[Lorenzo di Niccolo]], a Florentine painter who was active from 1391 to 1412.  The recto shows the story of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Actaeon]].  Diana, goddess of hunting appears in the foreground clothed in a dark, broaded robe and carrying a falcon; at the right, her nymphs pursue a boar. At the top of the painting, Diana and her nymphs are bathing in a pool of water when the mortal Actaeon happens upon the naked goddess. For offending the virgin deity, Actaeon was transformed into a [[stag]] to be hunted down by his own dogs. His fate is illustrated on the left side, where hounds chase a deer.  The reverse (verso) shows the allegorical figure of Justice with two family coats of arms while holding a scale and a sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Steven|title=Masterworks of European Painting in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor|date=1999|publisher=Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco|location=San Francisco|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreyfus|first=Renee|title=Legion of Honor: Selected Works|date=2007|publisher=Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco|location=San Francisco|pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''documenta 14''' is the fourteenth edition of the art exhibition [[documenta]] and took place in 2017 in both [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], its traditional home, and [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is being held first in Athens from 8 April till 16 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.documenta14.de/en/ |title= documenta 14 |publisher= South Magazine |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Kassel from 10 June till 17 September 2017. As part of the concept of the artistic director [[Adam Szymczyk]], the exhibition is proceeding in both countries. Most featured artists are working at both locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/streit-in-kassel-die-documenta-soll-nun-auch-nach-athen-13199214.html |title= In Athen den Süden suchen |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|author= Niklas Maak | date= 2014-10-09 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenta is a series of [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. It takes place every five years (originally every four years) and lasts 100 days each; It is therefore also referred to as a museum of 100 days. The first documenta was organized in 1955 and went back to the initiative of [[Arnold Bode]]. The location of the Documenta is normally [[Kassel]].

Established in 2002, the '''Echo Park Film Center''' is a [[Los Angeles]]-based [[nonprofit]] media arts organization located in the [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Echo Park Film Center provides equal and affordable access to film/video education and resources via a community [[microcinema]] and meeting space, free and low-cost filmmaking classes and workshops, comprehensive small format film equipment rental and resources, and a green-energy mobile cinema/film school.

== Microcinema ==
The Echo Park Film Center's 65-seat microcinema screens an international array of documentary and experimental films every Thursday at 8 pm. EPFC also hosts film festivals touring artists, community events, guest lectures and a summer Artist-In-Residence program. The microcinema is available for private screenings and special events at affordable rates.

== Retail and resources ==
The retail department offers film and video equipment and services. EPFC carries Super 8, 8mm, 16mm, and digital video equipment and supplies for sale and rental. Services include film to digital transfers, hourly-rate editing facilities, and a lending library.
== Community classes ==
The Echo Park Film Center offers free film and video classes for neighborhood youth and seniors as well as low-cost workshops for adults.

== Filmmobile ==
A project of the Echo Park Film Center since 2007, the Filmmobile takes EPFC programs on the road to better serve Los Angeles and facilitate media arts exchanges with communities beyond Los Angeles. Running on waste-vegetable oil and green technologies, the Filmmobile is a model of sustainability that celebrates the long tradition of itinerant cinema.

'''Outdoor screenings'''
The Filmmobile Summer Screening Series invites Angelenos to discover and explore their changing urban landscape through an array of classic films at cinematic locations across the city. The Filmmobile partners with local organizations and filmmakers to screen films at community gatherings and special events. National and international tours present special programs of experimental and documentary films by established and emerging filmmakers.

'''Workshops'''
The Filmmobile brings free filmmaking workshops to media-marginalized populations, specifically at-risk youth, girls and young women, recent immigrants, the homeless, seniors, people of color and low-income earners. These programs provide a fertile meeting space for skills building and the exchange and validation of ideas, knowledge, and experiences, empowering individuals to share their unique stories with the world.

'''''Female Perversions''''' is a 1996 [[drama film]], the first feature directed by [[Susan Streitfeld]], which stars [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Amy Madigan]], [[Karen Sillas]], [[Frances Fisher]], [[Paulina Porizkova]] and [[Clancy Brown]]. It draws on insights from the 1991 book ''Female Perversions: The Temptations of Emma Bovary'' by the New York psychoanalyst [[Louise J. Kaplan]]. Aspects of female psychology, particularly the more morbid, are explored through the interactions of the characters and through their fantasies.

==Plot==
Eve Stephens, a successful trial attorney in Los Angeles, is close to the high point of her career, which is being appointed as a judge. Her private life is less successful, however. She has occasional intense sex, sometimes with a male geologist John and sometimes with a female psychiatrist Renee, but the relationships lack warmth or commitment on her part. She is troubled by erotic nightmares and by flashbacks to the lives of her parents, centring on her unfeeling father and the suspicious death of her mother. 

Both her professional and personal lives start unravelling when her intelligent but disturbed sister Maddie, who lives in a desert cabin, is arrested for repeated shoplifting. In the end, the two sisters begin to recognise the malign influence of their parents on their lives and the unsatisfactory responses they unconsciously adopted, one seeking compensation in stealing and the other in sex.

In [[prehistoric art]], '''finger flutings''' are lines that fingers leave on a soft surface. Considered a form of [[cave painting]], they occur in [[cave]]s throughout southern Australia, New Guinea, and southwestern Europe, and were presumably made over a considerable time span including some or all of the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2006. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Most are not obvious figures or symbols but, rather, appear to many observers as enigmatic lines. They are also called '''tracés digitaux''' or '''finger tracings''' and (though these terms are also in part interpretative) '''meanders''', '''macaroni''', and '''serpentines'''. The term '''finger fluting''' was coined by [[Robert Bednarik]].

Generally they are made in a substance called [[moonmilk]]. Sometimes they are made through a thin clay film into moonmilk underneath or perhaps just into clay.

As [[Henri Breuil]] has published, finger flutings have been recognized since the early days of the 20th century in Europe as Paleolithic. Their recognition as having a similar antiquity outside of Europe lay chiefly in the hands of Sandor (Alexander) Gallus and then in Koonalda Cave in Australia. Many other sites both in Europe and Australia have been found, some of the more famous being Gargas&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2010. Fluted Animals in the Zone of Crevices, Gargas Cave, France. Proceedings of the Eleventh Congress of the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, Lisbon, Portugal, 4–9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Baume Latronne caves in France and the [[cave of Altamira]] in Spain.

==Study methods==
Bednarik continues to publish sites that contain flutings, but current forward research into finger flutings is mainly being carried out by [[Kevin J. Sharpe]] and [[Leslie Van Gelder]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2006b. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295.&lt;/ref&gt; They have developed the following methods for this purpose. Their cornerstones include multiple examinations of the flutings under investigation, experimentation, and the initial and primarily setting aside of questions of meaning (as such assumptions can determine what investigators then see in the flutings). The physical data in the flutings themselves comprise what they seek: how the fluters constructed their flutings, how the flutings functioned with respect to one other and, if possible, how the flutings functioned for the fluters. Sharpe and Van Gelder use a specific terminology for their studies and call upon three analyses.

===Terminology===

A ''fluter'' makes a fluting by sweeping their fingers across a soft surface; a ''unit'' comprises flutings drawn with one sweep of one hand or finger; the ''profile'' of a unit or a fluter comprises the silhouette of the finger tops left in the medium from the fluting; a ''cluster'' comprises an isolatable group of units that exhibit a unity, for instance because they overlay each other; and a ''panel'' comprises a collection of clusters that appears geographically or otherwise distant from other clusters or on a surface of reasonably uniform orientation.

===Internal analysis===

In terms of the field methodology, having become familiar with a cluster, an Internal Analysis of it is carried out, specially noting the directions of the flutings and their overlays. This provides the differentiation of clusters and units, and the temporal sequence of the flutings. The analysis relates to [[Alexander Marshack]]’s question, asked especially for engraved line markings: What do the order, direction of and (especially for engravings) the tools for creation of the lines tell about the mind of the artifact creator when creating? Though Marshack pioneered this technique, it has been modified in its application by others such as Bednarik, Francesco d’Errico, and Michel Lorblanchet. It forms the backbone of research into line markings such as flutings.

===Forensic analysis===

One of their additions to this methodological base, Sharpe and Van Gelder call a ‘Forensic Analysis.’ In this, they record where possible whether the left or right hand made the unit under examination, as indicated by the presence of marks that the first or fifth finger – written F1 or F5 – would make. These appear distinctively different from one another and from the marks of the other fingers. They measure the width of the F2-F4 set of marks at their narrowest, calling this the 3-fingered width of the unit. The width data for the three fingers suggest the age category of the fluter, namely whether a young child or older.
A Forensic Analysis also examines the profile of a 4- or 5-fingered unit, for frequently units start with the tops of fingers and the investigator needs at least four fingers to tell whether the hand is left or right. Then the investigator records the relative height of F2 to F4 against F3. This would suggest the [[gender]] of the fluter painter. Further, consistency of widths and profiles, and perhaps some other features among units suggest the same person painted them with the finger-fluting technique.

==Results of studies==

Sharpe and Van Gelder’s work has focused on flutings found in the French caves of Rouffignac, in the Dordogne, and Gargas in the Hautes Pyrenees. Using the above methods, they have shown:&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, L. and Sharpe, K. 2009. Women and girls as Upper Paleolithic cave ‘artists’: Deciphering the sexes of finger fluters in Rouffignac Cave, Oxford Journal of Archaeology. 28:4, 323-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

* the involvement of young children aged 2–5 in Paleolithic ‘art’ and who may have been held up to do this;&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L.  2006. Evidence of cave marking by Paleolithic children. Antiquity 80:310, 937-947.&lt;/ref&gt;
* females and males created the ‘art’&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, L. and Sharpe, K. 2009. Women and girls as Upper Paleolithic cave ‘artists’: Deciphering the sexes of finger fluters in Rouffignac Cave, Oxford Journal of Archaeology. 28:4, 323-333.&lt;/ref&gt;* a young girl created a commonly accepted symbol;
* the inadequacy of Claude Barrière and Breuil’s identification of fluted animals in Gargas Cave;
* two panels were efficient communication&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2010b. Fluted Animals in the Zone of Crevices, Gargas Cave, France. Proceedings of the Eleventh Congress of the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, Lisbon, Portugal, 4–9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* indications as to the fluter’s identity (in particular, distinguishing the flutings made by an individual fluter).

==Interpretations==

The lack of thorough studies, let alone methods for doing them, means speculation as to the meaning of flutings runs unchecked, even by the most well-known experts on prehistoric art. They are seen, for example, as representing such things as the first scribbles by humans, though intuitive and random but serpentines (Breuil); water related (Marshack); entopic shapes or phosphenes (Bednarik); huts, comets, or rivers, or linear-phallic and male symbols in the statistical placement of signs within a cave (Leroi-Gourhan); snakes (and thereby associated with death) (Barrière); psycho-neurological archetypes (Gallus); hunting marks (Barrière); shamanic ritual (Lewis-Williams). The corpus of Paleolithic flutings is too complex to fit into a single meaning paradigm. Too much in prehistoric ‘art’ does not conform to what modern people might see as figures and symbols, flutings offering an example. Investigators bring to their study and tie their methods to preconceived notions as to what is meaningful, what constitutes a pattern, and what they think is the origin of fluting making. No one now may ever know the meaning of the flutings and no one now should expect to know it.

That need not stop people responsibly offering meaning or intentionality hypotheses, Sharpe and Van Gelder state. But all such hypotheses must subject themselves to the data uncovered by investigations using methods such as those above.

Tracings of hands and finger flutings often show the dimensions of children.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, B. (2007). Children of Prehistory, ''Science News'' vol. 171, pp. 264-266. ([http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070428/bob8ref.asp references])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Free Comic Book Day''', taking place on the first Saturday of May, is an annual [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] effort by the [[North America]]n [[comic book]] industry to help bring new readers into independent [[direct market|comic book stores]]. Retailer Joe Field of Flying Colors Comics in [[Concord, California]] brainstormed the event in his "Big Picture" column in the August 2001 issue of ''[[Comics &amp; Games Retailer]]'' magazine. Free Comic Book Day started in 2002 and is coordinated by the industry's single large distributor, [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]. This is another event like the Comic Book Day which started in USA and is now celebrated across counries in Asia, Europe and Australia.

==History==
In 2001, retailer Joe Field was writing columns for an industry magazine, and saw how successful [[superhero film|feature films based on comic book franchises]] were providing the comic book industry with a positive cultural and financial turnaround from the [[comic book collecting#Bust of the speculator market|speculator bust]] of the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="CBGXtra"&gt;Miller, John Jackson (December 12, 2005). [http://www.cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/the-1900s-the-century-in-comics "Nov. 17, 1992: A $30 Million Day — and the Days After"]. "The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics", [[CBGXtra.com.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Field proposed Free Comic Book Day in one of his columns, and received positive reaction to it. Then-[[Image Comics]] publisher [[Jim Valentino]] suggested having the first Free Comic Book Day on the same weekend as the opening of the 2002 ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' feature film, in order to take advantage of the film's heavy promotion and related press about the comic book medium,&lt;ref name="Founder interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksunleashed.me/2013/05/02/interview-with-the-founder-of-free-comic-book-day-joe-field/|author=Brassington, Mark|title=Interview with the Founder of Free Comic Book Day - Joe Field|publisher=Geeks Unleashed.me|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverine FCBD"&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Thill|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/free-comic-book-day/|title=Free Comic Book Day Recruits Wolverine, Green Lantern|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the first event was held May 4, 2002, one day after the film's opening.&lt;ref name="Founder interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquirer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/101553/tidbits-about-free-comic-book-day|title=Tidbits about Free Comic Book Day|publisher=Inquirer Lifestyle|date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all events have corresponded with the release of a film based on a comic book.&lt;ref name="2006 guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/05/free-comic-book-day-2006-guide|title=Free Comic Book Day 2006 Guide|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 it was held in July,&lt;ref name="July FCBD 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3284|title=FCBD 2004 set for July 3rd, coincides with "Spider-Man 2"|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was moved back to the first Saturday in May the following year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=4005|title=Free Comic Book Day 2005 Date Chosen|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=September 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been held on that day ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Home/1/1/27/992|title=Free Comic Book Day homepage|publisher=FreeComicBookDay.com|accessdate=May 8, 2013|quote="Free Comic Book Day is a single day - the first Saturday in May each year"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507165131/http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Home/1/1/27/992|archivedate=May 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Free Comic Book Day, participating comic book store retailers give away specially printed copies of free comic books, and some offer special deals and creator signings to those visiting their establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Cory|last=Doctorow|url=http://boingboing.net/2009/04/30/free-comic-book-day.html|title=Free Comic Book day this Saturday!|publisher=BoingBoing|date=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, retailers do not receive the issues for free; they pay 12–50 cents per copy for the comics they give away during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carlson, Johanna Draper|url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2007/03/05/free-comic-book-day-free-for-whom/|title=Free Comic Book Day Free For Whom?|publisher=Comics Worth Reading|date=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LVRJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/arts-culture/here-s-everywhere-you-can-get-free-comic-books-saturday|title=Here’s everywhere you can get free comic books on Saturday|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|last=Taylor|first=F.

==Effectiveness==
In its first six years, more than 2000 retailers in more than 30 countries gave away more than 12 million Free Comic Book Day special edition comic books. The success of the promotion rests with each participating retailer. Most participants agree that Free Comic Book Day has been part of a healthier comics market and growing comic book sales over the last several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1017?articleID=121128|title=Free Comic Book Day: A Talk with Joe Field|publisher=[[Diamond Comic Distributors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gonzalez, Guy LeCharles|url=http://loudpoet.com/2005/02/18/interview-field-on-free-comic-book-day/|title=Interview: Field on Free Comic Book Day|publisher=LoudPoet.com|date=February 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Comic Book Day has also garnered press coverage in the news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/122?articleID=11819|title=Outside the Panels: FCBD Coverage!|publisher=[[Diamond Comic Distributors]]|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/books/free-comic-book-day-set-unleash-heroes-zombies-talking-mice-6C9748003|title=Free Comic Book Day set to unleash heroes, zombies, talking mice|publisher=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the free publicity for the Free Comic Book Day event, and the comic book industry, from [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], over 1000 television news stations, and over 4000 online news outlets was estimated at $3.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=149321|title=FCBD Media Coverage Generates Over $3.2 Million In Publicity|publisher=Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the number of shops participating in Free Comic Book Day increased 8% over how many participated in 2014 and the number of comic books ordered increased by 21%.&lt;ref name="2015orders"/&gt;

In some communities, the day is more grandly organized such as in [[London, Ontario]], Canada where most of its major comic book retailers, such as [[Heroes Comics]], as well as the [[London Public Library]]'s Central branch participate. On that day, these establishments cooperate in a major cross-promotion in which visitors are invited to collect stamps of each participating establishment for entry in a prize draw upon completion as well as various other activities which has evolved into a street festival in the city's downtown core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Bono|first1=Norman|title=Downtown London transformed into comic festival|url=http://lfpress.com/news/local-news/downtown-london-transformed-into-comic-festival|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=London Free Press|date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 event collected over 2000 such completed ballots, which does not account for more casual visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemon|first=Marshall|title=The Crossover: How Free Comic Book Day Changed A Canadian College Town|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/11451-The-Crossover-How-Free-Comic-Book-Day-Changed-A-Canadian-College-Town|publisher= Escapist Magazine|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">'''Sir George Reeves-Smith''' (17 July 1863 – 29 May 1941) was an English hotelier. Hired by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] in 1900 to replace [[César Ritz]] as manager of the [[Savoy Hotel]], he remained in the post until his death four decades later. In addition to running the Savoy, he was general manager of the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group and was a director of the [[Savoy Theatre]].  He was also instrumental in establishing charitable medical institutions in England and Switzerland.

==Early years==
Reeves-Smith was born in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of George Reeves-Smith, whose jobs included running the [[Brighton]] aquarium.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Jaine, Tom. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37887 "Smith, Sir George Reeves- (1863–1941)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Brighton College]] and then apprenticed to J. Calvet ''et cie'', [[Bordeaux]] wine ''[[négociant]]s'', after which he trained in the hotel industry.  By 1893 he was manager of the [[The Berkeley|Berkeley Hotel]], [[Piccadilly]], and four years later he led a [[management buy-out]], with himself as principal shareholder and managing director.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the same time, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], founder of the Savoy Hotel, dismissed his manager, [[César Ritz]], for financial irregularities, and was looking for a suitable replacement.  Carte was impressed by both Reeves-Smith and the Berkeley, and he effectively secured both by purchasing the Berkeley and making Reeves-Smith managing director of the Savoy hotel group.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Reeves-Smith held this office from 1900 for the rest of his life, and from 1916 took on the post of vice-chairman of the company, which he also held for life.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U230887 "Reeves-Smith, Sir George"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, in addition to managing the growing Savoy hotel group, which included, among other interests, the Savoy, the Berkeley, [[Claridge's]] and [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]], he became a director of the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Savoy group==
The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' said of Reeves-Smith that "he was aware of the slightest derogation from high standards of housekeeping or service; yet he was innovative and capable of masterly delegation ... punctilious and conservative in manner and dress, he had a shrewd business appreciation of practical detail and people's tastes in leisure activities."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1930, the novelist [[Arnold Bennett]], who knew the Savoy well, dedicated his ''Imperial Palace'' to Reeves-Smith. The principal character of the novel, Evelyn Orcham, is the resourceful and urbane general manager of a large ''hôtel de luxe'' in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Arnold. [http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/etexts/E000279.htm ''Imperial Palace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908013723/http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/etexts/E000279.htm |date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves-Smith founded the Hotels and Restaurants Association (1910) and was its dominant figure for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 30 May 1941, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  He was connected with other catering industry organisations, including the International Hotel Alliance, of which he was president.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;  His interests extended beyond the world of grand hotels: he was instrumental in founding in the Preston Hall centre for tuberculous ex-servicemen in [[Kent]], and the British Sanatorium in [[Montana-Vermala]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He was knighted in 1938 for service to the hotel industry, and was honoured by France (''[[Légion d'honneur]]'', 1938) and Italy (Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], 1939).&lt;ref name=who/&gt; In 1938 Reeves-Smith engaged as his assistant [[Hugh Wontner]], who took over when Reeves-Smith died.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', obituary of Hugh Wontner, 27 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1888 Reeves-Smith married Maud Hindle, daughter of a Brighton hotelier. They had one son, who was killed in [[World War I]], and one daughter.  Their home was always a suite in one of Reeves-Smith's hotels, first in the Berkeley, then at Claridge's, where Reeves-Smith died of pneumonia, aged 77, survived by his wife.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' obituary gives his age as 86, but does not cite date of birth, and the dates and age given in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' have been used above.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18737">{{main|Creativity}}
The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

[[File:John Lavery The Fairy Fountain 1888.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The 'Fairy Fountain' at the exhibition, by [[John Lavery]].]]
The '''International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry''' was the first of 4 [[international exhibitions]] held in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It took place at [[Kelvingrove Park]] between May and November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinghorn|first=Jonathon |title=Glasgow's International Exhibition, 1888|publisher=[[Glasgow Museums &amp; Art Galleries]]|year=1988|isbn=978-0-902752-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of the exhibition was to draw international attention to the city's achievements in [[applied science]]s, industry and the arts during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. However, it was also hoped the Exhibition would raise enough money for a much-needed museum, art gallery and school of art in the city. The exhibition was opened by the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], as honorary president of the exhibition, on 8 May 1888. It was the greatest exhibition held outside London and the largest ever in Scotland during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Stanley K.|title=Kelvingrove and the 1888 Exhibition|url=http://www.studygroup.org.uk/Archives/24/KELVINGROVE.htm|website=Exhibition Study Group|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The buildings for the Exhibition were designed by competition winning Glaswegian architect James Sellars. Sellars decided on an oriental style which "lends itself readily to execution in wood." The buildings were however temporary, and consideration had to be given to ease of dismantling them once the exhibition was over.

The Main Building, which housed most of the exhibits, occupied an area of Kelvingrove Park between the [[River Kelvin]] and Sandyford Street which is now on the route of [[Sauchiehall Street]]. It featured a 170&amp;nbsp;ft high Dome erected on an iron framework covered in galvanised sheet iron. Four octagonal supporting towers around the Dome were made of brick, with minarets on top.

==Exhibits==

===Industrial===

Scottish firms accounted for two-thirds of the exhibitors at the International Exhibition of 1888, with many Glasgow firms featuring prominently. The majority of the third that came from outwith Scotland were from England, with London providing the largest number, followed by Lancashire and Yorkshire. India and Canada were the principal origin of non-British exhibitors. Of the seventy firms from outwith the British Empire, most were from France, Germany, Italy and the USA. 

One of the main British commercial exhibitors was [[Royal Doulton|Doulton &amp; Co]], who presented the massive terracotta Doulton Fountain to the city after the International Exhibition of 1888. Originally situated in Kelvingrove Park during the exhibition, it was later moved to [[Glasgow Green]] in 1890. At 46&amp;nbsp;ft high, with its outer basin measuring 70&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter, it remains the biggest fountain of its kind in the world.

===Recreation===
More populist attractions which were intended to broaden the exhibition's appeal to the public were kept separate from the main academic and industrial exhibits, sited in an area between the [[University of Glasgow]] and the west bank of the River Kelvin.

One of the most popular attractions was a [[switchback railway]]. Other popular attractions included a shooting gallery, a [[Moored balloon|captive air balloon]] and regular musical performances by bands. Sports events such as football matches, cycle racing and [[highland games]] were held in the adjacent University Athletics Ground.

The River Kelvin itself was an important feature at the International Exhibition of 1888. It was specially deepened and cleaned for the occasion. Exhibition goers could take trips on the river in electric and steam-powered launches as well as on a [[gondola]] imported from [[Venice]]. The latter proved particularly popular, as were the two gondoliers, nicknamed "Signor Hokey" and "Signor Pokey".

==Impact==
When the Exhibition closed in November 1888, the final attendance figure was 5,748,379. A profit of £43,000 was further evidence of the Exhibition's success, with the money going towards the construction of the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], which functioned as the Palace of Fine Arts for the subsequent [[Glasgow International Exhibition (1901)|Glasgow International Exhibition]], also held at Kelvingrove Park, in 1901.

'''''Look Mickey''''' (also known as '''''Look Mickey!''''') is a 1961 oil on canvas painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Widely regarded as the bridge between his [[abstract expressionism]] and [[pop art]] works, it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being the first example of the artist's employment of [[Ben-Day dots]], [[speech balloon]]s and comic imagery as a source for a painting. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., [[National Gallery of Art]] upon Lichtenstein's death.

Building on his late 1950s drawings of [[comic strip]]s characters, ''Look Mickey'' marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of [[painterly]] techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations of pop culture and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing to the work of artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]] during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.

The work dates from Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of pop art and as a work of [[modern art]] in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, ''[[Artist's Studio—Look Mickey]]'', which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein's studio.

==Background==
During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work. Lichtenstein was among them, and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters. [[Andy Warhol]] produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced ''Look Mickey'' and ''Popeye'' in 1961.&lt;ref name=L72/&gt;&lt;!--were these the only 1961 works of this type. It matters to the next claim, see the word "especially". --&gt;  Lichtenstein's 1961 works, especially ''Look Mickey'', are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|page=21|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Look Mickey source.jpg|thumb|Lichtenstein used this image from ''Donald Duck Lost and Found'' (illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten) for ''Look Mickey''.]]
According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, ''Look Mickey'' was based on the [[Little Golden Book]] series.&lt;ref name=C/&gt; The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is entitled ''Donald Duck Lost and Found'', written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through [[Disney Consumer Products|Disney Enterprises]]. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten.&lt;ref name=TC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RLOF175&gt;{{cite book|page=175|editor=Bader|last1=Bader|first1=Graham|chapter=Donald's Numbness|year=2009|quote=|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative theory suggests that ''Look Mickey'' and ''Popeye'' were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers.&lt;ref name=L72&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|2000|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein [[Cropping (image)|crop]]ped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|page=31|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of stories purport to tell of the moment of inspiration for ''Look Mickey''. Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled one of his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging; "I bet you can't paint as good as that".&lt;ref name=TPR&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pop! Revolution|author=Marquis, Alice Goldfarb|page=37|chapter=The Arts Take Center Stage|isbn=978-0-87846-744-0|year=2010|publisher=[[MFA Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts.&lt;ref name=RLOF166&gt;{{harvnb|page=166|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; American painter [[Allan Kaprow]] once stated, in reference to a [[Bazooka (chewing gum)|Bazooka]] [[Dubble Bubble]] Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, "You can't teach color from Cézanne, you can only teach it from something like this."

During the comic book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often slightly altered the colorization of the original source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|editor=Coplans, John|chapter=|year=1972|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a "loose and improvised style clearly derived from [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]]."&lt;ref name=L72/&gt; Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning ''Women''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fineberg|1995|page=260|loc="The Landscape of Signs: American Pop Art 1960 to 1965"}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: An International Perspective|editor=Livingstone, Marco|year=1991|isbn=0-8478-1475-0|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W109"&gt;Bourdon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and [[James Rosenquist]], that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing."&lt;ref name="Wat79"&gt;Watson, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fineberg|1995|page=251|author=Fineberg|loc="The Landscape of Signs: American Pop Art 1960 to 1965"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like [[Popeye]] and [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fineberg|1995|page=261|loc="The Landscape of Signs: American Pop Art 1960 to 1965"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During autumn 1961, Allan Kaprow, a fellow teacher at [[Rutgers University]], introduced Lichenstein to art dealer [[Ivan Karp]], the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings, but not ''Look Mickey''. He instead impressed him with ''[[Girl with Ball]]'', and Karp decided to represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm |title=Chronology |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132503/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm |archivedate=May  7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting is one of Lichtenstein's first non-[[expressionist]] works, and marks his initial employment of [[Ben-Day dots]] which he used to give it an "industrial" half-tone effect. The painting is his first use both of a speech balloon&lt;ref name=C/&gt; and [[comics]] as source material.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alloway|1983|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic-bristle dog brush to apply the oil paint onto the canvas.&lt;ref name=C/&gt;  By the time of his death, ''Look Mickey'' was regarded as Lichtenstein's breakthrough work.&lt;ref name=PAILD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/30/news/mn-37730/2|title=Pop Art Icon Lichtenstein Dies|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=September 30, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Knight, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="It occurred to me one day to do something that would appear to be just the same as a comic book illustration without employing the then current symbols of art: the thick and thin paint, the calligraphic line and all that had become the hallmark of painting in the 1940s and '50s. I would make marks that would remind one of a real comic strip."|source=—Lichtenstein on the germination of his style&lt;ref name=RLOF&gt;{{cite book|page=57|editor-last=Bader|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|last=Lichtenstein|first=Roy|chapter=A Review of My Work Since 1961&amp;mdash;A Slide Presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In reproducing a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies by reducing the composition to primary colors, which serves to accentuate its mass appeal and largely gives it the "pop" look.&lt;ref name=TC/&gt; Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet. By mixing dots of different colors, like an ink jet printer, just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using only a limited number of primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint.&lt;ref name=p29&gt;{{harvnb|page=29|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenstein made several alterations to the original work: he eliminated various non-essential figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the side rather than the end. At the same time, he kept Donald and Mickey in almost the same positions as they were in the original.&lt;ref name=RLOF174&gt;{{harvnb|page=174|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition.&lt;ref name=RLOF174-5&gt;{{harvnb|pages=174–75|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] said about Donald Duck: "He's got a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject."&lt;ref name=RLOF189&gt;{{harvnb|page=189|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features.&lt;ref name=RLOF190&gt;{{harvnb|page=190|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the original source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps [[schadenfreude]] towards Donald.&lt;ref name=p27/&gt; The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of the contours of the waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]].&lt;ref name=p29/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|2000|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], "''Look Mickey'' is broad comedy and falls into the category of slapstick&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=RLDW55&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|page=59|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lichtenstein's [[obituary]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Christopher Knight described the work as "a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism".&lt;ref name=PAILD/&gt; Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its "linear clarity and colour", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale.&lt;ref name=PAES/&gt; A common misconception about Lichtenstein comes from the fact that in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons.&lt;ref name=RLOF174-5/&gt; Graham Bader wrote that "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based."&lt;ref name=RLOF176&gt;{{harvnb|page=176|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Look Mickey'' is considered [[self-reference|self-referential]] in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist.&lt;ref name=RLOF176-8&gt;{{harvnb|pages=176–78|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Narcissus-Caravaggio (1594-96) edited.jpg|thumb|''Look Mickey'' has reflective elements that call upon [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Narcissus (Caravaggio)|Narcissus]]''.&lt;ref name=RLOF176-8/&gt;]]

Bader observes that ''Look Mickey'' is concerned both with the artistic process and Lichtenstein's new painting techniques. He believes it can be considered a self-portrait in the sense that it "explicitly situates the painting's maker himself within the self-enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center". The painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein's blue 'rfl' signature "as a kind of surrogate for the image's creator", in a manner that is reminiscent of [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Narcissus (Caravaggio)|Narcissus]]'', in which the subject gazes at his own reflection on the water.&lt;ref name=RLOF176-8/&gt; This is viewed as an allegory of Lichtenstein's position as an artist trained to develop his [[Realism (arts)|realist]] instincts despite the prominence of [[abstract expressionism]]. When viewed this way, Mickey serves as the "vanguard [[Modern art|modernist]]" [[superego]] towering over Lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts.&lt;ref name=p27/&gt;

Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots to color Mickey's face. According to some art critics, this gives the character the appearance of [[blushing]]. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or that it is the hue associated with a "healthy glow," since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|page=26|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority.&lt;ref name=p27&gt;{{harvnb|page=27|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are quick to point out that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;{{harvnb|page=28|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=39em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=It is precisely this tension—between heightened sensation and absolute numbness, bodily exuberance and the deadening of sensory experience—that animates ''Look Mickey''."|source=—Graham Bader&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite journal|page=93&amp;ndash;113|last1=Bader|first1= Graham|title=Donald’s Numbness|work=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford Art Journal]]|volume=29|issue=1|year=2006|doi=10.1093/oxartj/kci047}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Graham Bader, describing it as the engine of the painting's narrative, notes the intrigue created by the juxtaposition of Donald's heightened sense of visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch, and his deadened sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in the back of his own shirt. In this sense, Lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent sense of touch:&lt;ref name=DN/&gt;

{{Quote|text=Donald is an explicitly divided subject, all sensory experience on one end and, literally, numbness on the other (and, visually, all depth and all flatness – for Donald's face is by far the painting's most spatially illusionistic element, while his caught jacket, merged with the schematic waves behind it, emphatically one of its flattest). Indeed, Donald is a portrait of precisely the separation of sight and feeling, vision and touch… What divides vision and touch in Look Mickey, what marks this shift between them, is text: the words that Donald (and Lichtenstein) introduces to the scene, and which the duck's pole-cum-brush passes through before snagging his own back end.|sign=Bader|source=&lt;ref name=DN/&gt;}}

Lichtenstein frequently explored vision-related themes after he began to work in the pop art genre; early examples include ''[[I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It!]]'' and ''Look Mickey''.&lt;ref name=RL85/&gt; In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Hendrickson, Janis|publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=20|chapter=The Beginnings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (''[[Torpedo...Los!]]''), a [[mirror]] (''[[Girl in Mirror]]'') or a [[peephole]] (''I Can See the Whole Room&amp;nbsp;... and There's Nobody in It!''), ''Look Mickey'', with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.&lt;ref name=RL85&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: All About Art |publisher=Louisiana Museum of Modern Art|editor=Holm, Michael Juul |editor2=Poul Erik Tøjner |editor3=Martin Caiger-Smith|year=2003|isbn=87-90029-85-2|page=85|chapter= Pop according To Lichtenstein |author=Lobel, Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The idea of doing [a cartoon painting] without apparent alteration just occurred to me&amp;nbsp;... and I did one really almost half seriously to get an idea of what it might look like. And as  I was painting this painting I kind of got interested in organizing it as a painting and brought it to some kind of conclusion as an aesthetic statement, which I hadn't really intended to do to begin with. And then I really went back to my other kind of painting, which was pretty abstract. Or tried to. But I had this cartoon painting in my studio, and it was a little too formidable. I couldn't keep my eyes off it, and it sort of prevented me from painting in any other way, and then I decided this stuff was really serious&amp;nbsp;... I would say I had it on my easel for a week. I would just want to see what it looked like. I tried to make it a work of art. I wasn't trying just to copy. I realized that this was just so much more compelling.|sign=Lichtenstein|source=&lt;ref name=PAES&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art|author=Shanes, Eric|isbn=978-1-84484-619-1|page=84|year=2009|publisher=Parkstone Press International|chapter=The Plates}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The painting was bequeathed to the Washington [[National Gallery of Art]] after Lichtenstein's death in 1997, following a 1990 pledge in  honor of the institution's 50th Anniversary.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/20centpa/20centpa-71479.html|title=The Collection: National Gallery of Art|accessdate=May 9, 2012|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/16/arts/inside-art.html|title=Inside Art|accessdate=May 9, 2012|date=January 16, 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Vogel, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in the gallery's collection, where, {{asof|November 2012|lc=on}}, it is on permanent view.&lt;ref name=TC/&gt;

[[Harold Rosenberg]] once described Lichtensteins reworking of the comics source as follows: "...the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history, or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/crv/summary/v034/34.3beaty.html|title=Roy Lichtenstein's Tears: Art vs. Pop in American Culture|accessdate=June 30, 2013|volume=34|issue=3|year=2004|author=Beaty, Bart|work=Canadian Review of American Studies|pages=249&amp;ndash;268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon]]]]

The '''Lunar plaques''' are stainless steel [[commemorative plaque]]s measuring {{convert|9|by|7+5/8|in|cm|sigfig=3}} attached to the ladders on the descent stages of the United States [[Apollo Lunar Module]]s flown on lunar landing missions Apollo 11 through Apollo 17, to be left permanently on the lunar surface.  The plaques were originally suggested and designed by NASA's head of technical services [[Jack Kinzler]], who oversaw their production.&lt;ref name="Moon Flag"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Sandra L.|title=Red, White &amp; Blue: U.S. Flag at Home on the Moon|journal=Houston History Magazine|date=Fall 2008|volume=6|issue=1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

All of the plaques bear facsimiles of the participating astronauts' signatures. For this reason, an extra plaque had to be made for [[Apollo 13]] due to the late replacement of one crew member. The first ([[Apollo 11]]) and last ([[Apollo 17]]) plaques bear a facsimile of the signature of [[Richard Nixon]], [[President of the United States]] during the landings, along with references to the start and completion of "man's first explorations of the Moon" and expressions of peace "for all mankind".  

All, except the [[Apollo 12]] plaque (which is also textured differently), bear pictures of the two hemispheres of Earth. Apollo 17's plaque bears a depiction of the lunar globe in addition to the Earth. The plaques used on missions 13 through 16 bear the call-sign of each mission's Lunar Module. All the plaques were left on the Moon, except the two for the aborted Apollo 13 mission which did not land on the Moon.

==Notes==
* The plaques are curved so as to fit around the landing leg and not hinder the astronauts from using the ladder.  The plaques were attached directly to the ladder rungs, between the third and fourth rungs from the bottom.
* Two plaques were made for Apollo 13, because of the replacement of Command Module Pilot [[Thomas Mattingly|Thomas K. "Ken" Mattingly]] with [[John Swigert|John L. "Jack" Swigert]] two days before launch. Mission Commander [[Jim Lovell|James "Jim" Lovell]] was to have placed the plaque bearing Swigert's name over the original already fastened to the LM ''Aquarius'', when he descended the ladder to walk on the Moon. When the landing was aborted, Lovell saved this plaque to keep as a memento, and it remains in his possession. The original plaque bearing Mattingly's name was destroyed when ''Aquarius'' reentered the Earth's atmosphere.
* The lunar near-side map, with the six Apollo lunar landing sites marked on it, was added to the Apollo 17 plaque at the suggestion of astronaut [[Gene Cernan]].

'''''Never Too Late''''' is a 1965 comedic [[feature film]] directed by [[Bud Yorkin]]. It stars 54-year-old [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] as the wife of a businessman (played by 64-year old [[Paul Ford]]) who discovers, after 25 years of marriage, she is to become a mother for the second time.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=84720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Harry Lambert is a New England lumber company executive in a humdrum life with his wife Edith. He feels his life has grown stale since his recent defeat in an election for town mayor. Adding to his frustrations, the mayor who defeated him in the election is a neighbour. His adult daughter Kate is of little or no help to anybody; she and her husband Charlie live with Harry and Edith, and Charlie lives a freeloader's life, working at the lumber company.

Bothered by unexplained fatigue, Edith is persuaded by her friend Grace ([[Jane Wyatt]]) to go see a doctor. Edith learns she is pregnant. Her daughter Kate wishes ''she'' were also pregnant. Kate begins pressuring her husband Charlie to get her pregnant, without success.

Harry doesn't want to be a father again at his age; in his sixties, he worries that he will be in his eighties when the child graduates from college, making him embarrassed and feeling foolish. He also complains about Edith's spending, particularly after a misjudged prank by Charlie and himself insulting the mayor leads to their losing a lumber supply contract for a new stadium.

Despite his many complaints, Harry is genuinely taken aback when Edith announces she is leaving him to move to Boston and have the baby by herself. Harry pursues Edith to bring her back, while Charlie finally comes through by winning back the stadium contract.

'''Ostrovica Fortress''' ({{IPA-hr|ˈostrovitsa|hr}}; {{lang-hr|Tvrđava Ostrovica}}) is a ruined [[medieval]] [[fortification]] on a solid rock jutting from the top of the hill above the village of [[Ostrovica, Croatia|Ostrovica]] in [[Zadar County]], [[Croatia]]. It is located between the two historical and geographical regions, [[Bukovica]] and [[Ravni Kotari]]. It was once an important stronghold, known as the "Key to the City of [[Zadar]]", as it was a key defense of the city. It was destroyed during the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]] in the second half of the 17th century, leaving only a few remains.

==History==
The name Ostrovica was first mentioned in the second half of the 12th century (according to Croatian historian [[Vjekoslav Klaić]]), when the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Cinnamus]] listed the Croatian places conquered by the army of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] in 1168, quoting, among others, [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Trogir]], [[Šibenik]], [[Skradin]] and Ostrovica. For the second time ''castrum Ostrovica'' was specified as a place where an army of, then [[Herzog|herzog (duke)]], [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]], future [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croato-Hungarian]] king, camped in 1198 on its way back home from a military campaign in the south.

The fortress, as well as the whole medieval [[Bribir, Šibenik-Knin County|Bribir]] [[Župa|Župa (County)]], was owned by members of the [[House of Šubić|Šubić noble family]], known as ''nobiles, comites or principes Breberienses'' (Princes of Breber, "Knezovi Bribirski" in Croatian), until 1347. After the death of [[Paul II Šubić of Bribir|Pavao (Paul) II Šubić]] in 1346, who used to live in Ostrovica, he was succeeded by his underaged son [[Juraj I Zrinski|George (Juraj) III Šubić]] and his son's legal representative (George's uncle and Paul's jounger brother) [[Gregory V Šubić of Bribir|Grgur (Gregory)]]. It was in the very next year, that the ruling king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] demanded from Šubićs to hand him over the fortress, for he wanted to use it as a strategic point in a war against the [[Republic of Venice]]. In exchange for it, the king granted them the [[Zrin Castle]] and surrounding estate, a very distant property to the north of the country, actually in lower [[Slavonia]], one of Croatian lands.

Ostrovica had strategic significance since ancient times. It controlled the important ways and routes in directions of north-south (between [[Siscia]] and [[Salona]]) as well as of west-east (between [[Zadar]] and [[Knin]]). So it helped king Louis to win the war and to liberate [[Dalmatia]] from Venetians, which was ended in 1358 by signing the Peace [[Treaty of Zadar]]. After Louis' death in 1382, the fortress changed various owners in a relatively short period of time. For instance, it was property of [[John of Palisna|Ivan Paližna]], [[Prior]] of [[Vrana (town)|vrana]] and [[Bans of Croatia|Ban (viceroy) of Croatia]], and his descendants, then (between 1388 and 1391) of the mighty [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian]] king [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], and from 1393 of the [[Vuk Vukčić Hrvatinić]] (younger brother of [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]], Grand Duke of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]), who was appointed Ban of Croatia for some time by the [[counter-king]] [[Ladislaus of Naples]].

At the beginning of the 15th century, it was [[Sandalj Hranić Kosača]], [[Grand Duke]] of [[Zahumlje|Hum]], who married Katarina, a daughter of Vuk Vukčić Hrvatinić, and was given Ostrovica as her [[dowry]] (in spring 1405), together with the Town of Skradin. This was acknowledged by the king Ladislaus in a [[charter]] dated 23 March 1407. However, new circumstances occurred in 1409, as Ladislaus sold his rights to Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice. Subsequently negotiated Sandalj Hranić Kosača the terms of delivery of the castle to Venetians and agreed upon its handover for the sum of 5.000 [[ducat]]s. An agreement was signed in Zadar on 13 April 1411, and so the Most Serene Republic gradually took over the whole Dalmatia for a while, paying for it the sum of 100.000 ducats to king Ladislaus.

The fall of medieval Bosnian Kingdom into [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] hands in 1463 meant a new and constant jeopardy for the fortress. However, it remained within territory of the Croato-Hungarian Kingdom until 1523, when it was conquered by the Ottomans, together with surrounding land and villages.

In the next decades Ostrovica was subject to face the instability of the [[Military Frontier|military frontier]] between the Ottomans and Venetians and was finally razed to the ground in the second half of the 17th century. According to available sources, the fortress still existed in 1671, as [[Stojan Janković]], a famous warriorr against the Turks, was appointed its Venetian military commander. After that, on the [[plateau]] of Ostrovica's steep rock there were only remains of the ruined fortress left. Today can only some of them be found, like stone water [[cistern]], hewn stone [[stairway]] and  fragments of [[Gothic art|gothic]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

[[File:Poliptico de pissa Masaccio reconstruccion.jpg|thumb|Conjectural arrangement of the surviving panels. [[:File:Reconstruction of fragmrnts of Masaccio's Pisan altarpiece (after C. Gardner von Teuffel).jpg|Another idea]]]]

The '''Pisa Altarpiece''' (Italian - ''Polittico di Pisa'') was a large multi-paneled [[altarpiece]] produced by [[Masaccio]] for the chapel of [[Julian the Hospitaller|Saint Julian]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Pisa|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in [[Pisa]]. The chapel was owned by the [[notary]] Giuliano di Colino, who commissioned the work on February 19, 1426 for the sum of 80 florins. Payment for the work was recorded on December 26 of that year. The altarpiece was dismantled and dispersed to various collections and museums in the 18th century, but an attempted reconstruction was made possible due to a detailed description of the work by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] in 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1906, II, 292.; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T0DPSdOVX2UC&amp;pg=PA25 online translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a [[tempera]] painting on a gold ground and wood panel. It originally had at least five compartments organised in two registers, making ten main panels, of which only four are known to have survived. Another four side panels and three [[predella]] panels (two of which had a double scene) are now in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. The altarpiece's central panel was '''''Madonna and Child with Angels''''', produced in collaboration with Masaccio's brother Giovanni and with [[Andrea di Giusto]], now in the [[National Gallery, London]].

Eleven panels are known as of 2010, and they are insufficient to reconstruct the whole work with certainty. In particular four standing figures of saints flanking the central panel are missing. Vasari says these were the saints shown in the [[predella]] narrative scenes: Peter, John the Baptist, Julian and Nicholas. In particular it is unclear if these larger saints occupied the more traditional individual framed compartments, as proposed by C. Gardner von Teuffel and others, or stood in a unified field with the central Virgin and Child, as proposed by [[John Shearman]], which was to be become the usual style in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Reconstruction of fragmrnts of Masaccio's Pisan altarpiece by John Shearman..jpg|Central area, per John Shearman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving panels==
The eleven surviving panels are:
*Upper Register: ''Crucifixion'' (Naples); Saint Paul (Pisa); Saint Andrew (Malibu)
*Central Register: ''Madonna and Child with Angels'' (London); Augustine, Jerome, two Carmelite saints (all Berlin) 
*Predella (all Berlin): ''Adoration of the Magi''; two scenes of the ''Crucifixion of St Peter'' and ''Martyrdom of St John the Baptist''; two scenes from the legends of St Julian and St Nicholas

===Upper Register===
====Crucifixion====
The ''Crucifixion'' was placed above the central panel of the altarpiece, underlining the sacrificial (Eucharistic) nature of the central panel.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Dunkerton et al., ''Giotto to Dürer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery,'' New Haven, 1991, 248–251.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the panel unnaturalistically represents the narrative against a gold background (a medieval formula for representing sacred scenes), Masaccio creates an effect of reality by depicting the event from below, as the viewer standing before the altar truly saw it. In this way, he attempts to tie the viewer to the scene, to make the sacred accessible to the ordinary Christian.

====Saints====
Now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Pisa]], the panel of [[Paul of Tarsus]] is the only portion of the commissioned work which remains in [[Pisa]]. It is usually reconstructed as being one of two flanking panels to the left of the ''Crucifixion''. St Andrew was one of two flanking panels to the right of the ''Crucifixion'' and is now in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum, Los Angeles]].

===Lower Register===
====Madonna and Child with Angels====
[[File:Masaccio. Madonna and Child. 1426. National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with Angels'', 135.5 cm x 75 cm, National Gallery, London]]
The altarpiece's central panel was ''Madonna and Child with Angels'', produced in collaboration with Masaccio's brother Giovanni and with [[Andrea di Giusto]]. The panel is in a very damaged state and smaller than its original size; it has lost perhaps as much as 8&amp;nbsp;cm. at the bottom and 2-2.5&amp;nbsp;cm. at each side.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Dunkerton and Dillian Gordon, "The Pisa Altarpiece," in Carl Brandon Strehlke, ed.''The Panel Paintings of Masolino and Masaccio: The Role of Technique,'' Milan, 2002, 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven surviving panels of the altarpiece, which is the only documented work by Masaccio, are in various museums.&lt;ref&gt;Documents published in James Beck, ''Masaccio: The Documents,'' Locust Valley, NY, 1978, Appendix, 31–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars hypothesize the reconstruction of the altarpiece based on a very complete description by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1906, II, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting contains six figures: the Madonna and Child and four angels. The Madonna is the centre figure and is larger than any of the others to signify her importance. Christ sits on her knees, eating grapes offered to him by his mother. Although he is an exceedingly babyish baby (in comparison to the babies of Masaccio's immediate predecessors, like [[Lorenzo Monaco]] or [[Gentile da Fabriano]]), the grapes are a symbol of his blood – like the red wine of Communion – which indicates Christ's awareness of his eventual death. The Madonna looks sorrowfully at her child, as she also realises his fate.  
 
In many ways the style of the painting is traditional; the expensive gold background and ultramarine draperies of the Virgin, her enlarged scale, and her hierarchical presentation (ceremoniously enthroned) all fit within the late-medieval formulas for the representation of Mary and Jesus in glory. In other ways, however, the painting is a step away from International Gothic in the sense that Masaccio has created a more realistic approach to the subject: 
*The faces are more realistic and not idealised.
*The baby Jesus is less of a small man and more childlike.
*An attempt at creating depth has been attempted by Massacio's placement of the two background angels and through the use of linear perspective in the throne.
*Modeling is clearly visible as the light source is coming from the left of the painting.
*The Madonna is a bulky figure, deriving from classical models, and her drapery has larger and more naturalistic folds that shape her body.

Masaccio has used linear perspective to create pictorial space; it can be seen on the orthogonal on the cornice of her throne. The vanishing point is at the child's foot. The reason for this is that the work was originally located above a representation of the Adoration of the Magi, in which one of the magi kisses Jesus' foot.  
[[File:Masaccio 001.jpg|thumb|400px|''Adoration of the Magi'', Berlin]]
[[File:Masaccio. Stories of St Julian and St. Nicholas. 1426. Berlin-Dahlem.jpg|thumb|400px|''Scenes from the legends of St Julian and St Nicholas'']]
Although the paintings are noticeably different (the subjects are clothed differently and on different chairs) the Madonna is more or less in the same position in both works. This parallelism is designed to make viewers have the same attitude as the magus when looking at the Madonna and Child. They are imagined to be kneeling in front of Mary, and could easily lean forward to kiss the foot of Jesus.

Masaccio has also used the overlapping of figures and objects to create pictorial space, like the two angels in the foreground overlapping the throne and the throne overlapping the two angels in the background.

===Predella===
This was placed below the central panel or panels; probably there were only the three surviving panels, according to most reconstructions. They are about {{convert|21|x|61|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} and now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. They show the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'', especially praised by Vasari and presumed to have been the central panel, two scenes of the ''Crucifixion of St Peter'' and ''Martyrdom of St John the Baptist'', and two scenes from the legends of St Julian and St Nicholas in the third panel. These stories come from compilations such as the ''[[Golden Legend]]''. In the last, at left [[Julian the Hospitaller]] kills his parents, after having been misinformed by the devil, shown in the centre. At right [[Saint Nicholas]] is secretly pushing gold through the bedroom window of two poor girls, to provide a [[dowry]] for them.

[[File:David-harp.jpg|right|thumb|[[David]] playing his harp (unknown artist, c. 960). The book of [[Psalms]], included in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and said to have been written largely by David, is one of the earliest collections of sacred music, and still plays a role in the liturgies of the two religions.]]

'''Religious music''' (also '''sacred music''') is music performed or composed for [[religion|religious]] use or through religious influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/genre/religious-ma0000004431|title=Religious Music Genre Overview {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ritual music''' is music, sacred or not, performed or composed for or as [[ritual]].

==Christian music==
{{main|Church music|Christian music}}
According to some scholars, the earliest music in the Christian Church came from Jewish worship music, with some additional [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] influence.{{sfn|Conomos|2003}} It is believed that this music lay somewhere between singing and speaking, or speaking with an understood ritual cadence.&lt;ref&gt;Foley 2008,{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is another opinion that the roots of early Christian music come from the early ascetic monastic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin and Gibbs 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic Music ==
Islamic "songs" come in the form of prayers (In Arabic, prayer is ''Salah)'' that occur 5 times a day. These prayers are conducted by facing Mecca and having both knees to the ground bowing and reciting these prayers and usually are recitations of the Islamic Holy word the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A. Rasheid|first=Omar|date=|title=Muslim Prayer and Public Spheres: An Interpretation of the Quranic Verse 29:45|url=|journal=Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology|volume=68|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prayers occur of the day and connect the Muslim people through a series of melodic prayers that often become amplified through the city. In Islam the implication of prayer and in this case the ''Salah'' is for ritual since it is believed to be the direct word of God that shall be performed as a collective, as well as individually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== History of Islam Prayer ====
"What shall I say of their prayer? For they pray with such concentration and devotion that I was astonished when I was able to see it personally and observe it with my own eyes.” (Riccold De Monte in the year 1228).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The origin of the art of prayer in all Abrahamic religions is to glorify God and the same goes for Islam. The ''Al Salat'' is the most widely used word to mean institutionalized prayer and is one of the oldest forms of prayer in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalee|first=Mohammed|date=1999|title=The Foundation of Muslim Prayer|url=|journal=Medieval Encounters|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Islamic prayer, traditions, and ideals had influence from these Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hienz|first=Justin|date=August 2008|title=SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURY RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON THE SALĀT RITUAL|url=|journal=THE ORIGINS OF MUSLIMS PRAYER|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of origination of Salah came from the Muslim prophet Muhammad (the Messenger of God) in a cave as he began to worship Allah (God). It is believed that through this act of worship Mohammad interacted with the Abrahamic prophet Moses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now these "prayers" come in the form of recitations of the Quran and poems written by prophets of the faith.

==== The Spread of Islamic Prayer ====
Besides the spread of Islam through Arabia by prophets it spread through trade routes like the Silk Road and through conflict of war. Through the Silk road traders and members of the early Muslim faith were able to go to countries such as China and create mosques around 627 C. E.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/11321/islam-enters-far-east/|title=Islam Enters the Far East - The Religion of Islam|last=waheed|website=www.islamreligion.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As men from the Middle East came to China they would get married to these Asian women, which led to a spreading of the faith and traditions of Islam in multiplicities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Crusades in the 9th and 10th century encouraged the spread of Islam through the invasions of Latin Christian soldiers and Muslim soldiers into each other's land. The whole conflict began on the premises of a Holy Land and which group of people owned these lands that led to these foes invading their respective lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/news/why-muslims-see-the-crusades-so-differently-from-christians|title=Why Muslims See the Crusades So Differently from Christians|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the religion itself spread so did its implications of ritual, such as prayer.

The earliest synagogal music was based on the same system as that in the [[Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to the [[Talmud]], [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], who had served in the sanctuary [[Levite|Levitical]] choir, told how the choristers went to the synagogue from the orchestra by the [[altar]] (Talmud, Suk. 53a), and so participated in both services.

'''Saša Broz''' (born 19 October 1968) is a Croatian theatre and television director. She has worked for several theatres in Croatia and one in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

== Family and education ==
Saša Broz is the daughter of diplomat [[Mišo Broz]] and granddaughter of the Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Herta Haas]].&lt;ref name="Kerbler"&gt;{{citation|first=Jurica|last=Kerbler|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:673500-Aleksandra-Sasa-Broz-Mom-dedi-Titu-niko-nije-ni-do-kolena|title=Aleksandra Saša Broz: Mom dedi Titu niko nije ni do kolena|publisher=Večernje novosti|date=2 July 2017|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurković"&gt;{{citation|first=Dinka|last=Jurković|url=https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/intervju_sasa_broz/1738033.html|title=Ponosna sam na svoje prezime|publisher=Novi list|date=23 May 2009|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born and educated in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="br"/&gt; She became interested in [[classical ballet]] in early childhood, which her parents discouraged. With the support of her grandfather Tito, who was close to her and involved in her upbringing, she nevertheless enrolled into a ballet school.&lt;ref name="Burburan"&gt;{{citation|first=Edita|last=Burburan|title=Saša Broz: Nisam opterećena time što sam Titova unuka, ali me opterećuje što drugi ljudi jesu|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Kultura/Kazaliste/Sasa-Broz-Nisam-opterecena-time-sto-sam-Titova-unuka-ali-me-opterecuje-sto-drugi-ljudi-jesu?meta_refresh=true|publisher=Novi list|date=21 October 2012|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broz received graduate and postgraduate degrees from the [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography]], but a foot injury ended her ballet career, and she returned to Croatia. She took up studying [[theatre directing]] at the [[Academy of Dramatic Art, University of Zagreb]], and started her career as a director already in her second year of studies.&lt;ref name="br"&gt;{{citation|first=|last=|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/kultura/redateljica-sasa-broz-postala-ravnateljica-opere-u-rijeci-538583|title=Redateljica Saša Broz postala ravnateljica Opere u Rijeci|publisher=Večernji list|date=14 July 2013|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Broz has worked for a number of theatres in Zagreb, including the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] and [[Gavella Drama Theatre]], as well as in [[Velika Gorica]]. She has also worked outside Croatia, most notably for the [[Tuzla National Theatre]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During her two-year-long tenure as [[theatre intendant|intendant]] of the [[Istria National Theatre]] in [[Pula]], the theatre received awards at festivals in Italy and Montenegro.&lt;ref name="br"/&gt; The city authorities terminated her position in 2006. Broz sued them, claiming that their decision was politically motivated.&lt;ref name="Čulić"/&gt; She also directed the 50th [[Pula Film Festival]]. [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] has employed her as the director of [[synchronization]] for [[animated films]].&lt;ref name="br"/&gt; The 2013 decision to name Broz director of opera at the [[Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka]] was criticized by some cultural workers, including [[Darko Lukić]] and [[Slobodan Šnajder]], who stated that she had no training or experience in opera directing.&lt;ref name="Čulić"&gt;{{citation|first=Ivana|last=Čulić|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/kultura/redateljica-sasa-broz-postala-ravnateljica-opere-u-rijeci-538583|title=Saša Broz: Najjača sam i najranjivija osoba koju poznajem|publisher=tportal|date=23 January 2017|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{citation|first=|last=|url=https://www.rijekadanas.com/strucnjaci-o-novoj-ravnateljici-opere-sasa-broz-imenovana-zbog-podrske-sdp-u/|title=Stručnjaci o novoj ravnateljici opere: Saša Broz imenovana zbog podrške SDP-u?!|publisher=|date=15 April 2013|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Saša Broz was married to actor [[Ranko Zidarić]] from 1994 until their divorce in 2000. They have a daughter.&lt;ref name="Jokanović"&gt;{{citation|first=Srđan|last=Jokanović|url=http://blog.dnevnik.hr/poznateface/2006/07/1621353883/aleksandra-broz-kazalisna-redateljica.html|title=Aleksandra Broz, kazališna redateljica|publisher=|date=22 July 2006|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Saša and Mišo Broz [[trademark]]ed the name and signatures of Josip Broz Tito; Saša said the intent was to preserve her grandfather's dignity.&lt;ref name="Simić"&gt;{{citation|first=Tanja|last=Simić|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/29235/sprijecila-sam-prodaju-titova-imena|title=

[[File:Teatro Ferrara1.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Teatro Comunale, Auditorium]]
The '''Teatro Comunale''' (''Communal Theatre'') in [[Ferrara]] is an [[opera house]], located in the Italian region of [[Emilia-Romagna]], and built between 1786 and 1797 with seating for 990.
Privately owned theatres with limited seating capacity had existed in the city for many years, but the arrival of Cardinal Spinelli, the new papal envoy, in 1786 spurred the  construction of a new public theatre under the architects [[Cosimo Morelli]] and Antonio Foschini.  However, their disagreements led to conflicting design concepts regarding the elliptical shape of the auditorium which were resolved through compromise.  The theatre was finally ready for its inaugural presentation of Portogallo’s ''Gli Orazi e i Curiazi'' on 2 September 1798.

The theatre is noted for staging the premiere of an early opera written by [[Gioacchino Rossini]] at the  age of twenty, ''[[Ciro in Babilonia]]'' in March 1812.

Between 1825 and 1826 some renovation work was required, followed by some more in 1850, creating the theatre as seen today.  In 1928 an orchestra pit was added.  During the [[Second World War]] the theatre suffered badly from Allied bombing and, although it opened occasionally in the immediate post-war years, it closed in 1956, not to re-open until further restoration took place in the early 1960s and then once again between 1987 and 1989.

The present-day auditorium has 5 tiers, while the ceiling displays four scenes from the life of [[Julius Caesar]]. It now seats 890.

[[File:Teatro Comunale.jpg|thumb|Rotonda Foschini, the internal court of the Teatro Comunale.]]
Following the Second World War and subsequent renovations, performances were fairly sporadic, but after the creation of “Ferrara Musica” in 1988, more operatic performances have been staged, some of obscure or little-known operas, and other, more popular works alongside other theatres in the Emilia-Romagna region.  The conductor [[Claudio Abbado]] usually presents one opera every season and the 2007 schedule &lt;ref&gt;

Between January and April 2008 the four operas performed were ''[[Motezuma]]'' by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], ''[[Maria de Buenos Aires]]'' by [[Astor Piazolla]], ''[[Tosca]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] and ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrocomunaleferrara.it/lirica08/lirica08.asp 2008 opera season] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930101717/http://www.teatrocomunaleferrara.it/lirica08/lirica08.asp |date=2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's 2013/14 season shows performances of four operas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrocomunaleferrara.it/navigations/view/1/3/0/Lirica.html 2013/14 opera season] on official website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cptvdisplay.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Flat-screen televisions for sale at a consumer electronics store in 2008.]]
'''Television''' ('''TV'''), sometimes shortened to '''tele''' or '''telly''', is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in [[monochrome]] ([[black and white]]), or in colour, and in two or [[3D television|three dimensions]] and sound. The term can refer to a [[television set]], a [[television program]] ("TV show"), or the medium of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]]. Television is a [[mass medium]] for advertising, entertainment and news.  

Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After [[World War II]], an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] tape, [[Hard disk drive|local disks]], DVDs, [[flash drives]], high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, and cloud [[digital video recorders]] has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies— at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on [[Cloud computing|the cloud]].  At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, [[digital television]] transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) ([[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution and [[480i]]) to [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: [[1080p]], [[1080i]] and [[720p]]. Since 2010, with the invention of [[smart television]], [[Internet television]] has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through [[streaming video]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Roku]] and [[Chromecast]].

In 2013, 79% of the world's [[households]] owned a television set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/0087/the-state-of-television-worldwide/222681|title=TVTechnology: The State of Television, Worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage [[Cathode ray tube|cathode ray tube (CRT)]] screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s (both [[Cold cathode#Lamps|fluorescent-backlit]] and [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED]]), [[OLED]] displays, and [[plasma display]]s was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs.

Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] transmitters to [[broadcasting|broadcast]] the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by [[Cable television|coaxial cable or optical fiber]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] systems and, since the 2000s via the [[Internet television|Internet]]. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as [[analog television|analog]] signals, but a [[Digital television transition|transition]] to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including a tuner for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is correctly called a [[video monitor]] rather than a television.

==Etymology==
The word ''television'' comes {{ety|grc|''τῆλε'' (tèle)|far|lat|visio|sight}}. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist [[Constantin Perskyi]] used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris. The Anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still "...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over [[telegraph]] or telephone wires".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=30 December 1969 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; In the 19th century and early 20th century, other "...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904)."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The abbreviation "TV" is from 1948. The use of the term to mean "a television set" dates from 1941.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The use of the term to mean "television as a medium" dates from 1927.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The slang term "telly" is more common in the UK. The slang term "the tube" or the "boob tube" refers to the bulky [[cathode ray tube]] used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang term for the TV is "idiot box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thompson, Robert|title=1985: Television Transformed 1.0|work=[[New York Times]]|date=3 October 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/media/1985-television-transformed-1-0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, during the early rapid growth of television programming and television-set ownership in the United States, another slang term became widely used in that period and continues to be used today to distinguish productions originally created for broadcast on television from films developed for presentation in movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"&gt;Johnson, Richard (2018). [https://pagesix.com/2018/10/11/big-movie-stars-are-not-making-the-cut-on-the-small-screen/ “Big movie stars are not making the cut on the small screen”], Page Six, ''[[The New York Post]]'' (New York, N.Y.), October 11, 2018. Retrieved November 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The “small screen”, as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the “[[Feature film|big screen]]” was used to identify productions made for theatrical release.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"/&gt;

[[Facsimile transmission]] systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. [[Alexander Bain]] introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. [[Frederick Bakewell]] demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 13, 22. {{ISBN|978-0-8240-7782-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk "[[rasterizer|image rasterizer]]" became exceedingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers &amp; Shiers, p. 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Perskyi]] had coined the word  ''television'' in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris on 24 August 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Constantin PERSKYI|url=https://www.histv.net/perskyi-1900|title=Télévision au moyen de l'électricité|agency=Congrès Inographs by Telegraph|work=The New York Times Sunday Magazine|date=20 September 1907|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by [[Lee de Forest]] and [[Arthur Korn]], among others, made the design practical.&lt;ref name="Sending Photographs by Telegraph"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E4DA1331E733A25757C2A9649C946697D6CF "Sending Photographs by Telegraph"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday Magazine, 20 September 1907, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted "several times" each second.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Varigny, "[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision à distance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231305/http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, 11 December 1909, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 [[Edouard Belin]] sent the first image via radio waves with his [[belinograph]].

In 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, "very crude images" over wires to the "[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube" ([[cathode ray tube]] or "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: "the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZcwhVyiMqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burns+%27%27Television:+An+International+History+of+the+Formative+Years%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=zworykin%20rosing%20selenium&amp;f=false R.

[[File:John Logie Baird and Stooky Bill.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Baird in 1925 with his televisor equipment and dummies "James" and "Stooky Bill" ''(right)''.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John Logie Baird, 1st Image.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The first known photograph of a moving image produced by Baird's "televisor", circa 1926 (The subject is Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson)]] --&gt;

By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] employed the [[Nipkow disk]] in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf "Current Topics and Events"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, 4 April 1925, p. 505–506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal.  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]].

In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Pathé]] established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Baird, "[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.

An American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on "Motion Pictures by Wireless" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion", ''The New York Times'', 14 June 1925, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glinsky"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41–45| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent]] No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).

[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 30&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland &amp; Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[WRGB]], then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as "[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television". Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Léon Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.&lt;ref name="glinsky"/&gt; By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/rca_story_brewster.html | title=Early Electronic Television RCA TV Development: 1929 – 1949 | publisher=Early Television Museum | accessdate=20 February 2016 | author=Brewster, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 1926, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in [[Shizuoka University]], Hamamatsu Campus. His research in creating a production model was halted by the United States after Japan lost [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nhk.or.jp"&gt;[http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ ''Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101180643/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ |date=1 January 2016 }}, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissectors]] and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.

In 1897, English [[physicist]] [[J. J. Thomson]] was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the "Braun" tube.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.is/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552–559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]], with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

In 1908 [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which he described how "distant electric vision" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device,&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B.

On 7 September 1927, American inventor [[Philo Farnsworth]]'s [[image dissector]] camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Postman"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/farnsworth.html Postman, Neil, "Philo Farnsworth"], ''The TIME 100: Scientists &amp; Thinkers'', TIME.com, 1999-03-29, retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfmuseum"&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html "Philo Taylor Farnsworth (1906–1971)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622033654/http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html |date=22 June 2011 }}, ''The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco'', retrieved 15 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 September 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration.&lt;ref name="sfmuseum"/&gt; In 1929, the system was improved further by the elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422211543/http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0648.xml/complete The Philo T. and Elma G. Farnsworth Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929)]]
Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a [[patent interference]] suit against Farnsworth. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application;&lt;ref name=US1691324&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mZ9KAAAAEBAJ Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System].

Retrieved 2010-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts, and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1&amp;nbsp;million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel, ''The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television'', Broadway Books, 2002, p. 243–244. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-0759-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everson"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

At the [[Berlin Radio Show]] in August 1931, [[Manfred von Ardenne]] gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception. However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a [[flying-spot scanner]] to scan slides and film.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin: Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]] on 25 August 1934, and for ten days afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA838 New Television System Uses 'Magnetic Lens']", ''Popular Mechanics'', Dec. 1934, p. 838–839.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns370"&gt;Burns, R.

American television broadcasting, at the time, consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941.&lt;ref name="Everson4"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, 1 December 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business &amp; Economics – 1973, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent № 7219,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Television, 1880–1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).&lt;ref name="tvmuseum.ru"&gt;[http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 A.

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios]. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Goldmark, assignor to Columbia Broadcasting System, "Color Television", [http://www.google.com/patents?id=7pNDAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=color+television&amp;as_drrb_ap=b&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=1936&amp;as_maxm_ap=12&amp;as_maxy_ap=1941&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007 U.S. Patent 2,480,571], filed 7 September 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was first demonstrated to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on 29 August 1940, and shown to the press on 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;Current Broadcasting 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ColorTVSuccess&gt;"Color Television Success in Test", ''The New York Times'', 30 August 1940, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism", ''The New York Times'', 5 September 1940, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=JScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 New Television System Transmits Images in Full Color]", ''Popular Science'', December 1940, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940, and live cameras by 12 November.&lt;ref name="ColorTVSuccess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; "CBS Demonstrates Full Color Television," ''Wall Street Journal'', 5 September 1940, p. 1. "Television Hearing Set," ''New York Times'', 13 November 1940, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented)].&lt;/ref&gt; These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''New York Times'', 8 March 1942, p. 1.

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called [[Telechrome]]. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "[[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the [[NTSC|National Television Systems Committee]]&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white TVs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] "compatible". ("Compatible Color", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]", of [[West Side Story]], 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.

[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]
Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE]]'s relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Due to [[data compression]] digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522191336/http://www.disabled%2Dworld.com/artman/publish/digital%2Dhdtv.shtml | archivedate=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, as Japanese [[consumer electronics]] firms forged ahead with the development of [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology, the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "[[simulcast]]" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing [[NTSC]] standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.

The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, [[aspect ratios]], or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the [[consumer electronics]] industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the [[computer industry]] (joined by the [[film industry]] and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816184950/http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2009 |title=Information about interlaced and progressive scan signals |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth.  Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfforum.com/FAQs/view/All-About-HDTV/What-s-the-Difference-between-Interlaced-and-Progressive-Video/33.html|title=What's the Difference between "Interlaced" and "Progressive" Video? – ISF Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as [[Lcd|Liquid-crystal (LCD)]], for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"/&gt;

[[Progressive scanning]], the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. [[William F. Schreiber]], who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital television transition]] started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.

Smart TV should not to be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) or with [[Web TV]]. [[Internet television]] refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems – terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods). IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

3D television conveys [[depth perception]] to the viewer by employing techniques such as [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] display, [[free viewpoint television|multi-view]] display, [[2D-plus-depth]], or any other form of [[3D display]]. Most modern 3D [[television set]]s use an [[active shutter 3D system]] or a [[polarized 3D system]], and some are [[Autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] without the need of glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by [[John Logie Baird]] in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html |title=How Stereoscopic Television is Shown |publisher=Baird Television website|accessdate=18 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101019045734/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html| archivedate= 19 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs. Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. Many 3D television channels which started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.According to DisplaySearch 3D televisions shipments totaled 41.45&amp;nbsp;million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3D TV-sales growth |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |newspaper=globalpost.com |date=18 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724082049/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2013, the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future looks flat for 3D TV|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/future-looks-flat-for-3d-tv-20130814-2rv1q.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is 3D TV dead?

===Terrestrial television===&lt;!-- This section is linked from Television --&gt;
{{main article|Terrestrial television}}
{{see also|Timeline of the introduction of television in countries}}

[[File:UHF TV Antenna 001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|A modern high gain UHF Yagi [[television antenna]]. It has 17 directors, and one reflector (made of 4 rods) shaped as a [[corner reflector antenna|corner reflector]].]]
Programming is [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by television stations, sometimes called "channels", as stations are [[Frequency allocation|licensed]] by their governments to broadcast only over assigned [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]] in the television [[band (radio)|band]]. At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177–179]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 "CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas"], '"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104116/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 |date=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 "Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218160139/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for [[cord cutters]]. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.

===Cable television===
{{main article|Cable television}} {{see also|Cable television by region}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}

[[File:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coaxial cable]] is used to carry cable television signals into cathode ray tube and flat panel television sets.]]
Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcable.org/learn/history-of-cable/ | title=History of Cable | publisher=California Cable and Telecommunications Association | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.

===Satellite television===
{{main article|Satellite television}}

[[File:Dishing out the truth.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|right|DBS satellite dishes installed on an apartment complex.]]
Satellite television is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using broadcast signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.

The most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1–7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] wavelength and are completely digital.&lt;ref name=m101&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] spectrum from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name=fcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|Digital signals]] may include [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are [[pay television]] requiring a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet television===
{{main article|Streaming television}}
{{Distinguish|Smart television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}

Internet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the [[digital distribution]] of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or "telly", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in late 1920's in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]], which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, TVs were used to watch DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use [[LED-backlit LCD display|LEDs]].&lt;ref name="cepro.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology – The Source for Critical Information and Insight. – IHS Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

====CRT====
{{main article|Cathode ray tube}}
[[File:Crt14.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A 14-inch cathode ray tube showing its deflection coils and electron guns]]
The cathode ray tube (CRT) is a [[vacuum tube]] containing one or more [[electron gun]]s (a source of [[electrons]] or electron emitter) and a [[fluorescent]] screen used to view images.&lt;ref name="crthistory"/&gt;
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

In television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name='workings'&gt;{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.&lt;ref name='workings' /&gt;

{{main article|Digital Light Processing}}
[[File:Christie Mirage 5000.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Christie Mirage 5000, a 2001 DLP projector.]]
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of [[video projector]] technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997.  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded [[Emmy Awards]] in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of [[digital cinema]] projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221025534/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2014|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plasma====
{{main article|Plasma display}}

A [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger. They are called "[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.

====LCD====
{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}
[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]
Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[LCD]] [[display technology]] to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]], simply called LCDs and those using [[LED]] as backlight called as [[LED-backlit LCD television|LEDs]].

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Shipments+of+LCD+TVs+Surpass+CRT+TVs/article10775.htm | title=Hardware Report: Shipments of LCD TVs Surpass CRT TVs | publisher=DailyTech LLC. | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLEDs]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]], but {{as of|2014|lc=on}} none of these have entered widespread production.

====OLED====
{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}
[[File:LG전자, 깜빡임 없는 55인치 3D OLED TV 공개(2).jpg|thumb|left|OLED TV]]

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current.  This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld games console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small [[molecule]]s and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]]. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display resolution===
[[File:8K UHD, 5K, 4K UHD, FHD and SD.svg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Comparison of 8K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], 4K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], [[High-definition television|HDTV]] and [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolution]]

====LD====
{{main article|Low-definition television}}

Low-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such [[240p]] (320*240). It is used in [[handheld television]]. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).

====SD====
{{main article|Standard-definition television}}

Standard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: [[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems; and [[480i]] based on the American National Television System Committee [[NTSC]] system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either [[high-definition television]] ([[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], [[1440p]], [[4K UHDTV]], and [[8K UHD]]) or [[enhanced-definition television]] (EDTV [[480p]]).  In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same [[4:3]] aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being [[center cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html|title=Digital Television|date=28 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a [[pillarbox]]ed image.

====HD====
{{main article|High-definition television}}

High-definition television (HDTV) provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher than that of [[standard-definition television]].

HDTV may be transmitted in various formats:
* [[1080p]]: 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]
* [[1080i]]: 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame
** A non-standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame&lt;!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment. See also the 1080i article. --&gt;
* [[720p]]: 1280×720p: 921,600 pixels (~0.92 MP) per frame

====UHD====
{{main article|Ultra-high-definition television}}

Ultra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or [[XVGA#UHD (4K) (3840×2160)|UHD]]) includes [[4K resolution#Resolutions|4K UHD]] (2160p) and [[8K resolution#Resolutions|8K UHD]] (4320p), which are two [[digital video]] formats proposed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] and defined and approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU). The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] announced on 17 October 2012, that "Ultra High Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have an [[display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/what-is-ultra-hdtv/ | title = What is Ultra HDTV? | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-4k-and-8k-ultra-hd/ | title = The Ultimate Guide to 4K Ultra HD | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market share===
North American consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years, and the average household owns 2.8 televisions. {{asof|2011}}, 48 million are sold each year at an average price of $460 and size of {{convert|38|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="martin20111227"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/business/tv-prices-fall-squeezing-most-makers-and-sellers.html | title=Plummeting TV Prices Squeeze Makers and Sellers | work=The New York Times | date=27 December 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2011 | author=Martin, Andrew | pages=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming===
{{See also|Television show}}
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:

# Original run or First run: a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same.
# [[Broadcast syndication]]: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases, other companies, TV stations, or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

First-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on [[local programming]].

===Genres===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2014}}
[[Television genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.

Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime soap operas. Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. ''Reality TV'' shows "regular" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'') to significant weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing regular jobs (''[[The Simple Life]]'').

Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  "[[quality television]]", include series such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are "quality television", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.

]]

Around the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2&amp;nbsp;million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9&amp;nbsp;billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 – Markets, Trends Facts &amp; Figures (2008–2013)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008–09)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%–50% TV advertising revenues, 40%–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
{{main article|Television advertisement}}

TV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers ("sponsors") to fund their programming.&lt;ref name="Hornick"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917000611/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml |date=17 September 2010 }} "That Was the Year That Was" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in [[American English]], and known in [[British English]] as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length [[infomercial]]s). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.

[[File:Radio News Sep 1928 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Television was still in its experimental phase in 1928, but the medium's potential to sell goods was already predicted.]]

The effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as [[Marshall McLuhan]]. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as [[Nielsen Media Research]], is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a "daypart"). In many countries, including the United States, television [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] are considered indispensable for a [[political campaign]]. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Plasser, ''Global Political Campaigning'', p226&lt;/ref&gt; while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.

The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase "Bulova Watch Time", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.&lt;ref&gt;"Imagery For Profit" R.W. Stewart, New York Times, 6 July 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WNBT/Bulova test pattern|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 September 1955, advertising [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on [[Nippon Television]] in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising [[Seikosha]] (now [[Seiko]]), which also displayed a clock with the current time.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:コマーシャルメッセージ|コマーシャルメッセージ (Commercial message)]], Retrieved 24 November 2013{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
Since inception in the US in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |title=1940–1949 C.E. : Media History Project : U of M |publisher=Mediahistory.umn.edu |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025200852/http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html |title=The American Experience &amp;#124; Quiz Show Scandal &amp;#124; People &amp; Events &amp;#124; The Aftermath of the Quiz Show Scandal |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.

US advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular [[American Idol]], while the same amount of time for the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created "news" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart]] of "[[The Daily Show]]" was mock-outraged at this, saying, "That's what we do!", and calling it a new form of television, "infoganda".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films |year=1994 |isbn= 0-7864-1904-0 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a [[product placement]]). Sometimes, a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)

=====United Kingdom=====
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a "licence to print money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115610/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]], is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.

=====Ireland=====
Broadcast advertising is regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/General-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf General Commercial Communications Code] and [http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Childrens-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf Children’s Commercial Communications Code], referenced in: {{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/index.php/2010/05/bai-launches-revised-broadcasting-codes/|title=BAI launches Revised Broadcasting Codes|date=May 2010|publisher=Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|accessdate=1 May 2016}};&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription====
Some TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.

====Taxation or license====
Television services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:
* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])
* [[Belgium]] ([[RTBF]])
* [[Denmark]] ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])
* Ireland ([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]])
* Japan ([[NHK]])
* [[Norway]] ([[NRK]])
* [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])
* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])
* United States ([[PBS]])

The [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8&amp;nbsp;million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/|title=TV Licensing-FOI: Licences facts and figures |publisher=tvlicensing.co.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.

The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045049/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |archivedate=5 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report – Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels costs £147 a year (about US$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of TV sets owned; the price is reduced by two thirds if only black and white television is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Licence types and costs|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/tv-licence-types-and-costs-top2|website=tvlicensing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.

Other than internal promotional material, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years. In the 2014/15 federal budget, the ABC received A$1.11&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/abc-spent-nearly-50m-on-redundancy-payouts-after-coalition-budget-cuts-hit | title=ABC spent nearly $50m on redundancy payouts after Coalition budget cuts hit | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.

In France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax ("la redevance audiovisuelle").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212316/http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html |date=1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo| reception fee |受信料|Jushinryō}}). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.

===Broadcast programming===
{{main|Broadcast programming}}
{{see also|TV listings (UK)}}
Broadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.

==Social aspects==
{{Main article|Social aspects of television}}
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|American family watching television, circa 1958]]
Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as [[media violence]]. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;Butler, Fionnuala, Cynthia Pickett.  "Imaginary Friends." ''Scientific American''. 28 July 2009.  Web.  26 March 2010.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=imaginary-friends&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that [[educational television]] has many advantages. The article "The Good Things about Television"&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2006|title=The Good Things About Television|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.

===Consumption===
{{main|Television consumption}}

==Negative impacts==
With high lead content in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which ([[LCD]]s) use lamps which contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], there is growing concern about [[electronic waste]] from discarded televisions. Related [[occupational health]] concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing [[electrical energy]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |publisher=Energy Saving Trust |title=The Rise of the Machines: A Review of Energy Using Products in the Home from the 1970s to Today |date=3 July 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828072528/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in ''[[The Journal of Human Resources]]'' found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hernæs, Ø., Markussen, S., Røed, K. 2017.

Human Resources. doi: 10.3368/jhr.54.2.0316.7819R1. http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2017/10/02/jhr.54.2.0316.7819R1.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Happy Hooker: My Own Story''''' is a best-selling [[memoir]] by [[Xaviera Hollander]], a [[call girl]], published in 1971. It sold over 20 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20080626_Philmadelphia.html The Philadelphia Inquirer] on ''The Happy Hooker'': "He said he found it fascinating that her book, which has sold 20 million copies to date, is still being picked up today." (26 June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; copies.
[[Robin Moore]], who took Hollander's dictations of the book's contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy either transcribed the book&lt;ref name=Hollander1971&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Happy Hooker: My Own Story |publisher=Sphere Books |year=1971 |isbn=0-06-001416-4 |last=Hollander |first=Xaviera }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ghostwrote it.&lt;ref&gt;John Cassidy, "The hell-raiser", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 9 December 2000, Good Weekend, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==
Hollander's book inspired a series of movies, starting with 1975's ''[[The Happy Hooker (film)|The Happy Hooker]],'' which starred [[Lynn Redgrave]].&lt;ref name=IMDbHH1975&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Hooker (1975)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073091/|via=IMDb|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was followed by two sequels: 1977's ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]''&lt;ref name=IMDbHH1977&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington (1977)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076125/|via=IMDb|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980's ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood]].''&lt;ref name=IMDbHH1980&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080839/|via=IMDb|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sequels the role of Hollander was played by [[Joey Heatherton]] and [[Martine Beswick]] respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''Union of Soviet Writers''', '''USSR Union of Writers''', or  '''Soviet Union of Writers''' ({{lang-ru| Союз писателей СССР|translit=Soyuz Sovetstikh Pisatelei}}) was a [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|creative union]] of professional writers in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Garrard| first = John|author2=Carol Garrard | title = Inside the Soviet Writers' Union| page = xv | location = London| date = 1990| publisher = Tauris| isbn = 9781850432609}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1932 on the initiative of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] after disbanding a number of other writers' organizations: [[RAPP (organization)|RAPP]], [[Proletkult]], and [[VOAPP]].

The aim of the Union was to achieve Party and State control in the field of literature. For professional writers, membership of the Union became effectively obligatory, and non-members had much more limited opportunities for publication. The result was that exclusion from the Union meant a virtual ban on publication. In spite of this, the history of the Union of Writers also saw cases of voluntary self-exclusion from its cadre. Thus [[Vasily Aksenov]], [[Simeon Lipkin]] and [[Inna Lisnyanskaya]] left the Union of Writers in a show of solidarity following the exclusion of [[Victor Yerofeev]] and [[Yevgeni Anatolyevich Popov|Yevgeny Popov]] in punishment for self-publishing.

After the [[fall of Soviet Union]], the Union of Soviet Writers was divided into separate organizations for each of the [[Post-Soviet states]]. The Russian section was transformed into the ''[[Union of Russian Writers]]''.

== Chairmen ==

The post of chairman of the Union of Writers has been held by:

* [[Maxim Gorky]] (1934–1936)
* [[Vladimir Stavsky]] (1936–1938)
* [[Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeyev]] (1938–1944 and 1946–1954)
* [[Nikolay Semenovich Tikhonov|Nikolai Tikhonov]] (1944–1946)
* [[Alexey Surkov]] (1954–1959)
* [[Konstantin Fedin]] (1959–1977)
* [[George Markov]] (1977–1986)
* [[Vladimir Karpov]] (1986–1991)

==Publication==
From January 1946 to December 1990 the Union published a journal titled ''Soviet Literature Monthly''.  The title was later shortened to  ''Soviet Literature''.  The journal published translations of Soviet literature.  It was issued in English, French, German, Spanish, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, and Slovak editions.

'''Vernon Kilns''' was an [[United States|American]] [[ceramic]] company in [[Vernon, California]]. In July 1931, Faye G. Bennison purchased the former Poxon China pottery renaming the company Vernon Kilns.&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;  Poxon China was located at 2300 East 52nd Street.&lt;ref name=chip01&gt;{{cite book|last=Chipman|first=Jack|title=Collector's Encyclopedia of California Pottery|year=1999|publisher=Schiffer Publishing LTD|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-57432-037-8|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Vernon produced ceramic tableware, art ware, giftware, and figurines.  The company closed its doors in 1958.

Vernon Kilns was one of the "Big Five"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Colored Pottery, California Manufacturers Lead the World in Beauty of Design and Coloring|journal=California Magazine of Pacific Business|date=September 1937|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[California pottery|California potteries]].  The other "Big Five" potteries were [[Metlox Pottery|Metlox Manufacturing Company]], [[Pacific Pottery|Pacific Clay Products]], [[Gladding, McBean|Gladding, McBean &amp; Co]]., and [[Bauer Pottery|J.A. Bauer Pottery]].

== History ==

After the purchase of Poxon China in 1931, Vernon Kilns under Faye Bennison's direction continued to sell and produce Poxon China's patterns, using decals for the surface patterns. Vernon/Poxon pottery is notable for its heavier weight, and features embossed and scalloped rims. Vernon continued to produce a number of original Poxon patterns until 1933 when an earthquake destroyed most of the remaining Vernon/Poxon China ware stock. As a result, Vernon Kilns took the opportunity to create a new set of dinnerware molds: The result was the pottery company’s first original dinnerware shape, ''Montecito''.&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Maxine F|title=Collectible Vernon Kilns|edition=2nd |year=2004|publisher=Collector Books|location=Paducah, KY|isbn=1-57432-370-9| pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Vernon introduced their first solid color dinnerware line, ''Early California'', to complete with the other solid color dinnerware offerings popularized by potteries such as [[Bauer Pottery|J.A. Bauer Pottery]] and [[Pacific Pottery|Pacific Clay Products]]. In the approximately 15 years that ''Early California'' was manufactured, it was produced in 11 high-gloss glazes, including yellow, turquoise, green, brown, dark blue, light blue, ivory, orange, pink, white and maroon.

In the mid-1930s, Vernon established an art ware department, but suspended production of their art ware lines in 1937 due to poor economic conditions. In 1935, Gale Turnbull was hired as the art director, and under the direction of Faye Bennison, hired a series of contract designers and artists to create tableware and art ware. The roster of artists included May &amp; Vieve Hamilton, who joined Vernon from 1936 to 1937 to create a series of vases, figurines, plaques as well as two dinnerware lines: ''Rippled'' and ''Rythmic''. Designer Harry Bird came on board during the same period and using his patented “inlaid glaze” process, produced a variety of decorated dinnerware patterns in animal, floral and bird motifs on the Montecito shape. Jane Bennison, daughter of Faye Bennison, worked summers at the pottery and contributed art ware designs, and is credited with the design of the distinctive upside-down handle on the ''Ultra'' dinnerware shape of the 1940s.

Vernon continued to hire well-known artists to create new dinnerware patterns. [[Rockwell Kent]] designed three dinnerware sets based on his famous woodcuts: ''Salamina'', ''[[Moby Dick]]'', &amp; ''Our America''.  [[Don Blanding]], a [[Hawaii]]an poet and illustrator designed four basic tropical design patterns for tableware. Vernon Kilns signed a contract in 1940 with [[Walt Disney Productions]] to make [[figurine]]s based on [[Walt Disney|Walt Disney's]] films: [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]],  [[Dumbo]], and [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]].  Vernon also manufactured art ware based on the film Fantasia.

Janice Pettee sculpted and designed a series of celebrity figurines including [[Sally Rand]] [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Madeleine Carroll]], [[Anne Shirley (actress)|Anne Shirley]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Lynne Overman]], [[Victor McLaglen]], [[Evelyn Venable]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Preston Foster]], [[Walter Hampden]], [[Dorothy Lamour]], and [[Bette Davis]].

Prior to [[World War II]], Vernon Kilns ceased production of art ware, however continued to manufacture dinnerware and specialty ware. During the war, Vernon created a new set of English-style dinnerware molds and patterns to meet the demands of consumers who could no longer purchase imported dinnerware. This shape, known as ''Melinda'', featured an embossed rope motif and was decorated in approximately 24 different patterns between 1942 and 1955.

In April 1946, a fire in a drying room destroyed most of the pottery plant including much of their manufacturing equipment.&lt;ref name=labriefs&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Los Angeles briefs |url=http://search.proquest.co/docview/165650829 |newspaper= Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles |date=1946-04-18 |access-date=2015-07-20|via=ProQuest |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon quickly rebuilt, but the company suffered another devastating fire in 1947. They rebuilt their manufacturing facility again, taking the opportunity to modernize. The old beehive kilns were replaced with modern tunnel kilns that dramatically increased production capacity.

Vernon Kilns produced transfer-print specialty ware that could be special ordered.  Custom decal plates, as special order items, were produced for department stores, for promotional advertisement, for commemorative events, and for the tourist trade.

In 1952, Elliot House was hired as art director and continued to work with outside contract artists and designers such as Jean Goodwin Ames and Sharon Merrill. In 1955, Faye Bennison retired. By 1958, Vernon Kilns and several other potteries, including Santa Anita Pottery and Brock Pottery, closed their businesses due to mounting labor costs and competition from foreign imports. [[Metlox Pottery|Metlox Manufacturing Company]], [[Manhattan Beach, California]], bought the molds and continued to manufacture some of Vernon's patterns in their Vernonware division.
