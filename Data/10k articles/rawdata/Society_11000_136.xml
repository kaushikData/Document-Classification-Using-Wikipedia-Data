==Connotations of the word adivāsi==
The word Adivasi means the first inhabitants or the Indigenous People, a phrase recognised by the Supreme Court of India&lt;ref&gt;S. Faizi &amp; Priya K. Nair, 2016. "Adivasis: The World’s Largest Population of Indigenous People," Development, Palgrave Macmillan;Society for International Deveopment, vol. 59(3), pages 350-353, December.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tribe woman, India.jpg|thumb|170px|Woman of Banni tribe in traditional attire from [[Gujarat]]]]
Although terms such as ''atavika'', ''vanavāsi'' ("forest dwellers"), or ''girijan'' ("mountain people")&lt;ref&gt;Elst, Koenraad: (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; are also used for the tribes of India, ''adivāsi'' carries the specific meaning of being the original and [[indigenous peoples|autochthon]]ous inhabitants of a given region. It is a modern [[Sanskrit]] word specifically coined for that purpose in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="barnes1995"&gt;{{Citation | title=Indigenous peoples of Asia |author1=Robert Harrison Barnes |author2=Andrew Gray |author3=Benedict Kingsbury | publisher=Association for Asian Studies | year=1995 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-8eBAAAAMAAJ | isbn=0-924304-14-6 | quote="The Concept of the Adivāsi: According to the political activists who coined the word in the 1930s, the "adivāsis" are the original inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''ādi'' 'beginning, origin' and ''vāsin'' 'dweller' (itself from ''vas'' 'to dwell'), thus literally meaning ‘original inhabitant’.&lt;ref&gt;"Adivasi, n. and adj." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 10 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, unlike the terms "aborigines" or "tribes", the word "adivasi" has developed a connotation of past autonomy disrupted during the [[British Raj|British colonial period]] in India and not yet having been restored.&lt;ref name="waite2006"&gt;{{Citation | title=Embodied Working Lives: Work and Life in Maharashtra, India | author=Louise Waite | publisher=Lexington Books | year=2006 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=gLm6WmbFsA0C | isbn=0-7391-0876-X | quote="The scheduled tribes themselves tend to refer to their ethnic grouping as adivāsis, which means 'original inhabitant.' Hardiman continues to argue that the term adivāsi is preferable in India as it evokes a shared history of relative freedom in precolonial times ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, opposition to usage of the term is varied. Critics argue that the "original inhabitant" contention is based on the fact that they have no land and are therefore asking for a land reform. The adivasis argue that they have been oppressed by the "superior group" and that they require and demand a reward, more specifically land reform.&lt;ref name="ghurye1980"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Scheduled Tribes of India | author=Govind Sadashiv Ghurye | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=1980 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=9qt2e8xc-M4C | isbn=0-87855-692-3 | quote="I have stated above, while ascertaining the general attitude of Mr. Jaipal Singh to tribal problems, his insistence on the term 'Adivāsi' being used for Schedule Tribes... Sir, myself I claim to an Adivāsi and an original inhabitant of the country as Mr. Jaipal Singh pal... a pseudo-ethno-historical substantiation for the term 'Adivāsi'."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adivasi issues are not related to land reforms but to the historical rights to the forests that were alienated during the colonial period and India finally made a law to 'undo the historical injustice' committed to the Adivasis&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scheduled_Tribes_and_Other_Traditional_Forest_Dwellers_(Recognition_of_Forest_Rights)_Act,_2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northeast India]], the term adivāsi applies only to the [[Tea-tribes of Assam|Tea-tribes]] imported from Central India during colonial times.

==Geographical overview==

[[File:Ao tribesman at his village for festival celebration Nagaland India.jpg|thumb|160px|Naga man dressed in traditional attire from [[Nagaland]]]]

A substantial [[list of Scheduled Tribes in India]] are recognised as tribal under the [[Constitution of India]]. Tribal people constitute 8.6% of the nation's total population, over 104&amp;nbsp;million people according to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]]. One concentration lives in a belt along the [[Himalaya]]s stretching through [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], and [[Uttarakhand]] in the west, to [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], and [[Nagaland]] in the northeast. In the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland, more than 90% of the population is tribal. However, in the remaining northeast states of Assam, Manipur, [[Sikkim]], and Tripura, tribal peoples form between 20 and 30% of the population. Other tribal peoples, including the [[Santals]], live in [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]]. Central Indian states have the country's largest tribes, and, taken as a whole, roughly 75% of the total tribal population live there, although the tribal population there accounts for only around 10% of the region's total population.

Smaller numbers of tribal people are found in [[Odisha]] in eastern India; [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]], and [[Kerala]] in southern India; in western India in [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]], and in the union territories of [[Lakshadweep]] and the [[Andaman Islands]] and [[Nicobar Islands]]. About one percent of the populations of Kerala and Tamil Nadu are tribal, whereas about six percent in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and Karnataka are members of tribes.

===Scheduled tribes===
The term 'Scheduled Tribes'(ST's) first appeared in the Constitution of India. Article 366 (25) defined scheduled tribes as "such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this constitution". Article 342, which is reproduced below, prescribes procedure to be followed in the matter of specification of scheduled tribes.

==Particularly vulnerable tribal groups==
The Scheduled Tribe groups who were identified as more isolated from the wider community and who maintain a distinctive cultural identity have been categorised as 'Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups' (PTGs) previously known as Primitive Tribal Groups)  by the Government at the Centre. So far seventy-five tribal communities have been identified as 'particularly vulnerable tribal groups' in different States of India. These hunting, food-gathering, and some agricultural communities, have been identified as less acculturated tribes among the tribal population groups and in need of special programmes for their sustainable development. The tribes are awakening and demanding their rights for special reservation quota for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sci.tech-archive.net/pdf/Archive/sci.anthropology.paleo/2006-06/msg00409.pdf |title=New Book: ''Anthropology of Primitive Tribes in India'' |access-date=26 February 2009 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090226073900/http://sci.tech-archive.net/pdf/Archive/sci.anthropology.paleo/2006-06/msg00409.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient India===

Although considered uncivilised and primitive,&lt;ref name="irudayam2004"&gt;{{Citation | title=Adivasis Speak Out: Atrocities Against Adivasis in Tamil Nadu |author1=Aloysius Irudayam |author2=Jayshree P.

Although regarded by some British scholars as inferior to caste Hindus, the status of "adivasis" in practice most often paralleled that of the Hindus ...

===Medieval India===
The historiography of relationships between the Advasis and the rest of the Indian society is patchy. There are references to alliances between Ahom Kings of Brahmaputra valley and the hill Nagas &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Dalit-tribal/2003/adivasi.htm PUCL Bulletin, February 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;
This relative autonomy and collective ownership of adivasi land by adivasis was severely disrupted by the advent of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the early 16th century. Rebellions against Mughal authority include the Bhil Rebellion of 1632 and the Bhil-Gond Insurrection of 1643&lt;ref&gt;P. 27 ''Madhya Pradesh: Shajapur'' By Madhya Pradesh (India)&lt;/ref&gt; which were both pacified by Mughal soldiers. With the advent of the Kachwaha Rajputs and Mughals into their territory, the Meenas were gradually sidelined and pushed deep into the forests. As a result, historical literature has completely bypassed the Meena tribe. The combined army of Mughals and Bharmal attacked the tribal king Bada Meena and killed him damaging 52 kots and 56 gates. Bada's treasure was shared between Mughals and Bharmal.

===British period===
From the very early days of British rule, the tribesmen resented the British encroachments upon their tribal system.

==Tribal classification criteria and demands==
[[File:Great Andamanese scarification pattern 2 - 1901.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Scarification]], a traditional symbol of [[Great Andamanese]] tribal identity (1901 photo)]]
Population complexities, and the controversies surrounding ethnicity and language in India, sometimes make the official recognition of groups as adivasis (by way of inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes list) political and contentious. However, regardless of their language family affiliations, Australoid and Negrito groups that have survived as distinct forest, mountain or island dwelling tribes in India and are often classified as adivasi.&lt;ref name="minahan1996"&gt;{{Citation | title=Nations Without States: A Historical Dictionary of Contemporary National Movements | author=James Minahan and [[Leonard W. Doob]] | year=1996 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | isbn=0-313-28354-0 | publisher=Greenwood Press | url=https://books.google.com/?id=2yFnAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... The Adivasi tribes encompass the pre-Dravidian holdovers from ancient India ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively autonomous Mongoloid tribal groups of Northeastern India (including Khasis, [[Apatani people|Apatani]] and [[Naga people|Nagas]]), who are mostly Austro-Asiatic or Tibeto-Burman speakers, are also considered to be adivasis: this area comprises 7.5% of India's land area but 20% of its adivasi population.&lt;ref name="singh2005"&gt;{{Citation | title=India |author1=Sarina Singh |author2=Joe Bindloss |author3=Paul Clammer |author4=Janine Eberle | year=2005 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | isbn=1-74059-694-3 | publisher=Lonely Planet | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC | quote=''... Although the northeast states make up just 7.5% of the geographical area of India, the region is home to 20% of India's Adivasis (tribal people). The following are the main tribes ... Nagas ...

Khasi ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all autonomous northeastern groups are considered adivasis; for instance, the Tibeto-Burman-speaking [[Meitei people|Meitei]] of Manipur were once tribal but, having been settled for many centuries, are caste Hindus.&lt;ref name="singh1988js"&gt;{{Citation | title=Religion and Culture of Manipur | author=Moirangthem Kirti Singh | year=1988 | accessdate=2008-11-26 | publisher=Manas Publications | url=https://books.google.com/?id=doQeAAAAMAAJ | isbn=81-7049-021-9 | quote=''...

It is also difficult, for a given social grouping, to definitively decide whether it is a 'caste' or a 'tribe'. A combination of internal social organisation, relationship with other groups, self-classification and perception by other groups has to be taken into account to make a categorisation, which is at best inexact and open to doubt.&lt;ref name="raigobi1972"&gt;{{Citation | title=Man | publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland | date=1972|volume= v.7 | accessdate=2008-11-26 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ou8rAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... Nor, for that matter, does a traits approach to drawing distinctions between tribe and caste lead to any meaningful interpretation of social or civilizational processes. Social boundaries must be defined in each case (community or regional society) with reference to the modes of social classification, on the one hand, and processes of social interaction, on the other. It is in their inability to relate these two aspects of the social phenomenon through a model of social reality that most behavioural exercises come to grief ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categorisations have been diffused for thousands of years, and even ancient formulators of caste-discriminatory legal codes (which usually only applied to settled populations, and not adivasis) were unable to come up with clean distinctions.&lt;ref name="chattopadhyaya1959"&gt;{{Citation | title=Lōkayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism | author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya | publisher=People's Publishing House | year=1959 | accessdate=2008-11-26 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJccAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... Even the authors of our traditional law-codes and other works did not know whether to call a particular group of backward people a caste or a tribe ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demands for tribal classification===
The additional difficulty in deciding whether a group meets the criteria to be adivasi or not are the aspirational movements created by the federal and state benefits, including job and educational reservations, enjoyed by groups listed as scheduled tribes (STs).&lt;ref name="goldmann1984"&gt;{{Citation | title=From Independence to Statehood: Managing Ethnic Conflict in Five African and Asian States |author1=Robert Goldmann |author2=A.

Because the question of what groups are to be given preferences is constitutionally and politically open, the demand for preferences becomes a device for political mobilisation.

===Endogamy, exogamy and ethnogenesis===
Part of the challenge is that the [[endogamy|endogamous]] nature of tribes is also conformed to by the vast majority of Hindu castes. Indeed, many historians and anthropologists believe that caste endogamy reflects the once-tribal origins of the various groups who now constitute the settled Hindu castes.&lt;ref name="rajawat2003"&gt;{{Citation | title=Scheduled Castes in India: a Comprehensive Study | author=Mamta Rajawat | publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt.

Some anthropologists, however, draw a distinction between tribes who have continued to be tribal and tribes that have been absorbed into caste society in terms of the breakdown of tribal (and therefore caste) boundaries, and the proliferation of new mixed caste groups. In other words, ethnogenesis (the construction of new ethnic identities) in tribes occurs through a fission process (where groups splinter-off as new tribes, which preserves endogamy), whereas with settled castes it usually occurs through intermixture (in violation of strict endogamy).&lt;ref name="trautmann1997"&gt;{{Citation | title=Aryans and British India | author=Thomas R.

===Other criteria===
Unlike castes, which form part of a complex and interrelated local economic exchange system, tribes tend to form self-sufficient economic units. For most tribal people, land-use rights traditionally derive simply from tribal membership. Tribal society tends to the egalitarian, with its [[leadership]] based on ties of kinship and personality rather than on hereditary status. Tribes typically consist of [[segmentary lineage]]s whose extended families provide the basis for social organisation and control. Tribal religion recognises no authority outside the tribe.

Any of these criteria may not apply in specific instances. Language does not always give an accurate indicator of tribal or caste status. Especially in regions of mixed population, many tribal groups have lost their original languages and simply speak local or regional languages. In parts of Assam—an area historically divided between warring tribes and villages—increased contact among villagers began during the colonial period, and has accelerated since independence in 1947. A [[pidgin]] [[Assamese language|Assamese]] developed, whereas educated tribal members learnt [[Hindi]] and, in the late twentieth century, English.

Self-identification and group loyalty do not provide unfailing markers of tribal identity either. In the case of stratified tribes, the loyalties of clan, kin, and family may well predominate over those of tribe. In addition, tribes cannot always be viewed as people living apart; the degree of isolation of various tribes has varied tremendously. The [[Gondi people|Gond]]s, [[Santal]]s, and [[Bhil]]s traditionally have dominated the regions in which they have lived. Moreover, tribal society is not always more egalitarian than the rest of the rural populace; some of the larger tribes, such as the Gonds, are highly stratified.

The apparently wide fluctuation in estimates of South Asia's tribal population through the twentieth century gives a sense of how unclear the distinction between tribal and nontribal can be. India's 1931 census enumerated 22&amp;nbsp;million tribal people, in 1941 only 10&amp;nbsp;million were counted, but by 1961 some 30&amp;nbsp;million and in 1991 nearly 68&amp;nbsp;million tribal members were included. The differences among the figures reflect changing census criteria and the economic incentives individuals have to maintain or reject classification as a tribal member.

These gyrations of census data serve to underline the complex relationship between caste and tribe. Although, in theory, these terms represent different ways of life and ideal types, in reality they stand for a continuum of social groups. In areas of substantial contact between tribes and castes, social and cultural pressures have often tended to move tribes in the direction of becoming castes over a period of years. Tribal peoples with ambitions for social advancement in Indian society at large have tried to gain the classification of caste for their tribes. On occasion, an entire tribe or part of a tribe joined a Hindu sect and thus entered the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] ''en masse''. If a specific tribe engaged in practices that Hindus deemed polluting, the tribe's status when it was assimilated into the caste hierarchy would be affected.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Tribal religions in India}}
The majority of Adivasi practice Hinduism and Christianity. During the last two decades Adivasi from [[Odisha]], Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand have converted to Protestant groups.
Adivasi beliefs vary by tribe, and are usually different from the [[historical Vedic religion]], with its [[monism|monistic]] underpinnings, Indo-European deities (who are often [[cognates]] of ancient Iranian, Greek and Roman deities, e.g. [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]/[[Mithra]]/[[Mithras]]), lack of [[Idolatry|idol worship]] and lack of a concept of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="scudiere1997"&gt;{{Citation | title=Aspects of Death and Bereavement Among Indian Hindus and American Christians: A Survey and Cross-cultural Comparison | author=Todd Scudiere | publisher=University of Wisconsin&amp;nbsp;– Madison | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=gQVlAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... the Vedic Aryan was not particularly eager to enter heaven, he was too much this-worldly oriented.

===Animism===
{{Main article|Animism}}
[[Animism]] (from [[Latin]] ''animus, -i'' "[[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[life]]") is the [[worldview]] that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena) possess a spiritual essence. The ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Society'' estimates that 1–5% of India's population is animist.&lt;ref&gt;http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Animism.htm&lt;/ref&gt; India's government recognises that India's indigenous subscribe to pre-Hindu animist-based religions.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5019582.stm#graph|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; Europe &amp;#124; Indigenous people 'worst-off world over'|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Racism Against Indigenous Peoples|author1=Chakma, S.|author2=Jensen, M.|author3=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|date=2001|publisher=IWGIA|isbn=9788790730468|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7EPoTyUvfkC&amp;pg=PA196|page=196|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animistic perspective is so fundamental, mundane, everyday and taken-for-granted that most animistic indigenous people do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to "animism" (or even "religion");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native American Religious and Cultural Freedom: An Introductory Essay|work=The Pluralism Project|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College and Diana Eck|year=2005|url=http://www.pluralism.org/reports/view/176}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is an [[Emic and etic|anthropological construct]] rather than one designated by the people themselves.

====Sanamahi====
{{Main article|Sanamahism}}
[[Sanamahism]] is the worship of Sanamahi, the eternal force/cells responsible for the continuity of living creations. Sanamahi referred here is not to be confused with Lainingthou Sanamahi (The Supreme House-dwelling God of the Sanamahism). The religion has a great and unique traditional history which has been preserved till date for worshipping ancestors as almighty. Thus it signifies that Sanamahism is the worship of eternal force/cells present in living creations.

Sidaba Mapu, the Creator God of Sanamahism. Sanamahism is one of the oldest religion of [[South East Asia]]. It originated in [[Manipur]] and is mainly practiced by the [[Meitei people|Meitei]], [[Kabui]], [[Zeliangrong]] and other communities who inhabit in Manipur, [[Assam]], [[Tripura]].

====Adivasi sants====
A sant is an Indian holy man, and a title of a devotee or ascetic, especially in north and east India. Generally a holy or saintly person is referred to as a mahatma, paramahamsa, or swami, or given the prefix Sri or Srila before their name. The term is sometimes misrepresented in English as "[[Hindu saint]]", although "sant" is unrelated to "saint".

====Other tribals and Hinduism====

Some Hindus believe that Indian tribals are close to the romantic ideal of the ancient [[Wiktionary:silvan|silvan]] culture&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Parkhill: The Forest Setting in Hindu Epics.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Vedic people. [[Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar]] said:

{{quotation|The tribals "can be given [[Upanayana|yajñopavîta]] (...) They should be given equal rights and footings in the matter of religious rights, in temple worship, in the study of Vedas, and in general, in all our social and religious affairs. This is the only right solution for all the problems of casteism found nowadays in our Hindu society."&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Golwalkar: Bunch of Thoughts, p.479.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the [[Lingaraj Temple]] in [[Bhubaneswar]], there are [[Brahmin]] and Badu (tribal) priests. The Badus have the most intimate contact with the deity of the temple, and only they can bathe and adorn it.&lt;ref&gt;JAIN, Girilal: The Hindu Phenomenon.

===Demands for a separate religious code===
Some Adivasi organisations have demanded that a distinct religious code be listed for Adivasis in the 2011 census of India. The All India Adivasi Conference was held on 1 and 2 January 2011 at Burnpur, Asansol, West Bengal. 750 delegates were present from all parts of India and cast their votes for Religion code as follows: [[Sari Dhorom]]&amp;nbsp;– 632, [[Sarnaism|Sarna]]&amp;nbsp;– 51, [[Kherwalism]]&amp;nbsp;– 14 and Other Religions&amp;nbsp;– 03.

==Tribal system==

Tribals are not part of the caste system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4071703.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plight of India's tribal peoples | date=10 December 2004 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually constitute egalitarian societies. Christian tribals do not automatically lose their traditional tribal rules.

When in 1891 a missionary asked 150 [[Munda people|Munda]] Christians to "inter-dine" with people of different rank, only 20 Christians did so, and many converts lost their new faith. Father Haghenbeek concluded on this episode that these rules are not "pagan", but a sign of "national sentiment and pride", and wrote:

{{quotation|
"On the contrary, while proclaiming the equality of all men before God, we now tell them: preserve your race pure, keep our customs, refrain from eating with Lohars (blacksmiths), Turis (bamboo workers) and other people of lower rank. To become good Christians, it (inter-dining) is not required."&lt;ref&gt;A. Van Exem: "The Mistake, reviewed after a century", Sevartham 1991 may. Elst 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, many scholars argue that the claim that tribals are an egalitarian society in contrast to a caste-based society is a part of a larger political agenda by some to maximise any differences from tribal and urban societies. According to scholar [[Koenraad Elst]], caste practices and social taboos among Indian tribals date back to antiquity:

{{quotation|
"The Munda tribals not only practise tribal [[endogamy]] and [[Wiktionary:commensality|commensality]], but also observe a [[jâti]] division within the tribe, buttressed by notions of social pollution, a mythological explanation and harsh punishments.

A Munda Catholic theologian testifies: The tribals of [[Chhotanagpur]] are an [[endogamous]] tribe. They usually do not marry outside the tribal community, because to them the tribe is sacred. The way to salvation is the tribe. Among the Santals, it is tabooed to marry outside the tribe or inside ones clan, just as Hindus marry inside their [[caste]] and outside their [[gotra]]. More precisely: To protect their tribal solidarity, the [[Santal]]s have very stringent marriage laws. A Santal cannot marry a non-Santal or a member of his own clan. The former is considered as a threat to the tribe's integrity, while the latter is considered incestuous. Among the [[Ho language|Ho]] of Chhotanagpur, the trespasses which occasion the exclusion from the tribe without chance of appeal, are essentially those concerning endogamy and [[exogamy]]."

Inter-dining has also been prohibited by many Indian tribal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;veddha{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tribal communities in India are the least educationally developed. First generation learners have to face social, psychological and cultural barriers to get education. This has been one of the reason for poor performance of tribal students in schools.&lt;ref name="ssa.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssa.nic.in/research-studies-docs/education_tribal_children.pdf/view|publisher=web.archive.org|title=Education of Tribal Children in India&amp;nbsp;— Portal|accessdate=2017-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404082640/http://ssa.nic.in/research-studies-docs/education_tribal_children.pdf/view|archivedate=4 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor literacy rate since independence has resulted in absence of tribals in academia and higher education. The literacy rate for STs has gone up from 8.5% (male&amp;nbsp;– 13.8%, female&amp;nbsp;– 3.2%) in 1961 to 29.6% (male&amp;nbsp;– 40.6%, female&amp;nbsp;– 18.2%) in 1991 and to 40% (male&amp;nbsp;– 59%, female&amp;nbsp;– 37%) in 1999–2000.&lt;ref name="ssa.nic.in"/&gt; States with large proportion of STs like Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya have high literacy rate while States with large number of tribals like Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have low tribal literacy rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001202/120281e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal students have very high drop-out rates during school education.&lt;ref name="newindianexpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/School-Dropout-Rate-Among-Tribals-Remains-High/2014/05/03/article2203265.ece|publisher=newindianexpress.com|title=School Dropout Rate Among Tribals Remains High- The New Indian Express|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extending the system of primary education into tribal areas and reserving places for needing them, they say, to work in the fields. On the other hand, in those parts of the northeast where tribes have generally been spared the wholesale onslaught of outsiders, schooling has helped tribal people to secure political and economic benefits. The education system there has provided a corps of highly trained tribal members in the professions and high-ranking administrative posts. tribal children in middle and high schools and higher education institutions are central to government policy, but efforts to improve a tribe's educational status have had mixed results. Recruitment of qualified teachers and determination of the appropriate language of instruction also remain troublesome. Commission after commission on the "language question" has called for instruction, at least at the primary level, in the students' native language. In some regions, tribal children entering school must begin by learning the official regional language, often one completely unrelated to their tribal language.

Many tribal schools are plagued by high drop-out rates. Children attend for the first three to four years of primary school and gain a smattering of knowledge, only to lapse into illiteracy later. Few who enter continue up to the tenth grade; of those who do, few manage to finish high school. Therefore, very few are eligible to attend institutions of higher education, where the high rate of attrition continues. Members of agrarian tribes like the Gonds often are reluctant to send their children to school,

An academy for teaching and preserving Adivasi languages and culture was established in 1999 by the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre. The Adivasi Academy is located at Tejgadh in Gujarat.

==Economy==
Most tribes are concentrated in heavily forested areas that combine inaccessibility with limited political or economic significance. Historically, the economy of most tribes was subsistence agriculture or hunting and gathering. Tribal members traded with outsiders for the few necessities they lacked, such as salt and iron. A few local Hindu craftsmen might provide such items as cooking utensils.

In the early 20th century, however, large areas fell into the hands of non-tribals, on account of improved transportation and communications. Around 1900, many regions were opened by the government to settlement through a scheme by which inward migrants received ownership of land free in return for cultivating it. For tribal people, however, land was often viewed as a common resource, free to whoever needed it. By the time tribals accepted the necessity of obtaining formal land titles, they had lost the opportunity to lay claim to lands that might rightfully have been considered theirs. The colonial and post-independence regimes belatedly realised the necessity of protecting tribals from the predations of outsiders and prohibited the sale of tribal lands. Although an important loophole in the form of land leases was left open, tribes made some gains in the mid-twentieth century, and some land was returned to tribal peoples despite obstruction by local police and land officials.

In the 1970s, tribal peoples came again under intense land pressure, especially in central India. Migration into tribal lands increased dramatically, as tribal people lost title to their lands in many ways&amp;nbsp;– lease, forfeiture from debts, or bribery of land registry officials. Other non-tribals simply squatted, or even lobbied governments to classify them as tribal to allow them to compete with the formerly established tribes. In any case, many tribal members became landless labourers in the 1960s and 1970s, and regions that a few years earlier had been the exclusive domain of tribes had an increasingly mixed population of tribals and non-tribals. Government efforts to evict nontribal members from illegal occupation have proceeded slowly; when evictions occur at all, those ejected are usually members of poor, lower castes.

Improved communications, roads with motorised traffic, and more frequent government intervention figured in the increased contact that tribal peoples had with outsiders. Commercial highways and cash crops frequently drew non-tribal people into remote areas. By the 1960s and 1970s, the resident nontribal shopkeeper was a permanent feature of many tribal villages. Since shopkeepers often sell goods on credit (demanding high interest), many tribal members have been drawn deeply into debt or mortgaged their land. Merchants also encourage tribals to grow cash crops (such as cotton or [[castor-oil]] plants), which increases tribal dependence on the market for necessities. Indebtedness is so extensive that although such transactions are illegal, traders sometimes 'sell' their debtors to other merchants, much like [[indenture]]d [[peon]]s.

The final blow for some tribes has come when nontribals, through political jockeying, have managed to gain legal tribal status, that is, to be listed as a Scheduled Tribe.

Tribes in the Himalayan foothills have not been as hard-pressed by the intrusions of non-tribal. Historically, their political status was always distinct from the rest of India. Until the British colonial period, there was little effective control by any of the empires centred in peninsular India; the region was populated by autonomous feuding tribes. The British, in efforts to protect the sensitive northeast frontier, followed a policy dubbed the "Inner Line"; non-tribal people were allowed into the areas only with special permission. Postindependence governments have continued the policy, protecting the Himalayan tribes as part of the strategy to secure the border with China.

Government policies on forest reserves have affected tribal peoples profoundly. Government efforts to reserve forests have precipitated armed (if futile) resistance on the part of the tribal peoples involved. Intensive exploitation of forests has often meant allowing outsiders to cut large areas of trees (while the original tribal inhabitants were restricted from cutting), and ultimately replacing mixed forests capable of sustaining tribal life with single-product plantations. Nontribals have frequently bribed local officials to secure effective use of reserved forest lands.

The northern tribes have thus been sheltered from the kind of exploitation that those elsewhere in South Asia have suffered. In [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly part of the [[North-East Frontier Agency]]), for example, tribal members control commerce and most lower-level administrative posts. Government construction projects in the region have provided tribes with a significant source of cash. Some tribes have made rapid progress through the education system (the role of early missionaries was significant in this regard). Instruction was begun in Assamese but was eventually changed to Hindi; by the early 1980s, English was taught at most levels. Northeastern tribal people have thus enjoyed a certain
measure of social mobility.

The continuing economic alienation and exploitation of many adivasis was highlighted as a "systematic failure" by the [[Prime Minister of India|Indian prime minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] in a 2009 conference of [[Chief Ministers of India|chief ministers]] of [[State of India|all 29 Indian states]], where he also cited this as a major cause of the [[Naxalite]] unrest that has affected areas such as the [[Red Corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-04/india/28079244_1_tribals-traditional-rights-land-acquisition | work=The Times of India | title=PM's snub to Maoists: Guns don't ensure development of tribals | date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8343193.stm | work=BBC News | title=Indian PM reaches out to tribes | date=4 November 2009 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-16/india/28113430_1_indigenous-peoples-traditional-knowledge-human-rights | work=The Times of India | first1=Rukmini | last1=Shrinivasan | title=Tribals make poor progress, stay at bottom of heap | date=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribuneindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091105/main2.htm|publisher=tribuneindia.com|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India&amp;nbsp;– Main News|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article42968.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Aarti | last=Dhar | title=Sustained economic activity not possible under shadow of gun: PM | date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aghul''' is a language spoken by the [[Aghul people|Aghuls]] in southern [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]] and in [[Azerbaijan]]. It is spoken by about 29,300&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/agx|title=Aghul|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; people (2010 census).

==Classification==
Aghul belongs to the Eastern Samur group of the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic]] branch of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] language family.

==Geographic distribution==
In 2002, Aghul was spoken by 28,300 people in Russia, mainly in Southern Dagestan, as well as 32 people in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=agx|title=Aghul|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Related languages===
There are nine languages in the Lezgian language family, namely: Aghul, [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]], [[Rutul language|Rutul]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]], [[Tsakhur language|Tsakhur]], [[Budukh language|Budukh]], [[Kryts language|Kryts]], [[Udi language|Udi]] and [[Archi language|Archi]].

==Phonology==
Aghul has contrastive [[epiglottal consonant]]s.&lt;ref name="LadMad"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aghul makes, like many Northeast Caucasian languages, a distinction between tense consonants with concomitant length and weak consonants. The tense consonants are characterized by the intensiveness (tension) of articulation, which naturally leads to a lengthening of the consonant so they are traditionally transcribed with the length diacritic. The gemination of the consonant itself does not create its tension, but morphologically tense consonants often derive from adjoining two single weak consonants. Some{{Which|date=January 2010}} Aghul dialects have an especially large number{{Vague|date=January 2010}} of permitted initial tense consonants.&lt;ref name="LadMad"/&gt;

* The [[glottal stop]] transcribed here is named rather ambiguously a "glottalic [[laryngeal consonant|laryngeal]]" by the source.
* The epigottal stop is included by Omniglot in the phoneme list, but not by TITUS DIDACTICA.
* Omniglot says that the lenis voiceless stops are [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]]. It also says that the [[epiglottal consonant|epiglottals]] are in fact [[pharyngeal consonants|pharyngeals]].&lt;ref name="omniglot.com"/&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}

===Case===
There are four core cases: absolutive, ergative, genitive, and dative, as well as a large series of location cases. All cases other than the absolutive (which is unmarked) and ergative take the ergative suffix before their own suffix.

===Adjectives===
Independent and predicative adjectives take number marker and class marker; also case if used as nominal. As attribute they are invariable.  Thus ''idžed'' "good", ergative, ''idžedi'', etc. ''-n, -s;'' pl. ''idžedar''; but ''Idže insandi hhuč qini'' "The good man killed the wolf" (subject in [[ergative case]]).

'''Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai''' ({{lang-ps|احمد شاه احمدزی}} - born 30 March 1944) is an Afghan [[politician]]. He served  as the prime minister of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996. He is an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] from the [[Ahmadzai (Ghilji clan)|Ahmadzai]] sub-tribe.

==Biography==
Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai was born in Malang, a village in the [[Khaki Jabbar District|Khaki Jabbar]] district of [[Kabul Province]].  He studied [[engineering]] at [[Kabul University]] and then worked in the agriculture ministry. In 1972 he received a scholarship to study in the United States, at [[Colorado State University]].  He received a master's degree in 1975 and became a professor at [[King Faisal University]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=iwpbro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?apc_state=hdriarr2004&amp;l=en&amp;s=f&amp;o=152930 |title=Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai: Islamist Insists He's Broken Armed Faction Ties |work=Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting |date=6 October 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929142800/http://www.iwpr.net/?apc_state=hdriarr2004&amp;l=en&amp;s=f&amp;o=152930 |archivedate=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Saur Revolution|communist coup]] in 1978, Ahmadzai returned to Afghanistan to join the [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|mujahideen]].  He was a close associate of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], being deputy of his [[Jamiat-e Islami]] party, but then left and joined [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]'s [[Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan]] party in 1992, the year that communist rule ended. He served as a minister in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|post-communist Afghan government]], variously as interior, construction and education minister, and later became prime minister between 1995 and 1996, although he has downplayed the import of these posts given the chaos due to the fighting at that time.&lt;ref name=iwpbro /&gt;

Ahmadzai left Afghanistan in 1996 after the government fled the [[Taliban#Origin|Taliban]] advance.  He lived in exile  in [[Istanbul]] and [[London]], before he returned to Afghanistan in 2001 after the fall of Taliban.&lt;ref name=iwpbro /&gt;  He was an independent candidate in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] supporting an Islamic system of government.&lt;ref name=iwpbro /&gt;  He secured 0.8% of the total votes counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.org.af/public_html/Election%20Results%20Website/english/english.htm |title=Afghanistan Presidential Results - 2004 |work=[[Independent Election Commission| Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan]] |date=4 November 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627125024/http://www.iec.org.af/public_html/Election%20Results%20Website/english/english.htm |archivedate=27 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is generally accepted that the Eskimo and Aleut peoples were part of a relatively late migration from Asia across the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]], between 4,000 and 6,000 years ago. During this period the [[Proto-Eskimo–Aleut language|Proto-Eskimo-Aleut]] language was spoken, which broke up around 2000 BC (contemporaneous with the split of [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]]). Differentiation of the two branches is thought to have happened in Alaska because of the linguistic diversity found in the Eskimo languages of Alaska relative to the entire geographic area where Eskimo languages are spoken (eastward through Canada to Greenland). After the split between the two branches, their development is thought to have occurred in relative isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-9|title=Eskimo-Aleut|last=Berge|first=Anna|date=June 2016|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of a culture associated with Aleut speakers on the Eastern Aleutian Islands as early as 4,000 years ago followed by a gradual expansion westward over the next 1,500 years to the Near Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The people at the end of the world: The Western Aleutians project and the archaeology of Shemya Island|last=Corbett, D., West, D., and Lefèvre, C.|first=|publisher=Aurora|year=2010|isbn=|location=Anchorage|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of another westward expansion about 1,000 year ago, which may explain the lack of obvious diversification among the Aleut dialects, with Eastern Aleut features having spread westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodbury|first=A.C.|date=1984|title=Eskimo and Aleut languages|url=|journal=Handbook of North American 42 Indians|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second westward expansion is characterized as a period of cultural affinity with southeastern Alaska and the Pacific Northwest Coast,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumond|first=D.|date=2001|title=Archaeology in the Aleut zone of Alaska, some recent research|url=|journal=Archaeology in the Aleut zone of Alaska, some recent research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain linguistic features that Aleut shares with neighboring non-Eskimo languages, such as rules of plural formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leer|first=J.|date=1991|title=Evidence for a Northwest Coast language area: Promiscuous number marking and periphrastic possessive constructions in Haida, Eyak, and Aleut|url=|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=57|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berge|first=Anna|date=2010|title=Origins of linguistic diversity in the Aleutian Islands|url=|journal=Human Biology|volume=82|pages=5–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to colonization by Russian colonizers and traders in the 18th and 19th centuries, Aleut has a large portion of Russian loanwords. However, they do not affect the basic vocabulary and thus do not suggest undue influence on the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Observations on the distribution patterns of Eskimo cognates and non-cognates in the basic Aleut (Unangam Tunuu) lexicon [poster]|last=Berge|first=Anna|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==

Within the Eastern group are the dialects of the Alaskan Peninsula, [[Unalaska]], [[Belkofski]], [[Akutan Island|Akutan]], the [[Pribilof Islands]], [[Kashega]] and [[Nikolski, Alaska|Nikolski]]. The Pribilof dialect has more living speakers than any other dialect of Aleut.

The Atkan grouping comprises the dialects of Atka and [[Bering Island]].

[[Attu Island|Attuan]] was a distinct dialect showing influence from both Atkan and Eastern Aleut. Copper Island Aleut (also called [[Medny Aleut language|Medny Aleut]]) is a Russian-Attuan [[mixed language]] ([[Medny Island|Copper Island]] ({{lang-ru|Медный}}, ''Medny'', ''Mednyj'') having been settled by Attuans).  Despite the name, today Copper Island Aleut is spoken only on Bering Island, as Copper Islanders were evacuated there in 1969.

All dialects show lexical influence from [[Russian language|Russian]]; Copper Island Aleut has also adopted many Russian inflectional endings.

==Orthography==
The modern practical Aleut orthography was designed in 1972 for the Alaska school system's bilingual program:{{sfn|Bergsland|1994|p=xvi}}

The historic Aleut ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]) alphabet found in both Alaska and Russia has the standard pre-1918 [[Russian alphabet|Russian orthography]] as its basis, although a number of Russian letters were used only in loanwords. In addition, the extended Cyrillic letters: г̑ (г with inverted breve), ҟ, ҥ, ў, х̑ (х with inverted breve) were used to represent distinctly Aleut sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hcOAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Опытъ Грамматики Алеутско-Лисьевскаго языка (Grammatical Outline of the Fox Island (Eastern) Aleut Language)|author=St. Innocent (Veniaminov)|publisher=Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences|location=St. Petersburg, Russia|year=1846|page=2|authorlink=Innocent_of_Alaska}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drtBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Начатки Христіанскаго Ученія – Букварь (Beginnings of Christian Teaching – Primer)|author=St. Innocent (Veniaminov)|author2=[[Jacob Netsvetov|St. Jacob (Netsvetov)]]|publisher=Synodal Typography|location=St. Petersburg, Russia|year=1893 |orig-year=1840|authorlink=Innocent_of_Alaska}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLRCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Алеутскій Букварь (Aleut Primer)|author=St. Innocent (Veniaminov)|author2=[[Jacob Netsvetov|St. Jacob (Netsvetov)]]|publisher=Synodal Typography|location=St. Petersburg, Russia|year=1893 |orig-year=1846|authorlink=Innocent_of_Alaska}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 24+ letters were used to represent distinctly Aleut words, including 6 vowels (а, и, й, у, ю, я) and 16 consonants (г, г̑, д, з, к, ҟ, л, м, н, ҥ, с, т, ў, х, х̑, ч). The letter [[Ka with stroke|ҟ]] has been used in modern Aleut Cyrillic publications to denote the letter [[Aleut Ka|ԟ]] (Aleut Ka) traditionally used to mark the [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}}.

:
The palato-alveolar affricate {{IPAslink|tʃ}} and uvular stop {{IPAslink|q}} are pronounced with strong aspiration.

Attuan labial fricative {{IPAslink|v}} is pronounced voiced or devoiced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Voiceless approximants and [[devoiced]] nasals are [[Preaspiration|preaspirated]]. The preaspiration of approximants causes very little friction and may pronounced more as a breathy voice. The preaspiration of devoiced nasals starts with a voiceless airstream through the nose and may end voiced before a vowel. The preaspiration feature is represented orthographically with an &lt;'''h'''&gt; preceding the given sound. For example, a devoiced, preaspirated labial nasal would be written &lt;'''hm'''&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Voiced approximants and nasals may be partly devoiced in contact with a voiceless consonant and at the end of a word.

The voiceless glottal approximant {{IPAslink|h}} functions as an initial aspiration before a vowel. In Atkan and Attuan, the prevocalic {{IPAslink|h}} aspiration contrasts with an audible but not written glottal stop initiation of the vowel. Compare ''halal'' ("to turn the head") and ''alal'' ("to need"). This contrast has been lost in Eastern Aleut.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Modern Eastern Aleut has a much simpler consonant inventory because the voice contrasts among nasals, [[sibilants]] and approximants has been lost.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taff, Et al.|first=Alice|date=2001|title=Phonetic Structures of Aleut|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0095447001901421/1-s2.0-S0095447001901421-main.pdf?_tid=2d4c2260-06e6-11e8-9bb5-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1517444811_51b5ce8fe423c1414d067aff702b3c97|journal=Journal of Phonetics|volume=29|pages=231–271|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants listed in the dental column have varied places of articulation. The stop, nasal, and lateral dentals commonly have a laminal articulation. The voiced dental fricative is pronounced interdentally.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The  pronunciation of the sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} varies from an alveolar articulation to a retracted articulation like a palato-alveolar consonant. There is no contrast between {{IPAslink|s}} and [[Voiceless alveolar fricative|ʃ]] in Aleut. Many Aleut speakers experience difficulties with this distinction while learning English.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Aleut has a basic three-vowel system including the high front {{IPA|/i/}}, low {{IPA|/a/}}, and high back {{IPA|/u/}}. Aleut vowels contrast with their long counterparts {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/aː/}}, and {{IPA|/uː/}}.

Notably, Aleut {{IPA|/u/}} is pronounced slightly lower than {{IPA|/i/}} in the vowel space.

The long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}} is pronounced retracted in the vowel space creating a significant distinction relative to the vowel length of {{IPA|/a/}}. The two high vowels are pronounced with the same vowel quality regardless of vowel length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In contact with a [[uvular consonant|uvular]], {{IPA|/i/}} is lowered to {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|/a/}} is backed to {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} is lowered to {{IPA|[o]}}. In contact with a [[coronal consonant|coronal]], {{IPA|/a/}} is raised to {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} is fronted to {{IPA|[ʉ]}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The mid-vowels {{IPA|[ɔ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} occur only in family names like ''Nevzorof'' and very recently introduced Russian loanwords.

=== Syllable Structure ===
&lt;big&gt;(C)(C)V(V) ± {C(C)(C)V(V)} ± C&lt;/big&gt;

An Aleut word may contain one to about a dozen syllables, all syllables with a vocalic nucleus. In Atkan and Attuan, there is a word-final CC due to [[Apocope|apocopation]]. There also exist word initial CCC in loanwords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Phonotactics&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
A word may begin or end in a vowel, both short and long, with few exceptions. Due to apocopation, short {{IPA|/u/}} is not found in the final position. The same is true for short {{IPA|/i/}}, except in some obsolete suffixes, such as '''''-chi''''' 'your' (pl.) which is realized as '''''-chin''''' and  '''''-chix''''' in modern Eastern and Atkan Aleut.

Vowels within a word are separated by at least one consonant. All single consonants can appear in an intervocalic position, with the following exceptions:
* {{IPAslink|ʍ}} and {{IPAslink|h}} do not occur in intervocalic positions
* {{IPAslink|w}} does not occur in contact with {{IPA|/u/}}
* {{IPAslink|ç}} does not occur in contact with {{IPA|/i/}}
Words begin with any consonant except {{IPAslink|θ}} and preaspirated consonants (with the exception of the preaspirated {{IPAslink|ŋ̥}} in Atkan Aleut). Only in loanwords do {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, and the borrowed consonants (''p, b, f, t, d, g, [[Alveolar and postalveolar approximants|ɹ]]/[[Dental and alveolar flaps|ɾ]])''  appear word-initially.

The word-initial CC can take many forms, with various restrictions on the distribution of consonants:
* a stop or {{IPAslink|s}}, followed by a [[continuant]] other than {{IPAslink|s}} or {{IPAslink|z}}
* a coronal stop or {{IPAslink|s}}, followed by a postlingual continuant (velar, uvular, or glottal).
* postlingual stop or {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, followed by {{IPAslink|j}}
* {{IPAslink|k}} or {{IPAslink|s}}, followed by {{IPAslink|n}}
Intervocalic CC can occur in normal structure or as the result of syncopation.

In CC clusters of to voiced continuants, there is often a short transitional vowel. For example, '''''qilĝix̂''''' 'umbilical cord' is pronounced [-l&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;ĝ-]  similar to '''''qiliĝi-n''''' 'brain'.

Almost all possible combinations of coronal and postlingual consonants are attested.

The combination of two postlingual or two coronal consonants is rare, but attested, such as '''''hux̂xix''''' 'rain pants', '''''aliĝngix̂''''' 'wolf', '''''asliming''''' 'fit for me', '''''iistalix''''' 'to say; to tell; to call'.

In CCC clusters, the middle consonant is either {{IPAslink|t}}, {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, {{IPAslink|s}}. For example, '''''taxtxix̂''''' 'pulse', '''''huxsx̂ilix''''' 'to wrap up', '''''chamchxix̂''''' 'short fishline'.

The most common single consonants to appear word-final are {{IPAslink|x}}, {{IPAslink|χ}}, {{IPAslink|m}}, {{IPAslink|n}}, {{IPAslink|ŋ}}, and {{IPAslink|j}}.

Through apocopation, word-final single consonants /[[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants|l]]/ and {{IPAslink|s}} occur, and word-final consonant clusters ending with {{IPAslink|t}} or {{IPAslink|s}}.

==== Syncopation ====

The details of the extensive [[Syncope (phonology)|syncopation]] characteristic of the Eastern Aleut dialect are described below. In the examples, the syncopated vowel will be shown in parentheses.

A word medial short vowel may be syncopated between single consonants, except after an initial [[Open syllable|open]] short syllable and/or before a final open short syllable. For example, '''''ìx̂am(a)nákux̂''''' 'it is good' and '''''alqut(a)maan''''' 'what for?'.

The syncopation often creates consonant clusters beyond those prescribed by the general rules of Aleut phonotactics. The resulting clusters include:
* clusters of two stops: '''''asx̂at(i)kuu''''' 'he killed it'
* geminate consonants: '''''yuug(i)gaadakux̂''''' 'is young'
* a regular three consonant cluster: '''''ingam(a)sxakum''''' 'after a short while (he)'
In some frequently encountered syncopated forms, which otherwise result in irregular three consonant clusters, the middle uvular fricative is deleted along with the preceding vowel. For example, '''''(h)iis(ax̂)talix''''' 'saying' and '''''(h)iil(ax̂)talix''''' 'being said'.

At slower speeds of speech, the syncopation may not be realized. Compare '''''txin saakutikux̂txin''''' 'you are getting skinny' beside '''''ting saak(u)tikuqing''''' 'I am getting skinny'.

=== Stress&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
Aleut stress is indeterminate and often difficult to define. Stress varies based on the relation to the beginning or end of the word form, the length of the vowels, the sonority of the consonants, open- or closeness of the syllables, or the number of syllables in sentential rhythm and intonation. Stress affects the length of both vowels and consonants. Stress underlies the distinctive [[syncopation]] characteristics of Eastern Aleut. In the following discussion, the acute accent (á) indicates the stronger stress and the grave accent (à) indicates the weaker.

In Eastern Aleut, stronger stress tends to fall on the penultimate syllable if it is short (has a short vowel), or on the last syllable if it is long (has a long vowel). The weaker stress commonly falls on the first syllable. For example, '''''úlax̂''''' 'house', '''''tùnúnax̂''''' 'talked', '''''tùnulákan''''' 'without talking', '''''ìnaqáam''''' 'he himself'.

Eastern Aleut words with more than two syllables exhibit a wider variety of stress patterns. Stress may be attracted to another syllable by a long vowel or relatively sonorant consonant, or by a closed syllable. It's possible the stress can be determined by rhythmic factors so that one word will have different stress in different contexts, such as '''''áĝadax̂''''' compared to '''''àĝádax̂''''', both meaning 'arrow'.

In Atkan and Attuan Aleut, stronger stress more commonly falls on the first syllable. However, long vowels, sonorants, etc. have similar effects on stress as in Eastern Aleut. For example, '''''qánáang''''' 'how many' vs '''''qánang''''' 'where'; '''''ùĝálux̂''''' 'spear' vs '''''álaĝux̂''''' 'sea'.

Stress may also be expressive, as with exclamations or polite requests. Stronger stress falls on the last syllable and is accompanied by a lengthening of a short vowel. For example, '''''kúufyax̂ àqakúx̂''!''' 'coffee is coming'. Similar structure for polite requests, '''''qadá''''' 'please eat!' vs '''''qáda''''' 'eat'.

Under ordinary strong stress, a short syllable tends to be lengthened, either by lengthening the vowel or geminating the following single consonant. Lengthening of the vowel is most common in Eastern, but is found in Atkan before a voiced consonant. In all dialects gemination is common between an initial stressed syllable with a short vowel and a following stressed syllable. For example, '''''ìláan''''' 'from him' pronounced {{IPA|[-ll-]}} and '''''làkáayax̂''''' 'a boy' pronounced {{IPA|[-kk-]}}.

=== Phrasal Phonology ===
The following descriptions involve phonological processes that occur in connected speech.

Word-final velar and uvular fricatives are voiceless when followed by a word-initial voiceless consonant and are voiced when followed by a word-initial voiced consonant or a vowel.

Word-final nasals {{IPAslink|m}} and {{IPAslink|n}} are frequently deleted before an initial consonant other than {{IPAslink|h}}. For example, '''''tana(m) kugan''''' 'on the ground' and '''''ula(m) naga''''' 'the interior of the house'.

In Eastern Aleut, the final vowel may be elided before or contracted with the initial vowel of the following word, as in '''''aamg(ii) iĝanalix''''' 'he is bleeding awfully'.

In Atkan, the final syllable of a word form may be clipped off in fast speech. This is even frequent at slow speed in certain constructions with [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] verbs. The result will be a sequence of vowels or full contraction:
* '''''waaĝaaĝan''''' '''''aĝikux̂''''', '''''waaĝaa-aĝikux̂''''', '''''waaĝaaĝikux̂''''' 'he's about to come'
* '''''ixchiinhan''''' '''''aĝikuq''''', '''''ixchii-aĝikuq''''', '''''ixchiiĝikuq''''' 'I'll go home'

== Morphology ==
Open word classes in Aleut include nouns and verbs, both derived from stems with suffixes. Many stems are ambivalent, being both nominal and verbal (see Derivation below). There are no adjectives other than verbal nouns and participles. Other word classes include pronouns, contrastives, quantifiers, numerals, positional nouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Ordinary nouns have suffixes for
* [[Grammatical number|number]]: singular, dual, and plural
* relational case: [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] and relatative
* [[Grammatical person|person]]: first, second, [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] third, reflexive third

As free forms,the pronouns are used primarily as an object, like fully specified nouns. As [[enclitics]] they function as subject markers.

==== Positional Nouns ====
Positional nouns indicate positional,directional, or some more abstract relation to a definite referent (a person or proceeding noun in relative case). Positional nouns have possessive suffixes but no inherent number.

Unlike ordinary nouns, positional nouns have two adverbial cases: [[Locative case|locative]] and/or [[Ablative case|ablative]]. The most important stem '''''i-''''', called the dative, has only a locative form (largely irregular) meaning 'to, at, for-'.

Most are used in absolutive case, as in '''''ula-m agal-a agikux̂''''' 'he passed behind the house'. Can also be used in the relative case, as in '''''laavki-m agal-a-n ula-a''''' 'the house behind the store'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Numerals ====
The numeral system is decimal with '''''hatix̂''''' 'ten' and '''''sisax̂''''' 'hundred' as the basic higher terms. The higher tens numerals are derived through multiplication (eg. 2 x10 for 'twenty'). The multiplicative numerals are derived with the suffix '''''-di-m''''' on the base numeral followed by '''''hatix̂''''' 'ten'. For example, '''''qankudim hatix̂''''' 'forty'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Verbs ===
Verbs differ from nouns morphologically by having mood/tense suffixes. Like nominal stems, verb stems may end in a short vowel or consonant. Many stems ending in a consonant had auxiliary vowels which have largely become part of the stem itself.

Negation is sometimes suffixal, preceding or combining with the mood/tense suffix. In some cases the negation will be followed by the enclitic subject pronoun.

=== Derivation (Postbases) ===
There exist 570 derivational suffixes ([[postbase]]s) including many composite ones. About two thirds are found only in a small number of words. There exist approximately 175 more common suffixes.

A postbase may be nominal or verbal, yielding nouns derived from nouns or verbs, or verbs derived from verbs or nouns, or from nominal phrases. Many stems are ambivalent, being either nominal or verbal and even some derivatives can be ambivalent.

Difficulties distinguishing between nominal and verbal parts of speech arise because the parts of speech in Aleut are not easy to distinguish. A verbal stem may be used as a verbal predicate, and quite often as a noun. The verbal use of nouns is also very common.

The derivational suffixes may combine in strings of up to about six components, some belonging together to form composites. In sequences, each successive suffix often modifies the preceding string.

The majority of derivatives have a single stem that occurs also without the suffix(es) in question. While some stems are bound, only occurring with some derivational suffix. For example, compare '''''iĝa-t-''''' 'to scare, frighten' '''''iĝa-x̂ta-''''' 'to fear, be afraid of' '''''iĝa-na-''''' 'to be terrible, frightening'.

==Syntax==

===Overview===

Most Aleut words can be classified as [[noun]]s or [[verb]]s.  Notions which in English are expressed by means of [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s are generally expressed in Aleut using verbs or [[postbase]]s ([[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] [[affix|suffixes]]).

Aleut's canonical [[word order]] is subject object verb (SOV).

Nouns are obligatorily marked for [[grammatical number]] (singular, dual, or plural) and for [[absolutive case]] or [[relative case]] (some researchers, notably Anna Berge, dispute both the characterization of this feature as "case" and the names "absolutive" and "relative".  This approach to Aleut nouns comes from Eskimo linguistics, but these terms can be misleading when applied to Aleut).  The absolutive form is the default form, while the relative form communicates a relationship (such as possessive or contrastive) between the noun and another member of the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], possibly one that has been omitted. Absolutive and relative are identical in most combinations of [[Person (grammar)|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]].

In [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] constructions, Aleut marks both possessor and possessum, with the possessor preceding the possessum:
:{{interlinear|lang=ale
|tayaĝu-x̂
|man-ABS
|'[the] man'}}

:{{interlinear|lang=ale
|ada-x̂
|father-ABS
|'[the] father'}}

:{{interlinear|lang=ale|ablist=REL:relative case;POSSM:possessum
|tayaĝu-m ada-a
|man-REL father-POSSM
|'the man's father'}}

The verbal predicate of a simple sentence of the final clause of a complex sentence carries the temporal and modal marking in relation to the speech act. Verbs of non-final clauses are marked in relation to the following clause. A complex sentence may contain an unlimited number of clauses.

Simple sentences may include a subject or no subject. The predicate may be a verb with no complement, a predicate noun with a copula, or a verb with a preceding direct object in the absolutive case and/or an oblique term or local complement.

The number of [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] may be increased or decreased by verbal derivative suffixes. Arguments of a clause may be explicitly specified or anaphoric.

The verb of a simple sentence or final clause may have a nominal subject in the absolutive case or a 1st/2nd person subject marker. If the nominal subject is left out, as known from context, the verb implies an anaphoric reference to the subject:

{{Interlinear|tayaĝu-x̂ awa-ku-x̂|man-SG.ABS work-PRES-SG.|The man is working}}

Positional nouns are a special, closed set of nouns which may take the [[locative case|locative]] or [[ablative case|ablative]] noun cases; in these cases they behave essentially as [[postposition]]s. [[morphosyntax|Morphosyntactically]], positional noun phrases are almost identical to possessive phrases:

:{{interlinear|lang=ale|ablist=REL:relative case
|tayaĝu-m had-an
|man-REL direction-LOC
|'toward the man'}}

Verbs are inflected for [[grammatical mood|mood]] and, if finite, for [[grammatical person|person]] and number.  Person/number endings [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with the subject of the verb if all nominal participants of a sentence are overt:
:{{interlinear|lang=ale
|Piitra-x̂ tayaĝu-x̂ kidu-ku-x̂.
|Peter-SG.ABS man-SG.ABS help-PRES-3SG
|'Peter is helping the man.'}}

If a 3rd person complement or subordinate part of it is omitted, as known from context, there is an anaphoric suffixal reference to it in the final verb and the nominal subject is in the relative case:
:{{interlinear|lang=ale|ablist=ANA:anaphoric;REL:relative case
|Piitra-m kidu-ku-u. 
|Peter-SG.REL help-PRES-3SG.ANA
|'Peter is helping him.'}}

When more than one piece of information is omitted, the verb agrees with the element whose grammatical number is greatest.  This can lead to [[ambiguity]]:

:{{interlinear|lang=ale|ablist=ANA:anaphoric
|kidu-ku-ngis
|help-PRES-PL.ANA
|'He/she helped them.' / 'They helped him/her/them.'{{sfn|Sadock|2000}}}}

===Comparison to Eskimo grammar===

Although Aleut derives from the same parent language as the Eskimo languages, the two language groups (Aleut and Eskimo) have evolved in distinct ways, resulting in significant [[linguistic typology|typological]] differences.  Aleut [[inflection]]al morphology is greatly reduced from the system that must have been present in Proto-Eskimo–Aleut, and where the Eskimo languages mark a verb's arguments morphologically, Aleut relies more heavily on a fixed word order.

Unlike the Eskimo languages, Aleut is not an [[ergative-absolutive language]].  Subjects and objects in Aleut are not marked differently depending on the [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]] of the verb (i.e. whether the verb is [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb|intransitive]]); by default, both are marked with a so-called absolutive noun ending.  However, if an understood complement (which may either be a complement of the verb or of some other element in the sentence) is absent, the verb takes an "anaphoric" marking and the subject noun takes a "relative" noun ending.

A typological feature shared by Aleut and Eskimo is [[polysynthetic]] derivational morphology, which can lead to some rather long words:
:{{interlinear|lang=ale
|top=Ting adaluusanaaĝiiĝutamasux̂takux̂.
|Ting adalu- usa- -naaĝ- -iiĝuta- -masu- -x̂ta- -ku- -x̂.
|me lie- -toward- -try.to- -again- -perhaps- -PFV- -PRES- -3SG
|'Perhaps he tried to fool me again.'{{sfn|Bergsland|1997|p=123}} }}

== Research history ==

The first contact of people from the Eastern Hemisphere with the Aleut language occurred in 1741, as [[Vitus Bering]]'s expedition picked up place names and the names of the Aleut people they met. The first recording of the Aleut language in lexicon form appeared in a word list of the Unalaskan dialect compiled by [[Captain James King]] on [[James Cook|Cook]]'s voyage in 1778. At that time the Imperial Academy of Sciences in [[Saint Petersburg]] became interested in the Aleut language upon hearing of Russian expeditions for trading.

In [[Catherine the Great]]'s project to compile a giant comparative dictionary on all the languages spoken in what was the spread of the [[Russian empire]] at that time, she hired [[Peter Simon Pallas]] to conduct the fieldwork that would collect linguistic information on Aleut. During an expedition from 1791 to 1792, Carl Heinrich Merck and Michael Rohbeck collected several word lists and conducted a census of the male population that included prebaptismal Aleut names. Explorer [[Yuriy Feodorovich Lisyansky]] compiled several word lists. in 1804 and 1805, the czar's plenipotentiary, [[Nikolai Rezanov|Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov]] collected some more. [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] and [[Johann Severin Vater]] published their ''Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachkunde 1806–1817'', which included Aleut among the languages it catalogued, similar to Catherine the Great's dictionary project.

It wasn't until 1819 that the first professional linguist, the Dane [[Rasmus Rask]], studied Aleut. He collected words and paradigms from two speakers of Eastern Aleut dialects living in Saint Petersburg. In 1824 came the man who would revolutionize Aleut as a [[literary language]]. [[Saint Innocent of Alaska|Ioann Veniaminov]], a [[Russian Orthodox]] priest who would later become a saint, arrived at Unalaska studying Unalaskan Aleut. He created an orthography for this language (using the Cyrillic alphabet; the Roman alphabet would come later), translated the [http://www.asna.ca/alaska/aleut/gospel-saint-matthew.pdf Gospel according to St. Matthew] and several other religious works into Aleut, and published a grammar of Eastern Aleut in 1846.

The religious works were translated with the help of Veniaminov's friends Ivan Pan'kov (chief of Tigalda) and [[Saint Jacob of Alaska|Iakov Netsvetov]] (the priest of Atka), both of whom were native Aleut speakers. Netsvetov also wrote a dictionary of Atkan Aleut. After Veniaminov's works were published, several religious figures took interest in studying and recording Aleut, which would help these Russian Orthodox clerics in their missionary work. Father Innocent Shayashnikov did much work in the Eastern Fox-Island dialect translating a Catechism, all four Gospels and Acts of Apostles from the New Testament, and an original composition in Aleut entitled: "Short Rule for a Pious Life".

Most of these were published in 1902, although written years earlier in the 1860s and 1870s. Father Lavrentii Salamatov produced a Catechism, and translations of three of the four Gospels (St. Mark, St. Luke, St. John) in the Western-Atkan dialect. Of Father Lavrentii's work, the Gospel of St. Mark was published in a revised orthography (1959), and in its original, bilingual Russian-Aleut format (2007), together with his Catechism for the youth of Atka Island (2007). The Atkan-dialect Gospel of St. John was also electronically published (2008), along with the Gospel of St. Luke (2009) in the original bilingual format, completing the set of Fr. Lavrentii's biblical translations.

The first Frenchman to record Aleut was [[Alphonse Pinart]], in 1871, shortly after the [[United States]] purchase of [[Alaska]]. A French-Aleut grammar was also produced by Victor Henry, entitled "Esquisse d'une grammaire raisonnee de la langue aleoute d'apres la grammaire et le vocabulaire de Ivan Veniaminov" (Paris, 1879).  In 1878, American [[Lucien M. Turner]] began work on collecting words for a word list. [[Benedykt Dybowski]], a Pole, began taking word lists from the dialects the Commander Islands in 1881, while Nikolai Vasilyevich Slyunin, a Russian doctor, did the same in 1892.

From 1909 to 1910, the [[ethnologist]] [[Waldemar Jochelson]] traveled to the Aleut communities of Unalaska, Atka, Attu and Nikolski. He spent nineteen months there doing fieldwork. Jochelson collected his ethnographic work with the help of two Unalaskan speakers, [[Aleksey Yachmenev]] and [[Leontiy Sivstov]]. He recorded many Aleut stories, folklore and myth, and had many of them not only written down but also recorded in audio. Jochelson discovered much vocabulary and grammar when he was there, adding to the scientific knowledge of the Aleut language.

In the 1930s, two native Aleuts wrote down works that are considered breakthroughs in the use of Aleut as a literary language. Afinogen K. Ermeloff wrote down a literary account of a shipwreck in his native language, while Ardelion G. Ermeloff kept a diary in Aleut during the decade. At the same time, linguist [[Melville Jacobs]] picked up several new texts from Sergey Golley, an Atkan speaker who was hospitalized at the time.

John P. Harrington furthered research into the Pribilof Island dialect on [[Saint Paul Island, Alaska|St. Paul Island]] in 1941, collecting some new vocabulary along the way. In 1944, the [[United States Department of the Interior]] published ''The Aleut Language'' as part of the war effort, allowing [[World War II]] soldiers to understand the language of the Aleuts. This [[English language]] project was based on Veniaminov's work.

In 1950, [[Knut Bergsland]] began an extensive study of Aleut, perhaps the most rigorous to date, culminating in the publication of a complete Aleut dictionary in 1994 and a descriptive grammar in 1997.  Bergsland's work would not have been possible without key Aleut collaborators, especially Atkan linguist [[Moses Dirks]].

[[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], [[Jeff Leer]], [[Michael Fortescue]], and [[Jerrold Sadock]] have published articles about Aleut.

[[Alice Taff]] has worked on Aleut since the 1970s.  Her work constitutes the most detailed accounts of Aleut phonetics and phonology available.

[[Anna Berge]] conducts research on Aleut.  Berge's work includes treatments of Aleut discourse structure and morphosyntax, and curricular materials for Aleut, including a conversational grammar of the Atkan dialect, co-authored with Moses Dirks.

In 2005, the parish of All Saints of North America Orthodox Church, began to re-publish all historic Aleut language texts from 1840–1940. Archpriest Paul Merculief (originally from the Pribilofs) of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Alaska and the [[Alaska State Library]] Historical Collection generously contributed their linguistic skills to the restoration effort. The historic Aleut texts are available on the parish's Aleut library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asna.ca/alaska|title=Alaskan Orthodox texts (Aleut, Alutiiq, Tlingit, Yup'ik)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revitalization==

Revitalization efforts are a recent development for the Aleut language and are mostly in the hands of the Aleuts themselves.  The first evidence of the preservation of the language came in the form of written documentation at the hands of the Russian Orthodox Church missionaries. However, as the historical events and factors transpired, Aleut's falling out of favor has brought upon a necessity for action if the language is to survive much longer.  Linguistic experts have been reaching out to the Aleut community in attempts to record and document the language from the remaining speakers.  Such efforts amount to "100 hours of conversation, along with the transcription and translation in Aleut, that will be transferred to compact disks or DVDs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2003/06/24/saving-aleut-linguist-begins-new-effort-to-preserve-native-alaskan-language/|title=Saving Aleut: Linguist begins new effort to preserve native Alaskan language|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If Aleut does go extinct, these records will allow linguists and descendants of the Aleutian people to pass on as much knowledge of the language as they can.  Efforts like this to save the language are being sponsored by universities and local community interest groups, like the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association Task Force for Language Revitalization, while government relations with the Aleut people are severely limited.  Similarly to the native languages of California, the native languages of Alaska had been given little attention from the United States government.  While linguists are working to record and document the language, the local Aleutian community groups are striving to preserve their language and culture by assisting the linguists and raising awareness of the Aleut population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/resources/anc/anc01.htm|title=Alaska Natives Loss of Social &amp; Cultural Integrity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apinayé ''' (otherwise known as Apinajé, Afotigé, Aogé, Apinagé, Otogé, Oupinagee, Pinagé, Pinaré, Uhitische, Utinsche, and Western Timbira) is a [[Subject–object–verb]] [[Jê languages|Jê language]] spoken in [[Tocantins]], Eastern Central Brazil by some 2277 speakers of [[Apinajé people]] according to the most recent census taken by SIASI/SESAI in 2014.&lt;ref name="Povos"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/apinaye|title=History|author=Maria Elisa Ladeira and Gilberto Azanha|website=Povos Indígenas No Brasil|publisher=Instituto Socioambiental}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are thirteen villages that speak the Apinayé language. The biggest and oldest villages include São José and Mariazinha; and the smaller villages are Cocalinho, Patizal, Buriti Comprido, Palmeiras, Prata, Cocal Grande, Serrinha, Botica, Riachinho, Bonito and Brejão.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunha de Oliveria |first=Christiane |date=2005 |publisher=University of Oregon |title= The language of the Apinajé people of Central Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Ethnologue]] considers Apinayé "developing," with a rating of 5 on the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS).&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition|last=Lewis|first=Paul|last2=Simons|first2=Gary F.|last3=Fennig|first3=Charles D.|date=2017|publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be hypothesized that language transmission is high, since Apinayé was ranked as a threatened language in the past 10 years, but presently it is no longer at that level.

==History==
Before the 20th century, there used to be three main Apinayé groups known as the Rõrkojoire, the Cocojoire, and the Krĩjobreire. Each had their own land and political division, which totaled more than half of the current territory.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Currently, the three distinct Apinayé groups have been living together, though São José is controlled by the Krĩjobreire, and Mariazinha has Cocojoire leadership.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; During the first quarter of the nineteenth century the Apinayé had a successful economic growth fueled by extensive cattle farming and the extraction of babaù palm oil which brought an increase in migration. The land rights of the Apinayé have been recognized by the federal government of Brazil in the 1988 Constitution.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

===Contact===
The Apinayé indigenous population has had contacts with the Jesuits, military bands and explorers, which is similar to the experiences of other indigenous groups. Between 1633 and 1658, the Jesuits journeyed up the Tocantins River in order to “[persuade] the Indians to ‘descend’ the river to the villages of Pará”.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt; This ushered in the potential of further encounters. On one of his expeditions, Captain-General D. Luiz Mascarenhas was confronted by “war-like” people, the Apinayé, in 1740.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Another confrontation between the Portuguese settlers and the Apinayé occurred in 1774 when Antônio Luiz Tavares Lisboa and his band of explorers were traveling by way of the Tocantins River.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; These early contacts did not greatly disrupt the lifestyle of the Apinayé people. It was not until the 19th century that the indigenous group would suffer from colonization. This was due to the shrinking of their territory and population reduction in the face of settlement establishment by the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Da Matta (1982) believes that the Apinayé were saved from extinction mainly due to the fact that the area they were situated in did not have true economic value.&lt;ref name="Da Matta"/&gt;

===Conflict===
During the initial colonization period, the Apinayé had been recorded as being hostile to European expeditions. This prompted the construction of the military post of Alcobaça in 1780.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt; However, it was soon abandoned due to the successful raids of the Apinayé. This only prompted further fortifications. In 1791 “another military post was founded on the Arapary river” and the same occurred in 1797 with the construction of the post of São João das Duas Barras.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt; Regardless of previous conflicts, the Apinayé participated in the War for Independence of 1823 after sending “250 warriors to join the troops of José Dias de Mattos”.&lt;ref name="Da Matta"&gt;{{cite book |last=Da Matta |first=Roberto |date=1982 |publisher=Harvard University Press |title= A Divided World: Apinayé social structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent area of conflict was during the construction of the Trans-Amazon highway in 1985, which was supposed to be built over indigenous land. With the support of Krahô, Xerente, Xavante, and Kayapó warriors, the Apinayé had their lands recognized by the Brazilian state and the route of the highway was altered to avoid passing through this indigenous territory.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt;

===First Schools===
Schools existed in the area of the Apinayé as early as the early 19th century,&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; however it is unclear if their purpose was for the indigenous group or the general settler population. The first instructional materials for the Apinayé language were organized by the missionaries of the Summer Institute for Linguistics, in this particular case, Missionary Patricia Ham.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Governmental support for indigenous schools was established as part of the 1988 Constitution.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The current school system of the Apinayé shows that children start to learn in their native language up to the 4th grade, when Portuguese is introduced.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The schools are run by the Apinayé community, with some teaching staff that comprises non-indigenous instructors and assistants.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; These schools further support the hypothesis that transmission rates are high; children are monolingual until they reach an age when they can start learning another language, leading to the majority of the population as being bilingual. It seems like the Apinayé language is still an important part of the culture of the group, and therefore has the ability to continue thriving.

==Language Family==
The [[Jê]] family is the largest language family in the [[Macro-Jê]] stock. It contains eight languages, some of which have many dialects within them. The languages of this family are concentrated mostly in “the savanna regions of Brazil from the southern parts of the states of [[Pará]] and [[Maranhão]] south to [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]”.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Moore| first=Denny| title=Brazil: language situation| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of languages and linguistics 2| date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many other languages in the [[Macro-Jê]] stock have become extinct, because their East coast location meant for the first contact with Europeans, which, as written above, was violent and detrimental to many indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

==Literature==
A descriptive grammar of this language exists, written by researcher Christiane Cunha de Oliveira in her dissertation “The Language of the Apinajé People of Central Brazil”. Oliveira provides an extensive description and analysis of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Apinayé. Other linguists have also contributed to the descriptive grammar of the language, including Callow’s 1962 paper discussing word order; Burgess and Ham’s phonological analysis including topics like consonant to vowel ratio, tone, and inventories of the different sounds of the language; and Callow’s 1962 analysis of nominal categories and Ham et al.’s 1979 analysis of verbal categories.&lt;ref name="WALS Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_api|title=Language Apinayé|last=Dryer|first=Matthew S.|last2=Haspelmath|first2=Martin|website=WALS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedagogical grammars have been created for use in a bilingual classroom setting, with the intention of teaching both national culture and indigenous culture to young students.&lt;ref name="Sousa et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magalhães de Sousa|first=Rosineide |last2=Alves de Almeida|first2=Severina|last3=Mendonça Lyra|first3=Jairo Roberto|last4= Guimarães Sousa|first4= Jane |last5=Dos Santos|first5= Elizeu José|date=2017|title=Apinajé Intercultural Bilingual School: For an Education Beyond the Ethnic Frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sousa et al.’s “Apinajé Intercultural Bilingual School: For an Education Beyond the Ethnic Frontier” discusses this process in depth, and examines the value of having an Apinayé pedagogical grammar in the classroom. There is an intrinsic link between language and culture, and learning the Apinayé language helps children build a stronger connection with both their indigenous culture and the national culture of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Sousa et al."/&gt; It also is perhaps part of the reason that this language currently holds the status of “developing” on the EGID scale as mentioned above, as transmission of a language to children of the culture is vital to its survival.&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt;

===Documentation Projects===
In the Acknowledgements section of “The Language of the Apinajé People of Central Brazil”, Oliveira thanks the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) for assistance with the documentation needed for the research. Therefore, the Apinayé language has been part of a small documentation project, to provide the research necessary for this dissertation and descriptive grammar. Otherwise, documentation projects for this language are unavailable.

===Ethnography===
The most recent ethnographic study done on the Apinayé people is from 2017, where the education system is analyzed (Sousa et al.). The most prominent ethnography of the Apinayé language and people is Oliveira’s thesis dissertation (2005). This was preceded by Da Matta’s work (1982) which explores Apinayé customs and traditions. Curt Niumendajú was a German anthropologist and ethnologist who wrote The Apinayé (1939). The book is based on the social structure of the indigenous group, though it also includes minimal information regarding the linguistic formation of the Apinayé language.

Just as in [[Mebengokre language|Mebengokre]], there are underlying nasal vowels which surface independent of the nasal consonants.

=== Syllable structure ===

==== Onsets ====
The onset is optional in Apinayé, but when it exists it may be any consonant from the inventory. C1C2V(C)-type syllables, where C2 is a voiced [+cont] semivowel or liquid are very common. CCC onsets are always {{IPA|/kvr/}}or {{IPA|/ŋvr/}}

==== Codas ====
All consonants other than {{IPA|/ŋ, ʔ/}} are permitted in the coda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burgess |first1=Eunice |last2= Ham |first2= Patricia |year=1968 |title=Multilevel conditioning of phoneme variants in Apinayé |journal=Linguistics |volume=41 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= 10.1515/ling.1968.6.41.5|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note also that the possible syllable types are identical to what we find in Mebengokre, except for those in which there are {{IPA|/ʔ/}}-initial complex onsets.

==Morphology==
Christiane Cunha de Oliveira wrote her PhD dissertation on the language of Apinayé (2005). She covers a wide range of morphological topics, which include lexical categories such as nouns, verbs, and postpositions. In the ‘nouns’ section, Oliveira discusses compound nouns and derived nouns in the Apinayé language. Inflection occurs on verbs, in accordance with person, constituency and nonfiniteness.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Postpositions inflect for person, if there is a lack of an overt dependent noun phrase.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

===Pronouns===
In Apinayé, there are personal pronouns for the first, second and third persons; which generally occupy the second position in a main clause.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The first person pronoun “includes the hortative and plural inclusive distinctions”; other clitics are used to differentiate number distinctions.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Pronouns occur in the realis and the irrealis modes: 
{| class="wikitable"
|[[Grammatical person|Person]]
|'''Realis Mode'''
|'''Irrealis Mode'''
|-
|[[Grammatical person|1st person (inclusive)]]
|''pa''
|''paj''
|-
|[[Grammatical person|2nd person]]
|''ka''
|''kaj''
|-
|[[Grammatical person|3rd person]]
|''əm/ø''
| ''ja''
|-
| [[Grammatical person|Hortative]]
|''pu''
| ''puj''
|-
|}

Based on the information available, it can be postulated that these are both subject and object pronominal forms. In pragmatically unmarked use, the pronoun works within a clitic sequence, where the mood marker is in the first position and potentially a tense/aspect clitic that is stressed in the group.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Phonological words are part of these sequences of clitics. In this instance, the pronouns do not carry stress; voice alteration is based on plosives occurring in the pronouns.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; For example: 
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Na''||''[pa''||''mɛ]''||''ra''||''pĩ''||''kə''
|-
| ||RLS||1||PL||ASP||tree||cut
|}
:"We (exclusive) have already torn down the trees."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Na''||''pa''||''ra''||''ku-ku''
|-
| ||RLS||1.INCL||ASP||3-eat
|}
:"We (inclusive) have already eaten."

In pragmatically marked use, a token of the pronoun precedes the sequence clause initially.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Therefore, when the pronoun is stressed, the plosives are voiceless.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; This applies only to the realis form of pronouns:
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Pa''||''kɔt''||''paj''||''Zɛkabeti''||''ɔ''||''grɛ''||''rač''||''kumrɛč''
|-
| ||1||IRLS||1.IRLS||N.||INSTR||dance||QTF||INTS
|}
:"It’s me that I want to dance all night with Zé Cabere."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Pa''||''na''||''pa''||''ic-kĩ''||''nẽ''
|-
| ||1||RLS||1||1-merry||FCT
|}
:"It’s me that I am really happy!"

===Clitics===

====Realis and Irrealis Modes====
What is interesting about Apinayé is that numerous grammatical categories are expressed by positional, phrasal and word clitics. Clitics are used to distinguish between realis and irrealis mood in the language. The marker ''na'' is used to denote realis clauses; whereas irrealis clauses are indicated by the marker ''kɔt''.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The realis domain includes present, past, and habitual postpositions.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The irrealis domain represents future, hypothetical, counterfactual, and conditional postpositions.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Examples follow below:

'''Realis:'''
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Na''||''ic-pe''||''ku-bə''
|-
| ||RLS||1-DTR||3.ACC-grab
|}
:"He took it from me."

'''Irrealis:'''
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Kɔt''||''paj''||''mũj''||''mẽ''||''wa''||''grɛ''
|-
| ||IRLS||1.IRLS||DEM.DST||ASSC||DU||dance
|}
:"I will dance with that one. (Lit.: ‘Me plus that one, the both of us will dance [together]’)"

===Reduplication===
Reduplication is a process that occurs in Apinayé. In terms of verbs, it is generally used to describe concepts, such as colours, onomatopoeic sounds; iterative, repetitive, or progressive events; and events that depict fragmentation (like ‘shatter’).&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Some examples are listed below:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ko.kot''
|}
:"rest"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''pɛ.pɛk''
|}
:"drip repeatedly on the same spot"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''tə̃. tə̃k''
|}
:"hurt;ache"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ro.rok''
|}
:"errode;collapse"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''rə.rər''
|}
:"yellow"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''pre.prek''
|}
:"be fast, rush"

This strategy reproduces the first foot right-to-left of the original stem.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The majority of closed syllables lose their coda under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; However that is not always the case. Reduplication does not only occur in verb stems, but also noun stems in some cases; though this occurs when reduplicated verbs convert into nouns, or they are compounds that include reduplicated verbal stems.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

==Syntax==

===Valency Change===
Some of the syntactic processes of Apinayé are the valency changing operations of causativization. There are two ways of expressing causativization: periphrastic construction and morphological construction.

====Periphrastic Causative==== 
The function of periphrastic construction is encoding indirect causation; the construction ''ɔ anẽ'' denotes the clause, while the result is in another clause.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Furthermore, the clause which encodes the result functions as a different-subject clause in relation to the clause that expresses causation.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; For example:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''ka''||''ri''||'''''ic-t-ɔ'''''||'''''anẽ'''''||''pa''||''rɔp''||''kura''
|-
| ||RLS||2||DEM||1-RP-do||thus||1||dog||hit
|}
:"You caused me to hit the dog. (Lit.: “You did me thus, I hit the dog”) [i.e. I was going to hit you with a stick, you stood behind the dog and I hit the dog instead of hitting you]"

This example shows that the two clauses share an argument; “the object of ''ɔ anẽ'' ‘do thus’ is coreferential with the causee”, shown by the independent pronoun at the beginning of the result clause.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

The example below will illustrate an alternative situation:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''rɔp''||''ri''||''ic-t-ɔ''||''anẽ''||'''''nẽ'''''||''pa''||''amɲĩ''||''pe''||''i-ɲ-õ''||''gwra''||''kago''||''kapi''
|-
| ||RLS||dog||DEM||1-RP-do||thus||FCT||1||RFLX||DTR||1-PSSR||buriti||juice||spill
|}
:"The dog caused me to spill my juice. (i.e. it ran across my way, I tripped on it, and dropped the bowl with the juice)"

The particle ''nẽ'' occurs between the two clauses. The introduction of the conjunction postulates that “the clauses expressing cause and result are not as formally bound to each other” as in the previous example.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Both clauses are under the scope of the modality marker, therefore it is a confirmation that they constitute a single sentence.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Furthermore, this example differs with the previous ones due to causation; while the causers are animate beings for both examples, the second case shows that the causer is unaware of its actions, whereas the previous example has intentional causes.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

The third syntactic pattern is the following:
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''i-j-apen''||''ja''||''na''||''ri''||'''''ic-t-ɔ'''''||'''''anẽ'''''||''na''||''pa''||''ra''||''ic-kengʌ''
|-
| ||1-RP-work||DET||RLS||DEM||1-RP-do||thus||RLS||1||ASP||1-tired
|}
:"My work is already making me tired."

The inclusion of the modality marker ''na'' in the second clause “suggests that cause and result are expressed by two independent sentences”.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; However, the consultant of Oliveira noted that such constructions are odd, possibly because the higher agent is an event rather than a participant, and are only found in elicitation situations.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

====Morphological Causative====

The morphological causative is distinguished by the marker ''ɔ'', which is preposed to the lexical verb of a clause.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;  The marker is not a prefix to the verb, and may be labeled as a compound, since no other elements can exist between the two morphemes.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;  This causativization applies only to monovalent verbs.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;  For example:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''kawə''||'''''dɘt'''''
|-
| ||RLS||côfo ||full
|}
:"The basket is full."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''ka''||''kawə''||'''''ɔ=dɘt'''''
|-
| ||RLS||2||côfo ||CAUS=full
|}
:"You filled the basket."

The morphological causative focuses on the effect of the cause in the causal chain. Here, the causee “is affected by the agent/causer; thus, the causee is expressed simply as the patient argument of the verb derived with the causative morpheme ''ɔ''”.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;  Furthermore, “the lexical verb shares an argument with ''ɔ'' and that the latter has a very generic meaning makes it easier for ''ɔ'' to become reinterpreted as belonging to a distinct category − a derivational morpheme, in the case at hand − than for the lexical verb to be reinterpreted as a manner adverb”.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

The establishment of the new function for ''ɔ'' as a morphological causative is “effected by the generalization in the usage of the construction”.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;  The examples below, in which inanimate participants occupy the position of the higher agent, illustrate this:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''ra''||''a-ɲ-õkwɨ''||''a-pe''||'''''čet'''''||''pa''
|-
| ||RLS||ASP||2-home||2-DTR||burn||CNCL
|}
:"Your house burned down on you (i.e. to your detriment)."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''kupĩp''||''kagrɔ''||''i-n-ikrɛ''||'''''ɔ=čet'''''
|-
| ||RLS||mat||hot||1-shoulder||CAUS=burn
|}
:"The hot mat burned my shoulder."

==Semantics==

===Quantification===

====Number Clitics====

In Apinayé number distinguishes between singular, dual, and plural categories for nouns and verbs. These are expressed by positional clitics: ''wa'' (dual) and ''mɛ'' (plural) which occur before nouns and verbs.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The number clitics occur after the usage of person pronouns:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Mɛ''||''a-krĩ''||''[pu''||''mɛ]''||''pa''||''krĩ''
|-
| ||PL||2-sit.PL||HORT||PL||1.INCL||sit.PL
|}
:"Have a seat, you all, let’s have a seat and gather."

The plural clitic mɛ can be a noun modifier, the dual clitic ''wa'' is not: 
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''mɛ''||''di''||''jaja''
|-
| ||PL||woman||DEF.ART.RDPL

:"the women"

The plural and dual markers can also be used in compounding. An example is when they “combine with the indefinite article ''õ'' to form the indefinite pronouns ''mɛʔõ'' ‘someone’ and ''waʔõ'' ‘someone’”.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

====Quantifiers - Noun Phrases====
In Apinayé, the quantifiers ''wa'' ‘dual’ and ''me'' ‘plural’ are positional clitics as well, and have the same distribution when it comes to person prefixes, as with full nouns; the clitics occur before:
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''[wa''||''iɲ]-mə̃''
|-
| ||DU||1-DAT
|}
:"for us (DU.EXCL)"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''[me ''||''Ø]-karõ''
|-
| ||PL||3-spirit
|}
:"the (deceased people’s) spirits"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''[me''||''a]-p-ubu''
|-
| ||PL||2-RP-see
|}
:"...see you all"

With free pronouns, the clitics occur after:
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''kɔt''||''[kaj''||''wa]''
|-
| ||IRLS||2.IRLS||DU
|}
:"the both of you will…"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''na''||''[pa''||''me]''
|-
| ||RLS||1||PL
|}
:"we all…"

====Quantifiers - Postpositional Phrases====
The plural and dual clitics may co-occur with a postposition that is inflected for person. The quantifier clitic is modifying the person prefix attached to the postposition, and occurs in front of it.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; When it comes to the third person, the majority of postpositions take a zero prefix, though there are some irregular forms.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Such examples follow below:
{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''me''||''Ø-kot''
|-
| ||PL||3-after
|}
:"after them"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''me''||''kəm''
|-
| ||PL||3.DAT
|}
:"for them"

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''wa''||''a-pe''
|-
| ||DU||2-DTR
|}
:"from both of you (i.e. to your detriment)"

Retrieved 19 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; to answer questions about the impact of sex on [[technological innovation]] and adoption. New technologies are quick to appeal to pornography consumers, and thus these customers represent a profitable market segment for the suppliers of new products and services.
* The 2008 conference, subtitled "Do Androids Sleep with Electric Sheep: Critical Perspectives on Sex and Science Fiction,"&lt;ref&gt;Jardin, Xeni (26 September ''[2008]'').

* The 2009 conference, "Of Intercourse and Intracourse"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/arse-elektronika/2009/about.html "Arse Elektronika 2009"].  [[monochrom]].&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with bodies and the modification thereof, including [[wetware (brain)|wetware]], [[gene therapy]], [[biotechnology]] and [[body modification]]. Talks also speculated on the social impacts of these technologies particularly the implications on [[heteronormativity]] if biological sex becomes easily changeable.
* The 2010 conference, "Space Racy", dealt with issues of [[space]], both in an [[architecture|architectural]] and [[aeronautical]] sense. Topics included the possibility of sex in outer space, the gendered and/or sexualized nature of built spaces, interspecies romance in video games, and an interactive installation called ''[[Buried Alive (performance)#Six Feet Under Club|Six Feet Under Club]]'' in which participants could have sex while buried in a surveillant [[coffin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths "Six Feet Under Club Takes Sex to New Depths"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213234425/http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths |date=2010-12-13 }}.

* The 2013 conference, "id/entity" dealt with sex, technology and identity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* The 2014 conference, "TRANS*.*" dealt with technology and sexuality in societal and personal transition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* The 2015 conference, "Spread Your Workload" dealt with technology and sexuality and work (tech and sex work; work and labour politics in context of sex tech; work in a physical context).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* No (10th) conference has been held in 2016.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* Arse Elektronika's 10th anniversary conference (and 10th as well) is announced for autumn 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2015}}
'''Basque festival''', also known as '''''Euskal jaiak''''', is a festival celebrating [[Basque culture]] showing Basque dance and other elements of the [[Basque folklore]]. Basque festivals are organized in the [[United States of America]] in towns with an important population of Basque descendants, such as [[Reno]], [[Boise]] and [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]]. Similar festivals are celebrated in [[Argentina]] and other countries where [[Basque diaspora]] is set. Basque festivals are also celebrated in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]: ''Euskal Jaiak'' celebrations in September in [[Donostia]] and [[Zarautz]] are famous.

Early examples of Basque festivals date from the late 19th century, when the Lore Jokoak, or Basque [[Floral Games]] came into being in French-Spanish bordering areas of Navarre, Labourd, and Gipuzkoa, fostered and encouraged by [[Antoine d'Abbadie]] and other cultural figures.

'''Berber carpets''' are [[carpet]]s hand-woven by the [[Berbers|Berber]] autochthones in North Africa and the Sahara. The carpets come in traditional and modern designs, which are distinguished by different knotting patterns, dyes and fabric textures.

==History==
[[File:TapisKabyle2.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of a traditional Berber carpet]]
The origin carpet weaving by the Berber populations dates back several millennia. The hand spun cloth they created was named for the individual tribe, and they used natural fibers to create cloaks, rugs, and other fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130410151632/http://www.berber-arts.com/berber/index.php/editoral/vintage-moroccan-berber-carpets/ Moroccan (Berber) carpets] article on the history of Moroccan Berber carpets, by Gebhart Blazek. This text has originally been published as a catalog contribution to the exhibition "Moroccan Charm - Art of the Berber Tribes, The G. Blazek Collection of Carpets and Textiles and the I.

==Traditional and modern carpets==
[[File:Berber carpet from Morocco.jpg|thumb|250px|Handmade Berber carpet from Morocco]]
Modern industrialized Berber carpets are distinguished by a [[loop pile]] construction type that gives a similar appearance to the distinct knot of traditionally woven Berber carpets. The modern carpets usually contain small flecks of dark color on lighter shades of background colors resembling a natural undyed version of the traditional carpets. They generally consist of a plain color mix with no pattern, and are relatively cheap and durable. Popular for areas with significantly heavy use such as offices.  The distinctive knot texture and appearance of traditional hand-woven Berber carpets today are generally woven in brightly colored designs that are different from other [[oriental rug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berbercarpetbible.com], but there are also natural undyed versions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Handmade and usually homemade Berber carpets are still an active industry in many rural areas of Berber countries. Many Berber families earn their primary income from building-up carpets manually and selling them in local markets, merchants and tourists. Traditional Berber carpets differ from modern mass-produced Berber carpets that are usually found in industrialized markets. They often employ cultural designs and are typically made of natural materials

Today, there are numerous types of modern Berber carpet made from a wide variety of materials, [[Nylon]], [[Olefin fiber]], and [[wool]] are the most frequently used materials, Except [http://www.onat.nat.tn/lartisanat-tunisien/metiers-de-lartisanat/details/article/metiers-du-tissage/#.U_xkkPl5MQ0 Tunisian Berber carpets and rugs] usually called “Mergoum” which still preserve a know how inherited from ancestral weaving methods. Tunisian authorities are still controlling every piece to guarantee quality and that 'Berber' spirit in designs, patterns and symbols knotted so only wool is permitted with a total ban of any synthetic material, then each rug or carpet is sealed with a red wax sign (of Tunisian handicrafts authorities).

In other countries Olefin is the most frequently used and most affordable material, and carpets with blends of the different materials are also available.&lt;ref name="HI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homeimprovement.lovetoknow.com/Berber_Carpeting |title=Berber Carpeting at LoveToKnow Home Improvement |publisher=Homeimprovement.lovetoknow.com |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berber carpet is highly durable and is often found in offices, schools, and other high traffic areas. It is stain resistant as well, and is generally more affordable than thicker plush carpets. To care about it is recommended by most professionals that Moroccan Olefin Berber should be cleaned using a low-moisture or dry cleaning process. Traditional steam cleaning with high alkaline detergents can cause potential pH burns in the olefin. These appear as large yellow or brown splotches. Yellow or brown spots also may be tannin bleed from the sugars in natural fiber carpets that are drawn to the top by improper drying usually caused by over wetting. There are carpet chemicals that can remove most of this yellowing or browning but they are very expensive, and it would be better to not get the yellowing or browning. A better, but more difficult, method may be to dry the carpet from the bottom. This method would generally require lifting up some of the carpet to install a carpet fan under the carpet, and using hot air, not just room temperature air. Regrettably, many of these stains can be permanent if not corrected immediately by a professional carpet cleaner. As with all carpets, Berber should be cleaned every 6 to 12 months to prevent permanent wear patterns.&lt;ref name="HI" /&gt;

'''Biala''' (or '''Byala''', '''Biale''') [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[List of Hasidic dynasties|dynasty]] has its roots in [[Poland]]. The [[Rebbe#Hasidic Rebbe|Rebbes]] of Biala are descended from Rabbi [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz]], known as the ''Yid Hakodosh'' ("The Holy Jew").

==History==
The Biala dynasty is part of the [[Prshiskhe (Hasidic dynasty)|Prshiskhe dynasty]] whose first rebbe was Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok (the Holy Jew) of [[Przysucha|Prshiskhe]] (today [[Przysucha]], Poland), a disciple of Rabbi [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin]] (the Seer of Lublin). The Seer was a disciple of Rabbi [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]], who was a disciple of Rabbi [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] (the Maggid of Mezritch), the leading disciple of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]].

Rabbi Yechiel Yehoshua was six years old when his father, the Rebbe of [[Siedlce]], died as a young man. The Hasidim, bereft of their rebbe, mostly became followers of their late rebbe's brother, the Mezritsher Rebbe. It was he who educated his young nephew Yechiel Yehoshua in the ways of Torah and Hasidus. In 1924 the surviving Shedlitser Hasidim accepted Rabbi Yechiel Yehoshua as their rebbe. In time his name spread over [[Poland]] and the numbers of his Hasidim grew.

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germans overran Poland]]. Rabbi Yechiel Yehoshua managed to escape to the Russian-controlled zone, from which he was exiled to [[Siberia]]. Jews who survived the Siberian work camps testified that the Rebbe was the one who kept their spirit alive. In 1947 he [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] and settled in [[Tel Aviv]]. He was in the forefront of activity to maintain adherence to traditional Judaism amongst the masses. He was one of the founders of the [[Chinuch Atzmai]] educational network, and he served on the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]].He died on the 21st of [[Shvat]] 1982 and was buried in the Polish admorim section on the [[Mount of Olives]].&lt;ref name= Halachmi&gt;Meir Halachmi, ''Toldot Hachasidut b'Erets Yisrael'', vol.2, pp. 73-83, ''Beit Biala''&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand Rabbi Yerachmiel Tzvi Yehudah Rabinowicz was known as the Biala-Peshischa Rebbe (1923–2003). Born in 1923, he was the first-born son of the previous Biala Rebbe, known as the ''Chelkas Yehoshua''. He became Rebbe after his father died in 1982 and opened his [[yeshiva]] in the Har Nof section of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yarzheit.com/FRY/10FRY_Teves.htm Yarzheit.com, Teves]&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his sons.

Following the death of Yerachmiel Tzvi, one of his sons, Rabbi M. Rabinowicz, became Biala-Prshiskhe Rav of [[Har Nof]]. His eldest son, Rabbi Elimelech Rabinowicz, became the Biala Prshiskhe Rebbe of [[Haifa]]. One of his sons is Rabbi Simchah Ben Zion Isaac Rabinowicz, the author of ''Piskei Tshuvos'', a popular commentary on the Jewish legal classic ''Mishneh Brurah''.

Rabbi David Matisyahu Rabinowicz was Biala Rebbe in [[Bnei Brak]], Israel. He authored ''Lehavas Dovid''. He was well known for his warm prayers and his self-sacrifice for serving God. He travelled around the world to spread Hassidic teachings. He was commissioned by his father to open yeshivot around the Holy Land. His father called him ''"nekudas libi"'', the "focus of my heart". He died in 1997.

Rabbi Dovid Matisyahu of Biala had two daughters from his first wife, the daughter of Rabbi Shedrowitzsky, who died at a young age, and five sons from his second wife, the daughter of Rabbi Berkowitz, who survives him and presently resides in Bnei Brak. One of his sons-in-law and four of his sons succeeded him as Rebbe.

Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz, son of Rabbi Yechiel Yehoshua Rabinowicz, was the Biala Rebbe of the Ramat Aharon section of Bnei Brak, Israel. He died in 2010 and was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Tzvi Rabinowicz, the present Biala Rebbe of [[Ramat Aharon]].
[[Image:POL Warsaw JCP grob rabina.jpg|thumb|Biala dynasty plot in Poland]]
Rabbi Ben-Zion Rabinowicz of Biala was born in [[Poland]] on January 30, 1935. He is the youngest son of Rabbi Yechiel Yehoshua of Biala. During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] invasion of Poland in 1939, his father who was not yet the Rebbe, was caught whilst trying to escape to his brother in London and was sent to [[Siberia]] by the Russians. Ben-zion and his sister escaped with many other children across Europe eastwards into Russia and then down into [[Iran]] (Persia). They were eventually brought to the Holy Land by Zionists, who were saving Jewish children from starvation and disease in Iran, and bringing them to the Holy Land. The Ponevezher Rov &amp;mdash; Rabbi [[Yosef Kahaneman]] &amp;mdash; heard that there were some special children in this group from Poland, descended from famous Rebbes. He removed the young Rebbe-to-be and his sister from the care of the secular Zionists. After the war their father made it to Palestine and was reunited with his children. Rabbi Ben Zion married Rebetzin Beila Brocho Babad, daughter of Rabbi Avrohom Moshe Babad, ABD [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. He learned in the [[Ponevezh yeshiva]] in Bnei Brak, and in the [[Gateshead Talmudical College]] in [[England]].

He became Rabbi of [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]], in 1980. He became Rebbe in 1981 upon the death of his father, as did his brothers. His first wife died in 1995, and in 1998 the Rebbe remarried the widow Rebbetzin Steinwurtzel, the mother-in-law of the present Karlin-Stolin Rebbe. In addition to his position as the Rabbi of Lugano, the Rebbe spends much time in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Safed]], where he has [[synagogue]]s.

In Safed the Rebbe began a congregation in the old Kosover Synagogue. He does a lot of work helping to teach unaffiliated Jews learn about their Jewish heritage.

The Rebbe ''Shlita'' is the author of an extensive body of Torah literature, including both Hasidic discourses and [[Talmud]]ic commentaries, of which over thirty volumes have been published in Hebrew. These include the Rebbe's own works, ''Mevaser Tov'', as well as compete ''seforim'' and ''maamarim'' that appear in the numerous works of published literature from the entire house of Biala. ''Techias HaMeisim'' is the third book by the Rebbe to have been translated into [http://mevasertovweekly.com English], alongside ''The Merit of the Righteous Women'' and ''The Reward of the Righteous Women.''[http://www.yarzheit.com/heavensregister/bialarebbe.htm]

[[Image:Grand Rabbi Wolf Kornreich of Shidlovtza (3197).jpg|thumb|Grand Rabbi Wolf Kornreich of Shidlovtza]]

Grand Rabbi Wolf Kornreich of Shidlovtze is the son-in-law of Grand Rabbi David Mattisyahu Rabinowitz of Biala. He was very close with Grand Rabbi Yechiel Yehoshua Rabinowitz of Biala. He has a growing following in Jerusalem.

He found the lost tomb of Grand Rabbi Nathan David Rabinowitz of Shidlovtze and commissioned the building of a new ''ohel'' which now marks the grave.

After the death of his father, Rabbi Dovid Matisyohu, Rabbi Yaakov Menachem Rabinovich took upon himself the responsibility of guiding the followers of his late father. As he was a prominent Talmid Chochom [Torah scholar] and experienced counselor, even while his father was alive, he became the successor Biala rebbe. Already active in outreach programs for others in the USA who lack understanding and knowledge of their Jewish roots and traditions, he has already made a name for himself in many Jewish communities in the US where his yearly visits are attended by hundreds who seek his blessing, counsel and advice.

[[Image:Ostrova biala rebbe.jpg|thumb|left|Rabbi Avraham Yerachmiel Rabinowicz, the Ostrova-Bialer Rebbe, in his synagogue in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem, 2006]]

Grand Rabbi Avraham Yerachmiel Rabinowicz is another son of Grand Rabbi Dovid Matisyohu. The Rebbe runs a yeshiva where students come to learn at all hours of the day and night. Through the yeshiva, he supports over 100 families with food, Jewish education, emotional support, guidance, and counseling. The yeshiva also serves as a full service synagogue with daily prayers, Shabbat and holiday services. The Rebbe has been often called “the miracle worker” because of his gift of successful spiritual advice, blessings, and the high level of prayer he provides for everybody who comes to see him.  He recently opened a synagogue in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostrova-biale.com Historical background to Ostrova-Biala]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand Rabbi Aaron Shlomo Chaim Eleazar Rabinowicz, the Bialer Rebbe of America, was born in Bnei Brak. He is the son-in-law of the Dezher Rebbe of Boro Park. His chasidic court is located in the [[Boro Park]] section of [[Brooklyn]], NY. He was appointed by his father to be the Biala Rebbe in America after his father's death. He also has two synagogues in Israel, in [[Beitar Illit]] and in Jerusalem, and he spends much time there, as well as a synagogue in North Miami Beach, Florida.
He has published a biography of his father and grandfather in Yiddish entitled ''Der Heyliger Rebbi fun Biala: Tiferes Avos''. He has also re-published several books from the Biala dynasty: ''Sefer Divrei Binah'' and ''Yishrei Lev'' by the first Bialer Rebbe, with indexes and, recently, an English-Hebrew edition of ''Sefer Seder HaYom'' by his grandfather, the ''Chelkas Yehoshua'', which was translated by Rabbi Joseph Kolakowski.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/bialarebbe&amp;date=2009-10-25+13:32:13 www.bialayeshiva.com Biala Yeshiva website]&lt;/ref&gt;

  | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BSM) encompasses the technology, methodology, organization, and culture that brings business stakeholders together to collaboratively realize the reconciliation of their heterogeneous [[metadata]]; and consequently the application of the derived [[#Business semantics|business semantics]] patterns to establish semantic alignment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management.com/media/pdfs/collibra.pdf|title=Information Management Resources  - Information Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the underlying [[data structure]]s.

BSM is established by two complementary process cycles each grouping a number of activities. The first cycle is the [[#Semantic Reconciliation|semantic reconciliation]] cycle, and the second cycle is the [[#Semantic Application|semantic application]] cycle. The two cycles are tied together by the unification process. This double process cycle is iteratively applied until an optimal balance of differences and commonalities between stakeholders are reached that meets the [[semantic integration]] requirements. This approach is based on research on community-based [[ontology engineering]] (&lt;ref name="deleenheer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deleenheer2"/&gt;) that is validated in European projects, government and industry.

==Semantic Reconciliation==
Semantic reconciliation is a [[process cycle]] constituted of four subsequent activities: scope, create, refine, and articulate. First, the community is scoped: user roles and [[affordance]]s are appointed. Next, relevant facts are collected from documentation such as, e.g., [[natural language]] descriptions, (legacy) [[logical schema]]s, or other metadata and consequently decomposing this scope in elicitation contexts. The deliverable of scoping is an initial upper common [[ontology]] that organizes the key upper common patterns that are shared and accepted by the community. These upper common patterns define the current [[semantic interoperability]] requirements of the community. Once the community is scoped, all stakeholders syntactically refine and semantically articulate these upper common patterns.

==Unification==
During unification, a new proposal for the next version of the upper common ontology is produced, aligning relevant parts from the common and divergent stakeholder perspectives. If the semantic reconciliation results in a number of reusable language-neutral and context-independent patterns for constructing business semantics that are articulated with informal meaning descriptions, then the unification is worthwhile.

==Semantic Application==
Semantic application is a process cycle constituted of two subsequent activities: select and commit where the scoped information systems are committed to selected consolidated business semantic patterns. This is done by first selecting relevant patterns from the pattern base. Next, the interpretation of this selection is semantically constrained. Finally, the various scoped sources and services are mapped on (read: committed to) this selection. The selection and axiomatization of this selection should approximate the intended business semantics. This can be verified by automatically verbalization into natural language, and validation of the unlocked data.  Validation or deprecation of the commitments may result in another iteration of the semantic reconciliation cycle.

==Business semantics==
Business semantics &lt;ref name="deleenheer1"/&gt; are the information concepts that live in the organization, understandable for both business and IT. Business Semantics describe the business concepts as they are used and needed by the business instead of describing the information from a technical point of view.

One important aspect of business semantics is that they are shared between many disparate data sources. Many data sources share the same semantics but have different syntax, or format to describe the same concepts.

The way these business semantics are described is less important. Several approaches can be used such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[object-role modeling]], [[XML]], etc. This corresponds to Robert Meersman’s statement that semantics are "a (set of) mapping(s) from your representation language to agreed [[concept]]s (objects, relationships, behavior) in the real-world".&lt;ref name=sheth&gt;{{cite conference

In the construction of [[information system]]s, semantics have always been crucial.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In previous approaches, these semantics were left implicit (i.e. In the mind of reader or writer), hidden away in the implementation itself (e.g., in a [[database table]] or column code) or informally captured in [[Free-text|textual]] documentation.&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;{{cite conference

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dave McComb, "The scale and scope of our systems and the amount of information we now have to deal with are straining that model."&lt;ref name=dmreview&gt;{{Cite web

Nowadays, information systems need to interact in a more open manner, and it becomes crucial to formally represent and apply the semantics these systems are concerned with.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Application==
Business semantics management empowers all stakeholders in the organization by a consistent and aligned definition of the important information assets of the organization.

The available business semantics can be leveraged in the so-called business/social layer of the organization. They can for example be coupled to a [[content management]] application to provide the business with a consistent business vocabulary or enable better navigation or classification of information, leveraged by enterprise [[search engine]]s to make richer [[semantic-web]]-ready websites, etc..

Business semantics can also be used to increase operational efficiency in the technical/operation layer of the organization. It provides an abstracted way to access and deliver data in a more efficient manner. In that respect, it is similar to [[Enterprise Information Integration]] (EII) with the added benefit that the shared models are not described in technical terms but in a way that is easily understood by the business.

[[Collibra]] is the first organization to commercialize the idea behind business semantics management. Collibra's approach to Business Semantics Management is based on [[DOGMA]], a research project at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

'''Climate change and agriculture''' are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale. [[Global warming|Climate change]] affects [[agriculture]] in a number of ways, including through changes in [[instrumental temperature record|average temperatures]], [[rain]]fall, and climate [[extreme weather|extremes]] (e.g., heat waves); changes in [[pest (organism)|pests]] and diseases; changes in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and ground-level [[ozone]] concentrations; changes in the [[nutrition]]al quality of some foods;&lt;ref name=science-news&gt;{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Milius|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nutrition-climate-change-top-science-stories-2017-yir|title=Worries grow that climate change will quietly steal nutrients from major food crops|date=December 13, 2017|work=[[Science News]]|access-date=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in [[current sea level rise|sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, U., Section B: Agriculture - a key driver and a major victim of global warming, in: Lead Article, in: Chapter 1, in {{harvnb|Hoffmann|2013|pp=3, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Animal agriculture is also responsible for {{CO2}} greenhouse gas production and a percentage of the world's methane, and future land infertility, and the displacement of local species.

Agriculture contributes to climate change both by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as [[forest]]s into agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;Section 4.2: Agriculture’s current contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, in: {{harvnb|HLPE|2012|pp=67–69}}

Despite technological advances, such as [[crop breeding|improved varieties]], [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]], and [[irrigation]] systems, weather is still a key factor in agricultural productivity, as well as [[soil]] properties and [[Biota (ecology)|natural communities]]. The effect of climate on agriculture is related to variabilities in local climates rather than in global climate patterns. The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by 1.5&amp;nbsp;°F (0.83&amp;nbsp;[[°C]]) since 1880. Consequently,  in making an assessment [[agronomist]]s must consider each [[ecoregion|local area]].

On the other hand, [[agricultural economics|agricultural trade]] has grown in recent years, and now provides significant amounts of food, on a national level to major importing countries, as well as comfortable [[gross domestic product|income]] to exporting ones. The international aspect of trade and security in terms of food implies the need to also consider the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] on a global scale.

A 2008 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggested that, due to climate change, "southern Africa could lose more than 30% of its main crop, maize, by 2030. In South Asia losses of many regional staples, such as rice, millet and maize could top 10%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7220807.stm | title=Climate 'could devastate crops' | date=31 January 2008 |publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lobell DB, Burke MB, Tebaldi C, Mastrandrea MD, Falcon WP, Naylor RL | title = Prioritizing climate change adaptation needs for food security in 2030 | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5863 | pages = 607–10 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18239122 | doi = 10.1126/science.1152339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has produced several reports that have assessed the [[scientific literature]] on climate change. The [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], published in 2001, concluded that the poorest countries would be hardest hit, with reductions in crop yields in most tropical and sub-tropical regions due to decreased water availability, and new or changed insect pest incidence. In Africa and Latin America many rainfed crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance, so that yields are likely to fall sharply for even small climate changes; falls in agricultural productivity of up to 30% over the 21st century are projected. Marine life and the fishing industry will also be severely affected in some places.

Climate change induced by increasing [[greenhouse gas]]es is likely to affect crops differently from region to region. For example, average crop yield is expected to drop down to 50% in Pakistan according to the [[Met Office]] scenario whereas corn production in Europe is expected to grow up to 25% in optimum [[hydrologic]] conditions.

More favourable effects on yield tend to depend to a large extent on realization of the potentially [[beneficial effects of global warming|beneficial effects of carbon dioxide on crop growth]] and increase of efficiency in [[water use]]. Decrease in potential yields is likely to be caused by shortening of the growing period, decrease in water availability and poor [[vernalization]].

In the long run, the climatic change could affect agriculture in several ways :
* ''productivity'', in terms of [[quantity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]] of crops
* ''agricultural practices'', through changes of water use (irrigation) and agricultural inputs such as [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s
* ''environmental effects'', in particular in relation of frequency and intensity of soil [[drainage]] (leading to nitrogen leaching), [[soil erosion]], reduction of [[biodiversity|crop diversity]]
* ''rural space'', through the loss and gain of cultivated lands, land [[speculation]], land renunciation, and hydraulic amenities.
* ''adaptation'', organisms may become more or less competitive, as well as humans may develop urgency to develop more competitive organisms, such as flood resistant or [[Crop tolerance to seawater|salt resistant]] varieties of rice.

They are large uncertainties to uncover, particularly because there is lack of information on many specific local regions, and include the uncertainties on magnitude of climate change, the effects of technological changes on productivity, global food demands, and the numerous possibilities of adaptation.

Most agronomists believe that agricultural production will be mostly affected by the severity and pace of climate change, not so much by gradual trends in climate. If change is gradual, there may be enough time for [[biota (ecology)|biota]] adjustment. Rapid climate change, however, could harm agriculture in many countries, especially those that are already suffering from rather poor soil and climate conditions, because there is less time for optimum [[natural selection]] and adaption.

But much remains unknown about exactly how [[climate change]] may affect farming and [[food security]], in part because the role of farmer behaviour is poorly captured by crop-climate models.  For instance, Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]] [[Canada]], has conducted a number of studies that show that the socio-economic context of farming may play a huge role in determining whether a [[drought]] has a major, or an insignificant impact on crop production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = E | year = 2007a | title = Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change | url = | journal = Climate Change | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 495–514 | doi=10.1007/s10584-007-9240-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simelton, E. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simelton | first1 = E. | last2 = Fraser | first2 = E. | last3 = Termansen | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Typologies of crop-drought vulnerability: an empirical analysis of the socio-economic factors that influence the sensitivity and resilience to drought of three major food crops in China (1961–2001) | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Policy | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 438–452 | doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2008.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it seems that even minor droughts have big impacts on food security (such as what happened in [[Ethiopia]] in the early 1980s where a minor drought triggered a massive [[famine]]), versus cases where even relatively large weather-related problems were adapted to without much hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = E. | last2 = Termansen | first2 = M. | last3 = Sun | first3 = N. | last4 = Guan | first4 = D. | last5 = Simelton | first5 = E. | last6 = Dodds | first6 = P. | last7 = Feng | first7 = K. | last8 = Yu | first8 = Y. | year = 2008 | title = Quantifying socio economic characteristics of drought sensitive regions: evidence from Chinese provincial agricultural data | url = | journal = Comptes Rendus Geoscience | volume = 340 | issue = 9–10| pages = 679–688 | doi=10.1016/j.crte.2008.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evan Fraser combines socio-economic models along with climatic models to identify “vulnerability hotspots”&lt;ref name="Simelton, E. 2009"/&gt; One such study has identified [[Corn production in the United States|US maize (corn) production]] as particularly vulnerable to climate change because it is expected to be exposed to worse droughts, but it does not have the socio-economic conditions that suggest farmers will adapt to these changing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = E.

=== Pest insects and climate change ===
Global warming could lead to an increase in pest insect populations, harming yields of staple crops like [[wheat]], [[soybean]]s, and corn.&lt;ref name="Live Science"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/4296-global-warming-trigger-insect-population-boom.html|title=Global Warming Could Trigger Insect Population Boom|work=Live Science|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; While warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons, and faster growth rates for plants, it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations.&lt;ref name="Live Science"/&gt; Insects that previously had only two breeding cycles per year could gain an additional cycle if warm growing seasons extend, causing a population boom. Temperate places and higher [[latitude]]s are more likely to experience a dramatic change in insect populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stange|first=Erik|date=November 2010|title=Climate Change Impact: Insects|url=http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0022555.html|journal=Norwegian Institute for Nature Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] conducted studies to measure the effect of warmer temperatures on soybean plant growth and Japanese beetle populations.&lt;ref name="Union of Concerned Scientists"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/impacts/Global-warming-insects.html#.WOwzzDvy|title=Crops, Beetles, and Carbon Dioxide:|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warmer temperatures and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels were simulated for one field of soybeans, while the other was left as a control. These studies found that the soybeans with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels grew much faster and had higher yields, but attracted [[Japanese beetle]]s at a significantly higher rate than the control field.&lt;ref name="Union of Concerned Scientists"/&gt; The beetles in the field with increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also laid more eggs on the soybean plants and had longer lifespans, indicating the possibility of a rapidly expanding population. DeLucia projected that if the project were to continue, the field with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels would eventually show lower yields than that of the control field.&lt;ref name="Union of Concerned Scientists"/&gt;

The increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels deactivated three genes within the soybean plant that normally create chemical defenses against pest insects. One of these defenses is a protein that blocks digestion of the soy leaves in insects. Since this gene was deactivated, the beetles were able to digest a much higher amount of plant matter than the beetles in the control field. This led to the observed longer lifespans and higher egg-laying rates in the experimental field.&lt;ref name="Union of Concerned Scientists"/&gt;

There are a few proposed solutions to the issue of expanding pest populations. One proposed solution is to increase the number of pesticides used on future crops.&lt;ref name="agadapt.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agadapt.ucdavis.edu/pestsdiseases/|title=Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the benefit of being relatively cost effective and simple, but may be ineffective. Many pest insects have been building up an [[Pesticide resistance|immunity]] to these pesticides. Another proposed solution is to utilize [[Biological pest control|biological control agents]].&lt;ref name="agadapt.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; This includes things like planting rows of native vegetation in between rows of crops. This solution is beneficial in its overall environmental impact. Not only are more native plants getting planted, but pest insects are no longer building up an immunity to pesticides. However, planting additional native plants requires more room, which destroys additional acres of public land. The cost is also much higher than simply using pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stange|first=Erik|date=November 2010|title=Climate Change Impact: Insects|url=|journal=Norwegian Institute for Nature Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plant diseases and climate change ===
Although research is limited, research has shown that climate change may alter the developmental stages of pathogens that can affect crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coakley SM, Scherm H, Chakraborty S | title = Climate change and plant disease management | journal = Annual Review of Phytopathology | volume = 37 | pages = 399–426 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 11701829 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.phyto.37.1.399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest consequence of climate change on the dispersal of pathogens is that the geographical distribution of hosts and pathogens could shift, which would result in more crop losses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could affect competition and recovery from disturbances of plants. It has been predicted that the effect of climate change will add a level of complexity to figuring out how to maintain sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the summer of 2018, heat waves probably linked to climate change cause much lower than average yield in many parts of the world, especially in Europe.

===Projections===

As part of the IPCC's [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]], Schneider ''et al.'' (2007) [[Global climate model#Projections of future climate change|projected]] the potential future effects of climate change on agriculture.&lt;ref name=tab191&gt;{{cite book | author = Schneider, SH | contribution = 19.3.1 Introduction to Table 19.1 | title = Chapter 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change | series = Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability: contribution of Working Group II to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | url = http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-1.html | editor = ML Parry | publisher = Print version: CUP.

&lt;/ref&gt; With low to medium confidence, they concluded that for about a 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;°C global mean temperature increase (by 2100, relative to the 1990–2000 average level) there would be productivity decreases for some cereals in low latitudes, and productivity increases in high latitudes. In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, "low confidence" means that a particular finding has about a 2 out of 10 chance of being correct, based on expert judgement. "Medium confidence" has about a 5 out of 10 chance of being correct.&lt;ref name="parry uncertainty assessment"&gt;{{cite book | author = Parry, ML | contribution = Box TS.2.

&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same time period, with medium confidence, global production potential was projected to:&lt;ref name=tab191/&gt;
* increase up to around 3&amp;nbsp;°C,
* very likely decrease above about 3&amp;nbsp;°C.

Most of the studies on global agriculture assessed by Schneider ''et al.'' (2007) had not incorporated a number of critical factors, including changes in extreme events, or the spread of pests and diseases. Studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid [[adaptation to global warming#Agricultural production|adaptation to climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Schneider, SH | contribution = 19.3.2.1 Agriculture | title = Chapter 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change | series = Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability: contribution of Working Group II to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | url = http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-2-1.html | editor = ML Parry | publisher = Print version: CUP.

&lt;/ref&gt; stressed the uncertainties in their projections of changes in crop yields.

Writing in the journal ''[[Nature Climate Change]]'', Matthew Smith and Samuel Myers (2018) estimated that food crops could see a reduction of [[protein]], [[iron]] and [[zinc]] content in common food crops of 3 to 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Matthew R.|last2=Myers|first2=Samuel S.|date=2018-08-27|title=Impact of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on global human nutrition|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0253-3.epdf?referrer_access_token=Cp-MkN2GBOJ_9g_ATeYL6NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O5J0oP_LhVUOgym62AyF5ghuOS5aOCa4g0Agd33biHRPVvzshteII8s6f0432vmaDtwx28IbA_1rUF6bUFrcpPQmlkW8yIrssI3hK9jpJ8kZzTEIuIQmPgiyqj0FPn0ncunCPKX2u6ikr5IkKTJfRKB6Nk_AJt0lw9Z701SZMl9BwrSre6lOjBS9yodCaoCZb27oS0b16hW-aotQByRPF9Gu8SwyrmZFVh1lUBrw9lsYH0VGPZ03Yh3GbVOdxEh6mIyJq7XA37Wopl29RVFdHU&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=8|issue=9|pages=834–839|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0253-3|issn=1758-678X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the projected result of food grown under the expected atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels of 2050.

====Food security====

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report also describes the impact of climate change on [[food security]].&lt;ref name="easterling sub saharan africa"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Projections suggested that there could be large decreases in [[hunger]] globally by 2080, compared to the (then-current) 2006 level.&lt;ref name="easterling food security"&gt;
{{cite book | author = Easterling, WE | contribution = Executive summary | title = Chapter 5: Food, Fibre, and Forest Products | series = Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability: contribution of Working Group II to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | url = http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch5s5-es.html | editor = ML Parry | year = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-88010-7 | display-editors = etal }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Reductions in hunger were driven by projected [[social change|social]] and [[economic development]]. For reference, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has estimated that in 2006, the number of people undernourished globally was 820 million.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[climate change scenario|scenarios]] ''without'' climate change ([[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] A1, B1, B2) projected 100-130 million undernourished by the year 2080, while another scenario without climate change (SRES A2) projected 770 million undernourished. Based on an expert assessment of all of the evidence, these projections were thought to have about a 5-in-10 chance of being correct.&lt;ref name="parry uncertainty assessment"/&gt;

The same set of greenhouse gas and socio-economic scenarios were also used in projections that included the effects of climate change.&lt;ref name="easterling food security"/&gt; ''Including'' climate change, three scenarios (SRES A1, B1, B2) projected 100-380 million undernourished by the year 2080, while another scenario with climate change (SRES A2) projected 740-1,300 million undernourished. These projections were thought to have between a 2-in-10 and 5-in-10 chance of being correct.&lt;ref name="parry uncertainty assessment"/&gt;

Projections also suggested regional changes in the global distribution of hunger.&lt;ref name="easterling food security"/&gt; By 2080, [[sub-Saharan Africa]] may overtake [[Asia]] as the world's most food-insecure region. This is mainly due to projected social and economic changes, rather than climate change.&lt;ref name="easterling sub saharan africa"/&gt;

In South America, a phenomenon known as the El Nino Oscillation Cycle, between floods and drought on the Pacific Coast has made as much as a 35% difference in Global yields of wheat and grain.&lt;ref&gt;Howden, M. e. (2007). Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104/50, 19691-19696&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the four key components of food security we can see the impact climate change has had. Food “Access to food is largely a matter of household and individual-level income and of capabilities and rights” (Wheeler et al.,2013).  Access has been affected by the thousands of crops being destroyed, how communities are dealing with climate shocks and adapting to climate change. Prices on food will rise due to the shortage of food production due to conditions not being favourable for crop production. Utilization is affected by floods and drought where water resources are contaminated, and the changing temperatures create vicious stages and phases of disease. Availability is affected by the contamination of the crops, as there will be no food process for the products of these crops as a result. Stability is affected through price ranges and future prices as some food sources are becoming scarce due to climate change, so prices will rise.

====Individual studies====

Cline (2008)&lt;ref name="cline projections"&gt;
{{harvnb|Cline|2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how climate change might affect agricultural productivity in the 2080s. His study assumes that no efforts are made to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, leading to global warming of 3.3&amp;nbsp;°C above the pre-industrial level. He concluded that global agricultural productivity could be negatively affected by climate change, with the worst effects in developing countries (see graph opposite).

Lobell ''et al.'' (2008a)&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Lobell|others|2008a}} (paywall). {{harvnb|Lobell|others|2008b}} can be freely accessed.
&lt;/ref&gt; assessed how climate change might affect 12 food-insecure regions in 2030. The purpose of their analysis was to assess where adaptation measures to climate change should be prioritized. They found that without sufficient adaptation measures, South Asia and South Africa would likely suffer negative impacts on several crops which are important to large food insecure human populations.

Battisti and Naylor (2009)&lt;ref name="battisti seasonal temp"&gt;{{harvnb|Battisti|Naylor|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how increased seasonal temperatures might affect agricultural productivity. Projections by the IPCC suggest that with climate change, high seasonal temperatures will become widespread, with the likelihood of extreme temperatures increasing through the second half of the 21st century. Battisti and Naylor (2009)&lt;ref name="battisti seasonal temp"/&gt; concluded that such changes could have very serious effects on agriculture, particularly in the tropics. They suggest that major, near-term, investments in adaptation measures could reduce these risks.

"[[Climate change]] merely increases the urgency of reforming trade policies to ensure that global [[food security]] needs are met"&lt;ref name="ictsd"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/i/press/press-releases/61231/ Ending hunger will require trade policy reform], Press Release, [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development]], 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; said C. Bellmann, [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|ICTSD]] Programmes Director.  A 2009 ICTSD-IPC study by Jodie Keane&lt;ref name="study"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2009/10/draft-ictsd-ipc-paper.pdf Climate change, agriculture and aid for trade], by Jodie Keane, [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|ICTSD]]-IPC&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that [[climate change]] could cause farm output in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] to decrease by 12% by 2080 - although in some African countries this figure could be as much as 60%, with [[Agreement on Agriculture|agricultural exports]] declining by up to one fifth in others. Adapting to [[climate change]] could cost the agriculture sector $14bn globally a year, the study finds.

&lt;/ref&gt; projected that climate variability and change would severely compromise agricultural production and access to food. This projection was assigned "high confidence."

Africa's geography makes it particularly vulnerable to climate change, and seventy per cent of the population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. [[Tanzania]]'s official report on climate change suggests that the areas that usually get two rainfalls in the year will probably get more, and those that get only one rainy season will get far less. As of 2005, the net result was expected to be that 33% less maize—the country's staple crop—would be grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517935,00.html |title=In the land where life is on hold |author=John Vidal |website=The Guardian |location=UK |date=30 June 2005 |access-date=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia====

In [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], IPCC (2007:13)&lt;ref name="ar4 summary of regional impacts"/&gt; projected that [[crop yield]]s could increase up to 20% by the mid-21st century. In [[Central Asia|Central]] and South Asia, projections suggested that yields might decrease by up to 30%, over the same time period. These projections were assigned "medium confidence." Taken together, the risk of hunger was projected to remain very high in several developing countries.

More detailed analysis of rice yields by the [[International Rice Research Institute]] forecast 20% reduction in yields over the region per degree Celsius of temperature rise. Rice becomes sterile if exposed to temperatures above 35 degrees for more than one hour during flowering and consequently produces no grain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''], [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study found that warming had increased maize yields in the [[Heilongjiang]] region of China had increased by between 7 and 17% per decade as a result of rising temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10584-013-1009-8| title = The benefits of recent warming for maize production in high latitude China| journal = Climatic Change| volume = 122| pages = 341–349| year = 2013| last1 = Meng | first1 = Q. | last2 = Hou | first2 = P. | last3 = Lobell | first3 = D.

&lt;/ref&gt; assessed the literature for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. They concluded that without further adaptation to climate change, projected impacts would likely be substantial: By 2030, production from agriculture and [[forestry]] was projected to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand; In New Zealand, initial benefits were projected close to major rivers and in western and southern areas.

====Europe====

With high confidence, IPCC (2007:14)&lt;ref name="ar4 summary of regional impacts"/&gt; projected that in [[Southern Europe]], climate change would reduce crop productivity. In [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], forest productivity was expected to decline. In [[Northern Europe]], the initial effect of climate change was projected to increase crop yields.

The major agricultural products of [[Latin American]] regions include [[livestock]] and grains, such as [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[soybeans]], and [[rice]].&lt;ref name="ref 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=JONES|first=P|author2=THORNTON, P|title=The potential impacts of climate change on maize production in Africa and Latin America in 2055|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=April 2003|volume=13|issue=1|pages=51–59|doi=10.1016/S0959-3780(02)00090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 2" /&gt; Increased temperatures and altered hydrological cycles are predicted to translate to shorter growing seasons, overall reduced biomass production, and lower grain yields.&lt;ref name="ref 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baethgen|first=WE|title=Vulnerability of the agricultural sector of Latin America to climate change|journal=Climate Research|date=1997|volume=9|pages=1–7|doi=10.3354/cr009001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendelsohn|first=R.|author2=Dinar, A.|title=Climate Change, Agriculture, and Developing Countries: Does Adaptation Matter?|journal=The World Bank Research Observer|date=1 August 1999|volume=14|issue=2|pages=277–293|doi=10.1093/wbro/14.2.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]] alone contribute 70-90% of the total agricultural production in Latin America.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; In these and other dry regions, maize production is expected to decrease.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; A study summarizing a number of impact studies of climate change on agriculture in Latin America indicated that wheat is expected to decrease in Brazil, Argentina and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; Livestock, which is the main agricultural product for parts of Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]] is likely to be reduced.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; Variability in the degree of production decrease among different regions of Latin America is likely.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt; For example, one 2003 study that estimated future maize production in Latin America predicted that by 2055 maize in eastern Brazil will have moderate changes while Venezuela is expected to have drastic decreases.&lt;ref name="ref 1" /&gt;

Suggested potential adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of global warming on agriculture in Latin America include using plant breeding technologies and installing irrigation infrastructure.&lt;ref name="ref 2" /&gt;

===== Climate justice and subsistence farmers in Latin America =====

Several studies that investigated the impacts of climate change on agriculture in Latin America suggest that in the poorer countries of [[Latin America]], agriculture composes the most important economic sector and the primary form of sustenance for small farmers.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton JF | title = The impact of climate change on smallholder and subsistence agriculture | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 50 | pages = 19680–5 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18077400 | pmc = 2148357 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701855104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maize]] is the only grain still produced as a sustenance crop on small farms in Latin American nations.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; Scholars argue that the projected decrease of this grain and other crops will threaten the welfare and the economic development of subsistence communities in Latin America.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 3"/&gt; Food security is of particular concern to rural areas that have weak or non-existent food markets to rely on in the case food shortages.&lt;ref name="ref 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timmons Roberts|first=J.|title=The International Dimension of Climate Justice and the Need for International Adaptation Funding|journal=Environmental Justice|volume=2|issue=4|pages=185–190|doi=10.1089/env.2009.0029|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholars who considered the environmental justice implications of climate change, the expected impacts of climate change on subsistence farmers in Latin America and other developing regions are unjust for two reasons.&lt;ref name="ref 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Mark|author2=Guenther, Bruce; Leavy, Jennifer; Mitchell, Tom; Tanner, Thomas|title=Climate Change Adaptation, Disaster Risk Reduction and Social Protection: Complementary Roles in Agriculture and Rural Growth?|journal=IDS Working Papers|volume=2009|issue=320|pages=01–37|doi=10.1111/j.2040-0209.2009.00320_2|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, subsistence farmers in developing countries, including those in Latin America are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change&lt;ref name="ref 6"/&gt; Second, these nations were the least responsible for causing the problem of anthropogenic induced climate.&lt;ref name="ref 6" /&gt;

According to researchers John F. Morton and T. Roberts, disproportionate vulnerability to climate disasters is socially determined.&lt;ref name="ref 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 6"/&gt; For example, socioeconomic and policy trends affecting smallholder and subsistence farmers limit their capacity to adapt to change.&lt;ref name="ref 4"/&gt; According to W. Baethgen who studied the vulnerability of Latin American agriculture to climate change, a history of policies and economic dynamics has negatively impacted rural farmers.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; During the 1950s and through the 1980s, high inflation and appreciated real exchange rates reduced the value of agricultural exports.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; As a result, farmers in Latin America received lower prices for their products compared to world market prices.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; Following these outcomes, Latin American policies and national crop programs aimed to stimulate agricultural intensification.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; These national crop programs benefitted larger commercial farmers more. In the 1980s and 1990s low world market prices for cereals and livestock resulted in decreased agricultural growth and increased rural poverty.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt;

In the book, Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change, the authors describe the global injustice of climate change between the rich nations of the north, who are the most responsible for global warming and the southern poor countries and minority populations within those countries who are most vulnerable to climate change impacts.&lt;ref name="ref 6"/&gt;

Adaptive planning is challenged by the difficulty of predicting local scale climate change impacts.&lt;ref name="ref 4"/&gt; An expert that considered opportunities for climate change adaptation for rural communities argues that a crucial component to adaptation should include government efforts to lessen the effects of food shortages and famines.&lt;ref name="ref 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by [[Neil Adger|W.

====North America====

A number of studies have been produced which assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture in [[North America]]. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report of agricultural impacts in the region cites 26 different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Field, C.B. | contribution=Sec. 14.4.4 Agriculture, forestry and fisheries | title=Chapter 14: North America | series=Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability: contribution of Working Group II to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch14s14-4-4.html | editor=ML Parry | year=2007 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-88010-7 | display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With high confidence, IPCC (2007:14–15)&lt;ref name="ar4 summary of regional impacts"/&gt; projected that over the first few decades of this century, moderate climate change would increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5–20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges were projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources.

Droughts are becoming more frequent and intense in arid and [[semiarid]] western North America as temperatures have been rising, advancing the timing and magnitude of spring snow melt ﬂoods and reducing river flow volume in summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events|title=Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Table of Events -  National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)|first=Adam|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct effects of climate change include increased heat and water stress, altered crop [[phenology]], and disrupted symbiotic interactions. These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river ﬂow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favor of non-native [[herbaceous]] and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and [[nutrient]] cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Perry|first1= Laura G.|last2= Andersen|first2= Douglas C.|last3= Reynolds|first3= Lindsay V.|last4= Nelson|first4= S.

The US Global Change Research Program (2009) assessed the literature on the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the United States, finding that many crops will benefit from increased atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations and low levels of warming, but that higher levels of warming will negatively affect growth and yields; that extreme weather events will likely reduce crop yields; that [[weed]]s, [[disease]]s and [[insect]] [[pest (organism)|pests]] will benefit from warming, and will require additional [[pest control|pest]] and [[weed control]]; and that increasing {{CO2}} concentrations will reduce the land's ability to supply adequate livestock feed, while increased heat, disease, and weather extremes will likely reduce livestock productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=USGCRP | year=2009 | title=Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States | chapter=Agriculture |editor1=Karl, T.R. |editor2=Melillo.

====Polar regions====

Anisimov ''et al.''. (2007:655)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2007 |chapter=Chapter 15: Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic): Executive summary | title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

With medium confidence, they concluded that the benefits of a less severe climate were dependent on local conditions. One of these benefits was judged to be increased agricultural and forestry opportunities.

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported on how climate change had affected agriculture in Iceland. Rising temperatures had made the widespread sowing of [[barley]] possible, which had been untenable twenty years ago. Some of the warming was due to a local (possibly temporary) effect via ocean currents from the Caribbean, which had also affected fish stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517939,00.html |title=Frozen assets |author=Paul Brown |work=The Guardian |date=30 June 2005 |access-date=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Small islands====

In a literature assessment, Mimura ''et al.'' (2007:689)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that on small islands, [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence]] and [[commercial agriculture]] would very likely be adversely affected by climate change. This projection was assigned "high confidence."

=== Poverty impacts ===

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) have investigated the potential impacts climate change could have on agriculture, and how this would affect attempts at alleviating poverty in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name="ccandpoverty"/&gt; They argued that the effects from moderate climate change are likely to be mixed for developing countries. However, the vulnerability of the poor in developing countries to short term impacts from climate change, notably the increased frequency and severity of adverse weather events is likely to have a negative impact. This, they say, should be taken into account when defining [[agricultural policy]].&lt;ref name="ccandpoverty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1231&amp;title=climate-change-agricultural-policy-poverty-reduction-much-know |title= Climate change, agricultural policy and poverty reduction – how much do we know? |year=2007 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mitigation and adaptation in developing countries ===
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[IPCC]]) has reported that agriculture is responsible for over a quarter of total global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;[[IPCC]]. 2007. Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report. Contributions of Working Groups I, Ii, and Iiito the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Geneva:
IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; Given that agriculture’s share in global [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) is about 4%, these figures suggest that [[agriculture]] is highly [[greenhouse gas]] intensive. Innovative agricultural practices and technologies can play a role in [[climate]] change mitigation &lt;ref name="mitigation"&gt;Basak R. 2016. Benefits and costs of climate change mitigation technologies in paddy rice: Focus on Bangladesh and Vietnam. CCAFS Working Paper no. 160. Copenhagen, Denmark: CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). http://cgspace.cgiar.org/rest/bitstreams/79059/retrieve&lt;/ref&gt; and adaptation. This adaptation and mitigation potential is nowhere more pronounced than in developing countries where agricultural productivity remains low; poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity remain high; and the direct effects of climate change are expected to be especially harsh. Creating the necessary agricultural technologies and harnessing them to enable developing countries to adapt their agricultural systems to changing climate will require innovations in policy and institutions as well.  In this context, institutions and policies are important at multiple scales.

Travis Lybbert and Daniel Sumner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictsd.org/downloads/2010/06/agricultural-technologies-for-climate-change-mitigation-and-adaptation-in-developing-countries_web.pdf |title=Agricultural Technologies for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Developing Countries:Policy Options for Innovation and Technology Diffusion |publisher=[[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development]] |date=May 2010 |access-date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest six policy principles:
(1) The best policy and institutional responses will enhance information flows, incentives and flexibility.
(2) Policies and institutions that promote economic development and reduce poverty will often improve agricultural adaptation and may also pave the way for more effective climate change mitigation through agriculture.
(3) Business as usual among the world’s poor is not adequate.
(4) Existing technology options must be made more available and accessible without overlooking complementary capacity and investments.
(5) Adaptation and mitigation in [[agriculture]] will require local responses, but effective policy responses must also reflect global impacts and inter-linkages.
(6) [[Trade]] will play a critical role in both mitigation and adaptation, but will itself be shaped importantly by climate change.

The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/page/pressroom/2015-03-10-02 |title= Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project: Phase I Activities by a Global Community of Science  |publisher=[[Imperial College Press/ World Scientific Publishing]] |date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 2010 to evaluate agricultural models and intercompare their ability to predict climate impacts. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, South America and East Asia, AgMIP regional research teams (RRTs) are conducting integrated assessments to improve understanding of agricultural impacts of climate change (including biophysical and economic impacts) at national and regional scales. Other AgMIP initiatives include global gridded modeling, data and information technology (IT) tool development, simulation of crop pests and diseases, site-based crop-climate sensitivity studies, and aggregation and scaling.

=== Crop development models ===

Models for climate behavior are frequently inconclusive. In order to further study effects of global warming on agriculture, other types of models, such as ''crop development models'', ''yield prediction'', quantities of ''water or fertilizer consumed'', can be used. Such models condense the knowledge accumulated of the climate, soil, and effects observed of the results of various [[agricultural practices]]. They thus could make it possible to test strategies of adaptation to modifications of the environment.

Because these models are necessarily simplifying natural conditions (often based on the assumption that weeds, disease and insect [[pest (animal)|pests]] are controlled), it is not clear whether the results they give will have an ''in-field'' reality. However, some results are partly validated with an increasing number of experimental results.

Other models, such as ''insect and disease development'' models based on climate projections are also used (for example simulation of [[aphid]] reproduction or [[septoria]] (cereal fungal disease) development).

Scenarios are used in order to estimate climate changes effects on crop development and yield. Each scenario is defined as a set of [[meteorological]] variables, based on generally accepted projections. For example, many models are running simulations based on doubled [[carbon dioxide]] projections, temperatures raise ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;°C up to 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and with rainfall levels an increase or decrease of 20%. Other parameters may include [[humidity]], wind, and [[solar variation|solar activity]]. Scenarios of crop models are testing farm-level adaptation, such as sowing date shift, climate adapted species ([[vernalisation]] need, heat and cold resistance), [[irrigation]] and fertilizer adaptation, resistance to disease. Most developed models are about wheat, maize, rice and [[soybean]].

=== Temperature potential effect on growing period ===

Duration of crop [[cell growth|growth]] [[biological life cycle|cycles]] are above all, related to temperature. An increase in temperature will speed up development. In the case of an annual crop, the duration between [[sowing]] and [[harvesting]] will shorten (for example, the duration in order to harvest corn could shorten between one and four weeks). The shortening of such a cycle could have an adverse effect on productivity because [[senescence]] would occur sooner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Effect of elevated carbon dioxide on crops ===

Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide effects plants in a variety of ways. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases crop yields and growth through an increase in photosynthetic rate, and it also decreases water loss as a result of stomatal closing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-study-rising-carbon-dioxide-levels-will-help-and-hurt-crops|title=Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Will Help and Hurt Crops|last=Hille|first=Karl|date=2016-05-03|work=NASA|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth response is greatest in [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants ,]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;are also enhanced but to a lesser extent, and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM Plants]] are the least enhanced species&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JONGEN|first=MARJAN|last2=JONES|first2=MIKE B.|date=1998|title=Effects of Elevated Carbon Dioxide on Plant Biomass Production and Competition in a Simulated Neutral Grassland Community|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42765089|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=82|issue=1|pages=111–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== '''Effect of Drought Stress on Crops''' ===
Increase in global temperatures will cause an increase in evaporation rates and annual evaporation levels. Increased evaporation will lead to an increase in storms in some areas, while leading to accelerated drying of other areas. These storm impacted areas will likely experience increased levels of precipitation and increased flood risks, while areas outside of the storm track will experience less precipitation and increased risk of droughts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pmm.nasa.gov/resources/faq/how-does-climate-change-affect-precipitation|title=How does climate change affect precipitation? {{!}} Precipitation Measurement Missions|website=pmm.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Water stress effects plant development and quality in a variety of ways first off drought can cause poor germination and impaired seedling development in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farooq|first=M.|last2=Wahid|first2=A.|last3=Kobayashi|first3=N.|last4=Fujita|first4=D.|last5=Basra|first5=S.

Drought stress impairs mitosis and cell elongation via loss of [[turgor pressure]] which results in poor growth&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fahad S, Bajwa AA, Nazir U, Anjum SA, Farooq A, Zohaib A, Sadia S, Nasim W, Adkins S, Saud S, Ihsan MZ, Alharby H, Wu C, Wang D, Huang J | title = Crop Production under Drought and Heat Stress: Plant Responses and Management Options | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 8 | pages = 1147 | date = 2017-06-29 | pmid = 28706531 | pmc = 5489704 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2017.01147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Plants need water for the uptake of nutrients from the soil, and for the transport of nutrients throughout the plant, drought conditions limit these functions leading to stunted growth. Drought stress also causes a decrease in photosynthetic activity in plants due to the reduction of photosynthetic tissues, stomatal closure, and reduced performance of photosynthetic machinery. This reduction in photosynthetic activity contributes to the reduction in plant growth and yields&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Another factor influencing reduced plant growth and yields include the allocation of resources; following drought stress plants will allocate more resources to roots to aid in water uptake increasing root growth and reducing the growth of other plant parts while decreasing yields&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==== Effect on quality ====
According to the IPCC's TAR, "The importance of climate change impacts on grain and forage quality emerges from new research. For rice, the amylose content of the grain—a major determinant of cooking quality—is increased under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" (Conroy et al., 1994). Cooked rice grain from plants grown in high-{{CO2}} environments would be firmer than that from today's plants. However, concentrations of iron and zinc, which are important for human nutrition, would be lower (Seneweera and Conroy, 1997). Moreover, the protein content of the grain decreases under combined increases of temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ziska et al., 1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/208.htm "Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805194046/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/208.htm |date=5 August 2009 }} IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using [[Free-Air Concentration Enrichment|FACE]] have shown that increases in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02587-9|title=Rising atmospheric {{CO2}} and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry?|year=2002|author=Loladze, I|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|pages=457–461|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; including decreased B vitamins in rice.&lt;ref name="Zhu2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu C, Kobayashi K, Loladze I, Zhu J, Jiang Q, Xu X, Liu G, Seneweera S, Ebi KL, Drewnowski A, Fukagawa NK, Ziska LH | title = 2) levels this century will alter the protein, micronutrients, and vitamin content of rice grains with potential health consequences for the poorest rice-dependent countries | journal = Science Advances | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = eaaq1012 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29806023 | pmc = 5966189 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.aaq1012 | url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/5/eaaq1012 | access-date = July 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbon-dioxide-increases-rice-loses-b-vitamins-nutrients |title=As CO2 increases, rice loses B vitamins and other nutrients |author=Susan Milius |date=May 23, 2018 |website=[[Sciencenews.org]] |publisher= |access-date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have knock-on effects on other parts of [[ecosystem]]s as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carlos E.

Studies have shown that higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels lead to reduced plant uptake of nitrogen (and a smaller number showing the same for trace elements such as zinc) resulting in crops with lower nutritional value.&lt;ref name="The Food, the Bad, and the Ugly"&gt;[http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/07/12/scherer-plantchem/ The Food, the Bad, and the Ugly] ''Scherer, Glenn'' Grist July, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.unl.edu/~iloladze/NewSci/NewSci.htm Plague of plenty] New Scientist Archive&lt;/ref&gt; This would primarily impact on populations in poorer countries less able to compensate by eating more food, more varied diets, or possibly taking supplements.

Reduced nitrogen content in grazing plants has also been shown to reduce animal productivity in sheep, which depend on microbes in their gut to digest plants, which in turn depend on nitrogen intake.&lt;ref name="The Food, the Bad, and the Ugly"/&gt;  Because of the lack of water available to crops in warmer countries they struggle to survive as they suffer from dehydration, taking into account the increasing demand for water outside of agriculture as well as other agricultural demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/2886/1/JS_Irish_Agriculture.pdf|title=Climate Change and Irish Agriculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural surfaces and climate changes ===

Climate change may increase the amount of [[arable land]] in high-latitude region by reduction of the amount of frozen lands. A 2005 study reports that temperature in Siberia has increased three degree Celsius in average since 1960 (much more than the rest of the world).&lt;ref&gt;German Research Indicates Warming in Siberia, Global Warming Today, Global Warming Today&lt;/ref&gt; However, reports about the impact of global warming on Russian agriculture&lt;ref&gt;Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring 5Roshydromet), Strategic Forecast of Climate Change in the Russian Federation 2010–2015 and Its Impact on Sectors of the Russian Economy (Moscow 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; indicate conflicting probable effects : while they expect a northward extension of farmable lands,&lt;ref&gt;The Danger of Climate Change for Russia – Expected Losses and Recommendations, By Alexey O. Kokorin and Inna G. Gritsevich, Moscow, russian analytical digest 23/07 [http://se2.isn.ch/serviceengine/FileContent?serviceID=ISFPub&amp;fileid=E97C8CEF-87D1-D8C6-53EA-0991B4B6BA3B&amp;lng=en]&lt;/ref&gt; they also warn of possible productivity losses and increased risk of drought.&lt;ref&gt;Global warming 'will hurt Russia', 14:23 03 October 2003, NewScientist.com news service&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea levels are expected to get up to one meter higher by 2100, though this projection is disputed. A rise in the sea level would result in an agricultural [[land consumption|land loss]], in particular in areas such as [[South East Asia]]. [[Erosion]], [[sea level rise|submergence of shorelines]], [[salinity]] of the [[water table]] due to the increased sea levels, could mainly affect agriculture through [[inundation]] of [[depression (geology)|low-lying lands]].

Low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, India and Vietnam will experience major loss of rice crop if sea levels rise as expected by the end of the century. Vietnam for example relies heavily on its southern tip, where the Mekong Delta lies, for rice planting. Any rise in sea level of no more than a meter will drown several km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rice paddies, rendering Vietnam incapable of producing its main staple and export of rice.&lt;ref&gt;"Coping With Climate Change." Rice Today, IRRI. July–Sept (2007): 10–15. {{cite web|url=http://www.irri.org/publications/today/pdfs/6-3/10-15.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327094148/http://www.irri.org/publications/today/pdfs/6-3/10-15.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Erosion and fertility ===
The warmer atmospheric temperatures observed over the past decades are expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more extreme rainfall events.  [[Erosion]] and [[soil degradation]] is more likely to occur.  Soil [[fertility]] would also be affected by global warming. Increased erosion in agricultural landscapes from anthropogenic factors can occur with losses of up to 22% of soil carbon in 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doetterl|first=Sebastian|last2=Oost|first2=Kristof Van|last3=Six|first3=Johan|date=2012-05-01|title=Towards constraining the magnitude of global agricultural sediment and soil organic carbon fluxes|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=642–655|doi=10.1002/esp.3198|issn=1096-9837|hdl=2078.1/123112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the ratio of soil organic carbon to nitrogen is mediated by soil biology such that it maintains a narrow range, a doubling of soil organic carbon is likely to imply a doubling in the storage of [[nitrogen]] in soils as organic nitrogen, thus providing higher available nutrient levels for plants, supporting higher yield potential. The demand for imported fertilizer nitrogen could decrease, and provide the opportunity for changing costly [[fertilisation]] strategies.

Due to the extremes of climate that would result, the increase in precipitations would probably result in greater risks of erosion, whilst at the same time providing soil with better hydration, according to the intensity of the rain. The possible evolution of the [[organic matter]] in the soil is a highly contested issue: while the increase in the temperature would induce a greater rate in the production of [[minerals]], lessening the [[soil organic matter]] content, the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration would tend to increase it.

=== Potential effects of global climate change on pests, diseases and weeds ===

A very important point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, they are likely to compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that [[weedkiller]]s could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Early Summer Weed Control|url=http://extension.unl.edu/statewide/sw3/6.17.15%20Early%20Summer%20Weed%20Control.pdf|journal=-|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global warming would cause an increase in rainfall in some areas, which would lead to an increase of atmospheric humidity and the duration of the [[wet season]]s. Combined with higher temperatures, these could favor the development of [[fungi|fungal]] diseases. Similarly, because of higher temperatures and humidity, there could be an increased pressure from insects and [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vectors]].

=== Glacier retreat and disappearance ===

The continued [[Effects of global warming#Glacier retreat and disappearance|retreat of glaciers]] will have a number of different quantitative impacts. In the areas that are heavily dependent on [[Surface runoff|water runoff]] from [[glaciers]] that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished.

Approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion people live in the [[drainage basin]] of the Himalayan rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 Big melt threatens millions, says UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219045312/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 |date=19 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], China, [[Pakistan]], Afghanistan, [[Bangladesh]], Nepal and [[Myanmar]] could experience floods followed by severe droughts in coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90781/90879/6222327.html|title=People's Daily Online - Glaciers melting at alarming speed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]] alone, the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jul/24indus.htm|title=Ganges, Indus may not survive: climatologists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3998967.stm|title=Himalaya glaciers melt unnoticed|date=10 November 2004|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], also would be affected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080317154235.htm Glaciers Are Melting Faster Than Expected, UN Reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ozone and UV-B ===

Some scientists think agriculture could be affected by any decrease in [[stratospheric ozone]], which could increase biologically dangerous [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation B]]. Excess ultraviolet radiation B can directly affect plant [[physiology]] and cause massive amounts of [[mutation]]s, and indirectly through changed [[pollinator]] behavior, though such changes are not simple to quantify.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1470944,00.html Ozone layer least fragile on record] ''Brown, Paul'' The Guardian April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not yet been ascertained whether an increase in greenhouse gases would decrease stratospheric ozone levels.

In addition, a possible effect of rising temperatures is significantly higher levels of [[tropospheric ozone|ground-level ozone]], which would substantially lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Dead link: {{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/environment/story.jsp?story%3D633349 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050627000215/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/environment/story.jsp?story=633349 |archive-date=27 June 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ENSO effects on agriculture ===

ENSO ([[El Niño Southern Oscillation]]) will affect monsoon patterns more intensely in the future as climate change warms up the ocean's water. Crops that lie on the equatorial belt or under the tropical Walker circulation, such as rice, will be affected by varying monsoon patterns and more unpredictable weather. Scheduled planting and harvesting based on weather patterns will become less effective.

Areas such as Indonesia where the main crop consists of rice will be more vulnerable to the increased intensity of ENSO effects in the future of climate change. University of Washington professor, [[David Battisti]], researched the effects of future ENSO patterns on the Indonesian rice agriculture using [IPCC]'s 2007 annual report&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report. United Nations Environment Programme, 2007:Ch5, 8, and 10.[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and 20 different logistical models mapping out climate factors such as wind pressure, sea-level, and humidity, and found that rice harvest will experience a decrease in yield. Bali and Java, which holds 55% of the rice yields in Indonesia, will be likely to experience 9–10% probably of delayed monsoon patterns, which prolongs the hungry season. Normal planting of rice crops begin in October and harevest by January. However, as climate change affects ENSO and consequently delays planting, harvesting will be late and in drier conditions, resulting in less potential yields.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. et al. "Assessing risks of climate variability and climate change for Indonesian rice agriculture." [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]. No.19 (2007): 7752–7757.[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7752.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of agriculture on climate change ==
[[File:Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, by region, 1990-2010.png|thumb|right|450px|alt=refer to caption and image description|Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, by region, 1990-2010.]]
The agricultural sector is a driving force in the gas emissions and land use effects thought to cause climate change. In addition to being a significant user of [[land use|land]] and consumer of [[fossil fuel]], agriculture contributes directly to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions through practices such as rice production and the raising of livestock;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625000000/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }} retrieved 25 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the three main causes of the increase in greenhouse gases observed over the past 250 years have been fossil fuels, land use, and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/wg1-report.html Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501031449/http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/wg1-report.html |date=1 May 2007 }} ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land use===

Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas increases through land use in four main ways:
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; releases linked to [[deforestation]]
* Methane releases from [[rice|rice cultivation]]
* Methane releases from [[enteric fermentation]] in cattle
* [[Nitrous oxide]] releases from [[fertilizer]] application

Together, these agricultural processes comprise 54% of [[methane emissions]], roughly 80% of nitrous oxide emissions, and virtually all carbon dioxide emissions tied to land use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/076.htm Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios] retrieved 26 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The planet's major changes to [[land cover]] since 1750 have resulted from [[deforestation]] in [[temperate region]]s: when forests and woodlands are cleared to make room for fields and [[pasture]]s, the [[albedo]] of the affected area increases, which can result in either warming or cooling effects, depending on local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf|title=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation also affects regional [[RuBisCO|carbon reuptake]], which can result in increased concentrations of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the dominant greenhouse gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf IPCC Technical Summary] retrieved 25 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Land-clearing methods such as [[slash and burn]] compound these effects by burning [[biomatter]], which directly releases greenhouse gases and particulate matter such as [[soot]] into the air.

=== Livestock ===

Livestock and livestock-related activities such as deforestation and increasingly fuel-intensive farming practices are responsible for over 18%&lt;ref name="lls"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1B9LQQkm_qMC|title=Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|first1=Henning|last1=Steinfeld|first2=Pierre|last2=Gerber|first3=T.

* 9% of global [[carbon dioxide]] emissions
* 35–40% of global [[methane]] emissions (chiefly due to [[enteric fermentation]] and [[manure]])
* 64% of global nitrous oxide emissions (chiefly due to [[fertilizer]] use.&lt;ref name="lls"/&gt;)

Livestock activities also contribute disproportionately to land-use effects, since crops such as [[Maize|corn]] and [[alfalfa]] are cultivated in order to feed the animals.

In 2010, [[enteric fermentation]] accounted for 43% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from all agricultural activity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2013) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3107e/i3107e00.htm "FAO STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2013 World Food and Agriculture"].  See data in Table 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The meat from ruminants has a higher carbon equivalent footprint than other meats or vegetarian sources of protein based on a global meta-analysis of lifecycle assessment studies.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, William J.; Pete Smith; Helmut Haberl; Stephen A. Montzka; Clive McAlpine &amp; Douglas H. Boucher.  2014.  [http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n1/full/nclimate2081.html "Ruminants, climate change and climate policy"].  Nature Climate Change. Volume 4 No. 1. P 2-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Methane production by animals, principally ruminants, is estimated 15-20% global production of methane.&lt;ref&gt;Cicerone, R. J., and R. S. Oremland. 1988 [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1988/GB002i004p00299.shtml "Biogeochemical Aspects of Atmospheric Methane"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yavitt, J. B. 1992. Methane, biogeochemical cycle. Pages 197–207 in Encyclopedia of Earth System Science, Vol. 3. Acad.Press, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="lls"/&gt; The way livestock is grazed also decides the fertility of the land in the future, not circulating grazing can lead to unhealthy soil and the expansion of livestock farms effects the habitats of local animals and has led to the drop in population of many local species from being displaced.

'''Culhuacan''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Cōlhuàcān|koːlˈwaʔkaːn}}) was one of the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking [[pre-Columbian]] city-states of the [[Valley of Mexico]]. According to tradition, Culhuacan was founded by the [[Toltecs]] under Mixcoatl and was the first Toltec city.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahuatl speakers agreed that Culhuacán was the first city to give its rulers the title of "speaker" (''[[tlatoani]]'').

== History ==
Culhuacan was perhaps the first of the [[chinampa]] towns founded on the shores of [[Lake Xochimilco]], with chinampas dating to 1100 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula Region, Mexico." PhD dissertation, University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Adaptation in the Ixtapalapa Region, Mexico" ''Science'' 1972; 175(4028):1317-26&lt;/ref&gt;

From written records there is evidence that Culhuacan survived the fall of [[Tollan]] and maintained its prestige until the mid-14th century. According to the ''Cronica Mexicayotl'', transcribed in 1609, in 1299, Culhuacan's ''tlatoani'', [[Coxcoxtli]], helped the [[Tepanec]]s of [[Azcapotzalco]], the Xochimilca and other cities expel the [[Mexica]] from [[Chapultepec]]. Coxcoxtli then gave the Mexica permission to settle in the barren land of [[Tizapan]], southwest of Chapultepec, and they became vassals of Culhuacan. The Mexica subsequently assimilated into Culhuacan's culture and their soldiers provided mercenaries for its wars.

The Tenochtitlan ''tlatoani'' [[Acamapichtli]] was a grandson of Coxcoxtli. Nevertheless, in 1377 [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] subdued Culhuacán in large part with Aztec troops. In 1428, the Mexican Tlatoani Itzcóatl helped to overthrow Azcapotzalco's hegemony, and accepted the title "Ruler of the Culhua".

A cuckquean is a wife with an adulterous husband. In modern English it generally refers to a woman whose fetish is watching, and deriving sexual pleasure from watching, a man having sex with one or several women besides his [[girlfriend]], [[fiancée]], [[wife]] or other long-term female sex partner.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://vespertinecuckquean.wordpress.com/|title=vespertine cuckquean|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuckqueanry as a fetish==
A cuckquean fetishist is aware of her spouse's activity, sometimes actively encouraging it,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} and derives sexual pleasure from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Life of a Cuckquean | url=http://thelifeofacuckquean.blogspot.com/?zx=f8e8415e10c31b0d}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among some fetishists, the cuckold's humiliation or [[victimization]] is a major element of the [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2007/09/05/cuckquean/|title=What do you call a female cuckold?|first=Lynn|last=Harris|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fetish cuckqueaning subculture, the male takes on the role of being sexually [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]], while the female takes on a [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] role. The wife usually only becomes involved with the man or his lover when he permits it—sometimes remaining altogether [[celibate]].

When the fetish is simply heterosexual, the wife has sex only with her husband; when it is bi-sexual, the wife has sex with both her husband and the other woman, or only with the other woman.

The fetish specifics can range wildly. Sometimes the husband and his lovers can treat the cuckquean lovingly; sometimes it involves nothing but swinging, swapping husbands or sharing a lover.  But when it goes beyond this, the fetish can require that the cuckquean be humiliated or debased.  Sometimes this may be accidental or incidental (e.g., the parties involved are too aroused to stop); but at other times the humiliation may be intentional, and the husband and his lovers act out a story or perform a ritual in which they force the cuckquean to perform humiliating acts, or enter into circumstances that debase her.

A '''dining club''' is a [[Social club|social group]], usually requiring membership (which may, or may not be available only to certain people), which meets for dinners and discussion on a regular basis. They may also often have guest speakers.

==Dining club==
A dining club differs from a [[gentlemen's club]] in that it does not have permanent premises, often changing the location of its meetings and dinners.

Clubs may limit their membership to those who meet highly specific membership requirements, for example the Coningsby Club requires that one was a member of either [[Oxford University Conservative Association|OUCA]] or [[Cambridge University Conservative Association|CUCA]], the Conservative Associations at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge respectively.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Others may require applicants to pass an [[interview]], or simply pay a membership fee.

In the [[United States]], similar clubs that limit membership to students of a particular university are referred to as [[eating club]]s. Replaced largely by the [[Fraternities and sororities|modern fraternity and sorority system]] in the United States, eating clubs are now limited to a few colleges and universities, most notably [[Princeton University]].

Dining clubs often have reciprocity with other dining clubs across the nation or even worldwide. Some are able to arrange reciprocity with other private social clubs with more facilities besides dining such as overnight guest rooms and a gym. Examples of such social clubs include [[Penn Club of New York City]] that has reciprocity with India House Club at [[1 Hanover Square]].

The '''Duquesne Club''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], founded in 1873.

==History==
[[File:DuquesneClub.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Duquesne Club Building, built in 1887]]
The Duquesne Club was founded in 1873. Its first president was John H.

The '''economy of the Iroquois''' (also known as ''Haudenosaunee'') historically was based on communal production and combined elements of both [[horticulture]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] systems. Some have  the Iroquois economy as [[primitive communism]]{{sfn|Morgan, L. H. 1881. Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.}}. The [[tribe]]s of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] and other Northern [[Iroquoian la-speaking peoples, including the [ people|Huron]], had their traditional territory in what is now [[New York (state)|New York State]] and the southern areas bordering the [[Great Lakes]]. The confederacy was originally composed of five tribes; the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca, who had created an alliance long before [[Europeancolonization of the Americas|European contact]]. The Tuscarora were added as a sixth nation in the early eighteenth century after they migrated from North Carolina. The Huron peoples, located mostly in what is now Canada, were also Iroquioan-speaking and shared some culture, but were never part of the Iroquois.

The Iroquoian people were predominantly agricultural, harvesting the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]" commonly grown by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups: [[corn]], [[bean]]s, and [[Squash (fruit)|squash]]. They developed certain cultural customs. Among these developments were ideas concerning the nature and management of [[property]]. The Iroquois developed a system very different from the now-dominant Western variety. This system was characterized by such components as [[common ownership]] of land, [[division of labor]] by gender, and [[trade]] mostly based on [[gift economy]].

Contact with Europeans in the early 17th century had a profound impact on the economy of the Iroquoians. At first, they became important trading partners, but the expansion of European settlement upset the balance of the Iroquois economy. By 1800, following the American Revolutionary War, in which most of the nations supported the British and had to share their defeat, the Iroquois were reduced to [[Indian reservation|reservations]], primarily in New York in the United States, and Quebec and Ontario in Canada. They had to adapt their traditional economic system to dramatic changes. In the 20th century, some of the Iroquois nations in the United States have benefited from their sovereign status by founding gambling and recreation facilities, which have yielded greater revenues than some other enterprises. Individually, Iroquois have also become part of the larger economies in cities off the reservation.

== Land ownership ==
[[Image:Long House Iroquois Allen.jpg|thumb|Latter-day Iroquois longhouse housing several hundred people.]]
The Iroquois had an essentially [[common ownership|communal]] system of land ownership. The French Catholic missionary [[Gabriel Sagard]] described the fundamentals. The Huron had "as much land as they need[ed]."{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=110–111}} As a result, the Huron could give families their own land and still have a large amount of excess land owned communally. Any Huron was free to clear the land and farm on the basis of [[usufruct]]. He maintained possession of the land as long as he continued to actively cultivate and tend the fields. Once he abandoned the land, it reverted to communal ownership, and anyone could take it up for themselves.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=111}} While the Huron did seem to have lands designated for the individual, the significance of this possession may be of little relevance; the placement of corn storage vessels in the [[Native American long house|longhouses]], which contained multiple families in one kinship group, suggests the occupants of a given longhouse held all production in common.{{sfn|Trigger|1969|p=28}}

The Iroquois had a similar communal system of land distribution.  The tribe owned all lands but gave out tracts to the different clans for further distribution among households for cultivation.  The land would be redistributed among the households every few years, and a clan could request a redistribution of tracts when the Clan Mothers' Council gathered.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71–72}} Those clans that abused their allocated land or otherwise did not take care of it would be warned and eventually punished by the Clan Mothers' Council by having the land redistributed to another clan.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}} Land property was really only the concern of the women, since it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men's.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71–72}}

The Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans.  Food from such lands, called ''kěndiǔ"gwǎ'ge' hodi'yěn'tho'', would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}}

== Division of labor: agriculture and forestry ==
The [[division of labor]] reflected the complementary aspects common in Iroquois culture:  The twin gods Sapling (East) and Flint (West) embodied the two complementary halves. Each gender had defined roles in labor to support the people, which complemented each other. Women did all work involving the field, including planting, cultivating and harvesting the crops; while men did all work involving the forest, including the manufacture of anything involving wood.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|pp=120–121}} The Iroquois men carried out [[hunting]] and fishing, [[Trade|trading]], and [[fighting]], while the women took care of [[farming]], [[food gathering]] and processing, rearing of children, and [[Household management|housekeeping]]. This gendered division of labor was the predominant means of dividing work in Iroquois society.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=103}} At the time of contact with Europeans, Iroquois women produced about 65% of the goods and the men 35%.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=122}} The combined production of food made famine and hunger extremely rare; early Europeans settlers often envied the success of Iroquois food production.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=122}}

The Iroquois system of work reflected their communal land system. Since the Iroquois owned property together, they worked together as well. The women performed difficult work in large groups, going from field to field helping one another work each other's land.  Together they would sow the fields as a "mistress of the field" distributed a set amount of seeds to each of the women.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=124–125}} The Iroquois women of each agricultural group would select an old but active member of their group to act as their leader for that year and agree to follow her directions. The women performed other work cooperatively as well.  The women individually cut wood for family use, but their leader would oversee the collective carrying of the wood back to the village.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=32}} The women's clans performed other work. According to [[Mary Jemison]], a white woman assimilated with the Seneca while a young woman, the collective effort averted "every jealousy of one having done more or less work than another."{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=32}}

[[Image:Huron deer hunt V Champlain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samuel de Champlain]]'s sketch of a Huron deer hunt; Huron men make noise and drive animals along a V-shaped fence towards an apex where they are captured and killed.]]
The Iroquois men also organized in a cooperative fashion. The men acted collectively during military actions.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=32–33}} The other jobs of men, such as hunting and fishing, also involved cooperative elements. The men more often organized as a whole [[village]] rather than as a [[clan]].{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=33}} The men organized hunting parties where they used extensive cooperation to kill a large amount of game.  One firsthand account told of a hunting party that built a large brush fence in a forest to form a ''V''. The hunters set a fire across from the open side of the ''V'', forcing the animals to run towards the point where the hunters awaited them. They could kill one hundred [[deer]] at a time by such a plan.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=36–37}}

[[Image:Indians fishing de bry.jpg|thumb|upright|Native Americans of unknown tribe fishing in fashion similar to Iroquois.]]
The men also fished in large groups. Fishing expeditions included men in [[canoes]] using [[Fishing weir|weirs]] and [[Fishing net|nets]] to cover entire streams and harvest large amounts of fish, sometimes a thousand in half of a day.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=37–38}} A hunting or fishing party's takings were considered common property; they were divided among the party by the leader or taken to the village for a feast.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=70}} Hunting and fishing were not always cooperative efforts, but the Iroquois generally did better in parties than as individuals.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=30}}

== Trade ==
The Iroquois traded excess corn and tobacco for the pelts from the tribes to the north and the [[wampum]] from the tribes to the east.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=79–80}} The Iroquois used [[present-giving]] more often than any other mode of exchange.  Present-giving reflected the [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] in Iroquois society. The exchange would begin with one clan giving another tribe or clan a present with the expectation of some sort of needed commodity being given in return. This form of trade ties to the Iroquois culture's tendency to share property and cooperate in labor. In all cases no explicit agreement is made, but one service is performed for the community or another member of the community's good with the expectation that the community or another individual would give back.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=81}} External trade offered one of the few opportunities for individual enterprise in Iroquois society. A person who discovered a new trading route had the exclusive right to trade along the same route in the future. Often clans collectivized trading routes to gain a monopoly on a certain type of trade.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=80}}

[[Image:Iroquois western goods.jpg|thumb|left|Iroquois with Western goods, presumably acquired through trade (French engraving, 1722)]]
The arrival of Europeans created the opportunity for greatly expanded trade. Furs were in demand in Europe, and they could be acquired cheaply from Indians in exchange for manufactured goods the Indians could not make themselves.{{sfn|Caskey et al.|2001}} Trade did not always benefit the Natives.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] took advantage of the gift-giving culture. They showered the Iroquois with European goods, making them dependent on such items as rifles and metal axes. For a time, the access to guns gave the Mohawk and other Iroquois advantages over other tribes, and they entered trading seriously. The British primarily used these gifts to gain support among the Iroquois for fighting against the French.{{sfn|Johansen|1982|loc=chapter 3}}

The Iroquois also traded for alcohol, which the Europeans introduced. Eventually, this would have a very negative influence on their society, as they suffered a high rate of alcoholism. By 1753 Scarrooyady, a chief, petitioned the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] to intervene in trade: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Your Traders now bring scarce anything but Rum and Flour; they bring little powder and lead, or other valuable goods . . . and get all the skins that should go to pay the debts we have contracted for goods bought of the Fair Traders; by this means we not only ruin ourselves but them too. These wicked Whiskey Sellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them sell their very clothes from their backs. In short, if this practice be continued, we must be inevitably ruined."{{sfn|Caskey et al.|2001}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Effect on Iroquois culture and society ==
The structure of the Iroquois economy created a unique property and [[work ethic]]. The threat of theft was almost nonexistent, since little was held by the individual except basic tools and implements that were so prevalent they had little value. The only goods worth stealing would have been [[wampum]].{{sfn|Speck|1945|pp=31–32}} While a theft-free society can be respected by all, communal systems such as that of the Iroquois are often criticized for providing less of an incentive to work. In order for the Iroquois to succeed without an individual incentive, they had to develop a communal work ethic. Virtue became synonymous with productivity. The idealized Iroquois man was a good warrior and productive hunter while the perfect woman excelled in agriculture and housekeeping.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=144–145}} By emphasizing an individual's usefulness to society, the Iroquois created a mindset that encouraged their members to contribute even though they received similar benefits no matter how hard they worked.

As a result of their communal system, some would expect the Iroquois to have a culture of dependence without individuality. The Iroquois, however, had a strong tradition of autonomous responsibility. Iroquois men were taught to be self-disciplined, self-reliant, and responsible as well as stoic.{{sfn|Wallace|1969|p=30}} The Iroquois attempted to eliminate any feelings of dependency during childhood and foster a desire for responsibility. At the same time, the child would have to participate in a communal culture, children were taught to think as individuals but work for the community.{{sfn|Wallace|1969|p=34}}

== Land management after the Europeans arrived ==
The Iroquois system of land management changed somewhat after encounter with the Europeans. The Mohawk were the first to deal with them and "sold" some land to settlers, although it is unlikely either side understood the other's conception of property.

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the victorious Americans forced the nations into reservations much reduced in size from their former territories, even those two, the Oneida and Onondaga, that had supported them.  Most of the other Iroquois nations were forced to give up their territory and retreated to Canada, where they received some land in compensation from the Crown, in addition to existing settlements along the St. Lawrence River.

The Iroquois had a system of collectively owned land free to be used as needed by their members.  While this system was not wholly collective, as land was distributed for use to individual family groups, the Iroquois lacked the Western conception of property as a [[commodity]].{{sfn|Noon|1949|p={{page needed|date=September 2013}}}} Despite the influence of Western culture, the Iroquois have maintained a unique view of property over the years.

The contemporary Mohawk [[Doug George-Kanentiio]] sums up his perception of the Iroquois property view: The Iroquois have 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"no absolute right to claim territory for purely monetary purposes. Our Creator gave us our aboriginal lands in trust with very specific rules regarding its uses.  We are caretakers of our Mother Earth, not lords of the land. Our claims are valid only so far as we dwell in peace and harmony upon her."{{sfn|George-Kanentiio|2000|pp=169–170}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1981 the Iroquois Council of Chiefs (or Haudenosaunee) expressed similar ideas. The Council distinguished the 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Western European concepts of land ownership" from the Iroquois view that "the earth is sacred" and "was created for all to use forever—not to be exploited merely for this present generation." Land is not just a commodity and "In no event is land for sale." The statement continues, "Under Haudenosaunee law, 'Gayanerkowa,' the land is held by the women of each clan. It is principally the women who are responsible for the land, who farm it, and who care for it for the future generations. When the Confederacy was formed, the separate nations formed one union. The territory of each nation became Confederacy land even though each nation continued to have a special interest in its historic territory."{{sfn|Council of Chiefs}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Council's statement reflects its unique view of property among the Iroquois.

The system of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Grand River Iroquois]] (two Iroquois reservations in Canada) integrated the traditional Iroquois property structure with the new way of life after being confined to a reservation. The reservation was established under two deeds by the Crown in the 18th century following the American Revolutionary War.  These deeds gave corporate ownership of the lands to the Six Nations of the Iroquois.{{sfn|Noon|1949|pp=86–88}} Individuals were granted leases for a specific plot by the Confederacy.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=88}} The Iroquois idea that land came into one's possession if cared for and reverted to public control if left alone was used in reservation property law.  In one property dispute case, the Iroquois Council sided with a claimant who had made improvements and cultivated the land over one who had left it alone.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=88}}

The natural resources of the land are considered to belong to the tribe as a whole and not to those who possessed the particular parcel.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=92}} The Iroquois leased the right to extract stone from the lands in one instance and fixed royalties on all the production.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=94}} After natural gas had been discovered on the reservation, the Six Nations took direct ownership of the natural gas wells. They paid persons who had wells on their land compensation only for damages done by gas extraction.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=94}} This setup closely resembled the precontact land distribution system where the tribes owned the land and distributed it for use, but not unconditional ownership.

== Modern economy ==
{{update|date=April 2015}}
Many Iroquois have been fully integrated into the surrounding Western economy of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  For others their economic involvement is more isolated in the [[Indian reservation|reservation]].  Whether directly involved in the outside economy or not, most of the Iroquois economy is now greatly influenced by national and world economies.  The Iroquois have been involved in the steel construction industry for over a hundred years, with many men from the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] nations working on such high-steel projects as the [[Empire State Building]] and the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|National Public Radio|2002}}

Inside the reservations, which are sometimes isolated from larger cities, the economic situation has often been bleak.  For instance, the U.S. side of the Mohawk St. Regis reservation in northern New York has recently had [[unemployment]] as high as 46 percent.{{sfn|Herald American|1990}}

But many reservations have successful businesses. The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] reservation contains the [[Salamanca (city), New York|City of Salamanca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], a center of the hardwoods industry.{{sfn|City of Salamanca}} The Seneca make use of their sovereignty to sell gasoline and cigarettes tax-free and run high-stakes [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] operations.{{sfn|Adams|2002}} The Senecas have also opened several [[Indian casino]]s, the [[Seneca Niagara Casino]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] and one in Salamanca. In 2007 the Seneca opened a third in Buffalo, the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.{{sfn|Seneca Gaming Corporation|2007}}

The [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] also operate casinos on their reservations in New York and [[Wisconsin]].  The Oneida are one of the largest employers in northeastern Wisconsin with over 3,000 employees, including 975 people in tribal government. The Tribe manages more than $16 million in federal and private grants, and a wide range of programs, including those authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.{{sfn|Environmental Protection Agency}} The Oneida business ventures have brought millions of dollars into the community and improved the [[standard of living]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Venus symbol.svg|160px|thumb|The symbol of the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is commonly used to represent the female sex and is the [[alchemical symbol]] for copper.]]

'''Female''' (♀) is the [[sex]] of an [[organism]], or a part of an organism, that produces non-mobile [[ovum|ova]] (egg cells). Barring rare medical conditions, most female [[mammal]]s, including female [[human]]s, have two [[X chromosome]]s. Female characteristics vary between different species with some species containing more well defined female characteristics. Both genetics and environment shape the prenatal development of a female.

== Defining characteristics ==
The [[ovum|ova]] are defined as the larger [[gamete]]s in a [[heterogamous]] [[reproduction system]], while the smaller, usually [[Motility|motile]] gamete, the [[spermatozoon]], is produced by the [[male]]. A female individual cannot reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] without access to the gametes of a male, and vice versa. Some organisms can also reproduce by themselves in a process known as [[asexual reproduction]]. An example of asexual reproduction that some female species can perform is [[parthenogenesis]].

There is no single [[Genetics|genetic]] mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have [[evolution|evolved]] multiple times independently in different [[lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineages]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Alan Anderson. [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XR8IBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=genetic%20mechanism%20behind%20sex%20differences%20in%20different%20species%20and%20the%20existence%20of%20two%20sexes%20seems%20to%20have%20evolved%20multiple%20times%20independently%20in%20different%20evolutionary%20lineages. "The Metaphysics of Sex ...in a Changing World!"]. Retrieved June 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns of sexual reproduction include
*[[Isogamy|Isogamous]] species with two or more [[mating type]]s with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level),
*[[Anisogamy|Anisogamous]] species with [[gamete]]s of male and female types,
*[[Oogamy|Oogamous]] species, which include humans in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to [[Motion (physics)|move]]. Oogamy is a form of [[anisogamy]]. There is an argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', Chapter 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{ISBN|978-0-674-03116-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced, differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another. The concept is not limited to animals; egg cells are produced by [[chytrid]]s, [[diatom]]s, [[water mould]]s and [[plant|land plants]], among others. In land plants, ''female'' and ''male'' designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures, but also the structures of the [[sporophyte]]s that give rise to male and [[female plant]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:Beowulf - faemnan.jpg|thumb|"fæmnan," an [[Old English]] word for 'female']]
The word ''female'' comes from the Latin ''femella'', the diminutive form of ''femina'', meaning "[[woman]]". It is not etymologically related to the word ''male'', but in the late 14th century the spelling was altered in English to parallel the spelling of ''male''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=female Online Etymology Dictionary - Female (n.)] Retrieved 2010-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammalian female==
[[File:Anterior view of human female and male, with labels 2.png|thumb|Adult female and [[male]] with clean-shaven pubic regions.]]

A distinguishing characteristic of the [[class (biology)|class]] ''Mammalia'' is the presence of [[mammary gland]]s. The mammary glands are modified sweat glands that produce milk, which is used to feed the young for some time after birth. Only mammals [[Lactation|produce milk]]. Mammary glands are [[Breast#Other suggested functions|most obvious]] in [[humans]], as the female human body stores large amounts of fatty tissue near the nipples, resulting in prominent [[breast]]s. Mammary glands are present in all mammals, although they are seldom used by the males of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swaminathan|first1=Nikhil|title=Strange but True: Males Can Lactate|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-males-can-lactate/|website=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mammalian females have two copies of the [[X chromosome]] as opposed to the male which carries only one X and one smaller [[Y chromosome]] (but some mammals, such as the [[platypus]], have different combinations). To compensate for the difference in size, one of the female's X chromosomes is [[X-inactivation|randomly inactivated]] in each cell of placental mammals while the paternally derived X is inactivated in marsupials. In birds and some reptiles, by contrast, it is the female which is [[heterozygous]] and carries a Z and a W chromosome whilst the male carries two Z chromosomes. [[Intersex]] conditions can also give rise to other combinations, such as XO or XXX in mammals, which are still considered as female so long as they do not contain a Y chromosome, except for specific cases of testosterone deficiency/insensitivity in XY individuals while in the womb. However, these conditions frequently result in sterility.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Mammalian females bear live young (with the rare exception of [[monotremes]], which lay eggs). Some non-mammalian species, such as [[guppy|guppies]], have analogous reproductive structures; and some other non-mammals, such as [[shark]]s, whose eggs hatch inside their bodies, also have the appearance of bearing live young.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Symbol==
A common symbol used to represent the female sex is ♀ ([[Unicode]]: U+2640 [[Alt codes]]: Alt+12), a circle with a small cross underneath. According to Schott,&lt;ref&gt;Schott GD. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll: Sex symbols ancient and modern: their origins and iconography on the pedigree.BMJ 2005;331:1509-1510 (24 December), {{doi|10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1509}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most established view is that the male and female symbols "are derived from contractions in Greek script of the Greek names of these planets, namely Thouros (Mars) and Phosphoros (Venus). These derivations have been traced by Renkama&lt;ref&gt;Renkema HW. Oorsprong, beteekenis en toepassing van de in de botanie gebuikelijke teekens ter aanduiding van het geslacht en den levensduur. In: Jeswiet J, ed. Gedenkboek J Valckenier Suringar. Wageningen: Nederlandsche Dendrologische Vereeniging, 1942: 96-108.&lt;/ref&gt; who illustrated how Greek letters can be transformed into the graphic male and female symbols still recognised today." Thouros was abbreviated by θρ, and Phosphoros by Φ, both in the handwriting of alchemists so somewhat different from the Greek symbols we know. These abbreviations were contracted into the modern symbols.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Sex determination==
{{Main|Sex-determination system}}
The sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors. These may be genetic or environmental, or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life. Although most species with male and female sexes have individuals that are either male or female, [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] animals have both male and female reproductive organs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Genetic determination===
The sex of most mammals, including humans, is genetically determined by the [[XY sex-determination system]] where males have X and Y (as opposed to X and X) sex [[chromosome]]s. During [[reproduction]], the male contributes either an X sperm or a Y sperm, while the female always contributes an X egg. A Y sperm and an X egg produce a male, while an X sperm and an X egg produce a female. The [[ZW sex-determination system]], where males have ZZ (as opposed to ZW) sex chromosomes, is found in birds, reptiles and some insects and other organisms. Members of [[Hymenoptera]], such as ants and bees, are determined by [[haplodiploidy]], where most males are [[haploid]] and females and some sterile males are [[diploid]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Environmental determination===
The young of some species develop into one sex or the other depending on local environmental conditions, e.g. many crocodilians' sex is influenced by the temperature of their eggs. Other species (such as the [[goby]]) can transform, as adults, from one sex to the other in response to local reproductive conditions (such as a brief shortage of males).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''Finns in Switzerland''' consist of migrants from [[Finland]] to [[Switzerland]] and their descendants. According to one estimate{{Which|date=May 2010}} there are 7,000 Finns living in Switzerland, of whom 4,000 are first generation immigrants and 3,000 are second generation immigrants. Most of the first generation immigrants are women in their 40s and 50s, many of whom immigrated from 1960–70.&lt;ref name="MSM"&gt;Hannele Jönsson-Korhola and Anna-Riitta Lindgren, ''Monena suomi maailmalla - Suomalaisperäisiä kielivähemmistöjä'', Helsinki 2003, {{ISBN|951-746-344-8}} ''(in Finnish)''&lt;/ref&gt; Most Finns in Switzerland live in the [[Canton of Zürich]].&lt;ref name="FEIS"/&gt;

The first Finnish schools of Switzerland were located in [[Bern]] and [[Zürich]], and opened in 1982. ''Schweizerische Vereinigung der Freunde Finnlands'' (SVFF) began to operate in 1946, and has since published a newspaper called ''Suomen Sanomat'' until it was changed to ''Finnland Magazin''.  This newspaper is issued four times in year.&lt;ref name="MSM"/&gt; ''Sveitsin suomenkielinen kirkollinen toiminta'' (SSKT) organizes Finnish language church activities around Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sskt.seurakunta.net/?sid=1 SSKT Sveitsin suomenkielinen kirkollinen toiminta ''(in Finnish)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15248">The '''Gay Mafia''', '''Velvet Mafia''', '''gay lobby''', '''Lavender Mafia''', '''Homintern''', etc. are pejorative terms for the alleged disproportional behind-the-scene influence of [[gay rights]] groups and the [[LGBT]] community in politics, media, culture, and everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/04/08/gay_mafia_why_are_conservatives_afraid_of_lgbtq_activists.html|title=Gay mafia: Why are conservatives afraid of LGBTQ activists?|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=29 December 2014|author=J. Bryan Lowder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
An early use of the term was when the [[English people|English]] critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] proposed an article to ''[[Playboy]]'' editor A.C. Spectorsky in late 1967 on the "Homosexual Mafia" in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Tynan Letters (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Spectorsky declined, although he admitted that "culture hounds were paying homage to faggotismo as they have never done before".
Tynan allegedly enjoyed cross-dressing himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tynan|first=Kathleen |authorlink=Kathleen Tynan|title=The Life of Kenneth Tynan|edition=1|year=1987|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co| isbn=0-688-05080-8| pages=327, 333|quote=as cited in Paul Johnson's ''The Intellectuals'', Chapter 13, Note 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Playboy'' would subsequently run a panel on gay issues in April 1971.

The term "Velvet Mafia" was first used in an article in the "Top of the Pop" [[Column (periodical)|column]] in the entertainment section of the Sunday New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' in the 1970s by journalist [[Steven Gaines]] to describe the executives at the [[Robert Stigwood Organization]], a British film and [[Record label|record company]]. The phrase was later used by the same writer in a [[roman à clef]] about [[Studio 54]] called ''The Club'' in reference to the influential gay crowd that became the club's habitués. This "mafia" was said to include homosexual men such as [[Calvin Klein (fashion designer)|Calvin Klein]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Halston]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. The term was supposedly [[tongue-in-cheek]].

"Gay Mafia" was widely used in the media in the 1980s and 1990s, and could be seen in the pages of the American daily, the ''[[New York Post]]''. The term was also used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in 1998 in response to what it claimed was sinister dominance by gay men in the [[Blair ministry#First Blair ministry|Labour Party Cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sun-rejects-outing-and-sacks-parris-sacks-parris-and-rejects-outing-1184294.html|title='Sun' rejects outing and sacks Parris sacks Parris and rejects outing|work=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/212737.stm|title=BBC News - UK - Sun changes mind over gays|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100407/halltext/100407h0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 07 Apr 2010  (pt 0001)|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/11/news/11iht-brit.t_2.html|title=A 'Gay Mafia' in Whitehall?

The term "gay mafia" may also have gained wider popular prominence after it was used in both a 1995'' [[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' article and subsequently a 2002 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article, wherein [[Michael Ovitz]], in an interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Burrough | first = Bryan | title = Ovitz Agonistes | work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date = August 2002 | url =http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2002/08/ovitz200208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that a "gay mafia" was largely responsible for his company's failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lyman |first=Rick |title=Ovitz Bitterly Bares Soul, And Film Industry Reacts | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=July 3, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/03/arts/ovitz-bitterly-bares-soul-and-film-industry-reacts.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1999,  Ovitz sold his company AMG for an estimated $12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holson | first = Laura | last2 = Weinraub | first2 = Bernard | title = Some See a Young Ovitz in Emerging Power Broker | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = May 13, 2002 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/13/business/some-see-a-young-ovitz-in-emerging-power-broker.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he blamed the downfall of AMG upon a Hollywood [[cabal]] supposedly led by [[Dreamworks]] cofounder [[David Geffen]] (despite the fact that most of its purported members were not actually gay). He later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gorman | first = Steve | title = Ex-Hollywood Superagent Regrets 'Gay Mafia' Remark | date = July 3, 2002 | url = http://www.talkdisney.com/forums/td-archives/2302-ex-hollywood-superagent-ovitz-regrets-gay-mafia-remark.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100621054422/http://www.talkdisney.com/forums/td-archives/2302-ex-hollywood-superagent-ovitz-regrets-gay-mafia-remark.html | archivedate = June 21, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[TV host]] [[Bill Maher]] also claimed in 2014 that a gay mafia existed. He added his view that "if you cross them, you do get whacked. I really do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/04/04/bill_maher_there_is_a_gay_mafia_if_you_cross_them_you_do_get_whacked.html|title = Maher: "There Is A Gay Mafia -- If You Cross Them, You Do Get Whacked"|date = April 4, 2014|accessdate = |website = RealClearPolitics|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Lavender Mafia" has been used to refer to an informal network of gay executives in the [[Show business|entertainment industry]].&lt;ref name="Stefano"&gt;George De Stefano, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYNiZ8MahnQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=gay ''An offer we can't refuse: the mafia in the mind of America''], New York, 2005, Books.google.co.uk Retrieved 29 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; But more generally it refers to Church politics. For example a supposed faction within the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|leadership and clergy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] that allegedly advocates the acceptance of [[Homosexuality and the Catholic Church|homosexuality]] within the Church and its culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Peter (2005-11-28). "Vatican fuels gay clergy debate". BBC News. Retrieved 2007-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Pope Francis]] claimed there was a "gay lobby" within the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in remarks during a meeting held in private with some of the Catholic [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] from [[Latin America]], and he was said to have promised to see what could be done to address the issue.&lt;ref name="bbcrumours"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Francis 'confirms Vatican gay lobby and corruption' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22869399 |accessdate=27 August 2013 |publisher=BBC News|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2013, he responded directly to [[journalist]]s' questions. He notably drew a distinction between the problem of [[lobbying]] and the [[sexual orientation]] of people: "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?" "The problem", he said, "is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, [[Catholicism and freemasonry|Masonic]] lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem."&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/pope-francis-openness-gay-priests?CMP=twt_fd |author=Lizzie Davis |title=Pope Francis signals openness towards gay priests |work=The Guardian |date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Francis: Who am I to judge gay people?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23489702|accessdate=27 August 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early written reference to the term "Homintern" can be found in 1937, when the classics scholar [[Maurice Bowra]] referred to himself as a member of such a community (Bowra was homosexual).&lt;ref&gt;"Bowra, Sir (Cecil) Maurice (1898–1971)" by L. G. Mitchell, [http://www.oxforddnb.com "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are competing claims about who coined the term - including [[Jocelyn Brooke]] and [[W. H. Auden]].{{efn|{{cquote|[1930s?] "The new literary fashion then in the ascendant dominated by what Jocelyn Brooke (himself homosexual, but detached from 'committed' writing) used to call The Homintern, was unsympathetic to me; at the same time the fourth novel on which I was now at work - to have the title ''Agents and Patients'' - did not entirely satisfy my own standards in breaking fresh ground."- [[Anthony Powell]] (1981)&lt;ref name="powell"&gt;Anthony Powell, ''Faces in My Time'', Vol. 3 of ''To Keep the Ball Rolling: Memoirs'' by Anthony Powell), Holt, Rinehart and Winston 1981, {{ISBN|9780030210013}}, no page&lt;br/&gt;Anthony Powell: ''To Keep the Ball Rolling: The Memoirs of Anthony Powell'' (new edition, abridged), University of Chicago Press, 2001, {{ISBN|9780226677217}}, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}{{efn|{{cquote|"The word 'Homintern', which I coined in 1939, is attributed to [[W.

[[Chad]] is a source and destination country for [[trafficking of children|children subjected to trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. The country's trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves parents entrusting children to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or money; selling or bartering children into involuntary [[domestic servitude]] or herding is used as a means of survival by families seeking to reduce the number of mouths to feed. Child trafficking victims are primarily subjected to forced labor as herders, domestic servants, agricultural laborers, or beggars. Child cattle herders follow traditional routes for grazing cattle and at times cross ill-defined international borders into Cameroon, the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), and [[Nigeria]]. Underage Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are [[subsequently]] subjected to prostitution. Some girls are compelled to marry against their will, only to be forced by their husbands into involuntary domestic servitude or agricultural labor. In past reporting periods, traffickers transported children from Cameroon and the CAR to Chad's oil producing regions for commercial sexual exploitation; it is unknown whether this practice persisted in 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

During the reporting period, the [[Government of Chad]] actively engaged in fighting with anti-government armed opposition groups. Each side unlawfully conscripted, including from refugee camps, and used children as combatants, guards, cooks, and look-outs. The government's conscription of children for military service, however, decreased by the end of the reporting period, and a government-led, UNICEF-coordinated process to identify and demobilize remaining child soldiers in military installations and rebel camps began in mid-2009. A significant, but unknown number of children remain within the ranks of the Chadian National Army (ANT). Sudanese children in refugee camps in eastern Chad were forcibly recruited by Sudanese rebel groups, some of which were backed by the Chadian government during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government took steps to investigate and address the problem of forced child labor in animal herding. It also initiated efforts to raise awareness about the illegality of conscripting child soldiers, to identify and remove children from the ranks of its national army, and to demobilize children captured from rebel groups. The government failed, however, to enact legislation prohibiting trafficking in persons and undertook minimal anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and victim protection activities. The country faces severe constraints including lack of a strong judicial system, destabilizing civil conflicts, and a heavy influx of refugees from neighboring states.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Chad".

==History==
The practice of [[slavery]] in [[Chad]], as in the [[Sahel]] states in general, is an entrenched phenomenon with a long history, going back to the [[Arab slave trade]] in the [[Sahelian kingdoms]], and it continues today. 
As elsewhere in West Africa, the situation reflects an ethnic, racial and religious rift between black, Christian farmers and lighter-skinned, Muslim herdsmen, occasionally flaring up in eruptions of violence or civil unrest.

In the early 1890s, French military expeditions sent to Chad encountered the forces of [[Rabih az-Zubayr]], who had been conducting [[African slave trade|slave raids]] ([[Ghazw|razzia]]s) in southern Chad throughout the 1890s and had sacked the settlements of [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]], [[Baguirmi Kingdom|Baguirmi]], and [[Ouaddai Empire|Ouaddai]]. After years of indecisive engagements, French forces finally defeated Rabih az-Zubayr at the [[battle of Kousséri]] in 1900.
The colonial authorities of [[French Chad]] officially suppressed slavery, but their de facto control over the region was limited. In the huge [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]], the handful of French military administrators soon reached a tacit agreement with the inhabitants of the desert; as long as caravan trails remained relatively secure and minimal levels of law and order were met, the military administration (headquartered in [[Faya Largeau]]) usually left the people alone. 
In central Chad, French rule was only slightly more substantive. 
Slave raids continued in the 1920s, and it was reported in 1923 that a group of Senegalese Muslims on their way to Mecca had been seized and sold into slavery. Unwilling to expend the resources required for effective administration, the French government responded with sporadic coercion and a growing reliance on indirect rule through the sultanates.

Today, in the Republic of Chad, slavery persists, but it does not have the same ubiquity as in  the [[West Africa|western]] Sahel, e.g. [[slavery in Mauritania|in Mauritania]] where up to 20% of total population are estimated as living in slavery. 
Instead, contemporary slavery in Chad is mostly limited to [[child labour]], and not to hereditary servitude.

==Child slavery==
Child slaves, sold by their impoverished parents, are mostly held by [[Arabized Berber|Arab-Berber]] herdsmen. 
These often impose a new identity on them, 
:"The Arab herdsman change their name, forbid them to speak in their native dialect, ban them from conversing with people from their own ethnic group and make them adopt Islam as their religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=52490  Chad: Children sold into slavery for the price of a calf], 
[[IRIN]] (Integrated Regional Information Networks) of the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], 21 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
Chad's weak judicial system impeded its progress in undertaking anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The government failed to prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and punish trafficking offenders during the year. Existing laws do not specifically address human trafficking, though forced prostitution and many types of labor exploitation are prohibited. Title 5 of the Labor Code prohibits forced and bonded labor, prescribing fines of $100 to $1,000; these penalties, which are considered significant by Chadian standards, fail to prescribe a penalty of imprisonment and are not sufficiently stringent to deter trafficking crimes. Penal Code Articles 279 and 280 prohibit the prostitution of children, prescribing punishments of 5 to 10 years' imprisonment and fines up to $2,000 – penalties that are sufficiently stringent, but not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Pimping and owning brothels are also prohibited under Penal Code Articles 281 and 282. The 1991 Chadian National Army Law prohibits the Army's recruitment of individuals below the age of 18. In 2009, the Ministry of Justice, with support from UNICEF, completed drafting revisions to the penal code; several new provisions will prohibit and prescribe punishments for child trafficking and provide protection for victims. The revisions are pending approval by the Supreme Court and the secretary general of the government. The government did not make anti-trafficking law enforcement statistics available, and there is no evidence to suggest the government prosecuted trafficking offenses during the reporting period. It did not provide information on the status of pending cases reported in the previous reporting period. In past reporting periods, the government prosecuted a small number of child trafficking cases using laws against kidnapping, the sale of children, and employing children under 14 years of age, though most magistrates lack understanding of how to apply existing laws to trafficking cases. During the year, police detained an unknown number of Chadian adults suspected of using forced child labor for herding, as well as intermediaries arranging herding jobs for children, but released all suspects after they paid small fines. Some cases were dealt with by traditional forms of justice which varied depending on the religion, ethnicity, and clan affiliation of all parties involved in or affected by the exploitation. The government did not prosecute military officials for conscripting child soldiers, though it notified the ANT during the year that future infractions would be punished with the full weight of the law.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Chad did not take adequate steps to ensure that all victims of trafficking received access to protective services during the reporting period. It did, however, make progress in providing protection for child soldiers, some of whom may have been forcibly conscripted, identified within the country. In a June 2009 ceremony, the ANT transferred to UNICEF for care 84 child combatants captured from Chadian rebel groups in early May. In July 2009, representatives of the Ministries of Social Affairs, Defense, and Foreign Affairs led an inter-ministerial mission to the military camp in Moussoro, accompanied by staff from UNICEF and an international NGO, to identify child soldiers captured from rebel units; of the 88 presumed child soldiers, the team identified 51 as children and succeeded in removing 16 of them to UNICEF's care. By the end of 2009, the government and UNICEF identified and transferred to NGO-run rehabilitation and vocational training centers one child soldier from Chadian military ranks and 239 from Chadian rebel groups. The Ministry of Social Action operated a transit center located in Moussouro to screen and provide shelter to demobilized children after they are first released from armed groups. After spending between two days and two weeks at the center, the government transferred the children to rehabilitation centers operated by international NGOs. During the year, the Ministries of Social Affairs and Defense began maintaining files on rehabilitated child soldiers and other child victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government provided few services for trafficking victims other than unlawfully conscripted child soldiers during the reporting period. In 2009, the government continued its efforts to provide minimal assistance to child trafficking victims through its six technical regional committees charged with addressing the worst forms of child labor. These committees – located in N'Djamena, Abeche, and southern towns, with representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Social Affairs and Family, Education, Public Works, Human Rights, and the Judicial Police – encouraged victims to file charges against and assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. They also referred cases of children forced to herd animals to the judiciary for action. The government sustained a formal system for officials to refer victims to NGOs or international organizations for care; judiciary police or other local authorities are to notify the Ministry of Justice's Child Protection Department, UNICEF, and local NGOs when there is a potential case of child trafficking. The government provided no information, however, on the number of victims it referred to such organizations during the year. Officials did not report encouraging victims to file charges or assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. The government did not arrest or detain trafficking victims, or prosecute or otherwise penalize identified child victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Due to weak state entities and a lack of capacity, the government did not allocate any resources for training its officials regarding the identification and treatment of trafficking victims during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Chadian government made modest efforts to prevent human trafficking during the year. The government continued to conduct its trafficking efforts according to two internal documents that are annually reviewed and revised – the "Guide for the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking", and the "Integrated Action Plan to Fight the Worst Forms of Child Labor, Exploitation, and Trafficking (2008-1010)" – developed by the National Committee to Fight Trafficking and the Directorate of Children in the Ministry of Justice, respectively. While neither plan was formally adopted or launched as originally intended, all relevant government entities follow the work plans outlined in each. The government focused its prevention activities principally on addressing child labor trafficking, as children are the largest group of trafficking victims in Chad. Throughout 2009, an inter-ministerial team visited southern towns to investigate suspected cases of children forced to herd animals and provided a report with recommendations for future action to the Human Rights Ministry. During the year, the government, in partnership with UNICEF and UNFPA, launched several nationwide human rights campaigns that included sensitization for the population on the dangers of giving, renting, or selling one's children into animal herding; these campaigns involved public events, billboards, posters, and the distribution of informational materials. The government also drafted a plan to educate parents on the risks of selling their children; the plan awaits final approval from the Prime Minister and funding. In January 2010, the National School of Administration and Magistracy graduated its first class of 28 labor inspectors; they have not yet been deployed due to lack of funding. The country's 25 existing inspectors and 59 assistance inspectors lacked the resources to fulfill their mandate and the Ministry of Labor provided no information on the number of child labor inspections carried out or the number of children, if any, removed or assisted as the result of such inspections. Beginning in August 2009, the Ministry of Foreign Affair's Military Coordinator led an awareness raising delegation composed of officers from the ANT, the Nomadic Guard, Directorate General of Security Services for National Institutions, and the Gendarmerie, along with civilian government officials and representatives of UNICEF, UNDP, the UN peacekeeping operation, and diplomatic missions, to the four headquarters locations of the government's armed forces in Abeche, N'Djamena, Moussoro, and Mongo. The Military Coordinator, a brigadier general, delivered a consistent message denouncing the use of child soldiers, outlining the government's intolerance of the practice, and stating that the government would investigate and prosecute anyone implicated in the use of child soldiers. The government made no effort to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor during the reporting period. In July 2009, the government ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Julia Wilbur''' (August 8, 1815 – June 6, 1895) was a [[Quaker]] [[abolitionist]], [[suffragist]] and nurse. She kept a diary during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and in it she records events of historical significance as well as everyday happenings that provide a picture into life during that time.&lt;ref name="paulawhitacre.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulawhitacre.com/about-julia-wilbur/|title=About Julia Wilbur|website=Paula Tarnapol Whitacre}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is noted to have worked alongside [[Susan B. Anthony]] to establish voting rights for women. She was an early member and later secretary of the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society which helped fund Frederick Douglass' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/clementsmss/umich-wcl-M-2084roc?byte=11201599;focusrgn=bioghist;subview=standard;view=reslist|title=Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society papers  1851-1868|website=quod.lib.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53277938/julia-ann-wilbur|title=Julia Ann Wilbur (1815-1895) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11341">'''La Manada''' ([[Pack (canine)|wolfpack]]) '''case''' is a case of [[sexual violence]] that happened in [[Pamplona]], [[Navarre]], [[Spain]] on July 7, 2016 during [[San Fermín]] celebrations. A group of five men sexually abused an 18-year-old woman from Madrid in a building hallway at the city centre of Pamplona. The victim accused them of [[rape]].

The case had strong media coverage because there were video recordings of the events and the commentaries on [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trendencias.com/feminismo/las-redes-sociales-sobre-la-manada-asi-reacciona-el-feminismo-en-las-redes|title=Las redes sociales sobre "la manada": así reacciona el feminismo en las redes|accessdate=April 28, 2018|author=Abril Camino|date=November 16, 2017|publisher=Trendencias}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accused from Seville, including a member of the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and another of the [[Spanish Army]], were arrested and tried.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43915551|title=Thousands protest over Spanish rape ruling|date=2018-04-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment was announced on April 26 2018 with the court clearing the accused of rape, finding them guilty of [[sexual abuse]] instead. One of the three magistrates did not agree with his two colleagues and voted for their [[acquittal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Iruñeko_bortxaketaren_auzia_11.jpg|thumb|upright|Protesters in Pamplona]]
In the early hours of July 7, an 18-year-old woman reported a rape to the Police of Pamplona, perpetrated by five young people. The woman, who was going to her car to sleep, was accompanied during a part of the journey by the men. She alleged that they pushed her into a doorway of a building. While some committed the crime, others recorded it on their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=La policía que redactó la denuncia dice ahora que la joven sabía que la grabaron.

The perpetrators shared the video of the attack in a [[WhatsApp]] group called "La Manada" ("the wolfpack").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Pepa López|title=Estos son los mensajes de Whatsapp de "La Manada", el grupo acusado de la violación de San Fermín 2016|url=https://www.trendencias.com/feminismo/estos-son-los-mensajes-de-whatsapp-de-la-manada-el-grupo-acusado-de-la-violacion-de-san-fermin-2016|date=November 14, 2017|accessdate=April 27, 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven clips of this video were studied by the police in a 200-page report in which it is reported that the woman maintained a "passive and neutral" attitude, that her attitude was not "participatory" and that there was "humiliation and vexation" toward her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Manuel Jacoibs|title=Un juicio de 96 segundos|url=https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/11/25/actualidad/1511633639_199059.html|date=November 27, 2017|accessdate=April 27, 2018|newspaper=EL PAÍS|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The prosecution was represented by the public prosecutor, the victim, the City of [[Pamplona]], and the Government of [[Navarre]]. The tribunal considered in the sentence that the victim's testimony was objectively credible, was consistent throughout the investigation, did not introduce "improbable elements" and did not have "spurious motives" to make the accusation. It considered that there was "minimal violence" and "very serious intimidation that prevented the defense of the victim" surrounded by the five men, and that they left her helpless after the event because they took her cell phone. The defendant argued that it was group consensual sex and she had made the accusation for fear that the video could be seen by other people.

On Thursday, April 26, 2018, five months after the trial, the Provincial Court of Navarre published its judgment. The court sentenced the five accused to nine years in prison for continued sexual abuse, although they did not find them guilty of sexual aggression (which would have meant 12 to 15 years of prison). The sentence is not [[Res judicata|final]]. [[File:Manifestación contra La Manada - Madrid - 26 de abril.webm|thumb|Video of demonstrations on April 26, 2018, in Madrid streets.]]
In Spain, the crime of sex without consent has 2 legal categories, sexual aggression or sexual abuse. Sexual aggression is defined as necessitating violence (''violencia'') or intimidation (''intimidación''), sexual abuse is without violence, however there are controversies regarding the interpretation of these legal terms by the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2018/04/26/actualidad/1524742454_508812.html|title=Por qué los jueces consideran que no hay violación y sí abuso sexual|last=Ceberio Belaza|first=Mónica|date=27 April 2018|newspaper=[[El País]]|access-date=13 June 2018|location=Madrid|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; "intimidation" is more narrow than abusing superiority or influence over the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/27/inenglish/1524824382_557525.html|title=La Manada ruling sparks fierce debate over definition of sexual violence|last=Ceberio Belaza|first=Mónica|date=27 April 2018|newspaper=[[El País]]|access-date=13 June 2018|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
After the sentence, demonstrations took place in many Spanish cities as a sign of disagreement with the conviction for its 'leniency', as well as the expression of disagreement of different relevant political and social figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.es/20171124/anger-in-spain-over-pamplona-festival-gang-rape-case|title=Anger in Spain over Pamplona festival gang rape case|date=November 24, 2017|accessdate=April 29, 2018|publisher=The Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist associations denounced the sentence, valuing it as especially negative because it can be "very bad precedent" giving the context of the events. They also pointed out that once again women are held responsible for the assaults they suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/Defensa-expulsa-militar-manada_0_828717210.html|title=Defensa expulsa del Ejército al militar de 'la manada'|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2018-10-25|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 22 June 2018 they are out prison under [[bail]] after paying 6,000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2018/06/22/actualidad/1529649334_611069.html|title=La Manada sale de la cárcel porque el tribunal cree “impensable” que reincida|author=Reyes Rincón and Javier Lorente|date=22 June 2018|newspaper=[[El País (Spain)|El País]]|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; American actresses [[Jessica Chastain]] and [[Rose McGowan]] also expressed their condemnation of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/30449/hollywood-hits-out-at-gang-rape-acquittal-jessica-chastain-and-rose-mcgowan-condemn-lenient-sentence Hollywood hits out at gang-rape acquittal: Jessica Chastain and Rose McGowan condemn 'lenient' sentence] in thinkspain.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During the defendants' parole awaiting the outcome to their appeal, four of them were subject to prosecution for another sex abuse case involving an unconscious 21-year-old woman lying on the defendants' van.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2018/09/25/actualidad/1537872071_703040.html|title=La Manada volverá a ser juzgada por otro delito de abuso sexual en Pozoblanco|last=Sáiz|first=Eva|date=2018-09-25|work=El País|access-date=2018-10-25|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late October, the convicts were declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' in [[Pozoblanco|Pozoblanco, Cordova]], hometown of the victim of the male group's alleged assault in 2016, now under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europapress.es/andalucia/noticia-ayuntamiento-pozoblanco-cordoba-declara-personas-non-gratas-miembros-manada-20181030111549.html|title=Pozoblanco (Córdoba) declara personas 'non gratas' a los miembros de 'La Manada'|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2018-10-30|work=europapress.es|access-date=2018-11-06|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, the soldier Alfonso Jesús Cabezuelo, one of the individuals condemned in the case, was expelled from the army months after his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2018/10/25/actualidad/1540452507_247475.html|title=Expulsado del Ejército el militar de La Manada|last=Sáiz|first=Eva|date=2018-10-25|work=El País|access-date=2018-11-06|last2=González|first2=Miguel|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late November 2018, the same judge panel in charge of "La Manada" case convicted a man from [[Lodosa]], Navarre, of occasional 'mistreatment' and a 10 month prison term after considering it proved that "he attempted to kill her with a knife and by strangulation while she struggled for life, with their young children watching, but eventually giving up"; the sentence cited the man's mental state as a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.es/espana/violencia-machista-jueces-manada-sentencian-acuchillar-tratar-axfixiar-mujer-maltrato-ocasional.html|title=Los jueces de 'La Manada' condenan sólo por 'maltrato ocasional' a un hombre que acuchilló y trató de asfixiar a su mujer|access-date=2018-11-23|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has denounced the hurdles found by the victims of gender aggression in the Spanish justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.es.amnesty.org/en-que-estamos/espana/violencia-contra-las-mujeres/|title=Violencia contra las mujeres en España|last=España|first=Amnistía Internacional|website=www.es.amnesty.org|language=es|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lankapalli Bullayya''' (1918–1992) was an innovative Indian educator and vice-chancellor of [[Andhra University]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He was the first [[Dalit]] to be appointed vice-chancellor of an Indian university.

==Life and career==

Bullayya was born in 1918 in [[Peravali]], near [[Vemuru]], [[Guntur district]], Andhra Pradesh. He had to travel long distances to receive his education. Bullayya received a B.A. degree with honours from [[Andhra University]], and served as principal of a [[Bachelor of education|B.Ed.]] college in [[Kurnool]]. He later became a District Educational Officer in [[Kurnool district|Kurnool]], [[Krishna district|Krishna]] and other districts and served in the Education Department as a senior-level officer. After the formation of Andhra State in 1953, Bullayya was appointed Director of Public Instruction. As Director of Higher Education for the government of Andhra Pradesh, he was instrumental in bringing about educational reform.

He considered the [[Education in India|10+2+3 plan]] in Andhra Pradesh before it was recommended by the [[Kothari Commission]], and was given the responsibility of strengthening the educational system from primary to university level. In November 1968, Bullaya was appointed vice-chancellor, continuing in that post until December 1974. He sympathised with socially- and economically-disadvantaged students, and was concerned about their welfare. Academic, curricular and examination reforms (among them the introduction of the [[Academic term|semester]] system), abolition of external examinations and the detention system, and continuous assessment marked his tenure. During this period the departments of education, geography, biochemistry, human genetics and [[physical anthropology]] were established along with foreign-language courses (German, French and Russian).

Six affiliated colleges were permitted to establish postgraduate departments in selected subjects for the purpose of decentralisation. Coaching classes for civil-service examinations and the Continuing Education Scheme were introduced. For the first time in South India, a School of Correspondence Courses was established due to Bullayya's efforts. He was an able administrator and maintained a rapport with the central and state governments, directed toward the betterment of the university.
When university buildings were badly damaged after the 1970 [[cyclone]] which struck [[Visakhapatnam]] Bullayya showed photographs of the damage to [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] authorities in New Delhi, seeking grants for the repair of the buildings. The UGC granted funds not only for repairs, but for constructing new buildings.

Bullayya later served at the [[Union Public Service Commission]] in an advisory capacity on behalf of [[Telugu language|Telugu-speaking]] candidates at the UPSC Interview Board. He was chairman of the Andhra Pradesh and all-India units of the Boy Scouts and a director on the Andhra Bank Board. Bullayya's wife, Samyuktha, was also an educator and former chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Housing Board. His brother's sons Lankapally Ramesh Babu and Suresh Babu are public servants in [[Sanjeeva Reddy Nagar]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Dr. Bullayya College at Visakhapatnam was named after him. He founded Dr. V.S. Krishna Government College in 
remembrance of his predecessor, vice-chancellor [[Vasireddy Sri Krishna]], and was more concerned about that school than the one named after himself. A bust of Bullayya has been installed in the School of Distance Education in Visakhapatnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/06/stories/2003010600900200.htm "Lankapalli Bullayya (1918-1992): A visionary educationist".

[[File:Adelaide trolleybus number 472 - 1953.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adelaide]] in Australia had [[Trolleybuses in Adelaide|a trolleybus system]] from 1937 to 1963.]]

This is a '''list of cities where [[trolleybus]]es operate, or operated''' in the past, as part of the [[public transport]] system. The original list has been divided to improve user-friendliness and to reduce article size. Separate lists&amp;mdash;separate articles in Wikipedia&amp;mdash;have been made for the following countries:

*Americas

**[[List of trolleybus systems in Canada|Canada]]
**[[List of trolleybus systems in the United States|United States]]
*Europe (''Note:'' countries not listed here are included in ''this'' article; see ''Contents'' table below)

'''Notes''' for the two tunnel trolleybus lines:
* The 6.1&amp;nbsp;km [[Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus]] line operates almost entirely in tunnel, through a mountain, and connects Ōgizawa Station with Kurobe Dam, for tourists and hikers. Ōgizawa Station is in [[Ōmachi, Nagano|Ōmachi city]], [[Nagano Prefecture]].
* The affiliated 3.6&amp;nbsp;km [[Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus]] line, similarly, operates entirely in tunnel and connects Daikanbo with Murodō. The line is located in [[Tateyama, Toyama|Tateyama town]], [[Toyama Prefecture]].

Both lines are part of the [[Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route]]. This passes through [[Chūbu-Sangaku National Park]] (also known in English as "Japan Alps National Park").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1471">The '''Logorik''' are an ethnic group in the southern part of [[Sudan]]. They are one of seven distinct ethnicities comprising the [[Daju people]]. They speak the [[Logorik language]], a Nilo-Saharan language. They live in the north, central [[Nuba Mountains]] in the Jebel Liguri hills area northeast of [[Kadugli]]. The population of this ethnic group likely exceeds 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=liu Ethnologue: Logorik People] retrieved April 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is generally agreed that the Logorik people came from a very early migration (perhaps 2,000 years ago) out of the Daju [[Urheimat]] in the [[Marrah Mountains]]. There they carved out their own small territory in the midst of the original inhabitants of the eastern Nuba Mountains, the [[Kordofanian]] tribes, as well as amongst later migrating tribal/linguistic groupings: the [[Nyima languages|Nyimang]] tribes, the [[Temein languages|Temein]] tribes, and the [[Kadugli language|Kadugli]] tribes. The migration of the [[Hill Nubian]] tribes in the Nuba Hills is generally seen as coming after the main Daju migration. The Nuba Mountains have generally been an area of "retreat" for persecuted groups seeking security hence the significant linguistic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenubian.net/settlement.php Thelwall, Robin; The Linguistic Settlement of the Nuba Mountains]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15649">The '''MacDowell Clubs''' in the United States were established at the turn of the twentieth century to honor internationally recognized American composer [[Edward MacDowell]]. They became part of a broader social movement to promote music and other art forms in America.

== History ==
The first MacDowell music club was established in 1896 in Boston by Edward MacDowell's students  — ''The MacDowell Club of Boston'' (Edith Noyes Greene was one of the founders).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DnpFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA550&amp;lpg=PA550&amp;dq=Edward+MacDowell+Club&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wg4rSjmltU&amp;sig=oztFJJjmpWYjydOrEbpHH3MF-Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLq5vy_OvJAhXHyj4KHQ-gCtw4ChDoAQg1MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20MacDowell%20Club&amp;f=false The Federated Clubs], ''The Musical Monitor'', Volume 8, p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bomberger"&gt;Bomberger, E.

At the peak of their popularity before and during the [[World War II]], about 400 independent clubs functioned in the nation. In 1955, [[Marian MacDowell]] wrote in a letter, "I suppose in the last forty years there must have been nearly 400; probably there are 300 now."{{r|Yackley|page=64}} War-time entry of [[Women in the workforce|women into the workforce]] and later [[Women's liberation movement|social developments]] decreased the membership, and combined with advances in transportation and communication diminished the role of MacDowell Clubs both as social hubs and entertainment venues. In 2008, fifteen MacDowell Clubs continued to operate,{{r|Bomberger|page=289}} including, in [[Altus, Oklahoma]]; [[Dyersburg, Tennessee]]; [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Canton, Ohio]]; [[Chickasha, Oklahoma]]; [[Janesville, Wisconsin]]; and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of active MacDowell Clubs as of 2008, see: Yackley, Marian MacDowell and the Macdowell Clubs. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, such clubs, as the ''MacDowell Club of Mountain Lakes'' in New Jersey (established in 1916 by Lazelle Crooks Whitmore),&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtnlakes.org/Community/macdowell/ The MacDowell Club of Mountain Lakes, New Jersey]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''MacDowell Club of Allied Arts'' in Oklahoma City (established in 1920 by Hyla Florence Long),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macdowellclubokc.org/Home_Page.php The MacDowell Club of Allied Arts — Oklahoma City]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''MacDowell Music Club in Janesville'', Wisconsin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janesvillewomansclub.com/clubs/macdowell-music-club/ MacDowell Music Club, Janesville, Wisconsin]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''MacDowell Music Club of Chattanooga'' (founded in 1916),&lt;ref&gt;{{facebook|221959814525195|MacDowell Music Club of Chattanooga}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''MacDowell Club of Milwaukee'' (established in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macdowellclubmilwaukee.org/mcomwho.htm The MacDowell Club of Milwaukee]&lt;/ref&gt; were functioning.

A typical small club gathering would feature a privately held meeting with invited talks, piano and vocal solos and duets of local performers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ROczAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wu4HAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4473%2C4423157 Final Meeting of MacDowell Club], ''The Lodi Sentinel'' ([[Lodi, California]]), June 8, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Bigger clubs were able to organize academic lectures, concerts, recitals (including [[Marian MacDowell]]’s or other well-known national performers) and art exhibitions opened to the general public, as well as private dinners, pageants, and balls. Several organizations, including clubs in New York City, Los Angeles, [[Austin, Chicago|Austin, Illinois]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], [[Canton, Ohio]], [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], Oklahoma City, and [[Altus, Oklahoma]],{{r|Yackley|page=82}} among others, established student funds and scholarships for youth and developed outreach programs through Junior MacDowell Clubs while continuing to support financially the [[MacDowell Colony]]. Several clubs established their own choruses, as in [[New York City]], Boston and [[Milwaukee]]; other — vocal ensembles. In Boston, the MacDowell Club Orchestra consisting mainly of amateur and semiprofessional female musicians gave performances in [[Grundmann Studios|Copley Hall]]; the MacDowell clubs of New York, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles also formed their own orchestras. All employed well-known conductors, such as [[Georges Longy]], and [[Arthur Fiedler]] in Boston; in New York, orchestra was formed in 1929, led by [[David Mannes]], a concertmaster of the [[New York Symphony Orchestra]], and held concerts in [[Madison Square Garden]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]].{{r|Yackley|page=67-69}}

All clubs were responsible for adopting their own bylaws and acted differently in defining their membership: some were accepting musicians only, as the ''MacDowell Club of Green Bay in Wisconsin'', or the ''Macdowell Club of Mountain Lakes'' in New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Marcella V. (1987) ''Willing &amp; Able: A History of the Macdowell Club of Mountain Lakes, N.J., 1916-1946.''&lt;/ref&gt; other subscribed to an allied arts organization philosophy championed by [[Edward MacDowell]] as the ''MacDowell Club of New York City'';&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Anita, Edwin A. Robinson, and Percy MacKaye. ''A Mosaic of Muses of the Macdowell Club of New York City: Benjamin Prince, President, Compiled and Designed by Anita Browne.'' New York: Poets Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; some were operating strictly as [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]], i.e., the ''MacDowell Club of Mountain Lakes'', the ''MacDowell Club of Los Angeles'', or the ''MacDowell Club of Milwaukee'', while other accepted men, as clubs in Boston and New York did. However, most of the MacDowell clubs were "female-only organizations."{{r|Yackley|page=63}} Many clubs joined the [[National Federation of Music Clubs]].

The MacDowell Club of New York City was established in 1905 and disbanded in 1942. It was among the biggest clubs by the same name around the country honoring the legacy of [[Edward MacDowell]] and supporting the [[MacDowell Colony]], the artists’ retreat in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]]. The Club funded and awarded a resident scholarship at the MacDowell Colony and made regular financial contributions.&lt;ref name="Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records"&gt;[http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/macdowell/bioghist.html Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records, 1905-1942], ''New York Historical Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

The club charter declared the main goals of the club as following:{{quote|To discuss and demonstrate the principles of the arts of music, literature, the drama, painting, sculpture, and architecture, and to aid in the extension of knowledge of works especially fitted to exemplify the finer purposes of these arts, including works deserving wider recognition, and to promote a sympathetic understanding of the correlation of these arts, and to contribute to the broadening of their influences; thus carrying forward the life purpose of Edward MacDowell.&lt;ref name="Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records" /&gt;}}

In a few years the membership of the club grew to 600.&lt;ref name="Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records" /&gt; Club membership included writers, musicians, performing and visual artists, theate and film actors, sculptors,  and architects: [[Hamlin Garland]], [[Richard Watson Gilder]], [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]], [[James Harvey Robinson]], [[John Dewey]], [[Leonora Speyer]], [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]], [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken|Robert Aitken]], [[Hobart Nichols]], [[Irving Ramsey Wiles]], [[Ivan Olinsky]], [[F. Luis Mora]], [[Robert Henri]], [[George Bellows]], [[Louise Homer]], [[David Bispham]], Katherine Bacon (1896-1952), Francis Stetson Rogers (1870-1951), [[Charles Coburn]], Harriet Rogers (Otis) Dellenbaugh, [[Beatrice Cameron]], [[Harold Van Buren Magonigle]], among others.&lt;ref name="Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records" /&gt;

=== Facilities ===
The MacDowell Club was initially located in the [[Carnegie Hall]] studio (1905-1909), then at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|old Metropolitan Opera House]] (1909-1911). In 1911, the Club moved to a spacious building at 108 W 55th Street,&lt;ref name="An Art Exhibition Without a Jury System of Award"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/05/14/106783163.pdf ''An Art Exhibition Without a Jury System of Award'',] &lt;u&gt;[[The New York Times]]&lt;/u&gt;, May 14, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; which featured a large vaulted gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIn6EkBlJSUC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22108+West+55th+Street%22+-austin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YEtl_7u4tK&amp;sig=HFaPeCS3TTXGUuFWDsCBIvwWSjw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VPM6TZS9HMKC8gbMqJXqCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22108%20West%2055th%20Street%22%20-austin&amp;f=false Richard H. Love, ''Carl W. Peters: American Scene Painter From Rochester to Rockport'', pg. 183, col. 2], University of Rochester Press (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the MacDowell Club purchased the old converted Marquand stable &amp;mdash; located at 166 East 73rd Street &amp;mdash; from the [[Joseph Pulitzer]] estate.  [[Richard Morris Hunt]] had designed the original building for art collector [[Henry Gurdon Marquand]] in 1883.  Shortly after Marquand's death in 1902, the building had been sold to [[Joseph Pulitzer]], then publisher of the ''[[New York World]]'', who lived several blocks to the east at 73rd and Park.  A fire swept the building in 1935 and destroyed prints by Whistler, Hassam and others.&lt;ref&gt;''On a Block of Stables, an Unexpected Restoration'', &lt;u&gt;[[The New York Times]]&lt;/u&gt;, June 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the Landmarks Preservation Commission proposed 12 of the 13 stable and garage buildings on the block for designation, excluding the Marquand building. A year later Halina Rosenthal, head of the block association and later founder of the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, lobbied the commission to include the Marquand stable in the designation, which it did in 1981.

=== MacDowell Chorus ===
The MacDowell Chorus was formed in November 1909, under the direction of [[Kurt Schindler]]. Two months after its founding, [[Gustav Mahler]], then the conductor of The [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], invited the chorus to perform with the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gl4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=%22MacDowell+Club%22+%22new+york%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U0_UyA4ZRj&amp;sig=xNfDROLLOwdaiMKbM3Ds5CpBvSc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BP06TaOKBY-q8Aa9oo3RCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22MacDowell%20Club%22%20%22new%20york%22&amp;f=false Gustav Stickley, ''The MacDowell Chorus, A New Music Development in New York''], ''[[The Craftsman (magazine)|The Craftsman]]'', Vol. 19, pg. 316, Oct 1910–Mar 1911, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, Schindler changed the name to ''Schola Cantorum.''  Schindler continued to conduct the Schola Cantorum until January 1926, when he accepted an offer to take charge of the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]].  [[Hugh Ross (musician)|Hugh Ross]] later became the director of the chorus.

=== Student Fund Committee ===
The MacDowell Club established a scholarship fund to support aspiring talented young artists, and funded a resident scholarship in Professor George Baker's Drama Workshop at [[Harvard University]], and a resident fellowship at the [[MacDowell Colony]].&lt;ref name="Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records" /&gt;

=== Notable art exhibitors ===
In 1911, [[John White Alexander|John W. Alexander]], the Club's second president, instituted a revolutionary for the time change by introducing an ''open exhibition'', or ''no jury'' policy.&lt;ref name="An Art Exhibition Without a Jury System of Award" /&gt; Group of artists started to select works for exhibition in the MacDowell Club galleries by themselves. Many talented, but previously unrecognized artists, such as [[Stuart David]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], among others, received an opportunity to promote their works.

Among the notable art exhibitors were:
* [[Edward Hopper]], 1912
* [[Colin Campbell Cooper]], 1912
* [[George Bellows]], 1917
* [[William Laurel Harris]], ''Saint Francis de Sales before Pope Clement VIII''
* [[Helen Farnsworth Mears]], one of 3 bronze ''[[bas-reliefs]]'' of [[Edward MacDowell]]
* [[Abraham Jacob Bogdanove]], 1918

=== Presidents ===
* Eugene Heffley
* [[John White Alexander]]
* [[Frederick A. Stokes|Frederick Stokes]] 
* [[Ernest Peixotto]] 
* [[Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh|Frederick S. Dellenbaugh]] 
* Benjamin Prince 
* Cecil Smith

The '''Narikurava''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST| Narikkuṟava}}) is an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] community from [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nafra.org/nari-info-e.html About the Narikurava] ''nafra.org''. Retrieved 29 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The main occupation of the people who originally belong to the indigenous tribes, is hunting. But as they were prohibited entry into the forests to pursue this livelihood, they were forced to take up other alternatives such as selling beaded ornaments to survive. Hence, they migrate from place to place to find a market for their beads. Children accompany the adults wherever they go, which means they never get to attend school.

During [[British rule in India]] they were placed under [[Criminal Tribes Act]] 1871, hence stigmatized for a long time, after Independence. However, they were [[Denotified tribes of India|denotified]] in 1952, though the stigma continues.&lt;ref name=dis&gt;{{cite web

== Etymology ==

The word "Narikurava" is a combination of the Tamil words "Nari" and "Kurava" meaning "jackal people"&lt;ref name="Narikoravastudies_intro_siromoney"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/narikorava.htm|title=Introduction to Narikorava Studies, from Gift Siromoney's website|accessdate=2008-07-26|year=1989|author=S. Theodore Baskeran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landpiratesp64"&gt;[[#The Land Pirates of India|The Land Pirates of India]], Pg 64&lt;/ref&gt; or the "fox people".&lt;ref name="virammap287"&gt;[[#Viramma|Viramma]], p 287&lt;/ref&gt; This appellation has been bestowed upon them due to their adeptness in hunting and trapping jackals.&lt;ref name="Narikoravastudies_intro_siromoney" /&gt;

== Origins ==

As per a theory propounded by Werth in 1966 and Fraser, authorities on the gypsies of Europe, believes that the [[Dom people|Domar]] are the ancestors of the [[Romani people]] and therefore, the Narikuravas are related to the Romani.&lt;ref name="Conservationp265"&gt;[[#Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples|Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples]], p 265&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Edgar Thurston]] feels that they are related to the Khonds of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].&lt;ref name="Conservationp265" /&gt;

== Language ==

The Narikuravas speak an [[Indo-Aryan language]] called '''Vagriboli'''.&lt;ref name="Narikoravastudies_intro_siromoney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vagriboli"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/EnvirPol/ColloqPapers/Peterson2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Peasants, nomadic hillwomen and birdcatchers: Landscape and environmental dialogues in early modern South Indian literature|accessdate=2008-07-26|publisher=Mount Holyoke College|year=2002|author=[[Indira Viswanathan Peterson]]}}, Pg 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[SIL Ethnologue]] classifies it as a dialect of the [[Domari language]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Due to this reason, they are also known as Vagris or Vagrivalas.&lt;ref name="vagriboli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservationp264"&gt;[[#Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples|Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples]], p 264&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all Narikuravas are well-versed in Tamil. However, most of the Narikurava liturgical hymns and folk songs are in Vagriboli.

== Sub-divisions ==
[[File:PettaiNarikoravas.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A Narikorava shop selling beads]]
Although all Kuravars come under one roof based on their common clan name  '''kuravars''' they were  broadly sub-divided into two sub-divisions: the&lt;ref name="Conservationp271"&gt;[[#Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples|Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples]], p 271&lt;/ref&gt;  buffalo-sacrificers and Nandevala&lt;ref name="Conservationp271" /&gt; or goat-sacrificers.&lt;ref name="Narikorava_ceremonies"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Narikorava/nari_ceremonies.htm|title=Some ceremonies of the Narikoravas |accessdate=2008-07-26|year=1977|author=J.P.Vijayathilakan|work=Studies on Vaagrivala}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they are Commonly classified based on the region they originate from. The Seliyos have only one sub-sect—the Vithiyo.&lt;ref name="Narikorava_ceremonies" /&gt;

== Customs and practices ==

Each Narikurava clan has a bundle of clothes called ''sami-mootai'' meaning "God's bundle".&lt;ref name="Narikorava_ceremonies" /&gt; It is filled with blood of animals sacrificed by the Narikuravas and clothes dipped in them. The ''sami-mootai'' of one clan must not be touched by members of another clan. On the death of the head of the family, his eldest son inherits the ''sami-mootai''.&lt;ref name="Narikorava_ceremonies" /&gt; The prestige a clan-leader holds depends on the antiquity of his ''sami-mootai''.

== Silambam ==
{{main|Silambam}}
Silambam is a stick fighting style that supposedly originated from the Kurinji hills some 5000 years ago, where the native Narikuravar used bamboo staves called Silambamboo to defend themselves against wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silambam.com/SomebasicfactsaboutSilambam.html|title=Some basic facts about ''silambam''|accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

The major issues which confront Narikuravas are [[poverty]], [[illiteracy]], [[diseases]] and [[discrimination]].

There has been discrimination of Narikuravas since ancient times. Due to their consumption of animals tabooed by settled Hindu communities and other habits, they are considered untouchable and are excluded from streets inhabited by upper castes. This has led to protests and resentment from the community.&lt;ref name="narikorava_sc_1"&gt;{{cite news | last= | first= | title= Narikuravas running from pillar to post for ST status | date=14 January 2005 | url =http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2005/01/14/stories/2005011416090300.htm | work =The Hindu: Friday Review | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Narikuravas are yet to be recognized as a scheduled tribe.

High crime rates and unemployment are other problems which afflict the Narikurava community. The proscription of fox-hunting as well as killing endangered species of birds and wildlife have depleted the Narikuravas of their traditional sources of livelihood. As a result, unemployed Narikurava youth are taking to crime and illegal activities. There have also been instances when Narikurava have been arrested for the possession of unregistered firearms as country rifles which are banned according to the Indian laws.&lt;ref name="narikorava_crime"&gt;{{cite news | last= | first= | title= Narikoravas arrested

The '''Oxford Round Table''' is a series of [[interdisciplinary]] conferences organised in [[Oxford|Oxford (UK)]] by a US-based (currently California-based) educational organisation.  

The company is not affiliated with the University of Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disclaimer|url=http://www.oxfordroundtable.com/index.php/view/Content-Main/page/disclaimer.html|publisher=Oxford Round Table|accessdate=9 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709015214/http://www.oxfordroundtable.com/index.php/view/Content-Main/page/disclaimer.html|archivedate=9 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has stated that events such as the Oxford Round Table are "external to the university" and "not, as such, authorised or endorsed by the university."&lt;ref name=THES&gt;{{cite web | last = Newman | first = Melanie  | title = 'Oxford' events firm under fire | publisher = [[Times Higher Education Supplement]] | date = 21 December 2007 | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310154&amp;sectioncode=26 | accessdate = 1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been accused of misrepresenting its relationship with the university.&lt;ref name=THES/&gt;&lt;ref name=THE2/&gt;

==Conferences==
The first meeting of the Oxford Round Table was held at [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St. Peter's College]] (Oxford) in 1989, sponsored by the Norham Centre for Leadership Studies of the University of Oxford under the direction of Vivian Williams and by [[Virginia Tech]], under the direction of Kern Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofeducationfinance.com/toc/tocintrovol15no4.html The Journal of Education Finance: Table of Contents Vols 15–33&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027050427/http://journalofeducationfinance.com/toc/tocintrovol15no4.html |date=27 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Oxford Round Table conferences have been held at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Harris Manchester College]], [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], and the [[Oxford Union]]. 

The Oxford Round Table brings together scholars and others from a variety of backgrounds (new professors and PhD students, college presidents and deans, school administrators, religious leaders) to discuss research on specific topics usually related to public policy. In its early years, the conference was held every other year, and the organisation financed the attendance of participants by raising funds itself (more than £80,000 in 1993).&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;Huw Richards, "All Rhodes lead to reform," ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'', 8 October 1993, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the ORT was charging attendees.&lt;ref name=THES/&gt;

One of the earliest conferences, in 1993, was on the links between education and the business sector. It brought together education ministers from major developing and transition countries, representatives of major multinationals (such as [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], [[Boeing]], [[BP]], and [[Honeywell]]), US state officials, and the [[World Bank]]. A major highlight was a paper by [[Edward Dneprov]], education minister of Russia, on education reform there.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Margrave, "International Partnership," ''The Times'', 1 November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1993 article in the ''Times Higher Education Supplement'' noted that "the Oxford conferences are going very well" and had gained "international interest."&lt;ref name=Richards/&gt;

==Publications==
The Oxford Round Table publishes an online journal, titled ''The Forum on Public Policy: A Journal of the Oxford Round Table''. The mission of the journal, according to its website, is "to disseminate knowledge with regard to salient issues in public affairs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumonpublicpolicy.com/ Welcome to the Forum on Public Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124114159/http://www.forumonpublicpolicy.com/ |date=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McGill/Queen's University Press published a volume of papers from a 2003 conference, ''The University: International Expectations'', on public administration issues related to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/hic/issues/vol4/13 Reviewed] by Anthony Potts, ''History of Intellectual Culture'', Volume 4, No. 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Another edited volume on primary (precollegiate) school choices in America emerged from, among other sources, a 2003 meeting on "Choice in Education."&lt;ref&gt;Carreiro, Paula J. and Eileen Shields-West, ''Choosing the Right Educational Path for Your Child: What Are the Options?''

==Company history and officers==
For most of its history the Oxford Round Table has been an American organisation run by members of the Alexander family and variously headquartered in Kentucky, Illinois, Florida, and California. [[Kern Alexander]], Professor of Excellence at the [[University of Illinois]], Urbana-Champaign, founded the Oxford International Round Table on Education Policy in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/frp/a/alexandr College of Education Faculty Research Profiles: Kern Alexander&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not incorporated until 1994, when it was established in Florida as a for-profit corporation, with Alexander as president.

==Criticism and litigation==
A 2009 report cited critics who claimed that the Oxford Round Table "does not make its lack of academic connection [to Oxford University] clear." The article noted that pictures of Oxford University are used liberally on the ORT webpage, and quoted a number of ORT attendees who believed they had been invited by Oxford University. One professor expressed "surprise" when she learned that the ORT was not affiliated with Oxford University and concluded that "my conference funds would be best targeted towards a more appropriate venue."&lt;ref name=THE2/&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' reported that Oxford Round Table had been criticised on the forums of the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' website by people who said it was trading on the name of [[Oxford University]], and failed to properly inform people invited that it had no formal academic links to the university.  Other criticisms were that its selection criteria were poor and that it was a "vanity conference."&lt;ref name=THES/&gt;

The University told the newspaper that such external events were "not, as such, authorised or endorsed by the university."  The principal of [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Harris Manchester College]] said that although the college provided the company with an office, "we don't run the ORT in any sense," and that as far as he was aware, all ORT participants were satisfied. The company defended its selection criteria, and reported that its disclaimer, which is on its website, uses "the exact wording that was provided to us by the legal office of the University of Oxford several years ago."  A spokeswoman dismissed the critics as "a few nameless bloggers."

The ORT sued Sloan Mahone, a lecturer in the history of medicine at Oxford, after she emailed invitees and posted on the ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' website.&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/forums/index.php?topic=30869.msg417974{{Verify credibility|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ORT complained that Mahone had described the ORT as a "scam, a "complete fraud", and "a tourist venture, not a prestigious academic event".&lt;ref name=THE2&gt;Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=405766&amp;c=1 "Round Table invitees confused by Oxford 'link'"], ''Times Higher Education'', 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=THES/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Round Table Complaint, http://www.dmlp.org/threats/oxford-round-table-inc-v-mahone&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt by the Oxford Round Table, Inc., to sue Mahone for libel in the [[Kentucky]] courts failed on jurisdiction grounds,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case570.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and the company threatened to take legal action in the UK.&lt;ref name=THES/&gt; The company dropped the action after the researcher hired her own lawyer.&lt;ref name=THE2&gt;Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=405766&amp;c=1 "Round Table invitees confused by Oxford 'link'"], ''Times Higher Education'', 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rifa-e-Aam Club''' is a historic building in [[Lucknow]], India. It is best known as the place where the [[Progressive Writers Movement]] was created.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lucknowobserver.com/rifa-e-aam/ |title=Rifa-e-aam – Progressive Writing, Regressive Caretaking |work= The Lucknow Observer |access-date=28 November 2016 |date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Rifa-e-Aam-From-literary-riches-to-rag-pickers-hub/articleshow/44872477.cms|title=Rifa-e-Aam: From literary riches to rag-pickers’ hub |newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russians in Nepal''' from a tiny community consisting of expatriates from [[Russia]] as well as Nepalese people of Russian descent. 
==Migration history==
Russian expatriates, began trickling into Nepal at the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3466.html Waiting for Ded Moroz in Kathmandu]", ''Himal South Asian'', December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Nepalese men, who went to pursue their university education in the [[Soviet Union]], began returning home, bringing their Russian wives with them whom they married while they were studying abroad. That trend continued, bringing more Russian women to Nepal, as the number of Nepali students on scholarships at Soviet universities continued to rise through the 1970s and 1980s and by the 1990s there were 24 families of Nepalis with Russian spouses settled in Nepal, the vast majority in [[Kathmandu]]. 

As more Nepalis returned home in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, that number swelled, reaching 58 at its peak in the early 2000s. Today, with immigration drawing increasing numbers of educated Nepalis abroad, many of the younger families have left, currently leaving roughly 25 Russian women settled in Kathmandu.
==Culture==
Among the main concerns of the Russian women living in Nepal was ensuring that their children grew up with a sense of the [[Russian language]] and culture. These needs soon gave rise to the Russian Culture Center. Established in 1979, the center organizes Russian holiday celebrations and film screenings for the Russian community.

The Shaikh is a [[Muslim]] community commonly found in the state of [[Bihar]] in [[India]]. They are part of the larger [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] community of [[South Asia]]. A number of Bihari Shaikh families are also found in the city of [[Karachi]] in [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Common surnames used by the community include: [[Sayyid]], [[Farooqi]], [[Osmani]], [[Ansari (nesba)|Ansari]] and [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]].&lt;ref name=Gopal_and_Jha&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 872 to 875 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The word Shaikh in [[Arabic]] means a tribal elder or headman.

The Kulhaiya Shaikh are found mainly in Araria District and in Kadwa. They get their name from the custom of not marrying within their clan or kul in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], or within their village. They speak [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Traditionally the title [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] signifies [[Arab people|Arab]] descent and hence within the [[South Asia]]n [[Muslim]] context, higher societal standing. Shaikh along with [[Syed]], [[Malik]]s and [[Khan (title)|Khan]]/[[Pashtun people|Pathans]] are considered to be amongst the [[Ashraf]] communities within the Bihari Muslim.

The term Shaikh now covers a large number of communities of no definite origin, since the name has been used by any individuals of wide background. This is especially the case in [[Bihar]], for example in the [[Purnea district|Purnea division]], where the Shaikh form just under one-third of the population.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Some [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] played a key role in the early [[Islamic]] history of [[Bihar]], serving as courtiers and administrators for the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers. These Shaikhs were local Muslim converts converted by [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Dawah|missionaries]] from [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] although some of them were immigrants from modern [[Pakistan]] and [[North India|north-western India]]. The oldest Shaikh families settled in [[Bihar Sharif]], which was the centre of early [[Muslim]] rule in the region. Often these early settlers from the [[Central Asia]] were granted [[jagir]]s (estates), and were the earliest [[Muslim]] colonists in the region. These early colonists were often required to make converts, and these converts often adopted the clan name of those at whose hand they accepted [[Islam]]. This practice led to a large increase in those who call themselves Shaikhs, and these converts now form by far the largest [[Bihari Muslim]] community. The term Shaikh, particularly in [[Bihar]] and Bengal refers to any [[Muslim]], and in the [[Muslim]] majority [[Purnia Division]], covers four distinct groups.&lt;ref name=Gopal_and_Jha /&gt; In East India, the term Shaikh is closer to its intended meaning in [[Arabic language]] i.e. an elder or old man. In fact, not only in Bihar but also in [[Bengal]] ( modern [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]); Shaikhs comprise one of the three major social groups the other two being [[Pashtun people|Khan]] and [[Kayastha]]s. The [[Muslim Kayasths]] are community of [[Muslim]]s, descendents of members of the [[Kayastha]] caste of [[North India|northern India]], mainly in modern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Punjab]] and [[Bihar]] who embraced [[Islam]] during the rule of [[Islamic empires in India|Muslim dynasties]] and assumed the title of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part 2 by K S Singh page 1046&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Sdz9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Endogamy+and+Status+Mobility+among+Siddiqui+Shaikh+in+Social+Stratification&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjezfWoi4HRAhUh5YMKHU0KD7UQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Endogamy%20and%20Status%20Mobility%20among%20Siddiqui%20Shaikh%20in%20Social%20Stratification&amp;f=false Muslim Backward Classes: A Sociological Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The greatest concentration of the [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] are in the [[Purnia division]], especially in [[Kishanganj district]], but they are found throughout [[Bihar]]. They also have a presence in [[Nalanda]], [[Patna]], [[Nawada]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Madhubani, India|Madhubani]], [[Samastipur]], [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Sitamarhi]] and [[Saharsa]].. The Shaikh speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Hindi language|Urdu]] and various local dialects. They are [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] [[Muslim]]s, and have customs similar to other [[Bihari Muslim]]s. In the rural areas, the community are a largely endogamous, marrying close within close kin and other Muslims. They practice both parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages. While in the cities, there is now great deal of intermarriage with other [[Bihari Muslim]] communities. The abolishment of the [[zamindar]]i system at [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]] saw the breakup of the larger [[jagir]]s. These changes have not affected the Shaikh who were medium and small scale farmers, who have actually benefited from the breakup of the estates.&lt;ref name=Gopal_and_Jha /&gt;

==Shaikh of Purnea Division==
The [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] form the largest single community in the [[Purnia division]], particularly in the [[Kishanganj District]], where they make just under half the population. These Shaikh are a medium to small scale farmers, and are entirely rural. They are in fact four distinct communities, the Bengali, Kulaiya, Surjapuri, Habalyar and Khutta, each of whom are endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Purnea District Bengal District Gazetteers Government of India press&lt;/ref&gt;

Shane's Inspiration was founded in 1998, by television producer [[Scott A. Williams]] and his wife Catherine Curry-Williams, and their friend Tiffany Harris, in memory of Scott and Catherine's son Shane, who died in infancy from the effects of [[spinal muscular atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/05/13/local-couple-gives-disabled-children-a-place-to-play-after-loss-of-son/ "Local Couple Gives Disabled Children a Place to Play after Loss of Son"] ''CBS Los Angeles'' (May 13, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duane Noriyuki, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/01/news/ls-34695/2 "Always In Their Heart"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (April 1, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; They were inspired in part by the work of Amy Jaffe Barzach, founder of Boundless Playgrounds a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Benet and Christina Tapper, [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20230447,00.html "A Chance to Play for Disabled Children"] ''People Magazine'' 70(14)(October 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The flagship Shane's Inspiration playground in [[Griffith Park]] opened in the autumn of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laparks.org/dos/playground/facility/griffithUAPk.htm Shane's Inspiration - Griffith Park], City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15094">'''Sheikh Bedreddin''' (1359–1420) ({{lang-ota|شیخ بدرالدین}}) was an influential mystic, scholar, theologian, and revolutionary. He is most well known for his role in a 1416 revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultanate]], in which he and his disciples posed a serious challenge to the authority of sultan [[Mehmed I]] and the Ottoman state. His full name was Sheikh Bedreddin Mahmud Bin Israel Bin Abdulaziz.

==Early life==
Many details of Bedreddin's early life are disputed, as much of it is the subject of legend and folklore. He was born in 1359 in the town of [[Kyprinos|Simavna (Kyprinos)]], near [[Edirne]]. His father was the ''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'' of the town, and his mother was the daughter of a Greek Byzantine fortress commander. Notably, Bedreddin was of mixed [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] parentage, with a Christian mother and a Muslim father; this contributed to his [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religious beliefs later in life. Turkish scholar [[Cemal Kafadar]] argues that Bedreddin's ghazi roots may also have contributed to his commitment to religious coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State|last=Kafadar|first=Cemal|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1995|isbn=|location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he was a ''[[kadı|kadi]]'' to Ottoman warriors on the marches, which gave him ample experience in [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence]], a field of study in which he would become well-versed. Bedreddin was exposed to a variety of different cultures during his education, traveling far from his birthplace in [[Thrace]]. He studied theology in [[Konya]], and then in [[Cairo]], which was the capital of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultanate]]. After this, he traveled to [[Ardabil]], in what is now [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]]. Ardabil was under the control of the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]], and was home to the mystic Safavid order. Surrounded by mystics and far removed from the religious norms of the Ottoman Empire, Bedreddin was in an excellent place to cultivate his unconventional religious ideology. There he found an environment sympathetic to his [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] religious beliefs, and particularly the doctrine of “[[Oneness of Being|oneness of being]]”. This doctrine condemned oppositions such as those of religion and social class as interference in the oneness of God and the individual, and such doctrine ran contrary to increasing Ottoman efforts to establish [[Sunni Islam]] as the [[state religion]]. By adopting it, Bedreddin further established himself as a subversive.

During the [[Ottoman Interregnum|Ottoman interregnum]] after the defeat of sultan [[Bayezid I]] by [[Tamerlane]] in 1402, Bedreddin served as the [[Kadıasker|kadiasker]], or chief military judge, of the Ottoman prince Musa as Musa struggled with his brothers for control of the Ottoman sultanate. Along with the frontier bey Mihaloglu, he was a chief proponent of Musa's revolutionary regime. While kadiasker, Bedreddin gained the favor of many frontier ghazis by distributing ''[[timar]]s'' among them. Through this he aided these unpaid ghazis in their struggle against centralization, a clear indication of his subversive side.

==Revolt of 1416==
After [[Musa Çelebi|Musa]]’s defeat by [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]] [[Mehmed I]] in 1413, Bedreddin was exiled to [[Iznik]], and his followers were dispossessed of their timars. However, he soon decided to capitalize on the climate of opposition to Mehmed I following the disorder of the still-fresh interregnum. Leaving his exile in Iznik in 1415, Bedreddin made his way to [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]] and from there across the Black Sea to [[Wallachia]]. In 1416, he raised the standard of revolt against the Ottoman state.

Most of the revolts the ensued took place in regions of [[Izmir]], [[Dobruja|Dobrudja]], and [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]]. The majority of his followers were [[Turkmens|Turcomans]]. The rest included frontier ghazis, dispossessed ''[[sipahi]]s'', [[Madrasa|medrese]] students, and Christian peasants. The first of these rebellions was kindled in [[Karaburun]], near Izmir. There, [[Börklüce Mustafa|Borkluje Mustafa]], one of Bedreddin’s foremost disciples, instigated an idealistic popular revolt by preaching the communal ownership of property and the equality of Muslims and Christians. Most those who revolted were Turkish nomads, but Borkluje’s followers also included many Christians. In total, approximately 6,000 people revolted against the Ottoman state in Karaburun. [[Torlak Kemal]], another of Bedreddin’s followers, led another rebellion in [[Manisa]], and Bedreddin himself was the leader of a revolt in [[Dobruja|Dobrudja]], in contemporary northeastern Bulgaria. The heartland for the Dobrudja revolt was in the "wild forest" region south of the [[Danube Delta]]. Bedreddin found disciples among many who were discontent with sultan Mehmed; he became a figurehead for those who felt they had been disenfranchised by the sultan, including disgruntled marcher lords and many of those who had been given timars by Bedreddin as Musa's kadiasker, which had been revoked by Mehmed.

These uprisings posed a serious challenge to the authority of Mehmed I as he attempted to reunite the Ottoman Empire and govern his Balkan provinces. Although they were all eventually stifled, the series of coordinated revolts instigated by Bedreddin and his disciples was suppressed after only great difficulty. Torlak Kemal's rebellion in Manisa was crushed and he was executed, along with thousands of his followers. Borkluje's rebellion put up more of a fight than the others, defeating first the army of the governor of [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] and then that of the Ottoman governor Ali Bey, before finally it was finally crushed by the Vizier [[Bayezid Pasha]]. According to the Greek historian [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]], Bayezid slaughtered unconditionally to ensure the rebellion's defeat, and Borkluje was executed along with two thousand of his followers. Sheikh Bedreddin's own Dobrudja rebellion was a short-lived one, and came to an end when Bedreddin was apprehended by Mehmed's forces and taken to [[Serres]]. Accused of disturbing the public order by preaching religious syncretism and the communal ownership of property, he was executed in the marketplace.

==Thought and writings==
Sheikh Bedreddin was a prolific writer and religious scholar, and a distinguished member of the Islamic religious hierarchy. He is often regarded as a talented voice in religious sciences, particularly for his thoughts on Islamic law. For his works on jurisprudence he is classed among the great scholars of Islamic thought. On the other hand, many condemn him as a heretic for his radical ideas on religious syncretism. Bedreddin advocated overlooking religious difference, arguing against zealous proselytism in favor of a utopian synthesis of faiths. This latitudinarian interpretation of religion was a major part of what allowed him and his disciples to instigate a broad-reaching popular revolt in 1416, unifying a very heterogenous base of support.

Bedreddin's religious origins were as a mystic. His form of mysticism was greatly influenced by the work of [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-‘Arabi]], and he is known to have written a commentary of al-‘ Arabi's book ''Fusus al-hikam'' (The Quintessence of Wisdom). Through his writings, he developed his own form of mysticism. His most significant book, ''Varidat,'' or ''Divine Inspirations,'' was a compilation of his discourses which reflected on his ideas about mysticism and religion. Bedreddin was a [[Monism|monist]], believing that reality is a manifestation of God's essence, and that the spiritual and physical worlds were inseparable and necessary to one another. As he writes in ''Varidat,'' he believed that “This world and the next, in their entirety, are imaginary fantasies; heaven and hell are no more than the spiritual manifestations, sweet and bitter, of good and evil actions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Era 1300-1600|last=Inalcik|first=Halil|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedreddin's [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] beliefs greatly influenced many of his political and social ideas, particularly the doctrine of “oneness of being.” This doctrine condemns oppositions which its adherents believe hinder the oneness of the individual with God, including oppositions between religions and between the privileged and the powerless. This belief system is reflected in the beliefs of Bedreddin and his disciples, who, among other things, preached that all religions are essentially the same, as well as that ownership of property should be communal. Such ideas appealed greatly to those who felt marginalized in Ottoman society, and this egalitarian ideology played a major role in inspiring popular revolt in 1416.

Sheikh Bedreddin clearly had ambitious political aspirations when he began his rebellion. According to the 15th-century Sunni historian Idris of Bitlis, Bedreddin considered himself the [[Mahdi]], who would bring about God's unity in the world by distributing his lands among his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300-1600|last=Inalcik|first=Halil|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Idris’ account is partial, Bedreddin's ambitions as a political and religious leader are apparent. He even went so far as to claim that he was descended from the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk royal house]], undoubtedly to bolster his legitimacy as a potential ruler. It is plausible that he aspired to win the sultanate.

== Impact ==

The revolt of 1416 marked a turning point in the toleration of non-Muslims by the Ottoman state. By crushing the rebellion aggressively and stigmatizing those who revolted, the state condemned popular discontent as illegitimate and further defined its position of opposition to religious nonconformists. After the revolt, Turco-Muslim presence in the Balkans became equivalent to an Ottoman presence. Bedreddin's rebellion made it clear to Ottoman statesmen that religious dissidence could pose a serious threat to their administrative structure, and in the years that followed, [[Murad II]], Mehmed's successor, took steps to ensure that Islam was further established as the state's religion. For example, Murad expanded the [[Janissaries]] in the wake of the Bedreddin revolt to increase Ottoman military power, but also to create a steady flow of Christians being converted to Islam. This demonstrates a clear shift in Ottoman policy away from toleration of non-Muslims and closer to one of assimilation, a trend that would continue in the coming centuries.

Sects of Bedreddin's followers continued to survive long after his death. His teachings remained influential, and his sectarians were considered a threat until the late sixteenth century. Known as the Simavnis or the Bedreddinlus, a sect of his followers in Dobrudja and [[Ludogorie|Deliorman]] continued to survive for hundreds of years after his execution. Unsurprisingly, the Ottoman government viewed this group with great suspicion. In the sixteenth century, they were regarded as identical to the [[Qizilbash|Kizilbash]], and persecuted along with them. Some of Bedreddin's doctrines also became common among some other mystic sects. One such sect was the [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], a dervish order commonly associated the Janissaries.

Sheikh Bedreddin continues to be known in Turkey, especially among socialists, communists, and other political leftists. In the twentieth century, he was brought back into the spotlight by the communist Turkish writer [[Nâzım Hikmet|Nazim Hikmet]], who wrote ''The Epic of Sheikh Bedreddin'' to voice opposition to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. Hikmet's work popularized Bedreddin as a historical champion of socialism and an opponent of fascist tyranny, and his name has remained well known to those on the left of the political spectrum. His bones were exhumed in 1924, but his devotees were so fearful of a backlash against Bedreddin's newfound political significance by the Turkish government that he was not buried until 1961. He was finally put to rest near the mausoleum of [[Mahmud II]], in [[Istanbul]].

'''''Sheng nu''''' ('''[[wikt:剩女|剩女]]'''; '''''shèngnǚ'''''; common translation: "leftover women" or "leftover ladies") is a [[derogatory term]] made popular by the [[All-China Women's Federation]] that classifies women who remain unmarried in their late twenties and beyond.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Magistad |first=Mary Kay |date=20 February 2013 |title=BBC News - China's 'leftover women', unmarried at 27 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=Beijing |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21320560 |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite news |last=Simpson |first=Peter |date=21 February 2013 |title=The 'leftover' women: China defines official age for females being left on the shelf as 27 |work=[[Mail Online]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2282249/The-leftover-women-China-defines-official-age-females-left-shelf-27.html |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sebag-Montefiore |first=Clarissa |date=21 August 2012 |title=Romance With Chinese Characteristics |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/romance-with-chinese-characteristics/?_r=0 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TCD3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/weekly/2012-11/30/content_15972982.htm|title=The marry-by date outlives its usefulness|date=30 November 2012|author=He Fing|publisher=''[[The China Daily]]''|accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most prominently used in [[China]], which was part of a controversial state sponsored directive and program, but has been used to colloquially refer to women in other parts of [[Asia]], [[India]], and [[North America]].&lt;ref name=PULITZER&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Deborah Jian |author2=Sushima Subramanian |date=17 October 2011 |title=China's Educated Women Can't Find Eligible Men |work=[[Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting]] |location=China |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PD&gt;{{cite news |last=HuangJin |first=Chen Lidan |date=26 February 2013 |script-title=zh:中国"剩女"现象引热议 国外网友称欲学中文来中国 |work=[[People's Daily]] |language=zh |trans-title=China's 'leftover women' phenomenon arouses heated debate in West |url=http://www.zj.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/sociology/2013-02/23/c_114777483.htm |accessdate=23 April 2013}} – [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90882/8144310.html English]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has gone on to become widely used in the mainstream media and has been the subject of several televisions series, magazine and newspaper articles, and book publications, focusing on the negative connotations and positive reclamation of the term.&lt;ref name=UCDM&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ng |first1=Valerie |last2=Nilsson |first2=Erik |date=12 February 2012 |title=Much ado about shengnu |publisher=''[[The China Daily]]'' |url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-02/12/content_17279212.htm |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Xu Xiaomin of ''[[The China Daily]]'' described the sheng nus as "a social force to be reckoned with" and others have argued the term should be taken as a positive to mean "successful women".&lt;ref name=TID&gt;{{cite news |last=Pratten |first=Nyima |date=19 March 2013 |title=Don't pity China's 'leftover women', they've got more going for them than you realise |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/dont-pity-chinas-leftover-women-theyve-got-more-going-for-them-than-you-realise-8536872.html |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schott |first=Ben |date=15 March 2010 |title=Leftover Ladies &amp; 3S Women |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/leftover-ladies-3s-women/ |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[slang]] term, '''3S''' or '''3S Women''', meaning "single, seventies (1970s), and stuck" has also been used in place of sheng nu.&lt;ref name="TNYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;{{cite news |last=Yao |first=Joanne |date=13 August 2010 |title=Love letters: The A, B, C and D of finding 'the one' in Shanghai |work=[[CNN]] |url=http://travel.cnn.com/shanghai/life/shanghai-finding-one-be-increasingly-difficult-480809 |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:One child policy.jpg|thumb|Government sign stating: "For a prosperous, powerful nation and a happy family, please use birth planning."]]
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] (Central People's Government) issued an "edict" in 2007 regarding the Population and Family Planning Program (one-child-policy) to address the urgent gender imbalance and cited it as a major "threat to social stability".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/opinion/global/chinas-leftover-women.html?_r=0|title=OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; China's 'Leftover' Women|last=Fincher|first=Leta Hong|date=12 October 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council further cited "upgrading population quality (suzhi)" as one of its primary goals and appointed the [[All-China Women's Federation]], a state agency established in 1949 to "protect women's rights and interests", to oversee and resolve the issue.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In March 2011, the All-China Women's Federation posted a controversial article titled 'Leftover Women Do Not Deserve Our Sympathy' shortly after [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; An excerpt states, "Pretty girls do not need a lot of education to marry into a rich and powerful family. But girls with an average or ugly appearance will find it difficult" and "These girls hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is, they don't realise that as women age, they are worth less and less. So by the time they get their [[Master's degree|MA]] or [[Doctorate|PhD]], they are already old — like yellowed pearls."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Originally at least 15 articles were available on its website relating to the subject of sheng nu, which have now been subsequently removed, that included matchmaking advice and tips.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

===Culture and statistics===
[[File:Lin Chi-Ling (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Model, film, and television superstar [[Lin Chi-ling]], born 1974, represents the university educated, financially successful, and wealthy "A-quality women" that have remained unmarried beyond their late twenties.]]
The [[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] (NBS) and state census figures reported approximately 1 in 5 women between the age of 25-29 remain unmarried.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In contrast, the proportion of unwed men in that age range is much higher, sitting at around 1 in 3.&lt;ref name="PULITZER" /&gt; In a 2010 Chinese National Marriage Survey, it was reported that 9 out of 10 men believe that women should be married before they are 27 years old.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; 7.4% of Chinese women between 30-34 were unmarried and the percentage falls to 4.6% between the ages 35–39.&lt;ref name="UCDM" /&gt; In comparison with other neighbouring countries with similar traditional values, these figures put China as having some of the highest female marriage rates in the world.&lt;ref name="UCDM" /&gt; Despite being categorized as a "relatively rare" demographic, the social culture and traditions of China have put the issue in the social spotlight.&lt;ref name="UCDM" /&gt;

A study of married couples in China noted that men tended to marry down the [[Economic inequality|socio-economic ladder]].&lt;ref name="PULITZER" /&gt; "There is an opinion that A-quality guys will find B-quality women, B-quality guys will find C-quality women, and C-quality men will find D-quality women," says Huang Yuanyuan.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; "The people left are A-quality women and D-quality men. So if you are a leftover woman, you are A-quality."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; A [[University of North Carolina]] [[demographer]] who studies China's gender imbalance, Yong Cai, further notes that "men at the bottom of society get left out of the marriage market, and that same pattern is coming to emerge for women at the top of society".&lt;ref name="ATL" /&gt;
[[File:Adia Chan.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Hong Kong]] actress [[Adia Chan]] starred in the [[Singaporean]] [[China|Chinese]] drama television series ''[[You Are the One (Singaporean TV series)|You Are the One]]'' where she portrayed the eldest career-minded sibling.]]
China, and many other Asian countries, share a long history of conservative and [[patriarchal]] view of marriage and the family structure including marrying at a young age and [[hypergamy]].&lt;ref name="PULITZER" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TDM2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-22/chinas-leftover-ladies-are-anything-but|title=China's 'Leftover Ladies' Are Anything But|last=Larson|first=Christina|date=23 August 2012|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=29 March 2013|location=China}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure from society and family has been the source criticism, [[shame]], social embarrassment and [[social anxiety]] for many women who are unmarried.&lt;ref name="PULITZER" /&gt; Chen, another women interviewed by the BBC, said the sheng nu are "afraid their friends and neighbours will regard me as abnormal. And my parents would also feel they were totally losing face, when their friends all have grandkids already".&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Similar sentiment has been shared amongst other women in China, particularly amongst recent university graduates. A report by [[CNN]] cited a survey of 900 female university graduates across 17 Chinese universities where approximately 70 percent of those surveyed said "their greatest fear is becoming a 3S lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/shanghai/life/shanghai-graduates-greatest-fear-becoming-3s-lady-455776|title=Shanghai women's biggest fear: Life without a man|date=25 August 2010|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing popularity of unwed women in China has been largely accredited to the growing educated [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="TID" /&gt; Women are more free and able to live independently in comparison to previous generations.&lt;ref name="TID" /&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that in 2013, "11 of the 20 richest self-made women in the world are Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-21/special-report/34626853_1_richest-self-made-women-chinese-women-leftover-women|archive-url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArchiveView.asp?Daily=TOICH&amp;AppName=1&amp;login=default&amp;pub=TOI&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;Enter=true&amp;GZ=T&amp;BaseHref=TOICH%2F2012%2F10%2F21&amp;PageSize=4&amp;Page=15|archive-date=2015-12-20|title=Leftover women are 'yellowed pearls'|date=21 October 2012|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it cites that Chinese female [[CEO]]s make up 19 percent of women in management jobs making it the second highest worldwide after [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/you-do-not-want-to-be-a-single-woman-over-28-in-china-2012-7|title=You Do Not Want To Be A Single Lady Over 28 In China|last=Keenlyside|first=Sarah|author2=Wang, Lily |date=30 July 2012|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted outcome has been the reluctance amongst male partners to date women who are professionally more successful than they or unwilling to give up work or both.&lt;ref name="TDM2" /&gt; A rapidly growing trend in [[premarital sex]] has been commonly surveyed and noted amongst women in China.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt; In 1989, 15% of Chinese women engaged in premarital sex against 2013 where between 60-70% had done so.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt; [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] professor Li states that this shows an increase in the types of relationships amongst new generations in China.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt;

A movement in China to have the word banned from most government websites, including the All-China Women's Federation website, was marginally successful.&lt;ref name="DM" /&gt; The wording was changed to "old unmarried women", but sheng nu remains a widespread and mainstream idea.&lt;ref name="DM" /&gt; The term has also been embraced by some feminists with the opening of 'sheng nu' [[social clubs]].&lt;ref name="PULITZER" /&gt; In an interview with fashion editor Sandra Bao by the ''[[Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting]]'', Bao stated that "many modern, single women in China enjoy their independence and feel comfortable holding out for the right man, even as they grow older." She further explained, "We don't want to make compromises because of age or social pressure".&lt;ref name="PULITZER" /&gt;

Between 2008 and 2012, sociologist Sandy To, while at the [[University of Cambridge]], conducted a 'grounded theory method' study in China regarding the topic.&lt;ref name="UOC" /&gt; To's research focused on "marriage partner choice" by Chinese professional women in the form of a [[psychological typologies|typology]] of four different "partner choice strategies".&lt;ref name="UOC" /&gt; The main finding of the study found that contrary to the popular belief that highly educated and single women remain unmarried, or do not want to take on traditional roles in marriage, because of personal preference, that in contrast, they commonly have an appetite for marriage and that their main obstacle is traditional patriarchal attitudes.&lt;ref name="UOC" /&gt; The study also pointed out that in other Asian countries such as [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]], where women have been receiving a higher education, that correspondingly, the average age of marriage amongst them is much higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cn.yahoo.com/ypen/20130307/1644257.html|title=港大博士发表论文 称甲男配乙女观念催生剩女_雅虎资讯|last=者 俞陶然|author2=邬思蓓|date=7 March 2013|work=[[Yahoo!

===Media===

The Chinese media has capitalized on the subject matter with television shows, [[viral video]]s, newspapers and magazine articles, and [[pundit]]s that have sharply criticized women for "waiting it out for a man with a bigger house or fancier car".&lt;ref name="ATL" /&gt; The television series comedy ''[[Will You Marry Me and My Family]]'', which premièred on [[CCTV-8]], that revolves around the principal concept of sheng nu as a family frantically searches for a prospective spouse of the main character who is in her 30s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ent.qq.com/a/20100407/000704.htm 大女当看《大女当嫁》 "大女"称谓取代剩女_娱乐_腾讯网].

Retrieved on 2011年10月25日.&lt;/ref&gt; This series and ''[[You Are the One (Singaporean TV series)|You Are the One]]'' ([[MediaCorp Channel 8]]) have been accredited with minting terms like "the shengnu economy" and further bringing the subject into public fascination and obsession.&lt;ref name="UCDM" /&gt; ''[[If You Are the One (game show)|If You Are the One]]'' ([[Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation|Jiangsu Satellite Television]]) is a popular Chinese [[game show]], loosely based on ''[[Taken Out]]'', whose rise has been credited with the "national obsession" surrounding sheng nu.&lt;ref name="TCD3" /&gt; The show between 2010-2013 was China's most viewed game show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/789494.shtml#.UxhA3PmSySo|title=If you are the foreign one|publisher=''[[Global Times]]''|author=Wang Fei|date=18 June 2013|accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a popular music video called "No Car, No House" about blue-collar Chinese bachelors, another music video called "No House, No Car" was made by a group of women and uploaded on International Women's Day.&lt;ref name="UCDM" /&gt; The video was viewed over 1.5 million times over the first two days on the Chinese video site Youku.&lt;ref name="UCDM" /&gt; Other commercial interests have taken advantage of the situation such as the increased popularity of "boyfriends for hire".&lt;ref name="BBCR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21192131|title=Boyfriends for hire to beat China's wedding pressure|last=Hatton|first=Celia|date=6 February 2013|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 March 2013|location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has also been turned into a popular television drama series called ''Renting a Girlfriend for Home Reunion''.&lt;ref name="BBCR" /&gt;

The topic has also been the subject of literary works. Hong Kong author [[Amy Cheung (writer)|Amy Cheung]]'s bestselling novel ''Hummingbirds Fly Backwards'' (三个A Cup的女人) depicts the anxieties of three unmarried women on the verge of turning 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/publications/books/17/2896-1.htm|title=I Used to Have You in My Life|publisher=Xinhua, translated and edited by All-China Women's Federation|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and consequences===
Experts have further theorized about the term's longevity as the [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]] has been moving towards phasing out the one-child policy in favour of an "appropriate and scientific family planning policy (one-child policy)" where the child limit may be increased.&lt;ref name="TID" /&gt;&lt;ref name="REU"/&gt; He Feng in ''[[The China Daily]]'' points out, "the sheng nu phenomenon is nothing like the [[feminist movement]] in [[Western world|the West]], in which women consciously demanded equal rights in jobs and strived for independence."&lt;ref name="TCD3" /&gt; Rather, the change has been "subtle" and that "perhaps decades later, will be viewed as symbolic of China's [[social progress]] and a turning point for the role of women in its society."&lt;ref name="TCD3" /&gt;

In an article by the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', it concludes, "with mounting pressure and dwindling hopes of fulfilling both career and personal ambitions at home, for women such as Xu the urge to pack up and leave only grows stronger with time.

== Sheng Nu Movement ==

=== Influence of media in the movement ===
The Sheng Nu Movement uses the internet and media as an outlet to remove the stigma against leftover women. [[SK-II]], a Japanese skincare brand, launched in the early 1980's, has launched a global campaign called #changedestiny,  to empower women affected by the prejudice against “leftover women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/creativity/skincare-brand-bravely-stood-chinas-leftover-women-unmarried-after-25-170708/|title=A Skin Care Brand Bravely Stood Up for China’s ‘Leftover’ Women Unmarried After 25 – Adweek|website=www.adweek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their campaign video, "Marriage Market Takeover&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=SK-II|title=SK-II: Marriage Market Takeover (Please turn on subtitle)|date=2016-04-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irfd74z52Cw&amp;t=28s|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;", stories of women who overcame the challenges of being unmarried after they turn 27.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The video includes interviews from leftover women. In the interview, Wang Xiao Qi describes how her parents pushed her into marriage by arguing that “marriage doesn’t wait.” She refutes them by saying, “even if I don’t have a significant other half, I can still live wonderfully.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sk-ii.com/luxury-skin-care-tips/marriage-market-takeover.html|title="We're single, but not 'leftovers'"|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial was launched with the idea of taking over the “Marriage Market&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;”, a place where Chinese parents essentially advertise children as marriage potential, listing their height, weight, salary, values and personality. 
=== Reaction ===
[[File:Tsai Ing-wen 2009.jpg|thumb|7th president of the Republic of China, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], won the 2016 [[Republic of China]] election while being a leftover woman.]]
Powerful figures of modern day China have publicly expressed their irritation towards the growing feminist movement in their male-dominated society. Feng Gang, a leading sociologist, posted on social media “History has proved that academia is not the domain of women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1001047/sociologist-refuses-to-apologize-for-sexist-social-media-posts|title=Sociologist Refuses to Apologize for Sexist Social Media Posts|last=Tone|first=Sixth|date=Tue Oct 24 04:57:21 PDT 2017|work=Sixth Tone|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xu Youzhe the CEO of one of China’s most popular gaming companies, [[Duoyi Network]], mentioned.

China’s government have also been known to combat the growing feminist movement in China. On International Women’s Day in 2015, feminists in China were detained for publicly raising awareness about sexual harassment on public transportation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/07/international-womens-day-china-muffles-womens-voices|title=On International Women’s Day, China Muffles Women’s Voices|date=2017-03-07|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Five Women in Beijing were also arrested and sent to a detention center by the [[Public Security Bureau]] for handing out the feminist sticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/feminist-stickers-china-backash-women-activists|title=I went to jail for handing out feminist stickers in China {{!}} Li Maizi|last=Maizi|first=Li|date=2017-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Women’s Voices, a social media account run by China’s most prominent feminists, was suspended with no specific explanation as to why.

[[Tsai Ing-wen|Tsai Ing-Wen]] is a 59-year-old leftover woman and also the first female president of [[The Republic of China|The Republic of China.]] [[Tsai Ing-wen|Tsai Ing-Wen]] is criticized for being an unmarried president. The Chinese State newspaper [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] shamed [[Tsai Ing-wen|Tsai Ing-Wen]] by commenting, “As a single female politician, she lacks the emotional drag of love, the pull of the ‘home,’ and no children to care for,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taiwan-tsai-ingwen-single-shamed_us_5745bd50e4b0dacf7ad38663|title=China Shames Taiwan's New Female President For Being Single|last=Ma|first=Alexandra|date=2016-05-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism in China ===
{{main|Sexism in China|Feminism in China}}
[[Sexism]] is prominent in China’s job field where women are either expected to meet China’s many societal standards or aren’t given any opportunities at all on the basis of their gender. In male-dominated areas such as technology and construction, one of the requirements needed to get the job may actually require the applicant to be a male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/08/world/asia/china-gender-discrimination/index.html|title=Gender discrimination rife in Chinese workforce - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Jemimah Steinfeld for|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[South China Morning Post]],'' Gender discrimination is deeply ingrained in Chinese society, which, for centuries, was dominated by Confucianism which places women as inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2143108/gender-discrimination-china-resurfacing-employers-seek|title=Beauty is in the eye of the employer in China|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender discrimination also occurs in employment where women have to fit certain physical features to be hired. Sexism exists in the Chinese employment system. Brian Stauffer from [[Human Rights Watch]] describes “Sexual objectification of women—treating women as a mere object of sexual desire—is prevalent in Chinese job advertising. Some job postings require women to have certain physical attributes—with respect to height, weight, voice, or facial appearance—that are completely irrelevant to the execution of job duties.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/04/23/only-men-need-apply/gender-discrimination-job-advertisements-china|title=“Only Men Need Apply” {{!}} Gender Discrimination in Job Advertisements in China|date=2018-04-23|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal actions have been taken against sexism in China’s job field. In 2014, a woman named Cao Ju was refused a job in the private tutoring firm Juren in Beijing based on the fact that she was a woman. The company settled for 30,000 yuan for what’s known to be “China's first gender discrimination lawsuit.” Cao justified her actions by stating that “[I] think as long as the person is capable of doing the work the post requires, gender is irrelevant.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/28/china-woman-settles-first-gender-discrimination-lawsuit|title=China: woman settles in first gender discrimination lawsuit|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2014-01-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Singapore]] is noted to have gone through a similar period.&lt;ref name="TCD3" /&gt; In 1983, then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] sparked the 'Great Marriage Debate' when he encouraged Singapore men to choose highly educated women as wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Kuan Yew|title=From Third World to First|year=2000|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-06-019776-5|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned that a large number of graduate women were unmarried.&lt;ref name="Lee 2000 140"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Kuan Yew|title=From Third World to First|year=2000|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-06-019776-5|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sections of the population, including graduate women, were upset by his views.&lt;ref name="Lee 2000 140"/&gt; Nevertheless, a match-making agency [[Social Development Unit]] (SDU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Kuan Yew|title=From Third World to First|year=2000|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-06-019776-5|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up to promote socialising among men and women graduates.&lt;ref name="natgeojan10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text|title=The Singapore Solution|last=Jacobson|first=Mark|date=January 2010|work=[[National Geographic Magazine]]|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Graduate Mothers Scheme, Lee also introduced incentives such as [[tax rebate]]s, schooling, and housing priorities for graduate mothers who had three or four children, in a reversal of the over-successful 'Stop-at-Two' family planning campaign in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 1990s, the birth rate had fallen so low that Lee's successor [[Goh Chok Tong]] extended these incentives to all married women, and gave even more incentives, such as the 'baby bonus' scheme.&lt;ref name="natgeojan10"/&gt; Lee reaffirmed his controversial position in his personal memoir, ''[[Lee Kuan Yew#Memoirs|From Third World to First]]'', "many well-educated Singaporean women did not marry and have children."&lt;ref name="TCD3" /&gt;

The 2012 UN study cited by the Chinese ''People's Daily'' reported that in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] 74 percent and in Japan 70 percent of all women between 25 and 29 were single.&lt;ref name="PD" /&gt; A similar feature in the ''People's Daily'' focused on the reception of the concept of sheng nu from [[netizen]]s outside of China, particularly in Asia, specifically Korea, Japan, and [[India]].&lt;ref name="PD" /&gt; One Japanese netizen noted that during the 1980s, the term "[[Christmas cake#Japan|Christmas cakes]]" was commonly used to refer to women who were unmarried and beyond the national age average of married women.&lt;ref name="PD" /&gt; The actual reference to Christmas cakes is the saying, "who wants Christmas cakes after December 25".&lt;ref name="PD" /&gt; Another contributor wrote, similarly "a class of highly educated, independent age 27+ women who choose to live a more liberated life and put their talent/skill to good use in society" is happening in India.&lt;ref name="PD" /&gt; "People must make their own choices and must simply refuse others' labels and be blissfully happy", she further explained.&lt;ref name="PD" /&gt; Alternatively, for men in Japan, the term [[Herbivore men]] is used to describe men who have no interest in getting married or finding a girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After the end of the world|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2011-03-23|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/03/23/apop032311.DTL&amp;ao=2|accessdate=2015-12-20|first=Jeff|last=Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan's 'grass eaters' turn their backs on macho ways|work=[[the Guardian]]|date=2009-12-27|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/japan-grass-eaters-salaryman-macho|accessdate=2015-12-20|first=Justin|last=McCurry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other typologically similar terms that are still used in the modern lexicon of other countries and cultures show the concept has existed in some cases as far back as the 16th century.

Many had already been in the country for more than fifteen years due to the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="forschungsportal1"&gt;[http://www.forschungsportal.ch/unibe/abstracts/A_66584590.html Social Change Among Sri Lankan Tamil Refugees in Switzerland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706232125/http://www.forschungsportal.ch/unibe/abstracts/A_66584590.html |date=2011-07-06 }}.

===LTTE in Switzerland===
As well a providing refuge for some Sri Lankans, members of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE or Tamil Tigers) have been based in Switzerland. The LTTE in Switzerland have been known as the Swiss Tigers.&lt;ref name="forschungsportal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srilankaguardian1"&gt;[http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2011/02/sri-lanka-perspectives-january-2011.html Sri Lanka Perspectives – January 2011].

Its contribution to the LTTE to the war effort has proportionately exceeded that of Tamils living in other Western countries. {{cn|date=August 2017}}

===End of the war===
With the end of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], LTTE  networks around the world were being shut down by both Sri Lankan and foreign governments. In 2011 the Swiss police arrested ten former LTTE representatives in the country for threatening, blackmailing and extortion of Tamils of the Sri Lankan diaspora to support the LTTE and the war effort financially. The funds were mainly used to buy weapons in Sri Lanka. Those arrested included the head of the LTTE in Switzerland [[Vijaratnam Sivanesan]] alias 'Ragu alias Ragupathy', his predecessor [[Chelliah Kularajasekeram]] alias 'Kulam' and the Swiss Tiger finance chief [[Chelliah Jeyapalan]] alias 'Abdullah'. They are facing charges of money laundering and belonging to a criminal organisation.&lt;ref name="srilankaguardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlanka.com/?p=3090 Onlanka News – Tamil Diaspora in Switzerland squeezed for money by LTTE «].

'''Street harassment''' is a form of [[sexual harassment]] that consists of unwanted comments, gestures, honking,
[[wolf-whistling]]s, '''catcalling''', exposure, following, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers in public areas such as streets, shopping malls, and public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying Via Social Media|journal=[[Journal of School Violence]]|last1=Whittaker|first1=Elizabeth|author2=Robin M. Kowalski|date=2015|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–29|doi=10.1080/15388220.2014.949377}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the founder of the non-profit organization ''Stop Street Harassment'', it can also consist of physically harmless behavior, such as "kissing noises" and "non-sexually explicit comments," to "more threatening behavior" like stalking, flashing, sexual assault, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stop Street Harassment: Making Public Places Safe and Welcoming for Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|publisher=Praeger|year=2010|isbn=978-0313384967|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients include people of all genders, but women are much more commonly victims of harassment by men. According to ''Harvard Law Review'' (1993), street harassment is considered harassment done primarily by male strangers to females in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Cynthia Grant|date=January 1993|title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=106|pages=519|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers from Cornell University and [[Hollaback!]] conducted the largest international cross-cultural study on street harassment. The data suggests that the majority of females have their first street harassment experience during puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihollaback.org/cornell-international-survey-on-street-harassment/|title=Street Harassment: The Largest International Cross-Cultural Study|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=hollaback!|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of South Asia, public sexual harassment of women is called "[[eve teasing]]". The Spanish term ''piropos'' most widely used in Mexico holds a similar effect. Studies show that what is considered street harassment is similar around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kissling|first=Elizabeth|date=1991|title=Street harassment: The Language of Sexual Terrorism|jstor=42888749|journal=Discourse and Society|volume=2|issue=4|pages=457–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many perpetrators of these actions would not characterize them as harassment, though most recipients would. Harassment can also be disproportionately directed at those with what is perceived by passers-by as a non-typical [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is street harassment?|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/what-is-street-harassment/|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking photos of strangers without permission, as [[street photography]] and [[photojournalism]] practitioners do, is not considered street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kearl|first1=Holly|title=Stop Global Street Harassment: Growing Activism Around the World|date=August 2015|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There is no definitive beginning of street harassment, but discussion regarding the subject began in 1944 with the rape of [[Recy Taylor]]. Rosa Parks was commissioned to investigate the crime in which Taylor, a black woman, was kidnapped and gang raped in Abbeville, Alabama. Parks responded by starting what was later dubbed the "strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dailey|first=Jane|date=2011|title=At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance—A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power, by Danielle L. McGuire|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=2|issue=2|pages=490–491|doi=10.1093/jahist/jar290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement called Take Back the Night gained traction. This movement, still strongly represented today, is an international protest against sexual violence against women. Take Back the Night has become a non-profit organization that aims to end all forms of sexual violence, including street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://takebackthenight.org/about-us/|title=About – Take Back the Night|website=takebackthenight.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the "Wall Street Ogle-In" took place. Led by [[Karla Jay]], women marched on Wall Street with signs addressing street harassment. As a role reversal, the women catcalled the men they passed in hopes of raising awareness of the unpleasant nature of the street harassment women experience daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/blogs/when-womens-lib-vindicated-wall-streets-original-joan-holloway.htm|title=How Wall Street's Original Joan Holloway Inspired Second-Wave Feminist Protests|date=2015-08-25|work=Stuff Mom Never Told You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Deirdre Davis wrote an academic article that helped clarify what street harassment is by explaining its five characteristics: 1) it takes place in a public space, 2) it most commonly occurs between men and women, 3) saying "thank you" to a harasser provokes further harassment, 4) comments often pertain to what cannot be seen on the woman's body, and 5) the harasser's comments, though disguised as compliments, are objectifying and derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Deirdre,|date=1994-01-01|title=The Harm That Has No Name: Street Harassment, Embodiment, and African American Women|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/83b9f21g|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the blog ''Stop Street Harassment'' became a non-profit that is "dedicated to documenting and ending gender-based street harassment worldwide" by hosting events and keeping people informed about action they can take to end street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/|title=About |publisher=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=2018-04-13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
There is a high prevalence for street harassment to become sexual violence. Worldwide, statistics show that 80% of women endure at least frequent street harassment, 45% feel that they cannot go alone to public spaces, 50% have to cross the street to find alternate routes to their destinations, 26% claim that they are in a relationship in order to avoid harassment, 80% feel the need to be constantly alert when traversing local streets and 19% have had to switch careers to escape the area in which harassment occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meza-De-Luna|first1=M.|last2=García-Falconi|first2=S.|title=Adolescent Street Harassment in Querétaro, Mexico|journal=Affilia|date=2014|volume=30 |issue=2|pages=158–169|doi=10.1177/0886109914541117}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not only transnational, but also transcultural and affects people of all identities, races, and ages—everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennox|first1=R.|last2=Jurdi-Hage|first2=R.|title=Beyond the empirical and the discursive: The methodological implications of critical realism for street harassment research|journal=Womens Studies International Forum|volume=60|pages=23–28|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2016.11.010|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian government sponsored a large survey in 1993 called the Violence Against Women Survey. In the sample of over 12,000 women, 85% said they were victims of harassment by a stranger.&lt;ref name="JRCD" /&gt; In a 2002 survey of [[Beijing]] residents, 58% cited public buses as a common location for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harassment rampant on public transportation|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0411/cn8-4.html|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=Shanghai Star|date=11 April 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121955/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0411/cn8-4.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Australia shows that almost 90% of women have experienced verbal or physical harassment in public one or more times in their lives. In Afghanistan, research done in the same year indicates that the prevalence of harassment was 93%. Canadian and Egyptian studies show that the rate of incidence is approximately 85% of women experiencing street harassment in the past year. In U.S.-based research, it was reported that women experienced stranger harassment on a monthly basis (41%), while a large minority reported experiencing harassment once every few days (31%). These statistics are given to show a sense of the phenomenon as widely construed, not taken as representative of the same phenomenon comparable across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fileborn|first1=B|last2=Vera-Gray|first2=F|title='I Want to be Able to Walk the Street Without Fear': Transforming Justice for Street Harassment|journal=Feminist Legal Studies|volume=25 |issue=2|page=203|doi=10.1007/s10691-017-9350-3|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
A representative survey of 2,000 Americans was commissioned in 2014 by activist group Stop Street Harassment and conducted by [[GfK]]. 65% of women and 25% of men reported having been the victims of street harassment in their lives. 41% of women and 16% of men said they had been physically harassed in some way, such as by being followed, [[exhibitionism|flashed]], or groped.&lt;ref name="SSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsafe and Harassed in Public Spaces|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2014-National-SSH-Street-Harassment-Report.pdf|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=31 October 2014|date=Spring 2014|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators are lone men in 70% of cases for female victims and 48% of cases for male victims; 20% of men who were harassed were the victims of a lone woman.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;  For men, the most common harassment was homophobic or transphobic slurs, followed by unwanted following, then catcalling and comments on body parts.  For women, the most common harassment was catcalling, followed by comments on body parts, unwanted touching or brushing up against, and then sexual slurs like "bitch" or "slut".&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;

For women, most harassment is performed by a total stranger. This comes from a 1990s study from the American Midwest. It was found that numerous women have experienced street harassment on numerous occasions. Another 50% were physically harassed or followed by such strangers. Half of those surveyed revealed this harassment occurred by their 17th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=badf8f6d-512b-410d-a384-25507577cf5e%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=linus.b3207216&amp;db=cat00322a|title=Stop Global Street Harassment|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=2015|website=One Search|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

66% of LGBT respondents in a 2012&lt;!-- note: the data relied upon in this report is from 2012, not 2014 --&gt; [[European Union]] survey said that they avoid [[holding hands]] in public for fear of harassment and assault. 50% said they avoid certain places or locations, and the places they listed as most unsafe to be open about their sexual orientations were "public transport" and "street, square, car parking lot, or other public space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU LGBT survey – European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey – Main results|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-eu-lgbt-survey-main-results_tk3113640enc_1.pdf|publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency]]|accessdate=31 October 2014|pages=87–89|format=pdf|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Stop Street Harassment national survey, LGBT men are 17% more likely to experience physically aggressive harassment and 20% more likely to encounter verbal harassment than heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/lgbt=men=experience=high=rates=of=street=harassment|title=LGBT Men Experience High Rates of Street Harassment|date=June 4, 2014|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|last=Miller|first=Hayley}}{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate survey, verbal harassment was cited as the most common form of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/.|title=Gay and Transgender Discrimination Outside the Workplace|last=Burns|first=Crosby|date=19 July 2011|website=American Progress|archive-url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/|archive-date=19 July 2011|dead-url=No|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were also a significant number of people who were harassed by being denied service or being physically harassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/|title=Gay and Transgender Discrimination Outside the Workplace|last=Burns|first=Crosby|date=19 July 2011|website=Center for American Progress|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample survey of 331 LGBTQ men in 2014 indicated the phenomena occurs worldwide. 90% of them claimed to be harassed in public spaces for their perceived differences. It was mainly their lack of traditionally masculine features that singled them out for abuse. This abuse was mainly aimed at how they did not fit typical gender roles while in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W_tPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Kearl,+Holly.+Stop+Global+Street+Harassment:+Growing+Activism+around+the+World.+ABC-CLIO,+LLC,+2015.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Stop Global Street Harassment|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=2015|website=Google Books|archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_tPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Kearl,+Holly.+Stop+Global+Street+Harassment:+Growing+Activism+around+the+World.+ABC-CLIO,+LLC,+2015.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qd9MCpzHfM&amp;sig=UkMwnWhOerK7yStLjbA6OEwlZ1E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbgdn02bPaAhUJslQKHbuSDfgQ6AEITTAL#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2015|dead-url=No|access-date=11 April 2018|isbn=9781440840210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health effects ===
A study in 2011 was aimed at recording the health effects of street harassment on women and girls. It was found that they were mentally stressed after experiencing street harassment. Poor mental health has been found to be linked to street harassment in addition to paranoia that certain spaces are not safe. The main way the women and girls put a stop to this was reducing the amount of time they spent on the street. However, this negatively impacted their ability to hold down a job or go to where they could receive healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=c3ba0215-5301-45f4-ab6b-d20f2035e2d3%40sessionmgr104|title=Experiences of street harassment and associations with perceptions of social cohesion among women in Mexico City|last=A Campos|first=Paola|date=1 January 2017|website=One Search|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 article, based on Canada's Violence Against Women Survey, showed that past exposure to harassment from strangers is an important factor in women's perceptions of their safety in public. Harassment from a stranger, as opposed to an acquaintance, is more likely to induce fear of sexual victimization.&lt;ref name="JRCD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macmillan|first1=Ross|last2=Nieorbisz|first2=Annette|last3=Welsh|first3=Sandy|title=Experiencing the Streets: Harassment and Perceptions of Safety among Women|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=1 August 2000|volume=37|issue=3|pages=306–322|doi=10.1177/0022427800037003003|url=http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/37/3/306.abstract|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 reported that "the experience of street harassment is directly related to a greater preoccupation with physical appearance and body shame, and is indirectly related to heightened fears of rape. ... Stranger harassment reduces feelings of safety while walking alone at night, using public transportation, walking alone in a parking garage, and while home alone at night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaudoir|first1=Stephenie R.|last2=Quinn|first2=Diane M.|title=Bystander Sexism in the Intergroup Context: The Impact of Cat-calls on Women's Reactions Towards Men|journal=Sex Roles|date=3 March 2010|volume=62|issue=9|pages=623–634|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9735-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
In some cases, men may enjoy the thrill of doing something illegal or taboo, and some may experience sexual gratification from groping, flirting, or sexual humiliation.  Negative remarks can also be the result of [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]].{{citation_needed|reason=I realize this is considered common knowledge in feminist spaces, but someone should at least try to document it properly. Especially since the source cited in the following paragraph argues to the contrary.|date=August 2018}}

Australian reporter Eleanor Gordon-Smith recorded interactions in the 2010s in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales]], and found that men who catcalled women enjoyed getting attention, flirting, and the public performance. The men were also under the impression that the women who were the subject of their remarks and gestures enjoyed the attention and believed they were helping the women have a good time or were giving a compliment about physical appearance that would be appreciated. The vast majority of women in the area, in contrast, found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault. Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.&lt;ref name="this_life"&gt;[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/603/once-more-with-feeling ''This American Life'' Episode 603: Once More, With Feeling Act One: Hollaback Girl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==
[[YouGov]] conducted a poll of about 1,000 Americans in August 2014. In their findings, 72% said it was never appropriate to make a "catcall", 18% said it was sometimes appropriate to catcall, and 2% said it was always acceptable. The majority (55%) labelled catcalling "harassment", while 20% called it "complimentary". Americans in the 18–29 age range were the most likely to categorize catcalling as complimentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Peter|title=Catcalling: Never OK and not a compliment|url=https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/08/15/catcalling/|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of women in the Kings Cross area study found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault.&lt;ref name="this_life" /&gt; In a more representative sample, a 2014 U.S. survey found that 68% of harassed women and 49% of harassed men were "very or somewhat concerned" the situation would escalate.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt; Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.&lt;ref name="this_life" /&gt; The U.S. survey found 31% of women responded by going out with other people instead of alone, and 4% of all victims made a major life change to avoid harassment, like moving or quitting a job.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;

== Representation in media ==
The mainstream media, including any printed, televised, social media or other online information sources, commonly represent sexual and street harassment using overly simplified narratives and delegitimizing language. There exists a tendency in media portrayals of the issue that harassment occurs as a reflection of individual aberration, usually highlighting aspects of misconduct by one party against another.&lt;ref name="Women 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Paula|last2=Charlesworth|first2=Sara|title=Framing Sexual Assault through Media Representations|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=March 2013|volume=37|issue=1|pages=95–103|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2012.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While humanities and feminist scholarship identify any degree of sexual harassment as a manifestation of gendered oppression and discrimination in society, seldom do mainstream media sources report that harassment derives from systemic gender inequality or introduce dialogue in the context of broader issues.&lt;ref name="Women 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Review 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easteal et. al,|first1=Paula|title=Review: Enduring Themes and Silences in Media Portrayals of Violence against Women|journal=Women Studies International Forum|date=January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|pages=103–113|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that mainstream media shapes the public opinion of harassment is by incorporating conservative messages to their audiences, specifically through the use of invalidating rhetoric. As with other forms of oppression against women, the language presented by media sources commonly undermines the validity of street harassment complaints.&lt;ref name="Review 2014" /&gt; The particular overuse of the words, "alleged," "supposed," "expected," immediately create a sense of uncertainty toward claims of harassment and assault, therefore imposing a sense of responsibility and/or guilt on to the victim.&lt;ref name="Review 2014" /&gt;

While the internet, social media specifically, allows a new platform for activism against street harassment, it has become a source of frequent verbal harassment against users. Harassment that victims may face in real life on the streets translates to the online public forum of Twitter. In a case study following a hashtag originating in November 2011, #mencallmethings, primarily female Twitter users posted and discussed examples of the harassment they received online from men.&lt;ref name="Conceptualizing Women 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Megarry|first1=Jessica|title=Online Incivility or Sexual Harassment? Conceptualizing Women's Experiences in the Digital Age|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=November 2014|volume=47|issue=1, part A|pages=46–55|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of this trending hashtag, tweets that were meant to educate, share stories, and create a sense of togetherness between victims often received backlash from the male Twitter user population, demonstrating that on an unmonitored media source women's voices on harassment are again silenced.&lt;ref name="Conceptualizing Women 2014" /&gt;

While internet "trolling" (defined as aggressive online behavior) is prevalent across several internet circles, the manifestation of gendered society which normalizes street harassment, result in a specific type of Internet aggression that feminist scholars label as "gendertrolling."&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mantilla|first1=Karla|title=Gendertrolling: Misogyny Adapts to New Media|journal=Feminist Studies|date=20|issue=2013|page=53|url=electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsglr&amp;AN=edsgcl.350577349&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gendertrolling is thought to be a more threatening form of social media presence, one that aligns with the responses to the #mencallmethings posts. What allows gendertrolling to become destructive to its victims are the prescriptive signs of gender-based insults, hate speech, credible threats, unusual intensity, scope, longevity of attacks, and reaction to women speaking out, all which are similar features of street harassment.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com" /&gt;

==Activism==
Public activism against street harassment has grown since the late 2000s. A group called Stop Street Harassment began as a blog in 2008 and became incorporated as a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|non-profit organization]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides tips for dealing with street harassment in safe and assertive ways, as well as provide opportunities to "take community action". In 2010, Stop Street Harassment started the annual "International Anti-Street Harassment Week". During the third week in April, people from around the globe participated in "marches, rallies, workshops, and sidewalk chalkings" in an effort to gain attention for the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/our-work/meetusonthestreet/|title=International Anti-Street Harassment Week|publisher=Stop Street Harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group called [[Hollaback!]] was founded in 2010.

Activists have made use of [[viral video]]s to publicize the frequency of unsolicited comments that women receive in public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeds|first1=Sarene|title=Jessica Williams Continues Her War Against Catcalls on 'The Daily Show'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/10/03/jessica-williams-continues-her-war-against-catcalls-on-the-daily-show/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hajela |first1=Deepti |title=Viral Video Documents New York Street Harassment |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/viral-video-documents-york-street-harassment-26568112 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News |date=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031005238/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/viral-video-documents-york-street-harassment-26568112 |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One American [[street art]]ist used [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for a campaign called "Stop Telling Women to Smile." The artist posts portraits of herself and other young women accompanied with messages against street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=An Artist Demands Civility on the Street With Grit and Buckets of Paste|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/arts/design/tatyana-fazlalizadeh-takes-her-public-art-project-to-georgia.html|accessdate=4 November 2014|work=New York Times|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Minneapolis]] woman created a set of printable "Cards Against Harassment" (in homage to the game ''[[Cards Against Humanity]]'') that she distributes to street harassers. The cards are meant to explain to street harassers why their comments are unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva|first1=Estey|title=Cards Against Harassment address street harassers directly|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/Modern-Parenthood/2014/0724/Cards-Against-Harassment-address-street-harassers-directly|accessdate=4 November 2014|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Cities Global Initiative created by UN-Habitat in 1996 is an approach to address harassment in public places through partnerships with cities’ communities, local organizations, and municipal governments. Actions taken to address this include improved street designs and lighting in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/2013-un-csw/|title=2013 UN Comission on the Status of Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=28 May 2013|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Commission of the Status of Women (CSW), a subcategory under UN Women, is committed to empowering women and advocating for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw|title=Commission on the Status of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Women|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, it included multiple clauses into their "[http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Agreed Conclusions]" that focused on sexual harassment in public places in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/2013-un-csw/|title=2013 UN Comission on the Status of Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=28 May 2013|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study in ''The'' ''British Journal of Criminology'' examines the extent to which online sites serve as a form of informal justice for street harassment victims. The results show that individuals experience “validation” or “affirmation” after self-disclosing their experiences online and may receive acknowledgement or support by doing so. Notably, some individuals feel re-victimized or experience re-traumatization. It was found that online justice is limited, but in particular for street harassment, it is possible that victims achieve some form of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fileborn|first=Bianca|date=November 2017|title=Justice 2.0: Street harassment victims' use of social media and online activism as sites of informal justice|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/57/6/1482/2698882|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=57|pages=1482–1501|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
In some jurisdiction there are laws that make some forms of street harassment illegal. Peru has had anti-street harassment laws since March 2015.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21651849-crackdown-public-displays-machismo-criminalising-catcallers|title=Criminalising the catcallers|work=The Economist|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quezon City]] in the [[Philippines]], which has a high rate of street harassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Fritzie|title=The streets that haunt Filipino women|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/124993-sexual-harassment-women-streets|accessdate=June 2, 2016|agency=[[Rappler]]|date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented an ordinance against street harassment, such as cat-calling and wolf-whistling, on May 16, 2016. Penalties for acts of street harassment include [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] of [[Philippine peso|Php]] 1,000 to Php 5,000 and a 1-month jail term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sauler|first1=Erika|title=In QC, wolf whistles can land you to jail|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/788539/in-qc-wolf-whistles-can-land-you-in-jail|accessdate=June 2, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the United States, laws regarding street harassment are under the jurisdiction of individual states. In Illinois there are laws that relate to street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SSH-KYR-Illinois.pdf|title=Illinois|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a potential precursor to physical assault and even murder, offensive speech and [[hate speech]] are protected under the [[First Amendment]]. Although a perpetrator is legally allowed to shout obscenities, other acts such as public indecency and sexual assault are blatant violations of the law. Offensive speech and hate speech as forms of street harassment are frequently used as evidence against repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Laura S.|date=2015-03-01|title=Street Harassment: Current and Promising Avenues for Researchers and Activists|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=3|pages=196–211|doi=10.1111/soc4.12248|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public's rejection of criminalizing offensive speech and hate speech in view of the First Amendment poses a challenge for the legal system. Contrary to popular belief, it is not just those who are unaffected by street harassment that hold this ideal; victims and survivors of offensive speech and hate speech are reluctant to advocate against this First Amendment right. Adversely, the public is hesitant to rely on the law in their daily lives as they prefer autonomy, regardless of how grave the situation may be.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2000 1055–1090"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Laura Beth|date=2000|title=Situating Legal Consciousness: Experiences and Attitudes of Ordinary Citizens about Law and Street Harassment|jstor=3115131|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1055–1090|doi=10.2307/3115131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is there a sense of powerlessness when being victimized during street harassment, but also during the legal process. More often than not, plaintiffs are unprepared for litigation and the courtroom as they are inexperienced, to no fault of their own. Quite frequently, plaintiffs are victims of legal aggression via their street harassment perpetrator. Perpetrators will file a frivolous lawsuit in response to their victim's charges. In addition to this, it is difficult to acquire government aid, as seen in the 1994 case when the EEOC received 11,000 harassment complaints and prosecuted fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stambaugh|first=Phoebe Morgan|date=1997|title=The Power of Law and the Sexual Harassment Complaints of Women|jstor=4316504|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=9|issue=2|pages=23–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of interviews conducted by Laura Beth Nielson in 2000, regarding the attitudes of the public in relation to the law and street harassment, four paradigms were offered. The freedom of speech paradigm is based on the ideal of allegiance to the First Amendment's supposed ideology. The autonomy paradigm is based on the desire for self-governance. The impracticality paradigm is based on the impossibility of regulation in regards to offensive speech and hate speech. Lastly, the distrust of authority paradigm is based on the lack of faith in legal officials to enforce laws. These four paradigms exemplify the reasoning behind the lack of criminalization for street harassment.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2000 1055–1090"/&gt;

'''Teenage pregnancy in the United States''' relates to girls under the age of 20 who become [[pregnant]]. 89% of these births take place out-of-wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/1996/08/childrenfamilies-akerlof|title=An Analysis of Out-Of-Wedlock Births in the United States|date=1996-08-01|website=The Brookings Institution|language=en|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, teen pregnancy has declined almost continuously.

[[File:Anti-teenage pregnancy III.jpg|thumb|An anti-teenage pregnancy poster]]

==Pregnancies==
According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 4 out of 5, or 80%, of teenage pregnancies are unintended.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintendedpregnancy/|title=Unintended Pregnancy Prevention {{!}} Unintended Pregnancy  {{!}} Reproductive Health {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, of the majority of pregnancies to adolescent females in the United States, an estimated 60% ended in live birth, 15% ended in miscarriage, and 30% in abortion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/reproductive-health/teen-pregnancy/trends.html|title=The Office of Adolescent Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|website=Office of Adolescent Health|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, there were 104,700 maternal hospital stays for pregnant teens; the number of hospital stays for teen pregnancies decreased by 47 percent from 2000-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Witt WP, Wiess AJ, Elixhauser A | title =  Overview of Hospital Stays for Children in the United States, 2012 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #186 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = December 2014 | url =https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb187-Hospital-Stays-Children-2012.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 249,078 babies were born to women aged 15 – 19 years old. This is a birth rate of 24.2 per 1000 women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm|title=About Teen Pregnancy {{!}} Teen Pregnancy {{!}} Reproductive Health {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most adolescents who give birth are over the age of 18. In 2014, 73% of teen births occurred in 18-19 year olds. Pregnancies are much less common among girls younger than 15. In 2008, 6.6 pregnancies occurred per 1,000 teens aged 13–14. In other words, fewer than 1% of teens younger than 15 became pregnant in 2008.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; Pregnant teenagers tend to gain less weight than older mothers, due to the fact that they are still growing and fighting for nutrients with the baby during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=X.-K.|last2=Wen|first2=S.

Teen pregnancy is defined as pregnancies in women under the age of 20, regardless of marital status. Teen pregnancy rates have dropped 9% since 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Between 1991 and 2014, teenage birth rates dropped 61% nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenationalcampaign.org/data/compare/1678|title=Data|website=thenationalcampaign.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenage [[birth rate]]s, as opposed to pregnancies, peaked in 1991, when there were 61.8 births per 1,000 teens, and the rate dropped in 17 of the 19 years that followed.&lt;ref name="birth slide"/&gt; 3 in 10 American girls will get pregnant before age 20. That are almost 750,000 pregnancies a year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-teen-pregnancy|title=11 Facts About Teen Pregnancy {{!}} DoSomething.org {{!}} Volunteer for Social Change|website=www.dosomething.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 89% of teenage births occur outside of marriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of all women, 16% will be teen mothers.&lt;ref name="pregEthnic"/&gt; The largest increases in unintended pregnancies were found among women who were cohabiting, had lower education, and low income.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==By ethnicity==

Black, Latina, and American Indian youth experience the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;  Studies show that Asians (23 per 1,000) and whites (43 per 1,000)&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pregEthnic"/&gt; have lower rates of pregnancy before the age of 20.  The pregnancy rate among black teens decreased 48% between 1990 and 2008, more than the overall U.S. teen pregnancy rate declined during the same period (42%).&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  The teen birth rate decline broken down by race in 2014 from 2013:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* 7% for Non-Hispanic Whites
* 11% for Non-Hispanic Blacks
* 9% Hispanic
* 11% Asian/Pacific Islander

Teen birth rates in the United States are higher than that of many other developed countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2013, the lowest birth rates were reported in the Northeast, while the highest rates were located in the south east.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, a 2001 study by UNICEF found that the US teenage birth rate was the highest among 28 OECD nations in the review;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt; in a 1999 comparison by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], U.S. teen pregnancy and teen birth rates were the second-highest among the 46 developed countries studied.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Pregnancy and childbearing levels and trends in developed countries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalis" /&gt;  In 2002, the U.S. was rated 84th out of 170 [[World Health Organization]] member countries based on teenage fertility rate.&lt;ref name="WHO Stat" /&gt;

Sexually active teens in the US are less likely to use any contraceptive method, including [[condoms]], and are especially less likely to use highly effective [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal methods]], primarily the pill, than their peers in other countries. Among adolescents who had sex in the past month: almost 25% of males and 40% of females did not use a condom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The research also found that US teens who become pregnant are less likely to choose abortion. This could be due to the fact that the resources for abortions are not readily available. 75% of women in rural areas have to drive at least 50 miles for abortion services.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsyoursexlife.com/pregnancy/article/teen-moms-abortion-stats-you-should-know|title=Teen Moms + Abortion: Stats You Should Know |website=www.itsyoursexlife.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 87% of United States counties do not have an abortion provider.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Parenting as a teenager==

There were 334,000 births among girls aged 19 or younger in 2011, representing 8% of all
U.S. births.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  Births to teen mothers peaked in 1991 at 62 births per 1,000 girls. This rate was halved by 2011 when there were 31 births per 1,000 girls.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; About 25% of teenage mothers have a second child within 24 months of the first birth.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scaany.org/documents/teen_pregnancy_dec08.pdf|title=Teenage Births: Outcomes for Young Parents and Their Children|date=December 2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenagers are becoming better contracepters because they realize that their sexual partners may not be a reliable coparent. Marriage rates over the 1990s through the 2010s with teenagers has drastically declined because of this realization. Since contraception has become more obtainable for teenagers, they are preventing unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Furstenberg 33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furstenberg|first=Frank|date=2016-11-01|title=Reconsidering Teenage Pregnancy and Parenthood|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/6/4/33|journal=Societies|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=33|doi=10.3390/soc6040033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For every 1,000 black boys in the United States, 29 of them are fathers, compared to 14 per 1,000 white boys.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  The rate of teen fatherhood declined 36% between 1991 and 2010, from 25 to 16 per 1,000 males aged 15–19. This decline was more substantial among blacks than among whites (50% vs. 26%) and about half of the rate among teen girls.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; Nearly 80% of teenage fathers do not marry the teenage mother of their child.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teenshelter.org/Jims_Statistics_on_Teenage_Pregnancy_11-11-06.pdf|title=Statistics on Teenage Pregnancy|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenage fathers have 10-15% lower annual earnings than teenagers who do not father children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Most female teens report that they would be very upset (58%) or a little upset (29%) if they got pregnant, while the remaining 13% report that they would be a little or very pleased.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  Most male teens report that they would be very upset (47%) or a little upset (34%) if they got someone pregnant, while the remaining 18% report that they would be a little or very pleased.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;

Parenting as a teenager has detrimental effects on the children. Children born to teenage mothers are more likely to: be born prematurely, 50% more likely to repeat a grade, live in poverty, and suffer higher rates of abuse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The sons of teen mothers are 13% more likely to end up incarcerated, and the daughters of teenage mothers are 22% more likely to become teenage mothers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More than 25% of teen mothers live in poverty during their 20s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Teenage pregnancy imposes lasting hardships on two generations: mother and child. Evidence from U.S. studies show that women who bear their first child at an early age bear more children rapidly and have more unwanted and out-of-wedlock births. Children of teenage parents are more likely to have lower academic achievements and tend to repeat the cycle of early marriage and early childbearing of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Wendy S. "Babies Having Babies. (Cover Story)." ''Women In Business'' 42.4 (1990): 18-20. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Great Recession, young people take three times longer to gain financial independence than it took for young people three decades ago. It is much harder for teenage parents to be able to support a family compared to the past due to the competitive work environment.&lt;ref name="Furstenberg 33"/&gt;

==Supporting teenage parents==
More than 50% of teenage mothers do not graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some high schools in the United States offer a program for pregnant and parenting teens to continue their education. These are sometimes referred to as "Teen Parent Programs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/local_news/article_551867df-5905-51de-8c65-aa26244343a8.html|title=Teen Parenting Program aims to keep young mothers in school|work=Valley Morning Star|author=Martinez, D. |date=February 7, 2009|accessdate=29 April 2016|quote=Saenz said the program, which follows a TEA curriculum, reaches out to girls and boys from middle school to high school who are facing a pregnancy to educate them about the parenting process, resources, federal programs and continuing their education.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several benefits to these school based programs, the number one benefit being teens are able to continue their high school education. Studies have shown that when teen parents stay in school after being pregnant, they have a better chance of graduating high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sadler L. S., Swartz M. K., Ryan-Krause P., Seitz V., Meadows-Oliver M., Grey M., Clemmens D. A. | year = 2007 | title = Promising Outcomes in Teen Mothers Enrolled in a School-Based Parent Support Program and Child Care Center | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 121–130 | doi = 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2007.00181.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 2% of teen moms earn a college degree by age 30.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many of these programs offer on-campus childcare. Some even require the pregnant and parenting teens to attend parenting classes or practicum classes. The parenting classes offer a place for these young parents to learn about the basic needs of a child. While, the practicum classes offer a hands on experience caring for the children in the childcare center.

Statistics show that less than 10% of teen parents earn their high school diploma by their eighteenth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/031912p24.shtml|title = Keep Teen Mom's In School- A School Social Work|last = Van Pelt|first = Jennifer|date = March–April 2012|website = Social Work Today|publisher =|access-date = March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are trying to change those statistics. Currently (2016), San Diego County has 7 high schools that offer these teen parent programs.

== Prevention ==
The United States has the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|date=2011-10-14|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e24658|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3194801|pmid=22022362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two primary reasons given by teenagers for not using protection is that the chance of becoming pregnant is small, and the failure to anticipate intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trussell|first=James|date=Spring 2017|title=Teenage Pregnancy in the United States|url=|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=6|pages=|doi=10.2307/2135482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teen pregnancies can be prevented. The best method of reducing the consequences of teenage parenthood is by providing reproductive health services to prevent teenagers from becoming pregnant in the first place.&lt;ref name="Furstenberg 33"/&gt;  Prevention can not only be beneficial on a micro level but it is also beneficial on a more macro scale. Nationally, teen pregnancies cost tax payers an average of $9.4 billion each year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These costs are associated with health care, foster care, criminal justice, public assistance and lost tax revenue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Teen pregnancies can be prevented by increasing access and education on the proper use of contraceptives,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as parental involvement. The best method of prevention is to integrate sex and STD education into the middle and high school science curriculum as well as addressing the effects of teenage pregnancies in the social studies curriculum.

== International comparison ==

[[File:Teenage birth rate per 1000 women 15–19, 2000-09.svg|thumb|450px|The teenage birth rate per 1,000 women aged 15–19, 2000–2009.&lt;ref name=ustats-births&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2009-2010/Table10.pdf Live births by age of mother and sex of child bred, general and age-specific fertility rates: latest available year, 2000–2009] — United Nations Statistics Division – Demographic and Social Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are large differences in adolescent pregnancy rates among developed nations like Canada, France, Great Britain, Sweden and the United States. The United States has the highest number of teen pregnancies and the highest number of STD’s compared to the other four countries. In France and Sweden during the late '90s, pregnancies were 20 per 1,000 women at ages 15–19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darroch|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Singh|first2=Susheela|last3=Frost|first3=Jennifer|title=Differences in Teenage Pregnancy Rates Among Five Developed Countries: The Roles of Sexual Activity and Contraceptive Use|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2001/11/differences-teenage-pregnancy-rates-among-five-developed-countries-roles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada and Great Britain the levels were twice that, and the United States the level was  4 times as high with 84 per 1,000 teenage women pregnant. The likelihood of pregnant teenage girls having abortions across the four countries differ and exclude miscarriages. In the U.S. abortion rates for 15–19 years are 35% while in Sweden it was 69%. Leaving Great Britain with 39%, Canada with 46% and France with 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darroch|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Singh|first2=Susheela|last3=Frost|first3=Jennifer|title=Differences in Teenage Pregnancy Rates Among Five Developed Countries: The Roles of Sexual Activity and Contraceptive Use|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2001/11/differences-teenage-pregnancy-rates-among-five-developed-countries-roles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the U.S. teen pregnancy rate is higher because of the prevalence of abstinence-only sex education. As a result, these adolescents are not fully aware of how to respond to sexual activity if it comes their way. The mentality of some education systems in the U.S. have the idea that if they do not teach safe sex, adolescents will refrain from sex{{Citation needed|reason=This reads like the author's conjecture/opinion, not an established fact. Overly conversational tone, citation reeded|date=July 2017}}. As the data concludes from above that compared to the other developed countries the U.S. is four times as likely to have a teen pregnancy. Yet the U.S. also uses less contraceptive, has more abortions{{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed for claim that the US has more abortions than "the other developed countries"|date=July 2017}} and more prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases than the other developed countries. 

In the U.S. all states are involved in sex education, but each state has differences in what they teach. Some states choose to go in detail others just cover the bases. Which include 39 states that require “some” education related to sexuality. There are 21 states that are required by law to teach sexuality and STD education. 17 states only require the teaching of STDs and not sexual education. There are also 11 states that have no requirement and leave it up to that state to decide whether or not they teach sex education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex and HIV Education|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern decline ==
Although there is a noticeable decline in U.S. teen pregnancy, the current rate is still 2-4 times more than in Canada, France, Great Britain, and Sweden. The biggest difference in the rate of pregnancies in the United States compared to the other countries is that in America there is a very high unintended pregnancy rate. This unintended pregnancy rate is higher than the total teenage pregnancy rate in all of the four countries.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darroch|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Singh|first2=Susheela|last3=Frost|first3=Jennifer|title=Differences in Teenage Pregnancy Rates Among Five Developed Countries: The Roles of Sexual Activity and Contraceptive Use|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2001/11/differences-teenage-pregnancy-rates-among-five-developed-countries-roles|website=Guttmacher Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 there was a rate of 57 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15–19. Most of those women reported that it was an unplanned pregnancy. This shows a 15% drop in pregnancies from 2008 to 2010. There is a huge decline in adolescent pregnancy for the nation as a whole. The cause of these declines are from abstaining from sex or better use of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="guttmacher.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boonstra|first1=Heather|title=What Is Behind the Declines in Teen Pregnancy Rates?|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/20what-behind-declines-teen-pregnancy-rates|website=Guttmacher Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates among younger teens ages 15–17 have also fallen faster – dropping by 50%, compared with a 39% decline among older teens ages 18 and 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Eileen |author2=Gretchen Livingston |title=Why is the teen birth rate falling? |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/29/why-is-the-teen-birth-rate-falling/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |date= 29 April 2016 |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have concluded that these declines stem from improvement in use of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="guttmacher.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12084">The [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]] [[Instant messaging|instant messaging service]] has more than 50 million users in Iran&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43907246 Iran blocks video and images on Telegram messaging app - BBC.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of the country's Internet's bandwidth is spent on using this app.&lt;ref name="ایسنا 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=تلگرام ۶۰ درصد پهنای باند کشور را اشغال کرد | website=ایسنا | date=September 18, 2017 | url=https://www.isna.ir/news/96062715757/تلگرام-۶۰-درصد-پهنای-باند-کشور-را-اشغال-کرد | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the disruptions caused by the Iranian government in the [[Viber]]&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری فارس 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=موج مهاجرت کاربران تلفن همراه از وایبر به تلگرام/ فرصت مغتنم برای پیام‌رسان‌های ایرانی | website=خبرگزاری فارس | date=May 5, 2015 | url=http://www.farsnews.com/news/13940215000378 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="انتخاب 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=انتخاب | first=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی | title=وایبر هم بالاخره فیلتر شد | website=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی انتخاب &amp;#124; Entekhab.ir | date=May 14, 2014 | url=http://www.entekhab.ir/fa/news/161368 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Line (software)|Line]] services, the Iranian people were attracted to Telegram.&lt;ref name="تبیان 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=تبیان | first=موسسه فرهنگی و اطلاع‌رسانی | title=از وایبر به تلگرام | website=سایت مؤسسه فرهنگی و اطلاع‌رسانی تبیان | date=February 21, 2017 | url=https://article.tebyan.net/296339/از-وایبر-به-تلگرام | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security was the most important reason that led to this immigration. Additionally, this service permitted exchanging files up to 1 gigabyte.&lt;ref name="آی تی رسان 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=آی تی رسان | website=آی تی رسان | date=June 29, 2015 | url=https://itresan.com/ | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ایسنا"&gt;{{cite web | title=جنگ وایبر با تلگرام | website=ایسنا | url=https://www.isna.ir/news/96071708740/جنگ-وایبر-با-تلگرام | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Islamic Republic of Iran]] has repeatedly considered the topic of blocking access to Telegram and has always imposed limitations on users' access. During the [[2017–18 Iranian protests|protests on December 8, 2017]], Telegram was blocked for more than a week and finally became available again on December 23, 2017.&lt;ref name="آخرین خبر &amp;#124; در کوتاهترین زمان بروزترین باشید 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=آخرین خبر - تلگرام مختل شد یا فیلتر؟ | website=آخرین خبر &amp;#124; در کوتاهترین زمان بروزترین باشید | date=June 6, 2018 | url=http://akharinkhabar.com/Pages/News.aspx?id=2181875 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="زومیت 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=مدیر عامل تلگرام: ایران از چهارشنبه دسترسی به تلگرام را محدود کرده است &amp;#91;بروزرسانی: پاسخ وزارت ارتباطات&amp;#93; | website=زومیت | date=October 21, 2015 | url=http://www.zoomit.ir/it-news/internet-network/25217-telegram-banned-iran | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ايران 1 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=ايران | first=عصر | title=5 نکته درباره شایعه فیلترینگ "تلگرام" | website=عصر ايران | date=June 6, 2018 | url=http://www.asriran.com/fa/news/425508 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reblocked on May 10, 2017 by judicial authorities. In the judicial order of the Tehran Prosecutor's Office, it was said that Telegram must be blocked by [[internet service provider|ISPs]] in such a way that it could not be achieved even with tools similar to [[VPN]]s.&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری 2باشگاه خبرنگاران 2018"&gt;{{cite web | author=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران | title=پایان کار تلگرام در ایران اعلام شد | website=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران &amp;#124; آخرین اخبار ایران و جهان &amp;#124; YJC | date=April 30, 2018 | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/6518604 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-time experience of blocking Telegram in Iran shows that Iranian users did not migrate to alternative services, such as the foreign [[WhatsApp]], or the domestic [[Soroush messenger]], but resorted to [[Internet censorship circumvention]].&lt;ref name="Khodabakhshi 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Khodabakhshi | first=Leyla | title=کاربران ایرانی بعد از فیلتر شدن تلگرام چه می‌کنند؟ | website=BBC Persian | date=May 3, 2018 | url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-43995921 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying request==
On 20 October 2015, [[Paul Durov]], [[CEO]] of Telegram LLC said, after denying the request of Iranian authorities for private information about citizens of the country, Telegram was blocked for hours in [[Iran]], but it was unblocked afterwards.&lt;ref name="BBC Persian 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=تلگرام 'پس از عدم همکاری با دولت ایران موقتا مسدود شد' | website=BBC Persian | date=October 20, 2015 | url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran/2015/10/151019_u04_telegram_iran | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavel Durov wrote an answer letter and announced that "Iranian authorities want to use Telegram to spy on their citizens. We can not help them in this regard."&lt;ref name="BBC Persian 2015" /&gt;

Following the Iranian government policy to censor every [[social network]] and instant messaging service in Iran, they have continued to disrupt access to Telegram. On Saturday, 19 May 2015, the telecommunication company of Iran blocked Telegram access in some parts of the [[Tehran province]] and some other provinces without prior notice.&lt;ref name="ITIRAN 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=تلگرام در آستانه فیلترشدن؟ | website=ITIRAN | date=May 1, 2018 | url=http://itiran.com/d/68654 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="انتخاب 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=انتخاب | first=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی | title=مخابرات تلگرام را مسدود کرد | website=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی انتخاب &amp;#124; Entekhab.ir | date=May 10, 2015 | url=http://www.entekhab.ir/fa/news/203390 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one day after Telegram introduced the voice call feature in the messenger, the voice call functionality was completely blocked in Iran.&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری 3 باشگاه خبرنگاران 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران | title=دلیل فیلترشدن تماس صوتی تلگرام در ایران | website=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران &amp;#124; آخرین اخبار ایران و جهان &amp;#124; YJC | date=April 17, 2017 | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/6051361 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Durov wrote in response to users who had asked about voice calls problems in Iran: "Internet service providers in Iran have blocked it again."&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری 1 باشگاه خبرنگاران 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران | title=دلیل فیلترشدن تماس صوتی تلگرام در ایران | website=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران &amp;#124; آخرین اخبار ایران و جهان &amp;#124; YJC | date=April 17, 2017 | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/6051361 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Twitter 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Pavel Durov on Twitter | website=Twitter | date=May 24, 2018 | url=https://twitter.com/durov/status/854700486989107200 | language=la | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low cost of calling using this feature and the subsequent financial losses incurred by the telecommunication network operators, including the stated-owned [[Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran]], may have motivated the block,&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران | title=مکالمه صوتی تلگرام به صورت کامل مسدود شد + دلیل مسدود سازی | website=خبرگزاری باشگاه خبرنگاران &amp;#124; آخرین اخبار ایران و جهان &amp;#124; YJC | date=April 17, 2017 | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/6050736 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although public relations of [[MTN Irancell]] announced that the operator has played no role in the disruption of the service.&lt;ref name="ايران 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=ايران | first=عصر | title=تماس صوتی تلگرام نیامده فیلتر شد؟! | website=عصر ايران | date=June 6, 2018 | url=http://www.asriran.com/fa/news/533724 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2017–18 Iranian protests|nationwide protests in Iran]] in 2017 and 2018, and to prevent rioting, the [[Supreme National Security Council|Supreme National Security Council of Iran]] decided to cut off all [[social network]]s, including Telegram,&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری ایلنا 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=تلگرام فیلتر شده است؟/طبیعی است که دست به محدودیت بزنیم | website=خبرگزاری ایلنا | date=June 6, 2018 | url=https://www.ilnanews.com/بخش-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%B1-6/577062-%D8%AA%D9%84%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D8%B7%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B9%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%85 | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was said to be temporary.&lt;ref name="خبرگزاری ایلنا12 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=فیلتر تلگرام موقتی است | website=خبرگزاری ایلنا | date=June 6, 2018 | url=https://www.ilnanews.com/بخش-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-3/577484-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%84%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of January 23, 2017, the block was lifted.&lt;ref name="روزنامک 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=بازتاب جهانی رفع فیلتر تلگرام - روزنامک | website=روزنامک | date=January 14, 2018 | url=http://www.rouznamak.ir/2018/01/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b2%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%a8-%d8%ac%d9%87%d8%a7%d9%86%db%8c-%d8%b1%d9%81%d8%b9-%d9%81%db%8c%d9%84%d8%aa%d8%b1-%d8%aa%d9%84%da%af%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%85/ | language=fa | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euronews 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=پیام‌رسان تلگرام در ایران رفع فیلتر شد | website=euronews | date=January 13, 2018 | url=http://fa.euronews.com/2018/01/13/iran-relived-telegram-messanger-ban | language=ar | access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kazimierz Dolny July 2013 042.JPG|thumb|A toilet service in silver]]

A '''toilet service''' is a set of objects for use at the [[Lowboy|dressing table]]. The term is usually reserved for large luxury sets from the 17th to 19th centuries, with "toilet set" used for later or simpler sets.  Historically, services were made in metal, ceramics, and other materials, for both men and women, though male versions were generally much smaller.  The rich had services in gold, silver, or [[silver-gilt]]. The contents vary, but typically include a mirror, one or more small [[ewer]]s and basins, two candlesticks, and an assortment of bowls, boxes, caskets, and other containers.&lt;ref&gt;MOS&lt;/ref&gt; One or more brushes and a pin-cushion, often as a top to a box, are often included.  The sets usually came with a custom-made travelling case, and some services were especially designed for travelling.

The toilet service was the most important item of "dressing plate", as opposed to table plate, and was often a gift upon marriage;&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 76, 98&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes augmented on the birth of children.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;  It was normally the personal property of the wife. The morning [[Levée (ceremony)|levée]] was sometimes a semi-public occasion for great persons in the [[early modern period]], and the toilet service might be seen by many people.&lt;ref&gt;Glory, 7–8; Adlin, 5–7.  Adlin gives [[Madame de Pompadour]] much of the credit for this, but for example Hogarth's ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette]]'' is from 1743, before she became at all notable at court. See also [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/washbowl-bearing-arms-duchess-orleans-legitimate-daughter-louis-xiv-and-madame-de-mon the Louvre "washbowl" page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[toilet]] comes from the French ''toile'' meaning cloth, and ''toilette'' ("little cloth") first came to mean the morning routine of washing, tidying hair, and shaving and making up as appropriate, from the cloth often spread on the dressing-table where this was done. This meaning spread into English as "toilet" in the 17th century; only later did "toilet" start to compete with "lavatory" as a [[euphemism]].  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records "toilet" in English first, from 1540, as a term for a cloth used to wrap clothes in, then from 1662 (by [[John Evelyn]]) for a gold toilet service, and before 1700 for a range of related meanings (a towel, the cloth on a dressing-table, the act of using a dressing-table, and so on), but not for a lavatory, which did not come into use until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Toilet"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Johan Zoffany - Queen Charlotte (1744-1818) with her Two Eldest Sons - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Detail of ''Queen Charlotte with her Two Eldest Sons'', [[Johan Zoffany]], 1765, ([[:File:Johan Zoffany - Queen Charlotte (1744-1818) with her Two Eldest Sons - Google Art Project.jpg|the whole painting]])]]
The contents of a service were variable but the classical grouping had as its largest piece the mirror, usually decorated at the top with some form of crest. In the 17th century these were rectangular, usually oblongs in "portrait" format, though the Louvre mirror and the Lennoxlove service use a "landscape" format. The frame normally had a wooden framework holding the glass, over which the metal was fitted.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre; MOS&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century oval mirrors began to be used, and later the introduction of dressing tables with built-in mirrors was part of the decline from fashion of the toilet service. Depictions in art, such as the Zoffany of [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], wife of George III, usually show that the elaborate crest at the top of the mirror has disappeared beneath the lace covers spreading to the sides, which are probably tied round it.  These were used to pull over the service on its table when it was not in use, or when husbands or other inconvenient visitors appeared in the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;Schroder&lt;/ref&gt;

The service usually contained two fairly small candlesticks, allowing the face to be lit from below.  There may also be "hand-candles", "chamber candles" or "chamber sticks", short, with a wide saucer-like base and a loop or handle. These were the last lights to be put out at night, and were carried in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 209&lt;/ref&gt; Candlestick makers (who always used [[casting]]) were treated as a speciality within silversmithing, and the candlesticks may be made by different workshops from the other pieces, as may any snuffers, also regarded as a speciality.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 99; MOS&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marriage A-la-Mode 4, The Toilette - William Hogarth (cropped).jpg|thumb|Detail of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette]]'', 1743]]

The service often contains one or a pair of ewer and basin sets for washing.  There is normally a number of other vessels of various sizes and shapes, some covered and others not, which go by a great variety of names, and whose purpose was perhaps always rather undefined.  A variety of brushes might be included, and sometimes a small bell. In the 18th century glass and porcelain items might be mixed in with the silver ones. Services also might contain food plates and cutlery (usually just for one) for breakfast or snacks in the bedroom or dressing-room, or when travelling.  One large type of bowl is connected with oatmeal, though it seems this might either be made into a facial, or eaten as [[porridge]] (or both, with a pair).&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 99; Louvre; MOS; Glory, 7–8; Taylor, 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;   Descriptions include items such as comb-boxes, glove-trays, soap-boxes, low [[tazze]] (or "waiters"), salvers, [[ecuelle]]s (small bowls with two handles) and others. The 48-piece German Schenk von Stauffenberg service (1740s, now [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) contains several items for food and drink, including a [[teapot]], and also items for writing, such as an [[inkstand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=Schenk+von+Stauffenberg Schenk von Stauffenberg service], German, 1740s, Metropolitan Museum of Art; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G-akfb80yFEC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Philippe de Montebello and the Metropolitan Museum of Art: 1977–2008'', p. 55], James R. Houghton, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The male service was much simpler, typically consisting of a shaving-bowl (oval, with a crescent cut out at one side), ewer and basin, a soap-box, toothbrush holder, perhaps a tongue-scraper and some boxes and bowls.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 98; Bennion, 294–302; Glory, 122&lt;/ref&gt;  These started later, in the 18th-century, when men began to shave themselves, or have a servant do it, rather than requiring a quasi-medical [[barber surgeon]] specialist.&lt;ref&gt;Adlin, 10, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mundus Muliebris'', a satire on fashionable ladies published in 1700, by [[Mary Evelyn]], the daughter of [[John Evelyn]] (or by him, or both of them),&lt;ref&gt;Sources disagree&lt;/ref&gt; the toilet service was described. Although by no means an insider at court, Evelyn was able to see the queen's toilet service and his diary records his admiring comments.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 159&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem:

&lt;poem&gt;:A new Scene to us next presents,
:The Dressing-Room, and Implements,
:Of Toilet Plate Gilt, and Emboss'd,
:And several other things of Cost:
:The Table Miroir, one Glue Pot,
:One for Pomatum, and what not?
:Of Washes, Unguents, and Cosmeticks,
:A pair of Silver Candlesticks;
:Snuffers, and Snuff-dish, Boxes more,
:For Powders, Patches, Waters store,
:In silver Flasks or Bottles, Cups
:Cover'd, or open to wash Chaps;...&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenwriters.library.emory.edu/content.php?level=div&amp;id=evelyn_003&amp;document=evelyn Emory Women Writers Resource Project, ''Mundus Muliebris: Or, The Ladies Dressing-Room Unlock'd, and her Toilette Spread''], an electronic edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

In the 18th-century special dressing-tables with a fitted mirror began to be made, so removing the need for the traditional centrepiece of a service.&lt;ref&gt;Adlin, 5–9, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  Men also had special shaving tables, often on long legs for shaving standing up.&lt;ref&gt;Adlin, 10, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The full toilette did not always occur at the start of the day, but might be before going out or having a formal meal. In the Zoffany portrait of Queen Charlotte above: "... Father Time appears scythe-bearing on the clock, but the face reads exactly 2.30pm, which means that the Princes have finished their dinner (which since November 1764 they had taken at 2.00pm) and are visiting their mother, after she has dressed (a process which began at 1.00pm), while their governess waits in the room beyond. The Queen will dine with the King at exactly 4.00pm."&lt;ref&gt;"Text adapted from ''The Conversation Piece: Scenes of fashionable life'', London, 2009", at  [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/400146/queen-charlotte-1744-1818-with-her-two-eldest-sons "Johan Joseph Zoffany (Frankfurt 1733-London 1810), Queen Charlotte (1744–1818) with her Two Eldest Sons  c.1765"] on the Royal Collection website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and style==

[[File:1695 Tobias Baurs Reiseservice mit Koffer anagoria.JPG|thumb|German travelling toilet service, 1695]]

Earlier examples of the component pieces existed, as is clear from documentary records and stray surviving pieces, but the toilet service as a large matching set of pieces seems to become common among the rich in the 17th century, and especially the France of [[Louis XIV]].  Sets of ewers and basins such as the [[Lomellini Ewer and Basin]] were a staple of display plate well before this, but the many paintings of the ''Toilet of Venus'', for example by [[Rubens]], show that until about 1650 even goddesses used mirrors with wooden frames.  Although many were made, very few Louis XIV toilet services survive, and these are all ones that left France quickly, and escaped the very effective drives at the end of Louis's reign to get the nobility to donate their plate to help pay for the ruinous [[Nine Years' War]] and [[War of the Spanish Succession]].  Exiled [[Huguenot]] silversmiths helped to spread French styles in England and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;MOS&lt;/ref&gt;  Once established, the characteristic types of pieces changed little, but their style followed general fashions in the decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic decoration with the [[coat of arms]] of the owner was very common. This could be engraved, or on small cast pieces attached to the main vessel by bolts. This method made it easier to change the heraldry if a service changed hands to a different family, and is used on the Lennoxlove and other services.&lt;ref&gt;MOS; Glanville, 202-04&lt;/ref&gt;  It is clear that many services were mainly made up from standard designs, perhaps often available from a silversmith's stock, and often built up taking some individual pieces from other silversmiths working with the same designs.  Moulds were also lent between workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 99; Snodin, 125&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century [[pattern book]]s became important, initially mostly French, but later originating in England and other countries; these supplemented earlier drawings and individual prints.  The sophisticated and complicated designs of the [[Rococo]] accelerated this process.&lt;ref&gt;MOS; Snodin, 28-32, 122-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for heraldic animals, [[putti]] and decorative masks, figurative decoration was relatively unusual until the advent of porcelain or enamel in the 18th century, but a group of English services of the 1680s use the same [[plaquette]] designs, of uncertain origin, on the tops of round and rectangular boxes, as well as elaborate cast and chased decoration of foliage and putti. These are a service (London 1683) once in the collection of [[J.P. Morgan]], now in the [[Al Tajir]] collection, the Calverly service in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and another.&lt;ref&gt;Glory, 60–61; Expert, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The English [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Sackville]] service of about 1750 ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]) has several pieces decorated with scenes of lovers in landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/14-piece-toilet-service-271999 The Sackville service], about 1750, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nécessaire de voyage (8273755837).jpg|thumb|''Nécessaire de voyage'', given by Napoleon I to his Empress, Paris, 1810]]

A few services survive in the very different technique of Asian [[filigree]], with scrolling filigree decoration applied to plain silver beneath, or left as [[openwork]]. These are concentrated in the [[Hermitage Museum]] and [[Burghley House]] in England.  They appear to come from China, and India in the case of one of the Hermitage services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artwis.com/articles/silver-wonders-from-the-east/2/ the Hermitage services], [http://www.burghley.co.uk/collections/collection/a-silver-filigree-toilet-service/ Burghley House service known as "Queen Elizabeth's toilet service"], [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=925897 Chistie's lot details]&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In the 18th century services continued to be made, with both the Rococo and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles lending themselves well to dressing plate.  By the mid-century the large service was falling somewhat out of fashion, and fewer were made.  The depiction of the toilette in [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette]]'' (1743), with a mirror larger than in any surviving example, is disapproving,&lt;ref&gt;Schroder; Adlin, 9&lt;/ref&gt; and one of many satirical accounts and caricatures.&lt;ref&gt;Adlin, 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time the development of dressing tables with integral mirrors, and porcelain vessels, represented an alternative style of toilet equipment.  The silver-gilt Neoclassical service made in London in 1779, now in Sweden (illustrated at top) is a late English example, and [[Philippa Glanville]] describes the Zoffany portrait of Queen Charlotte as showing "almost the latest flourish of the silver toilet service",&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 100, quoted&lt;/ref&gt; although George III gave her another service a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;Expert, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Older services continued to be in demand, and the [[provenance]] of several surviving examples shows them being bought and sold, presumably for continued use (see the Shireburn/Norfolk service below).  Several services were created from pieces by several different makers from a range of years, as can be seen from their [[hallmark]]s; for example the Lennoxlove service contains hallmarks from a period of some 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;MOS; Snodin, 125; Taylor, 211&lt;/ref&gt;  A service in the [[Royal Collection]] was created in 1824–25 for [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Frederick, Duke of York]], mostly using pieces a century or more old, supplemented by some contemporary ones and a new case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/50478/toilet-service "Edward Farrell, Toilet service, hallmarks 1699–1824"], Royal Collection, RCIN 50478&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porcelain==
Porcelain services were produced from the 18th century onwards. Initially the grandest examples were hardly less expensive than silver. What was probably [[Madame de Pompadour]]'s [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres porcelain]] service of 1763 is in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London.  She died the following year and the service was probably incomplete and never delivered. Lacking a mirror, it has three pairs of containers and two brushes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=71965&amp;viewType=detailView Wallace Collection page]&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]], wife of the future Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]] visited Paris in 1782 under a thin [[Anonymity|incognito]] as the "Comtesse du Nord", Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] gave her a Sèvres toilet service that cost 75,000 livres, though this included decoration in a complicated technique using gold foil, enamel and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Another large service in [[Meissen porcelain]] with gold mounts was given to [[Maria Amalia of Saxony]], Queen of Naples and later of Spain, by her mother [[Maria Josepha of Austria]] in 1747, to celebrate the birth of her son.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy-Geiger, 237–238; Bonhams lot details, [https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19483/lot/8/ "A Meissen gold-mounted oval snuff box from the toilet service for Queen Maria Amalia Christina of Naples and Sicily, Princess of Saxony, circa 1745–47"]&lt;/ref&gt;  A service in [[Vincennes porcelain]] with Parisian gold mounts was apparently intended as a diplomatic gift to [[Constantinople]] in the mid-1750s, but was never completed, perhaps because Franco-Turkish relations deteriorated.  A casket survives in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultLightboxView/result.t2.collection_lightbox.$TspTitleLink$0.link&amp;sp=10&amp;sp=Scollection&amp;sp=SfieldValue&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=2&amp;sp=Slightbox_3x4&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=F&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=1 "Six plaques mounted in a coffer; Plaques 'de coffre' of the second size"], Wallace Collection&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bathing Kit of Napoléon Bonaparte IMG 1922.JPG|thumb|Shaving and bathing set of [[Napoleon]]]]

[[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Mintons|Minton porcelain]] service, given as a Christmas present by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1853, remains on display in her dressing-room at [[Osbourne House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/15/collection/34627/scent-bottle-holder "Scent-bottle holder, c.1853, RCIN 34627"], Royal Collection website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Battersea enamel]] was also used for toilet items; the [[Royal Collection]] has a set of 7 rectangular "toilet boxes" from c. 1765, painted with pastoral landscapes around Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/2/collection/22385/set-of-toilet-boxes "Set of toilet boxes, circa 1765, Enamel, gilt metal, RCIN 22385]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travelling services==
Most services originally had custom travelling cases, as most owners had more than one residence.  Some of these survive; the Lennoxlove service was found in its ornate "travelling chest" in the attic of [[Lennoxlove House]] in 1924, having apparently been overlooked as the house had changed hands more than once.&lt;ref&gt;MOS; [http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/search-our-collections/collection-item/?item_id=370335&amp;search=description=%27lennoxlove%20toilet%20service%27&amp;startfrom=33 The Lennoxlove travelling chest]&lt;/ref&gt; The Naples Meissen porcelain service, which had an unusually long way to travel from its maker in [[Dresden]], had an individual leather case for each item.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy-Geiger, 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;

Some services were made with an eye to being compact and easily transportable. The "necessaire" was a term for either a small decorative container for small handy tools such as scissors, tweezers, a spoon, pencil and similar,&lt;ref&gt;Adlin, 27; Glory, 244-45&lt;/ref&gt; these also called an [[etui]], or a larger travelling set, originally usually concentrating on small sets of pieces for drinks such as tea and coffee, but later expanded to also include articles for the toilet, writing, sewing, and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;For "medical" and hygienic items, see Bennion, 294–302&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger cases also became works of art in their own right, with fine inlays in brass. As a frequent traveller, [[Napoleon]] commissioned several of these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/39/collection/61160/necessaire-case "Martin Guillaume Biennais (1764–1843), Necessaire case, 1810–14"], Royal Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
[[File:Toilet Service at Weston Park, Staffs DSCF1061 13.jpg|thumb|1679 service at [[Weston Park]] ([[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s later)]]
[[File:Alexandra Nikolaevna's toilet set (Fasanierie castle) 02 by shako.JPG|thumb|[[Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia]]'s toilet service, 1842]]

The surviving piece that goes back closest to the origin of the grand toilet set is the mirror from the service of [[Anne Hyde]], wife of the future [[James II of England]], which was made in Paris in 1660–61, and is now in the [[Louvre]].  This probably drew from the design of the 40 piece service, now lost, given by Louis XIV to [[Anne of Austria]], which is usually taken to be the first of the grand matching services; this may have been in solid gold.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre (also the Louvre "washbowl" page below, for "40 pieces"); Cowen, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three marked French toilet services from the reign of Louis XIV survive. [[Chatsworth House]] has a 23 piece service made for Queen [[Mary II of England]], the [[Museum of Scotland]] has the 17 piece Lennoxlove Service, and [[Rosenborg Castle]], [[Copenhagen]] has a 17 piece service owned by a [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden|Swedish princess]].&lt;ref&gt;MOS&lt;/ref&gt; A further unmarked set is now in a museum in [[Toledo, Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19791114&amp;id=3C1PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3558,831216&amp;hl=en Toledo Blade – Nov 14, 1979, "Toilet Set Gift to Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt; this is "almost identical" to the Lennoxlove service.&lt;ref&gt;MOS&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 25 English toilet services from before 1800 survive,&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 99&lt;/ref&gt; about half now abroad; in 2012 an expert report to the official committee granting export licences recorded only 12 English-made metal toilet services in British collections.&lt;ref&gt;Expert, 7–8 (plus the Norfolk service itself)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Knole House]] has an English set of 18 pieces made in 1674, the earliest English-made service.&lt;ref&gt;Expert, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The 14 pieces in the service at [[Weston Park]] are hallmarked for 1679.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Toilet Service at Weston Park, Staffs DSCF1061 20.jpg|Photo of information sheet at the house]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of these, a 34 piece [[silver-gilt]] English toilet service made in 1708, and presented by her father to [[Maria Howard, Duchess of Norfolk]] on her marriage was granted an export license from the UK to Australia in 2012, despite objections by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. Having cost around £700 in 1708, paid in installments, it was sold for £1,380,000 in 2012. It was made by the leading London silversmith Benjamin Pyne in the "plain English" style, as opposed to the French style used by Huguenot makers.  It had been bought by the London jewellers [[Rundell, Bridge &amp; Rundell]] as part-exchange for a new dinner service for the Duke of Norfolk in the early 19th century, and they it sold to [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], adding his cypher "discreetly".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_Jy3WZIuH_YC&amp;pg=PA36 Department for Culture, Media and Sport: Export of Objects of Cultural Interest], 2012/13 Report; Expert, throughout; Glory, 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford has two significant examples, the Acton toilet service (14 pieces, silver, London, 1699–1700),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objects/makedetail.php?pmu=129&amp;mu=149&amp;gty=qsea&amp;sec=&amp;dtn=15&amp;sfn=Object,Accession%20Number%28s%29,Material,Marks/Maker,Heraldry&amp;cpa=1&amp;rpos=0&amp;key=Acton Ashmolean page, "The Acton toilet service"]; Expert, 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the Treby toilet service (29 pieces, London, [[Paul de Lamerie]], 1724–1725),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objects/makedetail.php?pmu=129&amp;mu=149&amp;gty=qsea&amp;sec=&amp;dtn=15&amp;sfn=Object,Accession%20Number%28s%29,Material,Marks/Maker,Heraldry&amp;cpa=1&amp;rpos=0&amp;key=Treby Ashmolean page, "The Treby toilet service"]; Expert, 8&lt;/ref&gt; for which the bill survives, giving interesting information.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 211&lt;/ref&gt;
