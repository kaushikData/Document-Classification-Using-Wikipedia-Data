      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8052">The '''1958 Mailuu-Suu tailings dam failure''' in the industrial town of [[Mailuu-Suu]], ([[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]]: Майлуусуу), [[Jalal-Abad Region]], southern [[Kyrgyzstan]], caused the uncontrolled release of {{convert|600000|m3}} of radioactive waste.  

The event caused a number of direct casualties and widespread environmental damage.  It was the single worst incident in a region of arid, mountainous western [[Kyrgyzstan]], with a collection of shuttered Soviet-era uranium mining and processing sites, a legacy of extensive radioactive waste dumps, and a history of flooding and mudslides.

As of 2017, despite recent remediations funded by the [[World Bank]] and others, the treatment of radioactive waste at Mailuu-Suu still poses serious health and safety risks for local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Ivan|title=Kyrgyz Town Lives with Radioactive Soviet Legacy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18666435|accessdate=30 December 2017|publisher=National Public Radio|date=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Background ==

Oil was discovered here in the early 1900s.  Deposits of radium-bearing barites had been discovered by [[Alexander Fersman]] in 1929, during his national mineralogical resources survey for the new Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glasby|first1=Dr. G.P.|title=A.E. Fersman and the Kola Peninsula|url=https://www.geochemsoc.org/publications/geochemicalnews/gn135apr08/aefersmanandthekolapeninsu/|website=Geochemical Society|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Uranium mining began in 1946, organized by the "Zapadnyi Mining and Chemical Combine".  In addition to mining, two uranium plants would process more than {{convert|10,000|ST|MT}} of uranium ore, by ion exchange and alkaline leach, to produce [[uranium oxide]] for [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]s.  The processed ore was both mined locally and imported from elsewhere in the Eastern bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Djenchuraev, N. ''Current environmental issues associated with mining wastes in Kyrgyzstan''. Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy of Central European University, Budapest, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town was classified as one of the Soviet government's [[closed city|secret cities]], officially known only as "Mailbox 200".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Afifi|first1=Tamer|last2=Jäger, editors|first2=Jill|title=Environment, Forced Migration and Social Vulnerability|date=5 August 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1vjtrmLpu4C&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium mining was halted in 1968.  Operations left behind some 23 separate uranium [[tailings dam]]s and 13 waste rock dumps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mailuu-Suu Legacy Uranium Dumps|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/projects/display/129|website=Blacksmith Institute|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202094342/http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/projects/display/129|archive-date=2014-02-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; poorly designed on unstable hillsides above a town of 20,000 people in an area prone to both landslides and earthquakes, holding a total {{convert|1900000|m3}} of material containing radionuclides and heavy metals.  No attempt to stabilize or seal the material was done when Soviet mining ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium in Kyrgyzstan|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/kyrgyzstan.aspx|website=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Dam failure ==

On April 16, 1958, with mining and processing plants still operational, a combination of poor design, neglect, heavy rainfall and a reported earthquake caused the #7 tailings dam at Mailuu-Suu to fail.  About 50% of the entire volume of the dam flowed into the swift Mailuu-Suu River, only {{convert|30|m}} downhill from the breach.  The waste then spread about {{convert|40|km}} downstream across the national border into [[Uzbekistan]] then into the heavily populated [[Fergana Valley]].  The Mailuu-Suu River is a tributary of the [[Kara Darya]], used for agricultural irrigation in the valley.  

Some fatalities, building destruction, and contamination of the flood plain were reported as the direct result of the mudflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birsen|first1=N.|last2=Kadyrzhanov|first2=Kairat K.|title=Environmental Protection Against Radioactive Pollution: Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Environmental Protection Against Radioactive Pollution Almati, Kazakhstan 16–19 September 2002|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4G4BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of any public response by officials makes it difficult to identify fatalities from the April 1958 event, especially as distinguished from everyday exposure.  

== Aftermath == 

Longterm health effects are more measurable.  Grave threats to long-term residents persist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uranium in Central Asia: Poisoned legacy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21657431-vast-region-suffers-soviet-unions-radioactive-hangover-poisoned-legacy|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents experiencing far higher rates of cancer, goiter, anemia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trilling|first1=David|title=Kyrgyzstan: Radioactive Legacy Vexes Bishkek|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav052709a.shtml|accessdate=30 December 2017|publisher=Eurasia.net|date=26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other illnesses related to radiological exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landslide close to Mailuu-Suu uranium dump|url=http://www.irinnews.org/news/2005/04/14/landslide-close-mailuu-suu-uranium-dump|accessdate=30 December 2017|publisher=Irin News|date=14 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mailuu-Suu was found to be one of the 10 most polluted sites in the world in a study published in 2006 by the [[Blacksmith Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2006 Top 10 of Worst Polluted Places|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/the-2006-top-ten-of-worst-polluted-places.html|website=Blacksmith Institute|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual spring flooding and the lack of maintenance pose a continued threat of further releases of radioactive material.  In 1994, a new landslide temporarily dammed the Mailuu-Suu River.  In 2002 a flood caused by a mudslide nearly submerged a tailings pit.&lt;ref name=osce/&gt; 

The [[World Bank]] approved a [[US$]]5 million grant to reclaim the tailings pits in 2004,&lt;ref name=osce&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah MacGregor |url=http://www.osce.org/bishkek/57474 |title=Finding a solution for uranium waste in Kyrgyzstan - OSCE Centre in Bishkek |publisher=Osce.org |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approved an additional $1 million grant for the project in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22936608~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html |title=News &amp; Broadcast - 28, 000 Inhabitants of Mailuu-Suu Valey [sic] in the Kyrgyz Republic to Benefit from Improved and Safer Access on the Road to Villages |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]], and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] have also funded programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EBRD to fund remediation of Central Asian uranium dumps|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsebrd-to-fund-remediation-of-central-asian-uranium-dumps-5724908|accessdate=30 December 2017|publisher=Nuclear Engineering Intl|date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATIC launch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Launch of ATIC]]
The '''Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter''' ('''ATIC''') is a [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]-borne instrument flying in the [[stratosphere]] over [[Antarctica]] to measure the energy and composition of [[cosmic rays]]. ATIC was launched from [[McMurdo Station]] for the first time in December 2000 and has since completed three successful flights out of four.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news

==Working principle==
The detector uses the principle of [[ionization]] [[calorimetry]]: several layers of the [[scintillator]] [[bismuth germanate]] emit light as they are struck by particles, allowing to calculate the particles' energy. A [[silicon]] matrix is used to determine the particles' [[electrical charge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atic.phys.lsu.edu/aticweb/Instrument.html Instrument description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228235844/http://atic.phys.lsu.edu/aticweb/Instrument.html |date=28 December 2008 }}, LSU Space Science group. Retrieved 23 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborators==

The project is an international collaboration of researchers from [[Louisiana State University]], [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], [[Purple Mountain Observatory]] in China, [[Moscow State University]] in Russia and [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] in Germany. ATIC is supported in the United States by [[NASA]] and flights are conducted under the auspices of the Balloon Program Office at [[Wallops Flight Facility]] by the staff of the [[Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility]]. Antarctic logistics are provided by the [[National Science Foundation]] and its contractor [[Raytheon]] Polar Services Corporation.
The principal investigator for ATIC is John Wefel of Louisiana State University.

==Results==
In November 2008, researchers published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' the finding of a surplus of high energy [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name="mysterious"/&gt; During a 5-week observatory period in 2000 and 2003, ATIC counted 70 electrons with energies in the range [[Orders of magnitude (energy)#10-9|300-800 GeV]]; these electrons were in excess of those expected from the galactic background. The source of these electrons is unknown, but it is assumed to be relatively close, no more than about 3000 [[lightyear]]s away, since high energy electrons rapidly lose energy as they travel through the galactic magnetic field and collide with photons. The electrons could originate from a nearby [[pulsar]] or other astrophysical object, but the researchers were not able to identify a fitting object. According to another conjecture, the electrons result from collisions of [[Dark Matter]] particles, for example [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]] [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza-Klein particle]]s of mass near 620 GeV.&lt;ref name="mysterious"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16085-mysterious-electrons-may-be-sign-of-dark-matter.html Mysterious electrons may be sign of dark matter], ''New Scientist'', 19 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/19nov_cosmicrays.htm Discovered: Cosmic Rays from a Mysterious, Nearby Object], NASA, 19 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related data from other experiments==

Earlier in the year, the satellite [[Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics|PAMELA]] had found excess [[positron]]s (the [[antiparticle]] of the electron) in the cosmic ray signal, also believed to originate from dark matter interactions.
ATIC cannot distinguish between electrons and positrons, so it is possible that the two results are compatible.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

On the other hand, in November 2008 the [[Milagro (experiment)|Milagro experiment]] reported cosmic ray "hotspots" in the sky, possibly supporting astrophysical objects as sources of the surplus electrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081126/full/news.2008.1258.html Cosmic-ray hot spots puzzle researchers], ''Nature News'', 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, observations by the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi space telescope]] were reported which did not support the spike of high-energy electrons seen by ATIC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17085-dark-matter-signal-recedes-into-the-shadows.html Dark matter signal recedes into the shadows], ''New Scientist'', 7 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flight dynamics with text.png|thumb|right|200px|Yaw, Pitch and Roll in an aircraft]]

An [[aircraft]] in flight is free to rotate in three dimensions: ''yaw'', nose left or right about an axis running up and down; ''pitch'', nose up or down about an axis running from wing to wing; and ''roll'', rotation about an axis running from nose to tail. The axes are alternatively designated as ''vertical'', ''transverse'', and ''longitudinal'' respectively. These axes [[Moving frame|move with the vehicle]] and rotate relative to the Earth along with the craft. These definitions were analogously applied to [[spacecraft]] when the first manned spacecraft were designed in the late 1950s.

These rotations are produced by [[torque]]s (or [[Moment (physics)|moment]]s) about the principal axes. On an aircraft, these are intentionally produced by means of moving control surfaces, which vary the distribution of the net [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] force about the vehicle's [[center of gravity]]. [[Elevator (aeronautics)|Elevator]]s (moving flaps on the horizontal tail) produce pitch, a [[rudder]] on the vertical tail produces yaw, and [[aileron]]s (flaps on the wings that move in opposing directions) produce roll. On a spacecraft, the moments are usually produced by a [[reaction control system]] consisting of small rocket thrusters used to apply asymmetrical thrust on the vehicle.

==Principal axes==

*[[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal axis|Longitudinal axis]], or roll axis&amp;nbsp;— an axis drawn through the body of the vehicle from tail to nose in the normal direction of flight, or the direction the pilot faces. Parallel to the ''[[waterline]]''.

Normally, these axes are represented by the letters X, Y and Z in order to compare them with some reference frame, usually named x, y, z. Normally, this is made in such a way that the X is used for the longitudinal axis, but there are [[axes conventions|other possibilities]] to do it.

The '''yaw axis''' has its origin at the center of gravity and is directed towards the bottom of the aircraft, [[perpendicular]] to the wings and to the fuselage reference line.

(1975) ''Aerodynamics'' Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}, Section 16.6&lt;/ref&gt; A positive rolling motion lifts the left wing and lowers the right wing. The pilot rolls by increasing the lift on one wing and decreasing it on the other. This changes the bank angle. The [[aileron]]s are the primary control of bank. The rudder also has a secondary effect on bank.&lt;ref&gt;FAA (2004). ''Airplane Flying Handbook''. Washington D.C.:U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, ch 4, p 2, FAA-8083-3A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other systems of axes==
These axes are related to the [[Moment of inertia#Principal axes|principal axes of inertia]], but are not the same. They are geometrical symmetry axes, regardless of the mass distribution of the aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} 

In aeronautical and aerospace engineering intrinsic rotations around these axes are often called [[Euler angles]], but this conflicts with existing usage elsewhere. The calculus behind them is similar to the [[Frenet–Serret formulas]]. Performing a rotation in an intrinsic reference frame is equivalent to right-multiplying its characteristic matrix (the matrix that has the vector of the reference frame as columns) by the matrix of the rotation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==History==
The first aircraft to demonstrate active control about all three axes was the [[Wright brothers]]' [[Wright_Glider#1902_glider|1902 glider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/rotations.html|title=Aircraft rotations|access-date=2008-08-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704135659/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/rotations.html| archivedate= 4 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''allomone''' is any [[chemical substance]] produced and released by an individual of one [[species]] that affects the behaviour of a member of another species to the benefit of the originator but not the receiver.&lt;ref name="ELS"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of allomones is a common form of defence, particularly by plant species against insect [[herbivores]].

Many insects have developed ways to defend against these [[plant defenses against herbivory|plant defenses]] (in an [[evolutionary arms race]]). One method of adapting to allomones is to develop a positive reaction to them; the allomone then becomes a [[kairomone]]. Others alter the allomones to form [[pheromone]]s or other [[hormone]]s, and yet others adopt them into their own defensive strategies, for example by regurgitating them when attacked by an [[insectivorous]] insect.

A third class of allelochemical (chemical used in interspecific communication), [[synomone]]s, benefit both the sender and receiver.&lt;ref name="ELS"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Allomone was proposed by Brown and Eisner (Brown, 1968) to denote those substances which convey an advantage upon the emitter. Because Brown and Eisner did not specify whether or not the receiver would benefit, the original definition of allomone includes both substances that benefit the receiver and the emitter, and substances that only benefit the emitter. An example of the first relationship would be a mutualistic relationship, and the latter would be a repellent secretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The termite becomes immobile after 1 to 3 minutes, and completely paralysed very soon after this, although it may live for up to 3 hours. The berothid then feeds on the paralysed prey. The third instar feeds in a similar manner and may kill up to six termites at a time. Contact between the termite and the berothid is not necessary for subduing, and other insects present are not affected by the allomone.&lt;ref&gt;Insects as Predators by T New, published by NSW University Press in 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Branding irons-Dutch K, c, and k.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|Branding irons from the 1910s.]]
A '''branding iron''' is used for [[branding (disambiguation)|branding]], pressing a heated metal shape against an object or livestock with the intention of leaving an identifying mark.

==History==
The history of branding is very much tied to the history of using animals as a commodity. The act of marking livestock with fire-heated marks to identify ownership begins in ancient times with the [[ancient Egypt]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandingirons.com/index.html |title=The Evolution of Branding | publisher=Branding Irons Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process continued throughout the ages, with [[ancient Rome|Romans]] using the process to brand [[slave]]s as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/slave2.html The branding of slaves.] ''The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English lexicon, the Germanic word "[[wikt:brand|brand]]" originally meant anything hot or burning, such as a ''fire-brand'', a burning stick. By the European [[Middle Ages]] it commonly identified the process of burning a mark into a stock animals with thick hides, such as [[cattle]], so as to identify ownership under [[animus revertendi]]. In England, the [[rights of common]] including the common pasture system meant that cattle could be grazed on certain land with commoner's rights and the cattle were branded to show ownership, often with the commoner's or Lord of the manor's mark. The practice was widespread in most European nations with large cattle grazing regions, including [[Spain]]. 

With colonialism, many cattle branding traditions and techniques were spread via the [[Spanish Empire]] to [[South America]] and to countries of the [[British Empire]] including the Americas, Australasia &amp; [[South Africa]] where distinct sets of traditions and techniques developed respectively.

In the Americas these European systems continued with English tradition being used in the New England Colonies and spread outwards with the western expansion of the U.S. The Spanish system evolved from the south with the ''[[vaquero]]'' tradition in what today is the southwestern [[United States]] and northern [[Mexico]]. The branding iron consisted of an iron rod with a simple symbol or mark which was heated in a fire. After the branding iron turned red-hot, the cowhand pressed the branding iron against the hide of the cow. The unique brand meant that cattle owned by multiple owners could then graze freely together on the commons or [[open range]]. Drovers or cowboys could then separate the cattle at ''[[muster (livestock)|roundup]]'' time for driving to [[Market (place)|market]].

==Types of branding irons==
Branding Irons come in a variety of styles, designed primarily by their method of heating.

===Fire-heated===
The traditional fire-heated method is still in use today. While they require longer lengths of time to heat, are inconsistent in temperature and all around inferior to more advanced forms of branding, they are inexpensive to produce and purchase. Fire-heated branding irons are used to brand [[wood]], [[steak]], [[leather]], [[livestock]] and [[plastics]].

===Electric===
Electric branding irons utilize an electric heating element to heat a branding iron to the desired temperature. Electric branding irons come in many variations from irons designed to brand [[cattle]], irons designed to mark wood and leather and models designed to be placed inside a drill press for the purposes of manufacturing. An Electric Branding Iron's temperature can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the flow of electricity.&lt;!-- perhaps this should be its own page --&gt;

===Propane===
Propane Branding Irons use a continuous flow of [[propane]] to heat the iron head. They are commonly used where electricity is not available. Utilizing the flow of propane, the temperature can be adjusted for varying branding environments.

A commercially built branding iron heater fired with L.P. gas is a common method of heating several branding irons at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Freeze-branding===
{{Main|Freeze brand}}
In contrast to traditional hot-iron branding, [[freeze branding]] uses a branding iron that has been chilled with a coolant such as [[dry ice]] or [[liquid nitrogen]]. Rather than burning a scar into the animal, a freeze brand damages the pigment-producing hair cells, causing the animal's hair to grow white where the brand has been applied. To apply a freeze brand, the hair coat of the animal is shaved so that the bare skin is exposed, then the frozen iron is applied to the bare area for a period of time that varies with both the species of animal and the color of its hair coat: Shorter times are used on dark-colored animals, simply causing the hair follicles to lose all color and regrow as white hairs. Longer times are needed on animals with white hair coats, as the brand is applied long enough to permanently stop the hair from growing in the branded area and only epidermis  remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/publications/pubDetail.cfm?pk_ID=7636

==Popular use==

===Livestock===
[[Livestock branding]] is perhaps the most prevalent use of a branding iron. Modern use includes gas heating, the traditional fire-heated method, an iron heated by electricity (electric cattle branding iron) or an iron super cooled by dry ice (freeze branding iron). Cattle, horses and other livestock are commonly branded today for the same reason they were in Ancient times, to prove ownership.

===Wood branding===
[[Woodworkers]] will often use Electric or Fire-Heated Branding Irons to leave their maker's mark or company logo. Timber pallets and other timber export packaging is often marked in this way in accordance with [[ISPM 15]] to indicate that the timber has been treated to prevent it carrying pests.

===Steak===
Steak branding irons are used commonly by [[barbecue]] enthusiasts and professional chefs to leave a mark indicating how well done a steak is or to identify the chef or grill master.

===Leather===
Branding Irons are used often by makers of [[horse tack]] often in place of a steel [[leather stamp]] to indicate craftsmanship.

'''Capacitive [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]]''' is the transfer of energy within an [[electrical network]] or between distant networks by means of [[displacement current]] between circuit(s) [[node (circuits) | nodes]], induced by the electric field. This coupling can have an intentional or accidental effect.

[[File:Fluorescent tube under electric line.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity.|Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity.]]

In its simplest implementation, capacitive coupling is achieved by placing a [[capacitor]] between two nodes.&lt;ref name="J279"&gt;{{cite book|last=Joffe, Elya|title=Grounds for Grounding:A Circuit to System Handbook|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-66008-6|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where analysis of many points in a circuit is carried out, the capacitance at each point and between points can be described in a [[Capacitance#Capacitance_matrix|matrix form]]. 

==Use in analog circuits==

[[File:Mallory 150 coupling capacitor.jpg|thumb|Polyester [[film capacitor]]s, commonly used for coupling between two circuits.]]In [[analog circuit]]s, a coupling capacitor is used to connect two circuits such that only the [[alternating current|AC]] signal from the first circuit can pass through to the next while [[direct current|DC]] is blocked. This technique helps to isolate the [[DC bias]] settings of the two coupled circuits. Capacitive coupling is also known as ''AC coupling'' and the capacitor used for the purpose is also known as a ''DC-blocking capacitor''.

A coupling capacitor's ability to prevent a DC load from interfering with an AC source is particularly useful in [[Class A amplifier]] circuits by preventing a 0 volt input being passed to a transistor with additional resistor biasing; creating continuous amplification.

Capacitive coupling decreases the [[low frequency]] gain of a system containing capacitively coupled units. Each coupling capacitor along with the input [[electrical impedance]] of the next stage forms a [[high-pass filter]] and the sequence of filters results in a cumulative filter with a −3[[decibel|dB]] frequency that may be higher than those of each individual filter. So for adequate low frequency response, the capacitors used must have high capacitance ratings. They should be high enough that the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] of each is at most a tenth of the input impedance of each stage, at the lowest frequency of interest.  See [[Impedance bridging]].

Coupling capacitors can also introduce nonlinear [[distortion]] at low frequencies.  This is not an issue at high frequencies because the voltage across the capacitor stays very close to zero.  However, if a signal is allowed to pass through the coupling that is low relative to the RC [[cutoff frequency]], voltages can develop across the capacitor, which for some capacitor types results in changes of capacitance, leading to distortion. This is avoided by choosing capacitor types that have low ''voltage coefficient'', and by using large values that put the cutoff frequency far lower than the frequencies of the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Capacitor  Characteristics|url = http://sound.whsites.net/articles/capacitors.htm#s23|website = sound.whsites.net|accessdate = 2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Signal distortion from high-K ceramic capacitors|url = http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4416466/Signal-distortion-from-high-K-ceramic-capacitors|accessdate = 2015-06-06|first = John|last = Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These disadvantages of capacitively coupling DC-biased transistor amplifier circuits are largely minimized in [[direct coupling|directly coupled]] designs.

==Use in digital circuits==

AC coupling is also widely used in digital circuits to transmit digital signals with a zero [[DC component]], known as [[DC-balanced]] signals. DC-balanced waveforms are useful in communications systems, since they can be used over AC-coupled electrical connections to avoid voltage imbalance problems and charge accumulation between connected systems or components.

For this reason, most modern [[line code]]s are designed to produce DC-balanced waveforms. The most common classes of DC-balanced line codes are [[constant-weight code]]s and [[paired-disparity code]]s.

==Gimmick loop==

A gimmick loop is a simple type of capacitive coupler: two closely spaced strands of wire. It provides capacitive coupling of a few [[picofarad]]s between two nodes. Sometimes the wires are twisted together for physical stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Applications of Electronics | author = Bernard Grob and Milton Sol Kiver | year = 1960 | publisher = McGraw–Hill | pages = 300–01 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g9lUleIpznwC&amp;vid=OCLC02077707&amp;dq=gimmick&amp;q=gimmick&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Forrest Mims Circuit Scrapbook | author = Forrest M.

==Parasitic capacitive coupling==

Capacitive coupling is often unintended, such as the capacitance between two wires or [[printed circuit board|PCB]] traces that are next to each other.  Often one signal can capacitively couple with another and cause what appears to be [[noise (electronic)|noise]].  To reduce coupling, wires or traces are often separated as much as possible, or ground lines or [[ground plane]]s are run in between signals that might affect each other, so that the lines are capacitively coupled to ground rather than each other.  [[Breadboard]]s are particularly prone to these issues due to the long pieces of metal that line every row creating a several-picofarad capacitor between lines.  To prototype high-frequency (10s of MHz) or high-[[gain (electronics)|gain]] analog circuits, often the circuits are built over a ground plane so that the signals couple to ground more than to each other.  If a high-[[gain (electronics)|gain]] [[amplifier]]'s output capacitively couples to its input it often becomes an [[electronic oscillator]].

One rule of thumb says that drivers should be able to drive 25 pF of capacitance which allows for PCB traces up to 0.30 meters.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Corrugated Cardboard.JPG|thumb|Corrugated containerboard.]]
'''Containerboard''' ('''CCM''' or '''corrugated case material''') is a type of [[paperboard]] specially manufactured for the production of [[corrugated board]]. It includes both linerboard and corrugating medium (or fluting), the two types of paper that make up [[corrugated board]]. Since containerboard is made mainly out of natural unbleached [[pulp (paper)|wood fibers]], it is generally brown, although its shade may vary depending on the type of [[wood]], [[pulping]] process, [[recycling]] rate and impurities content. For certain boxes that demand good presentation, white bleached pulp or coating is used on the top ply of the linerboard that goes outside the box.

==Manufacture==
{{Main|Paper machine}}
Containerboard is made on modified paper machines that can handle higher [[grammage]]s.

The production of containerboard is the highest of all kinds of paper in the world.{{fact|date=April 2017}} More than 100 million tons are produced annually.{{fact|date=April 2017}} It is made in specialized paper machines from virgin as well as recycled fibers. Linerboard made of virgin pulp is called ''kraftliner'', whereas recycled linerboard is known as ''testliner.'' The corrugating medium may be recycled medium, called ''wellenstoff'' in Europe, or virgin, which is called semichemical medium for the type of pulp used in its production. The borders of these categories becomes blurred when both virgin and recycled fibers are used in making one product. 

At the end of the manufacturing process containerboard is cut into rolls comprising a continuous sheet of paper, which will later be unwound in the corrugator machine while making the corrugated board. A typical roll has a width of {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}}, a diameter of {{convert|1.45|m|abbr=on}}, and weighs around {{convert|3000|kg|-1|abbr=on}}.

A '''crystal cluster''' is a group of [[crystal]]s which formed in an open space environment and exhibit [[euhedral]] [[Crystal habit|crystal form]] determined by their internal [[crystal structure]]. A cluster of small crystals coating the walls of a cavity are called [[Druse (geology)|druse]].

=== AEK F.C. ===
{{Main|AEK Athens F.C.}}
Melissanidis was President of [[AEK Athens F.C.]] during the 90's.

On June 7, 2013, Dimitris Melissanidis became again active for AEK, after they declared bankruptcy, in order to save the club and bring them back to success. The company declared bankruptcy and were relegated to Greece's third tier. The club was reported to owe €170 million ($219 million) in taxes and will start the 2013/14 campaign in the Football League 2, the country's third amateur division.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130928170415/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-aek-athens-prepare-start-scratch-bankruptcy-200529478.html aek-athens-prepare-start-scratch-bankruptcy]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, together with other notable AEK fans and old players, they created the non-profit association "Union Friends of AEK" (''Enosi Filon AEK'') which took the majority stake of the football club.

Since the arrival and return of Melissandis to the club, AEK has secured major sponsorship deals which will give the club a huge financial boost. Melissanidis has secured a €2.1 million sponsorship deal from [[OPAP]], a €1.5 million contract with Greek Telecommunications company [[Nova Sports]] and a €1 million sponsorship deal with [[Fujitsu]].

Melissanidis has unveiled plans also for a new stadium in [[Nea Filadelfia]], where the old stadium of AEK was placed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220321/http://www.aek365.com/a-294021/h-maketa-tou-palatiou-ths-agia-sofias-fwto.htm h-maketa-tou-palatiou-ths-agia-sofias-fwto]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaneu.com/melissanidis-unveils-plan-build-aek-athens-stadium/ Melissanidis unveils plan to build new AEK Athens Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 2013 the AEK Athens board, under Dimitris Melissanidis, presented plans for the [[Hagia Sophia Stadium|new stadium]] to the municipality of [[Nea Filadelfeia]], in order to gain permission to build. A new  4-star UEFA system stadium will be built, seating between 32,500 and 35,000 spectators. The cost of this project is estimated to be around €70-80 million. It is modelled after the [[Hagia Sophia|Agia Sophia]] church in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], as AEK has its roots there. Around 1,500-2,000 new jobs will become available and the neighbourhood is expected to benefit largely from this endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/547028/aek-ayto-einai-spiti-soy-pics-vid AEK, αυτό είναι το σπίτι σου!] (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; The structural design of the stadium was designed by [[Italy|Italian]] architect Massimo Majowiecki and the architectural design by the Greek architect Athanasius Kyratsous. Majowiecki is most known for designing the home ground of the [[Juventus Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aek365.com/a-273056/o-rolos-kleidi-tou-masimo-magiobietski-gia-thn-filadelfeia.htm Ο ρόλος-κλειδί του Μάσιμο Μαγιοβιέτσκι για την Φιλαδέλφεια!] Massimo Majowiecki designs the new AEK stadium&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emma Delta &amp; OPAP ===
Melissanidis, via his own company Geonama Holdings,&lt;ref name=Geonama/&gt; reported owned a stake in Emma Delta, a private equity fund of [[EMMA Capital]]. Emma Delta acquired 33% stake of Greek betting firm OPAP&lt;ref name=OPAP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opap.gr/en/web/corporate.opap.gr/31|title=Shareholder Structure|access-date=19 January 2017|publisher=OPAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; for €652 million.&lt;ref name=Geonama&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g3newswire.com/greece-emma-delta-approved-opap-purchase/|title=Emma Delta approved for OPAP purchase|date=13 August 2013|access-date=21 January 2017|work=G3 News Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reuters, OPAP was the European biggest betting firm, as of 2008.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news | date=11 June 2008 |access-date=7 December 2017| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUKL1175764720080611 | title=Greek OPAP puts off charter changes ahead of deregulation | agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the press release, the 33% stake in Emma Delta was beneficially owned by his son Georgios, whom was nominated into the board of directors of OPAP..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.opap.gr/documents/11503/16501/12.11.20,%209M12+Financial+Results+Press+Release_en.pdf|title=OPAP announces revenues' single-digit drop coupled with EBITDA margin resilience|date=20 November 2012|access-date=22 January 2017|publisher=OPAP|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OPAPpress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmacapital.cz/files/announcement-11-october-2013.pdf|title=EMMA DELTA COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF GREECE’S OPAP BETTING GROUP|date=11 October 2013|access-date=22 January 2017|publisher=EMMA Capital}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the signing, Dimitris  Melissanidis ended his statement by commenting that "OPAP is turning a page".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_12/08/2013_513834 OPAP sale to Emma Delta inked, at last]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other  ==
Melissanidis has social and philanthropic action, mainly in cooperation with the [[Church of Greece]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. In January 2014, he was honoured with the title of ''[[Kouropalates]]'' (''cura palatii'') by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], a title given for the first time since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paraskhnio.gr/arxontas-koyropalatis-tis-agias-toy/ Άρχοντας Κουροπαλάτης της Αγίας του Χριστού Μεγάλης Εκκλησίας» αναγορεύθηκε ο Δημήτρης Μελισσανίδης]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enikos.gr/society/204608,Arxwn-ths-Megalhs-Ekklhsias-o-Dhmhtrhs-Melissanidhs.html Άρχων της Μεγάλης Εκκλησίας» ο Δημήτρης Μελισσανίδης]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Dimitris Melissanidis has been involved in many controversies over the years. In the 1980s when he ran his first business in Piraeus (a driving school) he received his first bribery conviction and then another bribery conviction for paying off two players in an amateur football league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepressproject.net/article/57229/Melissanidis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820094024/http://www.thepressproject.net/article/57229/Melissanidis |archivedate=2014-08-20 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;]{{not in source|date=May 2018}}

In 1996, Melissanidis and his [[business partner]], Yiannis Karras, were charged to a [[prison sentence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ΑΚΟΜΗ ΣΤΗ ΦΥΛΑΚΗ Ο ΜΕΛΙΣΣΑΝΙΔΗΣ|url=http://www.hyper.gr/makthes/960513/60513f07.html|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Makedonia|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for oil smuggling, however the charges were dropped and he was not found guilty for oil smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ktenas Spyros|title=Οι λαθρέμποροι πετρελαίου κλέβουν 80 εκατ. την ημέρα|url=http://www.tovima.gr/finance/article/?aid=83112|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=To Vima (Το Βήμα)|date=1996-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of negotiations with [[OPAP]], Costas Louropoulos, OPAP’s [[chief executive]], felt put “under pressure by Mr Melissanidis in a series of telephone calls. “He insulted me, as on many previous occasions. . . You dare to sign [the Intralot and lottery contracts] and I will take your head off”, Mr Louropoulos quoted Mr Melissanidis as telling him on May 20, 2013”, according to the "[[Financial Times]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerin Hope|title=Greece faces collapse of second key privatization|newspaper=Financial Times|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, immediately after the signing of the OPAP deal, the [[Greece|Greek]] [[privatization]] [[agency (law)|agency]] [[chairman]], Stelios Stavridis, was dismissed by Greek [[Finance Minister]], Yannis Stournaras, “for ethical reasons”, when news reports emerged that he travelled on Dimitris Melissanidis’ private jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harry Papachristou|title=UPDATE 2-Greek privatisation chief dismissed over holiday flight|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/18/greece-privatisations-idUSL6N0GJ0B520130818|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=Aug 18, 2013&lt;!-- 1:21pm EDT--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in a highly publicized incident, discussed in the Greek [[Parliament]], calling from an ‘Aegean Oil’ listed telephone number, Melissanidis personally [[bullied]] with [[death threats]] to Lefteris Charalambopoulos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baboulias Yiannis|title=Reporter receives death threats from man self-identified as Aegean Oil magnate (UPDATES)|url=http://www.urbandiaries.gr/2013/02/05/reporter-receives-death-threats-from-man-self-identified-as-aegean-oil-magnate-updates/|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Urban Diaries|date=5 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055917/http://www.urbandiaries.gr/2013/02/05/reporter-receives-death-threats-from-man-self-identified-as-aegean-oil-magnate-updates/|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Greek reporter who published the government report in the left-wing ‘Unfollow’ magazine.&lt;ref name="Augustine Zenakos"&gt;{{cite news|last=Augustine Zenakos|title=REPORTER THREATENED OVER AEGEAN OIL SMUGGLING REPORT|url=http://borderlinereports.net/2013/02/03/death-threats-from-man-self-identified-as-aegean-oil-magnate/|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Borderline Reports|date=February 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923031822/http://borderlinereports.net/2013/02/03/death-threats-from-man-self-identified-as-aegean-oil-magnate/|archivedate=23 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elektra Kotsoni|title=A Greek Oil Baron Wants to Blow Me Up in My Sleep|url=https://www.vice.com/en_se/read/unfollow-magazine-oil-smuggling-aegean-oil|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Vice|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caller self-identified as Dimitris Melissanidis threatened the reporters life repeatedly. Part of what was said by the man self-identified as Dimitris Melissanidis, which was taken down by the reporter, follows: “I could have you killed without having warned you. But I am a man and I’m gonna have you blown up in your sleep. I’ll have you killed, you, your wife, your children, everything you’ve got”.
When the reporter told the caller that he would alert the authorities, he replied: “Screw you and the authorities. I don’t understand anything, I am Melissanidis. You will not be able to sleep. You will not be able to go out, I’ll be your nightmare. Fear of me will haunt you. They will come to your house and blow you up in your sleep. I am used to talking to big journalists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40775">In economic terms, [[electricity]] (both [[electric power|power]] and [[electric energy|energy]]) is a [[commodity]] capable of being bought, sold, and traded. An '''electricity market''' is a system enabling purchases, through bids to buy;  sales, through offers to sell; and [[Short-term trading|short-term trades]], generally in the form of financial or obligation [[swap (finance)|swap]]s. Bids and offers use [[supply and demand]] principles to set the price. Long-term trades are contracts similar to [[power purchase agreement]]s and generally considered private bi-lateral transactions between counterparties.

Wholesale transactions (bids and offers) in electricity are typically cleared and settled by the market operator or a special-purpose independent entity charged exclusively with that function. Market operators do not clear trades but often require knowledge of the trade in order to maintain generation and load balance.
The commodities within an electric market generally consist of two types: [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[Energy (physics)|energy]]. Power is the metered net electrical transfer rate at any given moment and is measured in [[megawatt]]s (MW). Energy is electricity that flows through a metered point for a given period and is measured in [[Megawatt hour|megawatt-hours]] (MWh).

Markets for energy-related commodities trade net generation output for a number of intervals usually in increments of 5, 15 and 60 minutes. Markets for power-related commodities required and managed by (and paid for by) market operators to ensure reliability, are considered [[Ancillary services (electric power)|ancillary services]] and include such names as spinning reserve, non-spinning reserve, [[operating reserve]]s, responsive reserve, regulation up, regulation down, and [[Nameplate capacity|installed capacity]].

In addition, for most major operators, there are markets for transmission congestion and electricity [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] such as electricity [[Futures contract|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]], which are actively traded. These markets developed as a result of the restructuring of electric power systems around the world. This process has often gone on in parallel with the restructuring of [[natural gas]] markets.
{{TOClimit|3}}

==History==
One early introduction of [[energy market]] concepts and [[privatization]] to electric power systems took place in [[Electricity sector in Chile|Chile]] in the early 1980s, in parallel with other market-oriented reforms associated with the [[Chicago Boys]]. The Chilean model was generally perceived as successful in bringing rationality and transparency to power pricing. [[Electricity sector in Argentina|Argentina]] improved on the Chilean model by imposing strict limits on market concentration and by improving the structure of payments to units held in reserve to assure system reliability. One of the principal purposes of the introduction of market concepts [[Electricity sector in Argentina|in Argentina]] was to privatize existing generation assets (which had fallen into disrepair under the government-owned monopoly, resulting in frequent service interruptions) and to attract capital needed for rehabilitation of those assets and for system expansion. The [[World Bank]] was active in introducing a variety of hybrid markets in other Latin American nations, including Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, during the 1990s, with limited success.

A quantum leap in electricity pricing theory occurred in 1988 when four professors at MIT and Boston University (Fred C. Schweppe, Michael C. Caramanis, Richard D. Tabors, and Roger E. Bohn) published a book entitled, "Spot Pricing of Electricity."{{cn|date=October 2018}} It presented the concept that prices at each location on a transmission system should reflect the marginal cost of serving one additional unit of demand at that location.  It then proposed quantifying these prices by solving a systemwide cost minimization problem while complying with all of the system's operational constraints, such as generator capacity limits, locational loads, line flow limits, etc. using linear programming software.  The locational marginal prices then emerged as the shadow prices for relaxing the load limit at each location. 

A key event for electricity markets occurred in 1990 when the [[United Kingdom|UK]] government under [[Margaret Thatcher]] [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom#1980s market liberalisation|privatised the UK electricity supply industry]]. The process followed by the British was then used as a model (or at least a catalyst) for the restructuring of several other Commonwealth countries, notably the National Electricity Markets of Australia and New Zealand and the Alberta Electricity Market in Canada. 

In the United States the traditional vertically integrated electric utility model with a transmission system designed to serve its own customers worked extremely well for decades. As dependence on a reliable supply of electricity grew and electricity was transported over increasingly greater distances, wide area synchronous grid interconnections developed. Transactions were relatively few and generally scheduled well in advance.

However, in the last decade of the 20th century, some US policy makers and academics asserted that the electric power industry would ultimately experience deregulation and [[independent system operator]]s (ISOs) and [[regional transmission organization]]s (RTOs) were established. They were conceived as the way to handle the vastly increased number of transactions that take place in a competitive environment. About a dozen states decided to deregulate but some pulled back following the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000 and 2001.

In different deregulation processes the institutions and market designs were often very different but many of the underlying concepts were the same. These are: separate the potentially competitive functions of [[electricity generation|generation]] and [[electricity retailing|retail]] from the [[natural monopoly]] functions of [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]]; and establish a '''wholesale electricity market''' and a '''retail electricity market'''. The role of the wholesale market is to allow trading between generators, retailers and other financial intermediaries both for short-term delivery of electricity (see [[spot price]]) and for future delivery periods (see [[forward price]]).

Some states exempt non investor-owned utilities from some aspects of deregulation such as customer choice of supplier. For example, some of the New England states exempt municipal lighting plants from several aspects of deregulation and these municipal utilities do not have to allow customers to purchase from competitive suppliers. Municipal utilities in these states can also opt to function as vertically-integrated utilities and operate generation assets both inside and outside of their service area to supply their utility customers as well as sell output to the market.

==Nature of the market==

[[Electricity]] is by its nature difficult to store and has to be available on demand. Consequently, unlike other products, it is not possible, under normal operating conditions, to keep it in stock, ration it or have customers queue for it. Furthermore, demand and supply vary continuously.

There is therefore a physical requirement for a controlling agency, the [[transmission system operator]], to [[unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production|coordinate the dispatch of generating units]] to meet the expected demand of the system across the [[electric power transmission|transmission grid]]. If there is a mismatch between supply and demand the generators speed up or slow down causing the system [[frequency]] (either 50 or 60 [[hertz]]) to increase or decrease. If the frequency falls outside a predetermined range the system operator will act to add or remove either generation or load.

The proportion of electricity lost in transmission and the level of congestion on any particular branch of the network will influence the [[economic dispatch]] of the generation units.

Markets may extend beyond national boundaries.

== Wholesale electricity market ==

[[Image:Tagesgang engl.png|thumb|400px|Typical daily consumption of electrical power in Germany]]
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=March 2017}}
A '''wholesale electricity market''' exists when competing [[electricity generation|generators]] offer their electricity output to [[electricity retailing|retailers]]. The retailers then re-price the electricity and take it to market. While wholesale pricing used to be the exclusive domain of large retail suppliers, increasingly markets like New England are beginning to open up to end-users. Large end-users seeking to cut out unnecessary overhead in their energy costs are beginning to recognize the advantages inherent in such a purchasing move. Consumers buying electricity directly from generators is a relatively recent phenomenon.

Buying wholesale electricity is not without its drawbacks (market uncertainty, membership costs, set up fees, collateral investment, and organization costs, as electricity would need to be bought on a daily basis), however, the larger the end user's electrical load, the greater the benefit and incentive to make the switch.

For an economically efficient electricity wholesale market to flourish it is essential that a number of criteria are met, namely the existence of a coordinated spot market that has "bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices". These criteria have been largely adopted in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/whogan/ Criteria for economically efficient electricity wholesale markets ] - Criteria for economically efficient wholesale markets&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices ===
The system price in the day-ahead market is, in principle, determined by matching offers from generators to bids from consumers at each [[node (graph theory)|node]] to develop a classic [[supply curve|supply]] and [[supply curve|demand]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium price]], usually on an hourly interval, and is calculated separately for subregions in which the system operator's load flow model indicates that constraints will bind transmission imports.

The theoretical prices of electricity at each node on the network is a calculated "[[shadow price]]", in which it is assumed that one additional [[kilowatt-hour]] is demanded at the node in question, and the hypothetical incremental cost to the system that would result from the optimized redispatch of available units establishes the hypothetical production cost of the hypothetical kilowatt-hour. This is known as ''locational marginal pricing'' (LMP) or ''nodal pricing'' and is used in some deregulated markets, most notably in the [[PJM Interconnection]], [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas|ERCOT]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[New England]] markets in the USA, [[New Zealand Electricity Market|New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="alvey-etal-1998"&gt;

and in Singapore.

In practice, the LMP algorithm described above is run, incorporating a security-constrained, least-cost dispatch calculation (see below) with supply based on the generators that submitted offers in the day-ahead market, and demand based on bids from load-serving entities draining supplies at the nodes in question.

While in theory the LMP concepts are useful and not evidently subject to manipulation, in practice system operators have substantial discretion over LMP results through the ability to classify units as running in "out-of-merit dispatch", which are thereby excluded from the LMP calculation. In most systems, units that are dispatched to provide [[reactive power]] to support transmission grids are declared to be "out-of-merit" (even though these are typically the same units that are located in constrained areas and would otherwise result in scarcity signals). System operators also normally bring units online to hold as "spinning-reserve" to protect against sudden outages or unexpectedly rapid ramps in demand, and declare them "out-of-merit". The result is often a substantial reduction in clearing price at a time when increasing demand would otherwise result in escalating prices.

Researchers have noted that a variety of factors, including energy price caps set well below the putative [[scarcity value]] of energy, the effect of "out-of-merit" dispatch, the use of techniques such as voltage reductions during scarcity periods with no corresponding scarcity [[price signal]], etc., results in a "missing money" problem. The consequence is that prices paid to suppliers in the "market" are substantially below the levels required to stimulate new entry. The markets have therefore been useful in bringing efficiencies to short-term system operations and dispatch, but have been a failure in what was advertised as a principal benefit: stimulating suitable new investment where it is needed, when it is needed.

In LMP markets, where constraints exist on a transmission network, there is a need for more expensive generation to be dispatched on the downstream side of the constraint. Prices on either side of the constraint separate giving rise to [[congestion pricing]] and [[constraint rentals]].

A constraint can be caused when a particular branch of a network reaches its thermal limit or when a potential overload will occur due to a contingent event (e.g., failure of a generator or transformer or a line outage) on another part of the network. The latter is referred to as a ''security constraint''. Transmission systems are operated to allow for continuity of supply even if a contingent event, like the loss of a line, were to occur. This is known as a ''security constrained system''.

In most systems the algorithm used is a "DC" model rather than an "AC" model, so constraints and redispatch resulting from thermal limits are identified/predicted, but constraints and redispatch resulting from reactive power deficiencies are not. Some systems take marginal losses into account. The prices in the real-time market are determined by the LMP algorithm described above, balancing supply from available units. This process is carried out for each 5-minute, half-hour or hour (depending on the market) interval at each node on the [[electric power transmission|transmission grid]]. The hypothetical redispatch calculation that determines the LMP must respect security constraints and the redispatch calculation must leave sufficient margin to maintain system stability in the event of an unplanned outage anywhere on the system. This results in a spot market with "bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices".

Since the introduction of the market, New Zealand has experienced shortages in 2001 and 2003, high prices all through 2005 and even higher prices and the risk of a severe shortage in 2006 (as of April 2006). These problems arose because New Zealand is at risk from drought due to its high proportion of electricity generated from hydro.

{{further|New Zealand electricity market}}

Many established markets do not employ nodal pricing, examples being the UK, [[EPEX SPOT]] (most European countries), and [[Nord Pool Spot]] (Nordic and Baltic countries).

=== Risk management ===

Financial risk management is often a high priority for participants in deregulated electricity markets due to the substantial price and volume risks that the markets can exhibit.
A consequence of the complexity of a wholesale electricity market can be extremely high price [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] at times of peak demand and supply shortages. The particular characteristics of this price risk are highly dependent on the physical fundamentals of the market such as the mix of types of generation plant and relationship between demand and weather patterns. Price risk can be manifest by price "spikes" which are hard to predict and price "steps" when the underlying fuel or plant position changes for long periods.

[[Volume risk]] is often used to denote the phenomenon whereby electricity market participants have uncertain volumes or quantities of consumption or production. For example, a retailer is unable to accurately predict consumer demand for any particular hour more than a few days into the future and a producer is unable to predict the precise time that they will have plant outage or shortages of fuel. A compounding factor is also the common correlation between extreme price and volume events. For example, price spikes frequently occur when some producers have plant outages or when some consumers are in a period of peak consumption. The introduction of substantial amounts of [[intermittent power sources]] such as [[wind energy]] may affect market prices.

Electricity retailers, who in aggregate buy from the wholesale market, and generators who in aggregate sell to the wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and to protect themselves from volatility, they will enter into "[[hedge (finance)|hedge]] contracts" with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price [[forward contract]]s for physical delivery and [[hedge (finance)|contracts for differences]] where the parties agree a [[strike price]] for defined time periods. In the case of a [[contract for difference]], if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the "strike" price, the generator will refund the difference between the "strike" price and the actual price for that period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the actual price is less than the "strike price". The actual price index is sometimes referred to as the "spot" or "pool" price, depending on the market.

Many other [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] arrangements, such as swing contracts, [[virtual bidding]], Financial Transmission Rights, [[call option]]s and [[put option]]s are traded in sophisticated electricity markets. In general they are designed to transfer financial risks between participants.

== Retail electricity market ==
{{Main|Electricity retailing}}

A '''retail electricity market''' exists when end-use customers can choose their supplier from competing [[electricity retailing|electricity retailers]]; one term used in the United States for this type of consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. [[Demand response]] may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.

Generally, electricity retail reform follows from electricity wholesale reform. However, it is possible to have a single electricity generation company and still have retail competition. If a wholesale price can be established at a node on the [[electric power transmission|transmission grid]] and the electricity quantities at that node can be reconciled, competition for retail customers within the [[electricity distribution|distribution]] system beyond the node is possible. In the German market, for example, large, vertically integrated utilities compete with one another for customers on a more or less open grid.

Although market structures vary, there are some common functions that an electricity retailer has to be able to perform, or enter into a contract for, in order to compete effectively. Failure or incompetence in the execution of one or more of the following has led to some dramatic financial disasters:

*[[Invoice|Billing]]
*Credit control
*Customer management via an efficient [[call centre]]
*[[Electricity distribution|Distribution]] use-of-system contract
*Reconciliation agreement
*"Pool" or "spot market" purchase agreement
*[[Hedge (finance)|Hedge]] contracts - contracts for differences to manage "spot price" risk

The two main areas of weakness have been [[risk management]] and [[invoice|billing]]. In the USA in 2001, [[California]]'s flawed [[regulation]] of retail competition led to the [[California electricity crisis]] and left incumbent retailers subject to high spot prices but without the ability to hedge against these (see [http://haas.berkeley.edu/news/california_electricity_crisis.html Manifesto on The California Electricity Crisis]). In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] a retailer, Independent Energy, with a large customer base went bust when it could not collect the money due from customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/independent-energy-collapses-with-customers-still-owing-pound119m-in-bills-699827.html Independent Energy collapses with customers still owing £119m in bills ] - The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitive retail needs open access to distribution and transmission wires. This in turn requires that prices must be set for both these services. They must also provide appropriate returns to the owners of the wires and encourage efficient location of power plants.
There are two types of fees, the access fee and the regular fee. The access fee covers the cost of having and accessing the network of wires available, or the right to use the existing transmission and distribution network. The regular fee reflects the marginal cost of transferring electricity through the existing network of wires.

[[Event-driven SOA|New technology]] is available and has been piloted by the US Department of Energy that may be better suited to real-time market pricing. A potential use of [[event-driven SOA]] could be a virtual electricity market where home clothes dryers can bid on the price of the electricity they use in a real-time market pricing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid26_gci1289658,00.html |title=Event-driven SOA enables homes to purchase electricity |publisher=Searchsoa.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real-time market price and control system could turn home [[electricity]] customers into active participants in managing the [[power grid]] and their monthly utility bills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/podcasts/howitworks/hiw_07312006_tr.pdf IBM Podcast How it works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125005304/http://www.ibm.com/podcasts/howitworks/hiw_07312006_tr.pdf |date=2011-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers can set limits on how much they would pay for electricity to run a clothes dryer, for example, and electricity providers willing to transmit power at that price would be alerted over the grid and could sell the electricity to the dryer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/news/us/en/2008/01/10/d132215g19733c54.html |title=10 Jan 2008 Grid project lets consumer handle electricity use - United States |publisher=IBM |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one side, consumer devices can bid for power based on how much the owner of the device were willing to pay, set ahead of time by the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.asp?id=285 |title=PNNL: News - Department of Energy putting power in the hands of consumers through technology |publisher=Pacific Northwest National Lab |date=2008-01-09 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, suppliers can enter bids automatically from their electricity generators, based on how much it would cost to start up and run the generators. Further, the [[regional electricity company|electricity suppliers]] could perform real-time [[market analysis]] to determine [[Rate of return|return-on-investment]] for optimizing profitability or reducing end-user [[Cost of goods sold|cost of goods]]. The effects of a competitive retail electricity market are mixed across states, but generally appear to lower prices in states with high participation and raise prices in states that have little customer participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2011/wp1105.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, ''Did Residential Electricity Rates Fall After Retail Competition? A Dynamic Panel Analysis'', May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Event-driven SOA]] software could allow homeowners to customize many different types of electricity devices found within their home to a desired level of comfort or economy. The event-driven software could also automatically respond to changing electricity prices, in as little as five-minute intervals. For example, to reduce the home owner's electricity usage in peak periods (when electricity is most expensive), the software could automatically lower the target temperature of the thermostat on the central heating system (in winter) or raise the target temperature of the thermostat on the central cooling system (in summer).

== Electricity market experience ==
In the main, experience in the introduction of wholesale and retail competition has been mixed. Many regional markets have achieved some success and the ongoing trend continues to be towards deregulation and introduction of competition. However, in 2000/2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333468/index.htm Power Failure The current scandals pale in comparison to the energy industry's biggest problem: massive debt it can't repay.]&lt;/ref&gt; major failures such as the [[California electricity crisis]] and the [[Timeline of the Enron scandal|Enron debacle]] caused a slow down in the pace of change and in some regions an increase in market regulation and reduction in competition. However, this trend is widely regarded as a temporary one against the longer term trend towards more open and competitive markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Notwithstanding the favorable light in which market solutions are viewed conceptually, the "missing money" problem has to date proved intractable. If electricity prices were to move to the levels needed to incentivize new merchant (i.e., market-based) transmission and generation, the costs to consumers would be politically difficult.

The increase in annual costs to consumers in [[New England]] alone were calculated at $3 billion during the recent [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|FERC]] hearings on the [[NEPOOL]] market structure. Several mechanisms that are intended to incent new investment where it is most needed by offering enhanced capacity payments (but only in zones where generation is projected to be short) have been proposed for NEPOOL, [[PJM Interconnection|PJM]] and [[NYPOOL]], and go under the generic heading of "locational capacity" or LICAP (the PJM version is called the "Reliability Pricing Model", or "RPM").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/rpm.aspx Markets and Operations] PJM&lt;/ref&gt; There is substantial doubt as to whether any of these mechanisms will in fact incent new investment, given the regulatory risk and chronic instability of the market rules in US systems, and there are substantial concerns that the result will instead be to increase revenues to incumbent generators, and costs to consumers, in the constrained areas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13857">'''Electromagnetic propulsion (EMP)''', is the principle of accelerating an object by the utilization of a flowing electrical current and magnetic fields. The [[electric current|electrical current]] is used to either create an opposing [[magnetic field]], or to charge a field, which can then be repelled. When a current flows through a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a [[Lorentz force]], pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed to take advantage of the phenomenon. The term electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) can be described by its individual components: [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]{{snd}}using electricity to create a magnetic field, and propulsion{{snd}}the process of propelling something. When a fluid (liquid or gas) is employed as the moving conductor, the propulsion may be termed [[magnetohydrodynamic drive]]. One key difference between EMP and propulsion achieved by electric motors is that the electrical energy used for EMP is not used to produce [[rotational energy]] for motion; though both use magnetic fields and a flowing electrical current.

The science of electromagnetic propulsion does not have origins with any one individual and has  application in many different fields. The thought of using magnets for propulsion continues to this day and has been dreamed of since at least 1897 when John Munro published his fictional story "A Trip to Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Munro | first = John | title = A Trip to Venus | publisher = Jarrold &amp; Sons | location = London | year = 1897 | pages = 26–28 | edition = 2007 IndyPublish }}, Archive.org: E-book: [https://archive.org/details/atriptovenus13716gut A Trip to Venus]&lt;/ref&gt; Current applications can be seen in [[Maglev (transport)|maglev trains]] and military [[railgun]]s. Other applications that remain not widely used or still in development include [[ion thruster]] for low orbiting satellites and [[magnetohydrodynamic drive]] for ships and submarines.

==History==

One of the first recorded discoveries regarding electromagnetic propulsion was in 1889 when Professor [[Elihu Thomson]] made public his work with electromagnetic waves and alternating currents.&lt;ref name = katetwo&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/thomson.html Inventor of the week- Elihu Thomson .

==Uses==

=== Trains ===
[[File:JR-Maglev-MLX01-2.jpg|thumb|[[SCMaglev]] on the [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] test track in Japan in November 2005]]

Electromagnetic propulsion is utilized in transportation systems to minimize friction and maximize speed over long distances. This has mainly been implemented in high-speed rail systems that use a linear induction motor to power trains by magnetic currents. It has also been utilized in theme parks to create high-speed [[roller coaster]]s and water rides.

'''Maglev'''
{{Main article|Maglev (transport)}}

	In a [[maglev (transport)|maglev train]] the primary coil assembly lies below the reaction plate.&lt;ref name =katenine /&gt; There is a 1–10&amp;nbsp;cm (0.39-3.93&amp;nbsp;inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for speeds up to 500&amp;nbsp;km/h (310&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name =katenine /&gt; An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field.&lt;ref name =kateseven /&gt; This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back.&lt;ref name =kateten&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2616339.stm Shanghai supertrain makes first journey. (2002, December 31). BBC News, Retrieved from  news.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs).&lt;ref name =kateeight /&gt; This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks.&lt;ref name =kateeight /&gt; Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight.&lt;ref name =kateseven /&gt; Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time.&lt;ref name =katesix /&gt; Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil.&lt;ref name =katefour /&gt; On average most trains travel 483&amp;nbsp;km/h (300&amp;nbsp;mph) and use 0.4 megajoules per passenger mile.&lt;ref name =kateeight /&gt; Using a 20&amp;nbsp;mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97&amp;nbsp;km/h (60&amp;nbsp;mph) and uses 4 megajoules per passenger mile.&lt;ref name =kateeight /&gt; The carbon dioxide emissions are based upon the method of electrical production and [[Fossil-fuel power station|fuel use]]. Many renewable electrical production methods generate little or no carbon dioxide during production (although carbon dioxide may be released during manufacture of the components, e.g. the steel used in wind turbines). The running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes.&lt;ref name =katefive /&gt;

=== Spacecraft ===
{{main article|Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion}}
There are multiple applications for EMP technologies in the field of aerospace. Many of these applications are conceptual as of now, however, there are also several applications that range from near term to next century.&lt;ref&gt;Byers, D. C. (1984). The NASA electric propulsion program. JSASS/AIAA/DGLR 17th International Electric Propulsion Conference, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; One of such applications is the use of EMP to control fine adjustments of orbiting satellites. One of these particular systems is based on the direct interactions of the vehicle's own electromagnetic field and the magnetic field of the Earth. The thrust force may be thought of as an electrodynamic force of interaction of the electric current inside its conductors with the applied natural field of the Earth.&lt;ref name =joetwelve&gt;Pulatov, V. (2001). Magnetic propulsion systems. Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 37(3), 245-261.&lt;/ref&gt; To attain a greater force of interaction, the magnetic field must be propagated further from the flight craft. The advantages of such systems is the very precise and instantaneous control over the thrust force. In addition, the expected electrical efficiencies are far greater than those of current chemical rockets that attain propulsion through the intermediate use of heat; this results in low efficiencies and large amounts of gaseous pollutants.&lt;ref name =joethirteen&gt;Pulatov, V. (2005). Physics of magnetic propulsion. Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 41(1), 64-91.&lt;/ref&gt; The electrical energy in the coil of the EMP system is translated to potential and kinetic energy through direct energy conversion. This results in the system having the same high efficiencies as other electrical machines while excluding the ejection of any substance into the environment.&lt;ref name =joethirteen /&gt;

The current thrust-to mass ratios of these systems are relatively low. Nevertheless, since they do not require propulsive mass, the vehicle mass is constant. Also, the thrust can be continuous with relatively low electric consumption.&lt;ref name =joetwelve /&gt; The biggest limitation would be mainly the electrical conductance of materials to produce the necessary values of the current in the propulsion system.

=== Ships and Submarines ===

EMP and its applications for seagoing ships and submarines have been investigated since at least 1958 when Warren Rice filed a patent explaining the technology {{Cite patent|US|2997013}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, W.A. (1961). U.S. Patent No. 2997013. Washington DC: US Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The technology described by Rice considered charging the hull of the vessel itself. The design was later refined by allowing the water to flow through thrusters as described in a later patent by James Meng {{Cite patent|US|5333444}}.&lt;ref&gt;Meng, J.C.S. (1994). U.S. Patent No. 5333444. Washington DC: US Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement consists of a water channel open at both ends extending longitudinally through or attached to the ship, a means for producing magnetic field throughout the water channel, [[electrode]]s at each side of the channel and source of power to send [[direct current]] through the channel at right angles to magnetic flux in accordance with Lorentz force.&lt;ref&gt;Friauf, J. B. (1961). Electromagnetic ship propulsion. American Society of Naval Engineers -- Journal, 73(1), 139-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elevators===
Cable-free [[elevator]]s using EMP, capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm [[Thyssen Krupp]] for use in high rise, high density buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MULTI - Rope-free elevator system - thyssenkrupp Elevator|url=https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|website=multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com|publisher=[[Thyssen Krupp]]|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Condliffe|first1=Jamie|title=Meet the world’s first cable-free elevator—it can zoom horizontally or vertically|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608167/worlds-first-cable-free-elevator-zooms-horizontally-and-vertically-using-maglev-tech/|website=MIT Technology Review|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2230">'''EMTP''' is an acronym for Electromagnetic [[Transient (oscillation)|Transients]] Program. It is a software tool used by power systems engineers to analyse electromagnetic transients and associated insulation issues.

EMTP originated in the [[habilitation]] (postdoctoral) thesis of Dr. [[Hermann W. Dommel|Hermann Dommel]] in Germany in the mid 1960s, and has been improved by the cooperation of many power engineering professionals—an effort led by Dr. Dommel (currently with the [[University of British Columbia]], in Vancouver, B.C., Canada), and Dr. Scott Meyer (from the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A.).

There are two basic streams of EMTP programs: the stream known simply as "EMTP" originates from the program development at BPA; other versions have been written from scratch. The EMTP-ATP and MT-EMTP programs, for example, are based on the original BPA and DCG-EMTP versions. The alternate stream of EMTP-type programs may use new numerical methods and modeling approaches, and provide significantly improved capabilities and numerical performances. Examples of this alternate stream include RTDS Technologies, PSCAD-EMTDC, EMTP-RV, MT-EMTP, EMTP-ATP, eMEGAsim and HYPERsim from Opal-RT Technologies.

==Uses==
It is said to have potential for optical applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Liska, P. |author2=Thampi, K. |author3=Gratzel, M. |author4=Bremaud, D. |author5=Rudmann, D. |author6=Upadhyaya, H. |title= Nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cell/copper indium gallium selenide thin-film tandem showing greater than 15% conversion efficiency|journal=[[Applied Physics Letters]]|year=2006|volume=88|page=203103|doi=10.1063/1.2203965|bibcode=2006ApPhL..88t3103L}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the exploitation of this potential has been limited by the ability to readily grow [[single crystal]]s&lt;ref name=voe&gt;{{cite journal|title=Large single crystals of gallium selenide: growing, doping by In and characterization|author=V. G. Voevodin|journal=[[Optical Materials]]|doi=10.1016/j.optmat.2003.09.014|year=2004|volume=26|pages=495|issue=4|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2004OptMa..26..495V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallium selenide crystals show great promise as a [[nonlinear optical]] material and [[photoconductor]]. Non-linear optical materials are used in the [[frequency conversion (laser light)|frequency conversion]] of [[laser light]]. Frequency conversion involves the shifting of the wavelength of a [[monochromatic]] source of light, usually laser light, to a higher or lower wavelength of light that cannot be produced from a conventional laser source.

Several methods of frequency conversion using [[non-linear optical material]]s exist. [[Second harmonic generation]] leads to doubling of the frequency of infrared [[carbon dioxide laser]]s. In optical parametric generation, the wavelength of light is doubled. Near-infrared [[solid-state laser]]s are usually used in optical parametric generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=B. Singh|title=Far-infrared conversion materials: Gallium selenide for far-infrared conversion applications|journal=[[Progress in Crystal Growth and Characterization of Materials]]|year=1998|volume=37|page=47|doi=10.1016/S0960-8974(98)00013-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One original problem with using gallium selenide in optics is that it is easily broken along cleavage lines and thus it can be hard to cut for practical application. It has been found, however, that [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] the crystals with [[indium]] greatly enhances their structural strength and makes their application much more practical.&lt;ref name=voe/&gt; There remain, however, difficulties with crystal growth that must be overcome before gallium selenide crystals may become more widely used in optics.

Single layers of gallium selenide are dynamically stable two-dimensional semiconductors, in which the valence band has an inverted Mexican-hat shape, leading to a Lifshitz transition as the hole-doping is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=V. Zolyomi |author2=N. D. Drummond |author3=V. I. Fal'ko |title= Band structure and optical transitions in atomic layers of hexagonal gallium chalcogenides|journal= Phys. Rev.

==Synthesis==
Synthesis of GaSe [[nanoparticle]]s is carried out by the reaction of [[trimethylgallium|GaMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] with [[trioctylphosphine selenium]] (TOPSe) in a high temperature solution of [[trioctylphosphine]] (TOP) and [[trioctylphosphine oxide]] (TOPO).&lt;ref name=nanl&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chikan, V.  |author2=Kelley, D.|title=Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Nanoparticles|journal=[[Nano Letters]]|year=2002|volume=2|page=141|doi=10.1021/nl015641m|issue=2|bibcode=2002NanoL...2..141C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:GaMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + P[(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se → GaSe

A solution of 15 g TOPO and 5 mL TOP is heated to 150&amp;nbsp;°C overnight under nitrogen, removing any water that may be present in the original TOP solution. This initial TOP solution is vacuum distilled at 0.75 torr, taking the fraction from 204&amp;nbsp;°C to 235&amp;nbsp;°C. A TOPSe solution (12.5 mL TOP with 1.579 g TOPSe) is then added and the TOPO/TOP/TOPSe reaction mixture is heated to 278&amp;nbsp;°C. GaMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0.8 mL) dissolved in 7.5 mL distilled TOP is then injected. After injection, the temperature drops to 254&amp;nbsp;°C before stabilizing in the range of 266-268&amp;nbsp;°C after 10 minutes. GaSe nanoparticles then begin to form, and may be detected by a shoulder in the optical absorption spectrum in the 400-450&amp;nbsp;nm range. After this shoulder is observed, the reaction mixture is left to cool to room temperature to prevent further reaction. After synthesis and cooling, the reaction vessel is opened and extraction of the GaSe nanoparticle solution is accomplished by addition of [[methanol]]. The distribution of nanoparticles between the polar (methanol) and non-polar (TOP) phases depends on experimental conditions. If the mixture is very dry, nanoparticles partition into the methanol phase. If the nanoparticles are exposed to air or water, however, the particles become uncharged and become partitioned into the non-polar TOP phase.&lt;ref name=nanl/&gt;

The '''"Green Run"''' was a secret U.S. Government release of [[radioactive]] [[fission products]] on December 2–3, 1949, at the [[Hanford Site]] [[plutonium]] production facility, located in [[Eastern Washington]]. [[Radioisotopes]] released at that time were supposed to be detected by U.S. Air Force reconnaissance. [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests to the U.S. Government have revealed some of the details of the experiment.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100812054326/http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/history/release.html#Green#Green The Release of Radioactive Materials from Hanford: 1944-1972]&lt;/ref&gt; Sources cite {{convert|5500|to|12000|Ci|TBq|lk=on}} of [[iodine-131]] released,&lt;ref name="wash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Under the Cloud: The Decades of Nuclear Testing |publisher=Two Sixty Press |location=[[The Woodlands, Texas]] |first=Richard L |last=Miller |pages=71 |year=1991 |isbn=0-02-921620-6}} (See [https://books.google.com/books?id=adI-6jRDipgC&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;vq=slotin&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=Hanford%20ton&amp;f=false Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goliszek"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goliszek|first=Andrew|title=In The Name of Science|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2003|isbn=978-0-312-30356-3}} pp. 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and an even greater amount of [[xenon-133]]. The radiation was distributed over populated areas, and caused the cessation of intentional radioactive releases at Hanford until 1962 when more experiments commenced.&lt;ref name="Goliszek" /&gt;

There are some indications contained in the documents released by the FOIA requests that many other tests were conducted in the 1940s prior to the Green Run, although the Green Run was a particularly large test. Evidence suggests that filters to remove the iodine were disabled during the Green Run.&lt;ref name="Goliszek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/381/3733.html |title=New documents reveal story behind green run |publisher=WISE News Communique |date=October 30, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project gets its name from the processing of uranium at Hanford, WA in an open loop/water cooled nuclear reactor for the sole purpose of irradiating the [[Uranium-238]] producing the fissile [[Plutonium-239]]. Due to other unwanted highly radioactive decay products being formed, normal batch processing would take place 83 to 101 days after reactor extraction to allow the radioactive isotopes to decay before extracting the fissile Plutonium-239 in a safe manner for the 30,000 nuclear weapons amassed and now [[MOX fuel]] during the cold war by the United States. For the Green Run test, a batch was fresh from the reactor with only a scheduled 16-day decay period and then was vented into the atmosphere prematurely. The unfiltered exhaust from the production facility was therefore much more radioactive than during a normal batch.

==Oral history==
Leland Fox says that his father was in the military and was bivouacked on the banks of the Wenatchee River during the Green Run:

{{quote|text=... and people with radiation suits walked around and moved the little colored flags as the radiation was detected.  The cooking was done outdoors and they slept near the beach.  The Officers did not stay long except to give orders and drive away.  Almost everyone that my father knew was there has died of cancer.  My father had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and died from the complications of lung cancer.  The Feds said that the leukemia can not be caused by iodine-131 but his doctor, Dr. Bonnie Takasugi of Burien WA, said that it most probably was.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}}}

Health Physicist Carl C. Gamertsfelder, Ph.D. described his recollections as to the reasons for the Green Run by attributing it to the intentions of the Air Force to be able to track Soviet releases.

{{quote|text=Herb Parker called me to request that I, and the groups that I supervised, cooperate with the Air Force in the conduct of an experiment which became known as the Green Run ... And we didn't recommend, we wouldn't have recommended, that they operate it. We told them that.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14409">'''Hibernation''' (or '''suspend to disk''') in computing is powering down a computer while retaining its state. Upon hibernation, the computer saves the contents of its [[random access memory]] (RAM) to a [[hard disk]] or other [[non-volatile storage]]. Upon resumption, the computer is exactly as it was before entering hibernation. 

==Uses==
After hibernating, the hardware is powered down like a regular shutdown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hibernation is a means of avoiding the burden of saving unsaved data before shutting down and restoring all running programs after powering back on. Hibernation is used in [[laptop]]s, which have limited battery power available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It can be set to happen automatically on a low battery alarm. Most desktops also support hibernation, mainly as a general energy saving measure.

==Comparison to sleep mode==
Many systems also support a low-power [[sleep mode]] in which the processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption is one of the advantages of sleep mode over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system in sleep mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in sleep mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in sleep mode results in data loss, while cutting the power of a system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the power is restored. Both shut down&lt;!-- past participle --&gt; and hibernated systems may consume [[standby power]] unless they are unplugged.

== Hybrid sleep ==
Sleep mode and hibernation can be combined: The contents of RAM are copied to the non-volatile storage and the computer enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, and its state, including open and unsaved files, survives a power outage. Hybrid sleep consumes as much power as sleep mode while hibernation powers down the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turn off a computer: frequently asked questions|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-off-a-computer-frequently-asked-questions|work=Windows Vista Online Help|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleep and hibernation: frequently asked questions|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Sleep-and-hibernation-frequently-asked-questions|work=Windows 7 Online Help|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating system support==
Early implementations of hibernation used the [[BIOS]], but modern operating systems usually handle hibernation. Hibernation is defined as sleeping mode S4 in the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpi.info/DOWNLOADS/ACPIspec30b.pdf ACPI Specification Rev 3.0b]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft Windows===

On Windows computers, hibernation is available only if '''all''' hardware and [[device driver|device drivers]] are ACPI and [[plug-and-play]]–compliant. Hibernation can be invoked from the [[Start menu]] or the command line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555569/ Microsoft Help and Support – How To Put the System into hibernation or Standby from Run menu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows 95]] supports hibernation through hardware manufacturer-supplied drivers and only if compatible hardware and BIOS are present. Since Windows 95 supports only [[Advanced Power Management]] (APM), hibernation is called Suspend-to-Disk. [[Windows 98]] and later support ACPI. However, hibernation often caused problems since most hardware was not fully ACPI 1.0 compliant or did not have [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] drivers. There were also issues with the FAT32 file system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/hiberfat32.mspx BIOS and Hibernate Issues for FAT32 File System]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows 2000]] is the first Windows to support hibernation at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) without special drivers from the hardware manufacturer. A hidden system file named "&lt;tt&gt;hiberfil.sys&lt;/tt&gt;" in the root of the [[boot partition]] is used to store the contents of RAM when the computer hibernates. In Windows 2000, this file is as big as the total RAM installed. 

[[Windows Me]], the last release in the [[Windows 9x]] family, also supports OS controlled hibernation and requires disk space equal to that of the computer's RAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activewin.com/interviews/microsoft/7.shtml |title=Interview with Nicolas Coudière, Chief Product Manager: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me) |publisher=Activewin.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/winpowmgmt.mspx#EUE |title=Windows Power Management |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2001-12-04 |accessdate=2010-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713182635/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/winpowmgmt.mspx|archivedate=2004-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows XP]] further improved support for hibernation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/winpowmgmt.mspx#EQAAC Windows Power Management: Instant PC availability and energy savings]&lt;/ref&gt; Hibernation and resumption are much faster as memory pages are compressed using an improved algorithm; compression is overlapped with disk writes, unused memory pages are freed and [[Direct memory access|DMA]] transfers are used during I/O.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/XP_kernel.mspx#EUNAC Kernel Enhancements for Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;tt&gt;hiberfil.sys&lt;/tt&gt; contains further information including processor state. This file was documented by a security researcher [[Matthieu Suiche]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://msuiche.net/con/bhusa2008/Windows_hibernation_file_for_fun_%27n%27_profit-0.6.pdf BlackHat USA 2008 – Windows hibernation file for fun and profit]&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Black Hat Briefings]] 2008 who also provided a [[computer forensics]] framework to manage and convert this file into a readable memory dump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sandman.msuiche.net SandMan Computer Forensics Framework]&lt;/ref&gt; The compression algorithm was later documented by Microsoft as well.&lt;ref name="hiberfil.sys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/E/7/7E7662CF-CBEA-470B-A97E-CE7CE0D98DC2/HiberFootprint.docx |title=Reducing the Disk Footprint for Windows 7 Hibernation |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Windows XP added support for more than 4 [[gigabyte]]s of memory (through [[Windows XP 64-bit Edition]] and [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]]), this operating system, as well as [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] do not support hibernation when this amount of memory is installed because of performance issues associated with saving such a large pool of data from RAM to disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888575|title = You cannot put a computer that has more than 4 GB of memory into hibernation in Windows XP, in Windows Server 2003, in Windows Vista, or in Windows Server 2008|date = 23 September 2011|website = Support|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|accessdate = 23 March 2014|edition = 9.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Vista introduced a hybrid sleep feature, which saves the contents of memory to hard disk but instead of powering down, enters sleep mode. If the power is lost, the computer can resume as if hibernated.

[[Windows 7]] introduced compression to the hibernation file and set the default size to 75% of the total physical memory.&lt;ref name="hiberfil.sys"/&gt; Microsoft also recommends to increase the size using the &lt;code&gt;powercfg.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool in some rare workloads where the memory footprint exceeds that amount. It can be set from anywhere between 50% to 100%, although decreasing it is not recommended.

[[Windows 8]]'s resume-from-hibernation algorithm is multi-core optimized. Windows 8 also introduces a ''Hybrid Boot'' feature. When users select the ''Shut Down'' option, it hibernates the computer, but closes all programs and logs out the user session before hibernating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fast-boot-times-in-windows-8.aspx Delivering fast boot times in Windows 8]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Microsoft, a regular hibernation includes more data in memory pages which takes longer to be written to disk. In comparison, when the user session is closed, the hibernation data is much smaller and therefore takes less time to write to disk and resume. Windows 8 also saves the kernel image. Users have the option of performing a traditional shutdown by holding down the ''Shift'' key while clicking ''Shut Down''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/10/25/windows-8-windows-server-2012-faster-boot-process/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hibernation is often under-used in business environments as it is [[Green computing#Operating system support|difficult to enable it on a large network of computers]] without resorting to third-party [[PC power management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datasynergy.co.uk/PowerManagerHome.aspx Enable hibernate using group policy]&lt;/ref&gt; This omission by Microsoft has been criticized as having led to a huge waste in energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php EcoGeek – How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===macOS===
{{Main|Sleep (macOS)}}
On Macs, a feature known as Safe Sleep saves the contents of volatile memory to the system hard disk each time the Mac enters Sleep mode. The Mac can instantaneously wake from sleep mode if power to the RAM has not been lost. However, if the power supply was interrupted, such as when removing batteries without an AC power connection, the Mac would wake from Safe Sleep instead, restoring memory contents from the hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302477|title=Apple Support: Progress bar appears after waking from sleep|date=February 20, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312183128/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302477|archivedate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Safe Sleep's hibernation process occurs during regular Sleep, the [[Apple menu]] does not have a "hibernate" option.

Safe Sleep capability was added in Mac models starting with the October 2005 [[PowerBook G4]] (Double-Layer SD). Safe Sleep requires [[Mac OS X v10.4]] or higher.

Shortly after Apple started supporting Safe Sleep, Mac enthusiasts released a hack to enable this feature for much older Mac computers running Mac OS X v10.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=AndrewEscobar.com|url=http://andrewescobar.com/archive/2005/11/11/how-to-safe-sleep-your-mac/|title=How to Safe Sleep (Hibernate) Your Mac|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105000720/http://andrewescobar.com/archive/2005/11/11/how-to-safe-sleep-your-mac/|archivedate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[classic Mac OS]] once also supported hibernation, but this feature was dropped by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=59016|title=Sleep Memory Extension 1.0 Document and Software|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819171424/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=59016|archivedate=August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux===
In the [[Linux kernel]], hibernation is implemented by [[swsusp]] which is built into the 2.6 series. An alternative implementation is [[TuxOnIce]] which is available as patches for the kernel version 3.4. TuxOnIce provides advantages such as support for [[symmetric multiprocessing]] and [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]]. Another alternative implementation is [[uswsusp]]. All three refer to it as "suspend-to-disk".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6370">[[File:Euler curve illustration.jpg|thumb|right|Curve of Euler's formula for buckling. The area above the curve indicates failure while the area under the curve represents scenarios that would not cause failure.]]
The '''Johnson formula''' is an empirically based formula relating the slenderness ratio to the stress illustrating the critical load required to buckle a column. The formula is based on empirical results by J. B. Johnson from around 1900 as an alternative to [[Euler's critical load]] formula under low slenderness ratio conditions.

Buckling refers to a mode of failure in which the structure loses stability. It is caused by a lack of structural stiffness.&lt;ref&gt;Rice University (2009). "Buckling Analysis". Retrieved from https://www.clear.rice.edu/mech403/HelpFiles/FEA_Buckling_analysis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Placing a load on a long slender bar will cause a buckling failure before the specimen can fail by compression.&lt;ref&gt;Dornfeld, W (27 October 2016. "Machine Design". ''Fairfield University''. Retrieved from http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/wdornfeld/ME311/ME311MachineDesignNotes07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to calculate buckling is to utilize Euler's formula, which produces a critical stress vs. slenderness curve such as the one illustrated to the right.

However, depending on the geometry of the structure under stress, this equation is not always applicable, and the Johnson parabola should be used.

== Situations in which to apply the Johnson parabola ==
Euler's formula is displayed as such:
&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{cr}={P_{cr} \over A}={\pi^2EI \over AL^2}={\pi^2E \over \left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{cr} =&lt;/math&gt; critical stress, 
:&lt;math&gt;P_{cr} = &lt;/math&gt; critical force,
:&lt;math&gt;A = &lt;/math&gt; area of cross section,
:&lt;math&gt;L =&lt;/math&gt; length of the rod,
:&lt;math&gt;E = &lt;/math&gt; modulus of elasticity,
:&lt;math&gt;I = &lt;/math&gt; area moment of inertia of the cross section of the rod,
:&lt;math&gt;{l \over k}&lt;/math&gt; = slenderness ratio.

Euler's equation is useful in situations such as an ideal pinned-pinned column, or in cases in which the effective length can be used to adjust the existing formula (ie. Fixed-Free).&lt;ref&gt;MechaniCalc (2016). "Column Buckling". Retrieved from https://mechanicalc.com/reference/column-buckling&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Pinned-Pinned !! Fixed-Fixed !! Fixed-Pinned !! Fixed-Free
|-
| Effective Length, &lt;math&gt;L_e&lt;/math&gt; || 1 || 0.5L || 0.7L || 2L
|}
(L is the original length of the specimen before the force was applied.)

However, certain geometries are not accurately represented by the Euler formula. One of the variables in the above equation that reflects the geometry of the specimen is the slenderness ratio, which is the column's length divided by the radius of gyration.&lt;ref&gt;Bello, D (2016). "Buckling". ''Allan Hancock College''. Retrieved from http://www.ah-engr.com/som/10_buckling/text_10-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The slenderness ratio of the member can be found with &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )=L_e\sqrt{A \over I}&lt;/math&gt; while the critical slenderness ratio is &lt;math&gt;{\left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )}_{cr}=\sqrt{2\pi^2E \over \sigma_y}&lt;/math&gt;

In practical terms, the slenderness ratio is an indicator of the specimen's resistance to bending and buckling, due to its length and cross section. If the slenderness ratio is less than the critical slenderness ratio, the column is considered to be a short column. In these cases, the Johnson parabola is more applicable than the Euler formula.&lt;ref&gt;Engineers Edge (2016). "Ideal Pinned Column Buckling Calculation and Equation". Retrieved from http://www.engineersedge.com/column_buckling/column_ideal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of the Johnson Parabola ==

[[File:Euler johnson crit NEW.jpg|thumb|right|Graph of Johnson's parabola (plotted in red) against Euler's formula, with the transition point indicated. The Johnson parabola creates a new region of failure.]]

Johnson's formula rounds out the function given by Euler's formula. It creates a new failure border by fitting a parabola to the graph of failure for Euler buckling.

::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{cr}=\sigma_y-{1\over E}{\left ( \frac{\sigma_y}{2\pi} \right )}^2{\left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )}^2&lt;/math&gt;

There is a transition point on the graph of the Euler curve, located at the critical slenderness ratio. At slenderness values lower than this point (occurring in specimens with a relatively short length compared to their cross section), the graph will follow the Johnson parabola; in contrast, larger slenderness values will align more closely with the Euler equation.

== Application of the Johnson Parabola ==

One common material in aerospace applications is Al 2024. Certain material properties of Al 2024 have been determined experimentally, such as the tensile yield strength (324 MPa) and the modulus of elasticity (73.1 GPa). &lt;ref&gt;CRP Meccanica. "Aluminum 2024-T4". Retrieved from http://www.crpmeccanica.com/PDF/aluminium-2024-t4-2024-t351.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Euler formula could be used to plot a failure curve, but it would not be accurate below a certain &lt;math&gt;\frac{l}{k}&lt;/math&gt; value, the critical slenderness ratio.

::&lt;math&gt;{\left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )}_{cr}=\sqrt{2\pi^2E \over \sigma_y}=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi^2 \cdot 73.1 \cdot 10^9}{324 \cdot 10^6}}=66.7&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Euler equation is applicable for values of  &lt;math&gt;\frac{l}{k}&lt;/math&gt; greater than 66.7.
::Euler: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{cr}={\pi^2E \over \left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )^2}={\pi^2 \cdot 73.1 \cdot 10^9 \over \left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )^2}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\frac{l}{k}&gt;66.7&lt;/math&gt;
::: (units in Pascals)

Johnson's parabola takes care of the smaller &lt;math&gt;\frac{l}{k}&lt;/math&gt; values.
::Johnson: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{cr}=\sigma_y-{1\over E}{\left ( \frac{\sigma_y}{2\pi} \right )}^2{\left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )}^2=324 \cdot 10^6-{1\over 73.1 \cdot 10^9}{\left ( \frac{324 \cdot 10^6}{2\pi} \right )}^2{\left ( \frac{l}{k} \right )}^2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0\le \frac{l}{k}\le 66.7&lt;/math&gt;

'''Khātam''' ({{lang-fa|خاتم}}) is an ancient [[Persian people|Persian]] technique of inlaying. It is a  version of [[marquetry]] where art forms are made by decorating the surface of wooden articles with delicate pieces of [[wood]], [[bone]] and [[metal]] precisely-cut intricate geometric patterns. '''Khatam-kari''' ({{lang-fa|خاتم‌کاری}}) or '''khatam-bandi''' ({{lang-fa|خاتم‌بندی}}) refers to the art of crafting a khatam. Common materials used in the construction of inlaid articles are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[brass]], [[aluminum]] and [[twisted wire]].

==Design and construction==
Designing of inlaid articles is a highly elaborate process. There are sometimes more than 400 pieces per square inch in a work of average quality.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. S. (1967). Materials.

Inlaid articles in the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid era]] took on a special significance as artists created their precious artworks. Woods used include [[betel]], [[walnut]], [[cypress]] and [[pine]].

==Examples==
[[File:Boite khatam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A simple Khatam [[marquetry]] box decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of triangles and 6-point stars on its sides, and a floral design on its lid]]
The ornamentation of the doors of holy places predominantly consists of inlaid motifs. Samples of these can be observed in the cities of [[Mashhad]], [[Qom]], [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. In the Safavid era, the art of marquetry flourished in the southern cities of Iran, especially in [[Isfahan]], [[Shiraz]] and [[Kerman]]. The inlaid-ornamented rooms at the [[Saadabad Palace]] and  the [[Marble Palace (Tehran)|Marble Palace]] in [[Tehran]] are among masterpieces of this art.

==Current status==
Khatam is practiced in Isfahan, Shiraz and Tehran. The art of inlaid and sudorific woodwork is undertaken in the workshops of the [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran]], as well as in private workshops.

Master Mohammad Bagher Hakim-Elahi (محمد باقرحكيم الهي) was a master of this art, and learned the techniques from Master Sanee Khatam in Shiraz.  Later in life, in early 1950's, he moved to Tehran, where he lived until the end of his life in March 2012.  He continued making Khatam master pieces, ranging from small frames, and jewelry boxes, to large items such as coffee tables, bed frames, dinner tables, and large chandeliers, some of which are currently in Museums in Iran, but most are in private collection all around the world, including southern California.  He also taught the art to his younger brother Asadolah Hakim-Elahi (ﺍﺴﺪﷲ ﺤﻛﻴﻢﺍﻠﻬﻰ).  Asadolah died from lymphoma in the late 1970s when he was in his mid 40s.

'''Lithium fluoride''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] LiF. It is a colorless solid, that transitions to white with decreasing crystal size. Although odorless, lithium fluoride has a bitter-saline taste. Its structure is analogous to that of [[sodium chloride]], but it is much less soluble in water. It is mainly used as a component of [[molten salt]]s.&lt;ref name=Aigs&gt;J. Aigueperse, P. Mollard, D. Devilliers, M. Chemla, R. Faron, R. Romano, J. P. Cuer, "Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Formation of LiF from the elements releases one of the highest [[Energy Density|energy per mass of reactants]], second only to that of [[BeO]].

==Manufacturing==
LiF is prepared from [[lithium hydroxide]] or [[lithium carbonate]] with [[hydrogen fluoride]].&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Bellinger et al. "Improved High Efficiency Stacked Microstructured Neutron Detectors Backfilled with Nanoparticle &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;LiF," IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci., '''59''' (2012) 167-173 .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===In molten salts===
Fluorine is produced by the [[electrolysis]] of molten [[potassium bifluoride]].  This electrolysis proceeds more efficiently when the electrolyte contains a few percent of LiF, possibly because it facilitates formation of Li-C-F interface on the carbon [[electrode]]s.&lt;ref name=Aigs/&gt; A useful molten salt, [[FLiNaK]], consists of a mixture of LiF, together with [[sodium fluoride]] and [[potassium fluoride]].  The primary coolant for the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] was [[FLiBe]]; LiF-BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (66-33 mol%).

===Optics===
Because of the large [[band gap]] for LiF, its crystals are [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] to short wavelength [[ultraviolet]] [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]], more so than any other [[chemical substance|material]]. LiF is therefore used in specialized UV [[optics]],&lt;ref name="crystran.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web | title= Crystran Ltd., a manufacturer of infrared and ultraviolet optics| url=http://www.crystran.co.uk/lithium-fluoride-lif.htm | accessdate = 2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (See also [[magnesium fluoride]]). Lithium fluoride is used also as a diffracting crystal in X-ray spectrometry.

===Radiation detectors===
It is also used as a means to record [[ionizing radiation]] exposure from [[gamma rays]], [[beta particles]], and [[neutrons]] (indirectly, using the [[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]] (n,alpha) [[nuclear reaction]]) in [[thermoluminescent dosimeter]]s. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;LiF nanopowder enriched to 96% has been used as the neutron reactive backfill material for microstructured semiconductor neutron detectors (MSND) &lt;ref&gt;D.S. McGregor, S.L. Bellinger, and J.K. Shultis, "Present Status of Microstructured Semiconductor Neutron Detectors, '''379''' (2013) 99-110.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Nuclear reactors===
Lithium fluoride (highly enriched in the common isotope lithium-7) forms the basic constituent of the preferred fluoride salt mixture used in [[Liquid Fluoride Reactor|liquid-fluoride nuclear reactors]].  Typically lithium fluoride is mixed with [[beryllium fluoride]] to form a base solvent ([[FLiBe]]), into which fluorides of uranium and thorium are introduced.  Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF/BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures ([[FLiBe]]) have low melting points (360 C - 459 C) and the best neutronic properties of fluoride salt combinations appropriate for reactor use. [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]] used two different mixtures in the two cooling circuits.

===Cathode for PLED and OLEDs===
Lithium fluoride is widely used in [[PLED]] and [[OLED]] as a coupling layer to enhance electron injection.  The thickness of LiF layer is usually around 1&amp;nbsp;nm. The dielectric constant (or relative permittivity) of LiF is 9.0&lt;ref name=ANDEEN&gt;
C. Andeen, J. Fontanella,D. Schuel, "Low-Frequency Dielectric Constant of LiF, NaF, NaC1, NaBr, KC1, and KBr by the Method of Substitution", Physical Review B, 2, 5068-5073 (1970) {{DOI|10.1103/PhysRevB.2.5068}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural occurrence===
Naturally occurring lithium fluoride is known as the mineral griceite. It is extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;Mindat {{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-1749.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307080246/http://www.mindat.org/min-1749.html |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Ludovic Hubler''' is a French traveller, most famous for his 5-year tour of the world completed entirely by hitchhiking (car, boat, etc.). He wrote the travelbook Le Monde en stop, rewarded by the 2010 [[Pierre Loti]] award.

== Biography ==
===Childhood===
Born on September 11, 1977, Ludovic Hubler is the son of Monique and Jacques Hubler and the brother of the consultant Eric Hubler and the photograph Marc Hubler. Passionate about football and geography, he grew up in Wasselonne and Obernai in the Alsace region in eastern France. In June 2002, he graduated from [[EM Strasbourg Business School]] with a Master of Science in Management.

===Tour of the world by hitchhiking===
At the end of his Master's program, believing that discovering the realities of the world was a valuable pre-requisite to entering the work world, Ludovic Hubler decided to start a tour of the world using hitchhiking as his only means of transportation.

This adventure, which he baptized his, "life Phd", lasted 5 years during 2003-2008. From "sail-boat hitchhiking" to cross the Atlantic and the Pacific, to "ice breaker hitchhiking" to reach Antarctica; from crossing the Sahara desert or visiting countries as notorious as Colombia and Afghanistan, Ludovic used his thumb in all kinds of improbable and difficult to imagine situations.

His encounters were as numerous as they were diverse. Among the most striking is his meeting with the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who received him in his hometown [[Dharamshala]] (India) in 2007 but so were some of the thousands of students in all corners of the world with whom he shared his story.

Totalling the 5 years, the 170,000 kilometers travelled, the 59 countries visited, the hundreds of lectures given and recalling gratitude for the help of over 1,300 drivers gives an idea of the richness of Ludovic's trip - an adventure that was shared on a daily basis with pediatric cancer patients at the [[Hôpital civil, Strasbourg|Hospital of Strasbourg]], back home in Strasbourg, France.

===After the tour===
Ludovic Hubler now lives in Menton and works as Head of Programmes and Field Operations for [[Peace and Sport]], ''L'organisation pour la paix par le sport'' placed under the High Patronage of HSH Prince [[Albert II of Monaco]].

He continues to regularly give lectures sharing his journey and what he learned on the road. Ludovic Hubler is now married to Panamanian native Marisol Richards Espinosa, whom he met during the trip in September 2005, as he hitchhiked through Panama.

'''Mucking Marshes landfill''' was a major [[landfill]] site servicing [[London]], close to the ham of [[Mucking]]. Covering hundreds of acres of former [[gravel]] [[quary]], it was one of the largest landfills in [[Western Europe]] and had been filled for decades with [[municipal waste|municipal]] and [[commercial waste]] floated thirty miles down the [[River Thames]] in [[barges]] to Mucking [[Wharf]].&lt;ref name="Big Landfills in Europe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@emmabarkerjones/being-a-garbage-collector-is-the-best-job-ever-cc65ec4aa42d/|title=Mucking Marshes Landfill|accessdate=2015-04-08|year=2015|author=Rubbish Please}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barges, each carrying dozens of distinctive yellow containers, were a familiar, though rarely commented-upon, sight along the Thames through Central London. Once the barges had travelled {{convert|30|mi|km}} downstream from [[Walbrook Wharf]], mechanical [[crane (machine)|cranes]] at Mucking Wharf unloaded the containers onto [[truck]]s. The trucks made their way up the artificial [[mound]] created by decades of garbage compaction that still towers over the surrounding flat landscape. Flocks of [[seagulls]] and other scavenging estuarine birds were a familiar sight as the trucks disgorged their contents. 

The former landfill site itself, although it dominates the village of [[Mucking]], is guarded and surrounded by a [[perimeter fence]] more than four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) long. [[Cory Environmental]], the operators of the site, gated off Mucking Wharf Road so that views of the Thames meeting the [[North Sea]] can now be accessed from Mucking only via a circuitous footpath through the neighbouring village of [[East Tilbury]].{{fact|date=November 2017}}

== Conversion to a nature park ==

More prosaically, pure electron plasmas are used to produce the microwaves in microwave ovens, via the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron instability]].

Neutral plasmas in contact with a solid surface (that is, most laboratory plasmas) are typically non-neutral in their edge regions. Due to unequal loss rates to the surface for electrons and ions, an electric field (the [[Ambipolar diffusion|"ambipolar field"]] ) builds up, acting to hold back the more mobile species until the loss rates are the same. The electrostatic potential (as measured in electron-volts) required to produce this electric field depends on many variables but is often on the order of the electron temperature.

Non-neutral plasmas for which all species have the same sign of charge have [[Non-neutral plasmas#Equilibrium of a single species non-neutral plasma|exceptional confinement properties]] compared to neutral plasmas. They can be confined in a [[thermal equilibrium]] state using only static electric and magnetic fields, in a [[Penning trap]] configuration (see Fig. 1).&lt;ref name = "Dubin"&gt;Daniel H. E.

Such non-neutral plasmas can also access novel states of matter. For instance, they can be cooled to cryogenic temperatures without [[Recombination (physics)|recombination]] (since there is no oppositely charged species with which to recombine).

==Equilibrium of a single species non-neutral plasma ==

Non-neutral plasmas with a single sign of charge can be confined for long periods of time using only static electric and magnetic fields. One such configuration is called a [[Penning trap]], after the inventor [[Frans Michel Penning|F. M. Penning]]. The cylindrical version of the trap is also sometimes referred to as a Penning-Malmberg trap, after Prof. John Malmberg. The trap consists of several cylindrically symmetric electrodes and a uniform magnetic field applied along the axis of the trap (Fig 1). Plasmas are confined in the axial direction by biasing the end electrodes so as to create an axial potential well that will trap charges of a given sign (the sign is assumed to be positive in the figure). In the radial direction, confinement is provided by the {{nowrap|v × B}} [[Lorentz force]] due to rotation of the plasma about the trap axis. Plasma rotation causes an inward directed Lorentz force that just balances the outward directed forces caused by the unneutralized plasma as well as the centrifugal force. Mathematically, radial force balance implies a balance between electric, magnetic and centrifugal forces:&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 0= q E_r +q v_\theta B + m {v_\theta}^2/r ,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where particles are assumed to have mass ''m'' and charge ''q'', ''r'' is radial distance from the trap axis and ''E&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radial component of the electric field. This quadratic equation can be solved for the rotational velocity &lt;math&gt; v_\theta&lt;/math&gt;, leading to two solutions, a slow-rotation and a fast-rotation solution. The rate of rotation &lt;math&gt;\omega = -v_\theta/r&lt;/math&gt; for these two solutions can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = \frac{\Omega_c}{2} \pm\sqrt{{\Omega_c}^2/4-q E_r/{m r}} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_c = q B/m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cyclotron frequency]]. Depending on the radial electric field, the solutions for the rotation rate fall in the range &lt;math&gt; 0 \le \omega/\Omega_c  \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;. The slow and fast rotation modes meet when the electric field is such that &lt;math&gt; q E_r/{m r} = {\Omega_c}^2/4 &lt;/math&gt;. This is called the Brillouin limit; it is an equation for the maximum possible radial electric field that allows plasma confinement.

This radial electric field can be related to the plasma density ''n'' through the [[Poisson equation]],

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r E_r)= qn/\epsilon_0 , &lt;/math&gt;

and this equation can be used to obtain a relation between the density and the plasma rotation rate. If we assume that the rotation rate is uniform in radius (i.e. the plasma rotates as a rigid body), then  Eq. (1) implies that the radial electric field is proportional to radius ''r''. Solving for ''E&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' from this equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and substituting the result into Poisson's equation yields

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; n=\frac{2\epsilon_0 m\omega(\Omega_c-\omega)}{q^2}. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This equation implies that the maximum possible density occurs at the Brillouin limit, and has the value

:&lt;math&gt; n_B= \frac{\epsilon_0 m {\Omega_c}^2}{2 q^2}=\frac{B^2/(2 \mu_0)}{m c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; c=1/\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light. Thus, the  rest energy density of the plasma, n·m·c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is less than or equal to the magnetic energy density &lt;math&gt; B^2/(2\mu_0)&lt;/math&gt; of the magnetic field. This is a fairly stringent requirement on the density. For a magnetic field of 10 tesla, the Brillouin density for electrons is only n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|4.8|e=14|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The density predicted by Eq.(2), scaled by the Brillouin density, is shown as a function of rotation rate in Fig. (2). Two rotation rates yield the same density, corresponding to the slow and fast rotation solutions.
[[File:plasma density.jpg|thumb|right|alt=plasma density versus rotation rate.| Fig. 2. Density versus rotation rate for a single species plasma confined in a Penning trap.]]

=== Plasma loss processes; the rotating wall method ===

In experiments on single species plasmas, plasma rotation rates in the tens of kHz range are not uncommon, even in the slow rotation mode. This rapid rotation is necessary to provide the confining radial Lorentz force for the plasma. However, if there is neutral gas in the trap, collisions between the plasma and the gas cause the plasma rotation to slow, leading to radial expansion of the plasma until it comes in contact with the surrounding electrodes and is lost. This loss process can be alleviated by operating the trap in an ultra high vacuum. However, even under such conditions the plasma rotation can still be slowed through the interaction of the plasma with "errors" in the external confinement fields. If these fields are not perfectly cylindrically symmetric, the asymmetries can torque on the plasma, reducing the rotation rate. Such field errors are unavoidable in any actual experiment, and limit the plasma confinement time.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Malmberg and C.F. Driscoll, "Long-Time Containment of a Pure Electron Plasma", Phys. Rev. Lett. 44, 654 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to overcome this plasma loss mechanism by applying a rotating field error to the plasma. If the error rotates faster than the plasma, it acts to spin up the plasma (similar to how the spinning blade of a blender causes the food to spin), counteracting the effect of field errors that are stationary in the frame of the laboratory. This rotating field error is referred to as a "rotating wall", after the theory idea that one could reverse the effect of a trap asymmetry by simply rotating the entire trap at the plasma rotation frequency. Since this is impractical, one instead rotates the trap electric field rather than the entire trap, by applying suitably phased voltages to a set of electrodes surrounding the plasma.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt;

==Cryogenic non-neutral plasmas: correlated states ==

When a non-neutral plasma is cooled to cryogenic temperatures, it does not recombine to a neutral gas as would a neutral plasma, because there are no oppositely charged particles with which to recombine. As a result, the system can access novel strongly coupled non-neutral states of matter, including plasma crystals consisting solely of a single charge species. These strongly coupled non-neutral plasmas are parametrized by the coupling parameter &amp;Gamma;, defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{q^2}{4 \pi\epsilon_0 k_B T a},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]] (or mean inter-particle spacing), given in terms of the density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by the expression &lt;math&gt; 4\pi a^3 n/3 =1&lt;/math&gt;. The coupling parameter can be thought of as the ratio of the mean interaction energy between nearest-neighbor pairs, &lt;math&gt; q^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0 a)&lt;/math&gt;, and the mean kinetic energy of order &lt;math&gt; k_b T&lt;/math&gt;. When this ratio is small, interactions are weak and  the plasma is nearly an ideal gas of charges moving in the mean-field produced by the other charges. However, when &lt;math&gt;\Gamma &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; interactions between particles are important and the plasma behaves more like a liquid, or even a crystal if &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently large. In fact, computer simulations and theory have predicted that for an infinite homogeneous plasma the system exhibits a gradual onset of short-range order consistent with a liquid-like state for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \approx 2 &lt;/math&gt;, and there is predicted to be a first-order phase transition to a body-centered-cubic crystal for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\simeq 175&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Dubin"/&gt;

Experiments have observed this crystalline state in a pure beryllium ion plasma  that was laser-cooled to the millikelvin temperature range. The mean inter-particle spacing in this pure ion crystal was on the order of 10-20&amp;nbsp;[[µm]], much larger than in neutral crystalline matter. This spacing corresponds to a density on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, somewhat less than the Brillouin limit for beryllium in the 4.5 tesla magnetic field of the experiment. Cryogenic temperatures were then required in order to obtain a &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; value in the strongly coupled regime. The experiments measured the crystal structure by the [[Bragg scattering|Bragg-scattering]] technique, wherein a collimated laser beam was scattered off of the crystal, displaying Bragg peaks at the expected scattering angles for a bcc lattice (See Fig. 3).&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

When small numbers of ions are laser-cooled, they form crystalline "Coulomb clusters". The symmetry of the cluster depends on the form of the external confinement fields.  An interactive 3D view of some of the clusters  can be found [http://physics.ucsd.edu/~dhdpla/example.html here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">'''Pipe flow''', a branch of [[hydraulics]] and [[fluid mechanics]], is a type of [[liquid]] flow within a closed [[Conduit (fluid conveyance)|conduit]] (conduit in the sense of a means of containment). The other type of flow within a conduit is [[open channel flow]]. 
These two types of flow are similar in many ways, but differ in one important aspect. Pipe flow does not have a [[free surface]] which is found in open-channel flow. Pipe flow, being confined within closed conduit, does not exert direct atmospheric pressure, but does exert hydraulic pressure on the conduit.

Not all flow within a closed conduit is considered pipe flow. [[Storm sewer]]s are closed conduits but usually maintain a free surface and therefore are considered open-channel flow. The exception to this is when a storm sewer operates at full capacity, and then can become pipe flow.

Energy in pipe flow is expressed as [[Hydraulic head|head]] and is defined by the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]]. In order to conceptualize head along the course of flow within a pipe, diagrams often contain a hydraulic grade line. Pipe flow is subject to frictional losses as defined by the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy-Weisbach formula]].

==States of flow==
The behavior of pipe flow is governed mainly by the effects of [[viscosity]] and gravity relative to the [[inertia]]l forces of the flow. Depending on the effect of viscosity relative to inertia, as represented by the [[Reynolds number]], the flow can be either [[laminar flow|laminar]] or [[turbulent flow|turbulent]]. At a [[Reynolds number]] below the critical value of approximately 2040&lt;ref name=Recrit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avila|first=K.|author2=D. Moxey |author3=A. de Lozar |author4=M. Avila |author5=D.

In addition, the transition between laminar flow and turbulence can be sensitive to disturbance levels and imperfections.

Flow through pipes can roughly be divided into two:

*[[Turbulent flow]] - see [[Moody diagram]]

==Structure and Bonding==
The crystal structure of PtSi is orthorhombic, with each silicon atom having six neighboring platinum atoms. The distances between the silicon and the platinum neighbors are as follows: one at a distance of 2.41 angstroms, two at a distance of 2.43 angstroms, one at a distance of 2.52 angstroms, and the final two at a distance of 2.64 angstroms. Each platinum atom has six silicon neighbors at the same distances, as well as two platinum neighbors, at a distance of 2.87 and 2.90 angstroms. All of the distances over 2.50 angstroms are considered too far to really be involved in bonding interactions of the compound. As a result, it has been shown that two sets of covalent bonds compose the bonds forming the compound. One set is the three center Pt-Si-Pt bond, and the other set the two center Pt-Si bonds. Each silicon atom in the compound has one three center bond and two two center bonds. The thinnest film of PtSi would consist of two alternating planes of atoms, a single sheet of orthorhombic structures. Thicker layers are formed by stacking pairs of the alternating sheets. The mechanism of bonding between PtSi is more similar to that of pure silicon than pure platinum or Pt2Si, though experimentation has revealed metallic bonding character in PtSi that pure silicon lacks.&lt;ref name="Kelp"&gt;

   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

===Methods===
PtSi can be synthesized in several ways. The standard method involves depositing a thin film of pure platinum onto silicon wafers and heating in a conventional furnace at 450-600&amp;nbsp;°C for a half an hour in inert ambients. The process cannot be carried out in an oxygenated environment, as this results in the formation of an oxide layer on the silicon, preventing PtSi from forming.&lt;ref name="Pant"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
A secondary technique for synthesis requires a [[Sputtering|sputtered]] platinum film deposited on a silicon substrate. Due to the ease with which PtSi can become contaminated by oxygen, several variations of the methods have been reported. Rapid thermal processing has been shown to increase the purity of PtSi layers formed.&lt;ref name="Naem" &gt;

, higher temperatures produce thicker PtSi layers, though temperatures in excess of 950&amp;nbsp;°C formed PtSi with increased resistivity due to clusters of large PtSi grains.&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;

===Kinetics===
Despite the synthesis method employed, PtSi forms in the same way. When pure platinum is first heated with silicon, Pt2Si is formed. Once all the available Pt and Si are used and the only available surfaces are Pt2Si, the silicide will begin the slower reaction of converting into PtSi. The activation energy for the Pt2Si reaction is around 1.38 eV, while it is 1.67 eV for PtSi. 
	
Oxygen is extremely detrimental to the reaction, as it will bind preferably to Pt, limiting the sites available for Pt-Si bonding and preventing the silicide formation. A partial pressure of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as low at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; has been found to be sufficient to slow the formation of the silicide. To avoid this issue inert ambients are used, as well as small annealing chambers to minimize amount of potential contamination.&lt;ref name=Pant /&gt; The cleanliness of the metal film is also extremely important, and unclean conditions result in poor PtSi synthesis.&lt;ref name=Crider /&gt; 
	
However, in certain cases an oxide layer can be beneficial. When PtSi is used as a [[Schottky barrier]], an oxide layer has been shown to be protective and prevent wear of the PtSi.&lt;ref name=Pant /&gt;

==Applications==
PtSi is a [[semiconductor]] and a Schottky barrier with high stability and good sensitivity, and can be used in infrared detection, thermal imaging, or ohmic and Schottyky contacts.&lt;ref name="Azom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=8449 |title=Platinum Silicide (PtSi) Semiconductors |publisher=A to Z Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platinum silicide was most widely studied and used in the 1980s and 90’s, but has become less commonly used, due to its low quantum efficiency. PtSi is now most commonly used in infrared detectors, due to the large size of wavelengths it can be used to detect.&lt;ref name="Del"&gt;

Platinum silicide offers high uniformity of arrays imaged. The low cost and stability makes it suited for preventative maintenance and scientific IR imaging.

'''Power density''' (or ''volume power density'' or ''volume specific power'') is the amount of [[Power (physics)|power]] (time rate of [[energy transfer]]) per unit [[volume]].

In [[energy transformation|energy transformers]] including [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[fuel cell]]s, motors, etc., and also [[power supply]] units or similar, power density refers to a volume. It is then also called '''volume power density''', which is expressed as W/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Volume power density is sometimes an important consideration where space is constrained.

In [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] [[internal combustion engine]]s, power density—power per [[swept volume]] or [[brake horsepower per cubic centimeter]] —is an important metric. This is based on the ''internal'' capacity of the engine, not its external size.

A '''rotary converter plant''' is a facility at which [[rotary converter]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s convert one form of electricity to another form of electricity.  The installed combinations of motors and generators at a plant determine the possible type(s) of conversion.  Such facilities also allow the setting of voltages and frequencies, if appropriate equipment is installed.  Rotary converter plants were commonplace in [[railway electrification]] before the invention of [[mercury arc rectifier]]s in the 1920s.

At each facility, power from an AC power grid was converted to DC to feed into an [[overhead line]] or a [[third rail]] of a railway.  Rotary converter plants were also used for coupling power grids of different frequencies and operation modes.  The former [[Neuhof Substation]] was an example of the latter.  Former machinery transmitters like the [[Alexanderson alternator]] were, strictly speaking, rotary converter plants.

In spite of modern power [[semiconductor]] technology, rotary converters are still common for feeding railway systems with AC of a different frequency from that of the main electricity grid.  In Europe, this would typically be for [[15 kV AC railway electrification]].

The '''Shabaka Stone''', sometimes Shabaqo, is a relic incised with an ancient Egyptian religious text, which dates from the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=111561&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=shabako+stone&amp;page=1 The Shabako Stone], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the stone was likely used as a [[millstone]], which damaged the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]. This damage is accompanied by other intentional defacements, leaving the hieroglyphic inscription in poor condition.

== Provenance ==

=== Historical origins ===
Originally erected as a lasting monument at the [[Memphis, Egypt#Great Temple of Ptah|Great Temple of Ptah in Memphis]] in the late eighth century BCE, the stone was at some point removed (for unknown reasons) to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=5|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it was transported by a navy vessel from Alexandria to England. It was brought back as ballast along with a capital of an Egyptian column, fragments of a Greco-Roman black basalt capital, two fragments of quartzite lintel of [[Senusret III|Senwosret III]], and a black granite kneeling statue of [[Ramesses II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists|last=El Hawary|first=Amr|publisher=Peeters Publishers &amp; Department of Oriental Studies|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Goyon|editor-first=Jean-Claude|location=Leuven (Belgium)|pages=567–8|chapter=New Findings About the Memphite Theology|editor-last2=Cardin|editor-first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805, the stone was donated to the [[British Museum]] by [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer]] (1758-1834), who was First Lord of the Admiralty and since 1794 the trustee of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists|last=El Hawary|first=Amr|publisher=Peeters Publishers &amp; Department of Oriental Studies|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Goyon|editor-first=Jean-Claude|location=Leuven (Belgium)|pages=567|chapter=New Findings About the Memphite Theology|editor-last2=Cardin|editor-first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, the stone was deciphered, translated, and interpreted for the first time by the American egyptologist, [[James Henry Breasted]].&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument has remained at the museum to the present day.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Dating ===
Since this stone was meant to be a preservation of an older text, the question regarding the dating of the original work has been sought after. Attempts to attribute a definite date for the original text have been inconclusive. Breasted,  [[Adolf Erman]], [[Kurt Sethe]], and [[Hermann Junker]] all dated the stone to the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The stone is archaic, both linguistically (its language is similar to that used in the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom) and politically (it alludes to the importance of Memphis as the first royal city).&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; As such, [[Henri Frankfort]], John Wilson, [[Miriam Lichtheim]], and Erik Iverson have also assessed the stone to be from the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; However, Friedrich Junge and most other scholars since then have argued that the monument was produced in the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=10|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, scholars feel it is clear that it cannot predate the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mierroop, Marc (2011). A history of Ancient Egypt. Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing. p. 303. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

The stela is around {{convert|137|cm}} wide, with the left side height estimated at {{convert|91|cm}} and the right side about {{convert|95|cm}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=7|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written surface is {{convert|132|cm}} in width and on average, {{convert|66|cm}} in height.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rectangular hole in the center is {{convert|12|by|14|cm}}, with eleven radiating lines ranging in length from {{convert|25|to|38|cm}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The area of the surface which has been completely worn-out measures {{convert|78|cm}} across.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1901, James Henry Breasted identified the stone as a rectangular slab of black [[granite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breasted|first=James Henry|date=1901|title=The Philosophy of a Memphite Priest|url=|journal=Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde|volume=39|pages=458|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other scholars postulated that the monument was a slab or [[basalt]] or a conglomerate stone, a recent analysis by a scientist of the British Museum revealed the stone to be green [[breccia]] originating from [[Wadi Hammamat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=6|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The text includes two main divisions with a short introduction and an ending summary. The first division relates the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. Ptah works through [[Horus]] to accomplish this unification. The other is a creation story, the '''Memphite Theology''', that establishes Ptah as the creator of all things, including gods.

The text stresses that it is in Memphis that the unification of Egypt took place.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finnestad|first=Ragnhild Bjerre|date=1976|title=Ptah, Creator of the Gods: Reconsideration of the Ptah Sections of the Denkmai|url=|journal=Numen|volume=23|issue=2|pages=81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription also states that this town was the burial-place of [[Osiris]], after he drifted ashore.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Introduction and Titulary of the King ===
The first line of the stone presents the fivefold [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|royal titulary]] of the king: "The living Horus: Who prospers the Two Lands; the Two Ladies: Who prospers the Two Lands; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Neferkare; the Son of Re: [Shabaka], beloved of Ptah-South-of-His-Wall, who lives like Re forever.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=8|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three names emphasize the king's manifestation as a living god (especially of the falcon-headed Horus, patron god to the Egyptian kings), while the latter two names (the king's throne name and birth name) refer to Egypt's division and unification.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=9|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second line, a dedicatory introduction, claims that the stone is a copy of the surviving contents of a worm-ridden, decaying [[papyrus]] found by the pharaoh [[Shabaka]] as he was inspecting the Great Temple of Ptah.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Unification of Egypt ===
Lines 3 to 47 describe the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the god Horus at Memphis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The text first declares the political and theological supremacy of the Memphite god Ptah, the king of both Upper and Lower Egypt, and the creator of the [[Ennead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=13|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription then describes how Horus, as a manifestation of Ptah, initially rules [[Lower Egypt]] while his rival Set rules [[Upper Egypt]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=14|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horus receives Upper Egypt from [[Geb]], becoming the sole ruler of the land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The Memphite Theology ===
Lines 48 to 64 recount the creation myth known as the Memphite Theology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Ptah]], the patron god of craftsmen, metalworkers, artisans, and architects was viewed as a creator-god, a divine craftsman of the universe who was responsible for all existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation was first a spiritual and intellectual activity, facilitated by the divine heart (thought) and tongue (speech/word) of Ptah.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Joshua J.|date=April 2009|title=The Shabaka Stone: An Introduction|url=|journal=Studia Antiqua|volume=7|issue=1|pages=18–9|via=BYU ScholarsArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, creation became a physical activity carried out by [[Atum]], who, created by Ptah's teeth and lips, produced the Ennead from his seed and hands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Summary ===
Lines 61 through 64 summarize the text as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
According to Ragnhild Bjerre Finnestad, there are three theories on the possible purpose of the Shabaka text:
# To assert the supremacy of the Memphite theological system over the Heliopolitan
# To claim the hegemony of the Memphis and its priesthood over Heliopolis and its priesthood 
# To present an ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finnestad|first=Ragnhild Bjerre|date=1976|title=Ptah, Creator of the Gods: Reconsideration of the Ptah Sections of the Denkmai|url=|journal=Numen|volume=23|issue=2|pages=82–3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a temple text written down and set up in the temple of Ptah, it is likely that the Shabaka Stone served a religious, cultic-theological purpose, placing its subject matter within a cultic frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finnestad|first=Ragnhild Bjerre|date=1976|title=Ptah, Creator of the Gods: Reconsideration of the Ptah Section of the Denkmai|url=|journal=Numen|volume=23|issue=2|pages=83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projecting from the rectangular hole in the center of the stone are radial rough stripes, which destroyed the inscription within a radius of 78&amp;nbsp;cm, measured from the middle of the stone.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists|last=El Hawary|first=Amr|publisher=Peeters Publishers &amp; Department of Oriental Studies|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Goyon|editor-first=Jean-Claude|location=Leuven (Belgium)|pages=569|chapter=New Findings About the Memphite Theology|editor-last2=Cardin|editor-first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the secondary literature on the monument, this damage occurred because the stone was re-used as a millstone.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The oldest reference speculating the stone's use as a millstone is found in the display of the British Museum of 1821.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, the stone could instead have been the foundation of something round, possibly a column or a pillar.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists|last=El Hawary|first=Amr|publisher=Peeters Publishers &amp; Department of Oriental Studies|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Goyon|editor-first=Jean-Claude|location=Leuven (Belgium)|pages=570|chapter=New Findings About the Memphite Theology|editor-last2=Cardin|editor-first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parts of the stone were intentionally cut out during the Dynastic Period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This included the name of Seth (line 7), a god which was condemned during this time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, [[Psamtik II]] or [[Psamtik III]] erased the proper name and throne name of Shabaka from the stone.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists|last=El Hawary|first=Amr|publisher=Peeters Publishers &amp; Department of Oriental Studies|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Goyon|editor-first=Jean-Claude|location=Leuven (Belgium)|pages=571|chapter=New Findings About the Memphite Theology|editor-last2=Cardin|editor-first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psamtik III then engraved his name onto the stone, but his name was in turn erased by the Persians during their conquest.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists|last=El Hawary|first=Amr|publisher=Peeters Publishers &amp; Department of Oriental Studies|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Goyon|editor-first=Jean-Claude|location=Leuven (Belgium)|pages=572|chapter=New Findings About the Memphite Theology|editor-last2=Cardin|editor-first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3468">A '''soft-switching three-level inverter''' (S3L inverter) is a high-efficiency [[power electronics|power electronic]] [[inverter]] intended, in particular, for use with [[three-phase drives]], as a [[grid-tie inverter]] for [[photovoltaic]] installations or [[wind turbines]] and in [[power supplies]]. The topology was developed in 2009 at [[HTWG Konstanz]] (Constance University of Applied Sciences).

== Operating principle ==

[[File:S3L-Inverter Prinzipschaltbild.png|thumb|Schematic circuit diagram of the S3L inverter. The snubber circuit is highlighted in grey.]]

Inverters are used for converting [[DC voltage]] into [[AC voltage]]. Their construction typically makes use of [[power transistor]]s and [[diode]]s. These are operated as electronic switches. In conventional designs using "hard" switching, this gives rise to switching losses&lt;ref name="Peter R. W. Martin (editor)"&gt;Peter R. W. Martin (editor): Applikationshandbuch IGBT- und MOSFET-Leistungsmodule. ISLE Verlag, 1998, {{ISBN|3-932633-24-5}}, Section 1.2.3 Qualitatives Schaltverhalten von MOSFET und IGBT beim harten Schalten (PDF version).&lt;/ref&gt; which, especially for high values of the [[switching frequency]], cause a reduction in their [[energy conversion efficiency]]. To improve their efficiency, high-power inverters (from about 10&amp;nbsp;kW) frequently make use of a technique referred to as a three-level design ([[three-level inverter]]).&lt;ref name="Akira Nabae, Isao Takahashi, Hirofumi Akagi"&gt;Akira Nabae, Isao Takahashi, [[Hirofumi Akagi]]: A New Neutral-Point-Clamped PWM Inverter. In: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications. IA-17, No. 5, 1981, pp. 518–523, doi:10.1109/TIA.1981.4503992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming the basis of the S3L inverter is a hard-switching three-level inverter of this kind with a T-type topology.&lt;ref name="M. Schweizer, J. W. Kolar"&gt;M. Schweizer, J. W. Kolar: High efficiency drive system with 3-level T-type inverter. In: Proceedings of the 2011-14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE 2011). 2011, {{ISBN|9789075815153}}, pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; This base design is supplemented by a snubber circuit consisting of a few passive components.&lt;ref name="M. W. Gekeler"&gt;M. W. Gekeler: Soft switching three level inverter with passive snubber circuit (S3L inverter). In: Proceedings of the 2011-14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE 2011). 2011, {{ISBN|9789075815153}}, pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; It prevents the occurrence of simultaneously high values of voltage and current, and hence high power dissipation values, during the switching process. All switching processes therefore take place in a "soft" manner. In this way switching losses are largely avoided. Furthermore, because the snubber circuit functions, in principle, without losses, the conversion efficiency of the inverter remains high even for high values of the switching frequency.&lt;ref name="Manfred W.

A '''spring box''' is a structure engineered to allow [[groundwater]] to be obtained from a [[natural spring]]. The spring box functions to protect the spring water from [[Water pollution|contamination]], normally by [[surface runoff]] or contact with human and animals, and provides a point of collection and a place for [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]]. In many instances it also acts as the principal water storage for the household water supply. The area surrounding the spring box should be fenced off in order to reduce the risk of contamination from animal faeces. An overflow pipe should be installed into the spring box, and it should also have a well fitting lid. 

If the flow rate is relatively high, a spring box may not be necessary. Instead, a pipe can be driven horizontally into the spring. These systems are sometimes known as horizontal wells, although the pipe should not be completely horizontal; it should slope downwards away from the spring in order to reduce the risk of contamination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">'''Stationary fuel-cell applications''' (or stationary fuel-cell power systems) are [[Applied science|applications]] for [[fuel cell]]s that are either connected to the [[electric grid]] ([[distributed generation]]) to provide supplemental power and as [[emergency power system]] for critical areas, or installed as a grid-independent generator for on-site service.

==Applications==
In 2012 more than {{val|45,700}} fuel-cell systems were shipped all over the world — in residential homes, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, office buildings, schools, utility power plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf The fuel cell industry review 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Micro combined heat and power===
[[Micro combined heat and power]], "mCHP" or "micro cogeneration" is a so-called [[distributed energy resource]] (DER). The installation is usually less than 5 [[Watt#Electrical_and_thermal_watts|kW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] in a house or small business. Instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water, some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat.  This electricity can be used within the home or business or, if permitted by the grid management, sold back into the electric power grid. 

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf The fuel cell industry review 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, over {{val|20,000}} units were sold in [[Japan]] as part of the Ene Farm project. With a [[Service life|Lifetime]] of around 60,000 hours. For PEM fuel cell units, which shut down at night, this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/analysis/analyst-views/2013/13-02-27-latest-developments-in-the-ene-farm-scheme Latest developments in the Ene-Farm scheme].&lt;/ref&gt; For a price of $22,600 before installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/2013/01/en130117-5/en130117-5.html Launch of new 'Ene-Farm' home fuel cell product more affordable and easier to install].&lt;/ref&gt; For 2013 a state subsidy for {{val|50,000}} units is in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/analysis/analyst-views/2013/13-02-27-latest-developments-in-the-ene-farm-scheme Latest developments in the Ene-Farm scheme].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency power systems===
[[Emergency power systems]] are a type of fuel cell system, which may include lighting, generators and other apparatus, to provide backup resources in a crisis or when regular systems fail. They find uses in a wide variety of settings from residential homes to [[hospital]]s, scientific laboratories, [[data center]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t-systems.com/tsi/servlet/content/t-systems.de/en/228788 Fuel cell in the data center Munich] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920151839/http://www.t-systems.com/tsi/servlet/content/t-systems.de/en/228788 |date=2008-09-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[telecommunication]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcellsworks.com/Supppage9369.html India orders 10.000 fuel cell emergency power systems]{{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; equipment and modern naval ships.

===Uninterrupted power supply===
An [[uninterruptible power supply]] ('''UPS''') provides emergency power and, depending on the topology, provide line regulation as well to connected equipment by supplying power from a separate source when utility power is not available. It differs from an [[Emergency power system|auxiliary power]] supply or standby generator, which does not provide instant protection from a momentary power interruption.

==Codes and standards==
''Stationary fuel cell applications'' is a classification in FC [[hydrogen codes and standards]] and [[fuel cell]] codes and standards. The other main standards are [[Portable fuel cell applications]] and [[Fuel cell vehicle]].
*[[Fuel cell gas appliances up to 70 kW]]
*Installation permitting guidance for hydrogen and fuel cells stationary applications
*[[Standard for the installation of stationary fuel cell power systems]]

'''Stephan Ouaknine''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[business magnate]], best known for his activities in the [[Telecommunications|telecommunications industry]] and in [[renewable energy]].
A native of [[Montreal]], Ouaknine has been active at international events including the [[Clinton Global Initiative]], the Durban World Climate Summit and the Rio+20 World Green Summit, and has been named one of Canada's most notable entrepreneurs by [[Profit (magazine)|Profit]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shiffman|first=Kim|title=Canada's 30 Most Fabulous Entrepreneurs - Stephan Ouaknine|newspaper=Profit Magazine|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ouaknine, the son of Moroccan and Egyptian immigrants to Canada, attended [[McGill University]] and moved to the Israeli start-up industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quebec can benefit from Israeli tech know-how: Charest|url=http://www.cjnews.com/node/88798|newspaper=Canadian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; first joining a  [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] multimedia company then known as Geo-Interactive. As vice-president of business development, Ouaknine led the firm’s 1996 IPO on the London Stock Exchange under the name '''Emblaze'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacGregor|first=Alison|title=‘Crazy’ telecom idea now considered visionary|url=http://www.blueslice.com/pages/doc/articles/art_12_june_04.pdf|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=12 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telecom industry ==
In 1998, Ouaknine founded '''Airslide Systems''', an advanced telecommunications equipment company, from his home in Tel Aviv. He raised over $36 million in venture capital for this firm from investors including [[George Soros]], [[Sequoia Capital]], [[Intel]] and [[SingTel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Airslide Founder, Former CEO Stephan Ouaknine Resigns From Operational Role - To Remain On As Advisor|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_June_21/ai_75704123/|newspaper=Business Wire|date=June 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's assets were ultimately acquired by [[Dialogic Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Airslide Systems, Inc.|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=417113|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tehrani|first=Rich|title=Dialogic Buys Cantata|url=http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/rich-tehrani/ip-communications/dialogic-buys-cantata.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After exiting Airslide, Ouaknine returned to Montreal to found '''Blueslice Networks''' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blueslice Networks|url=http://www.blueslice.com/pages/doc/articles/art_27_june_04.pdf|newspaper=The Wall Street Transcript|date=June 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Blueslice Networks Inc.|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4985944|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Blueslice produced evolved Subscriber Data Management (eSDM) solutions for mobile operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Blueslice|url=http://www.tekelec.com/about-tekelec/blueslice.asp|publisher=Tekelec, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was acquired in 2010 by [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]]-based [[Tekelec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tekelec Announces Agreements to Acquire Camiant and Blueslice Networks|url=http://www.tekelec.com/news-&amp;-events/prDetail.asp?prID=835|publisher=Tekelec|date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent activities ==
Subsequently, to Blueslice's acquisition, Ouaknine moved to the renewable energy industry. With partners including Jigar Shah, founder of [[SunEdison]], Eric Ouaknine and Vincent Martel, Ouaknine founded '''Inerjys''', a renewable energy and [[clean technology]] growth equity fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chernova|first=Yuliya|title=New Clean-Tech Firm Inerjys Hires Industry Veterans Shah, Pullan|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2012/05/25/new-clean-tech-firm-inerjys-hires-industry-veterans-shah-pullan/?mod=WSJBlog|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
At Inerjys, Ouaknine’s activities have focused on a hybrid strategy of [[growth equity]] investment and [[Project finance|infrastructure project finance]], with the objective of accelerating the [[commercialization]] of innovative cleantech firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Katie|title=Whoa: Meet the new billion dollar cleantech fund Inerjys|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/whoa-meet-the-new-billion-dollar-cleantech-fund-inerjys/|newspaper=GigaOM earth2tech|date=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouaknine has promoted this investment thesis at major international events including the Durban World Climate Summit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=van Praet|first=Nicholas|title=Changing the landscape|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/12/12/changing-the-landscape/|newspaper=Financial Post|date=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadian CEO talks renewable energy in Durban|url=http://www.inerjys.com/en/press-releases/8-canadian-ceo-talks-renewable-energy-in-durban|publisher=Business Wire|date=December 6, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126224828/http://www.inerjys.com/en/press-releases/8-canadian-ceo-talks-renewable-energy-in-durban|archivedate=January 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  [[Clinton Global Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inerjys announces $1B renewable-energy commitment at Clinton Global Initiative|url=http://inerjys.com/en/press-releases/4-inerjys-announces-1b-renewable-energy-commitment-at-clinton-global-initiative|newspaper=Business Wire|date=September 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126103138/http://inerjys.com/en/press-releases/4-inerjys-announces-1b-renewable-energy-commitment-at-clinton-global-initiative|archivedate=January 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Bill Clinton Opens the 2011 Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting with a Focus on Generating Jobs for the 21st Century, Sustainable Consumption for our Planet, "What Works" for Girls and Women, and Progress of Member Commitments|url=http://press.clintonglobalinitiative.org/press_releases/president-bill-clinton-opens-the-2011-clinton-global-initiative-annual-meeting/|publisher=Clinton Global Initiative|date=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Green Summit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programme - World Green Summit|url=http://worldgreensummit.org/about/programme/|publisher=World Green Summit}}&lt;/ref&gt; a business conference affiliated with [[Rio+20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Green Summit at Rio+20|url=http://www.wclimate.com/?page_id=1052|publisher=World Climate Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, Oaknine was a guide in the walk of the living for teenagers.

The '''Strasskirchen Solar Park''' is a large [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Bavaria]], with an installed capacity of 54&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]. It was developed by a joint venture of [[MEMC Electronic Materials|MEMC]] and [[Q-Cells]] in 2009. At this time this Solar Park was the second largest PV Power Plant. Q-Cells also provided the solar modules for the facility which is located in [[Straßkirchen]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarplaza.com/top10-largest-pv-power-plants/|title=Top 10 World's Largest Solar PV Power Plants|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exenewable.com/projectProfile.asp?id=13028 eXenewable Project Profile Page - Strasskirchen, PV, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sulfide''' (systematically named '''sulfanediide''', and '''sulfide(2−)''') ([[British English]] '''sulphide''') is an [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[ion|anion]] of [[sulfur]] with the chemical formula S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; or a compound containing one or more S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions. It contributes no color to sulfide salts.  As it is classified as a [[strong base]], even dilute solutions of salts such as [[sodium sulfide]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) are corrosive and can attack the skin. Sulfide is the simplest sulfur anion.

== Nomenclature ==
The systematic names ''sulfanediide'' and ''sulfide(2−)'', valid [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] names, are determined according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. However, the name sulfide is also used in compositional IUPAC nomenclature which does not take the nature of bonding involved. Examples of such naming are [[selenium disulfide]] and [[titanium sulfide]], which contains no sulfide ions whatsoever.

''Sulfide'' is also used non-systematically, to describe compounds which release [[hydrogen sulfide]] upon acidification, or a compound that otherwise incorporates sulfur in some form, such as [[dimethyl sulfide]]. "Hydrogen sulfide" is itself an example of a non-systematic name of this nature. However, it is also a trivial name, and the preferred IUPAC name for [[sulfane]].

== Chemical properties ==
It has been confirmed that the sulfide ion, S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, does not exist even in hyper-concentrated aqueous alkaline  solutions of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=P.M.|last2=Batka|first2=D.|last3=Hefter|first3=G.|last4=Könignberger|first4=E.|last5=Rowland|first5=D.|title=Goodbye to S2-|journal=Chem. Comm.|date=2018|doi=10.1039/c8cc00187a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the dissociation reaction
:SH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) → S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
does not occur in aqueous solution at any concentration of sulphide. The sulphide ion, S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, was previously reported to be undetectable at concentrations up to 5&amp;nbsp;M [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = B | last2 = Ward | first2 = K | last3 = Koshlap | first3 = K | last4 = Peter | first4 = L | year = 1983 | title = Second dissociation constant of hydrogen sulfide | url = | journal = Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 22 | issue = | page = 2345 | doi = 10.1021/ic00158a027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sulfide ion may be produced when a solid is formed. For example [[cadmium sulphide]] precipitates in group 2 of [[Qualitative inorganic analysis|qualitative analysis]]. 
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (g) + Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CdS↓ (s) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

=== Chemical reactions ===
Upon treatment with a standard acid, sulfide converts to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and a metal salt. [[redox|Oxidation]] of sulfide gives sulfur or [[sulfate]]. Metal sulfides react with [[nonmetals]] including [[iodine]], [[bromine]], and [[chlorine]] forming [[sulfur]] and metal salts.
:8&amp;nbsp;MgS + 8&amp;nbsp;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&amp;nbsp;MgI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Sulfur can also be prepared from a sulfide and an appropriate oxidizer:

==Metal derivatives==
Aqueous solutions of [[transition metals]] [[cations]] react with sulfide sources (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, NaHS, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) to precipitate solid sulfides.  Such [[inorganic]] sulfides typically have very low solubility in water, and many are related to minerals with the same composition (see below).  One famous example is the bright yellow species CdS or "[[cadmium yellow]]".  The black tarnish formed on sterling silver is Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.  Such species are sometimes referred to as salts.  In fact, the bonding in transition metal sulfides is highly covalent, which gives rise to their [[semiconductor]] properties, which in turn is related to the deep colors.  Several have practical applications as pigments, in solar cells, and as catalysts. The fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WY3YvfNoouMC&amp;pg=PA533&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mycoremediation: Fungal Bioremediation|author=Harbhajan Singh|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{main|sulfide mineral}}
Many important [[metal]] [[ore]]s are sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, D. J.; Craig, J. R. “Mineral chemistry of metal sulfides" Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1978. {{ISBN|0-521-21489-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant examples include: [[argentite]] ([[silver]] sulfide), [[cinnabar]] ([[mercury (element)|mercury]]),  [[galena]] ([[lead]] sulfide),  [[molybdenite]] ([[molybdenum]] sulfide), [[pentlandite]] ([[nickel]] sulfide), [[realgar]] ([[arsenic]] sulfide), and  [[stibnite]] ([[antimony]]), [[sphalerite]] ([[zinc]] sulfide), and  [[pyrite]] ([[iron]] disulfide), and [[chalcopyrite]] ([[iron]]-[[copper]] sulfide).

==Corrosion induced by sulfide==
Dissolved free sulfides (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) are very aggressive species for the corrosion of many metals such as steel, stainless steel, and copper. Sulfides present in aqueous solution are responsible for [[stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) of steel, and is also known as [[sulfide stress cracking]]. Corrosion is a major concern in many industrial installations processing sulfides: sulfide ore mills, deep [[oil well]]s, pipelines transporting soured [[oil]], [[Kraft paper]] factories.

[[Microbial corrosion|Microbially-induced corrosion]] (MIC) or [[biogenic sulfide corrosion]] are also caused by [[sulfate reducing bacteria]] producing sulfide that is emitted in the air and oxidized in sulfuric acid by sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Biogenic sulfuric acid reacts with [[sewerage]] materials and most generally causes mass loss, cracking of the sewer pipes and ultimately, structural collapse. This kind of deterioration is a major process affecting sewer systems worldwide and leading to very high rehabilitation costs.

Oxidation of sulfide can also form [[thiosulfate]] ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2−}}) an intermediate species responsible for severe problems of [[pitting corrosion]] of steel and stainless steel while the medium is also acidified by the production of sulfuric acid when oxidation is more advanced.

==Organic chemistry==
In [[organic chemistry]], "sulfide" usually refers to the linkage C–S–C, although the term [[thioether]] is less ambiguous. For example, the thioether [[dimethyl sulfide]] is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–S–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Polyphenylene sulfide]] (see below) has the empirical formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S.  Occasionally, the term sulfide refers to molecules containing the –SH [[functional group]]. For example, methyl sulfide can mean CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–SH. The preferred descriptor for such SH-containing compounds is [[thiol]] or mercaptan, i.e. methanethiol, or methyl mercaptan.

==Disulfides==
Confusion arises from the different meanings of the term "[[disulfide]]". [[Molybdenum disulfide]] (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) consists of separated sulfide centers, in association with molybdenum in the formal +4 [[oxidation state]] (that is, Mo&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and two S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Iron disulfide ([[pyrite]], FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on the other hand consists of {{chem|S|2|2−}}, or &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;S–S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; dianion, in association with divalent iron in the formal +2 oxidation state (ferrous ion: Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). [[Dimethyldisulfide]] has the chemical binding CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–S–S–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas [[carbon disulfide]] has no S–S bond, being S=C=S (linear molecule analog to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Most often in sulfur chemistry and in biochemistry, the disulfide term is commonly ascribed to the sulfur analogue of the [[peroxide]] –O–O– bond. The [[disulfide]] bond (–S–S–) plays a major role in the conformation of [[protein]]s and in the catalytic activity of [[enzyme]]s.

==Preparation==
Sulfide compounds can be prepared in several different ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins |last2=Shriver |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5th |publisher=W. H. Freeman &amp; Co. |location=New York |date=2010 |page=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Direct combination of elements:
#:Example: Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → FeS&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;
#Reduction of a sulfate:
#:Example: MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 4C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → MgS&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 4CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
#Precipitation of an insoluble sulfide:
#:Example: M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → MS&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Safety==
Many metal sulfides are so insoluble in water that they are probably not very toxic. Some metal sulfides, when exposed to a strong mineral [[acid]], including [[gastric acid]]s, will release toxic [[hydrogen sulfide]].

Organic sulfides are highly flammable. When a sulfide burns it produces [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas.

Hydrogen sulfide, some of its salts, and almost all organic sulfides have a strong and putrid stench; rotting [[biomass]] releases these.

'''The Center for Art in Wood''' is an American educational [[wood art]] institution located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It was officially established as a nonprofit in 1986 by brothers Albert and Alan LeCoff, following a series of international symposium from 1976-1986 presented by the LeCoff's with woodturner Palmer Sharpless.  The organization operated as the Wood Turning Center until 2011, when the nonprofit moved to its current location in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City District of Philadelphia]] and changed its name to The Center for Art in Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/10/garden/philadelphia-design.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Four Square Blocks: Philadelphia|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Center presents changing exhibitions of contemporary art work in the medium of wood, a permanent collection of over 1,000 pieces and a host of educational programs and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmagazine.com/big-philadelphia/38|work=Big Magazine|title=The Center for Art in Wood|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center also houses a research library, artists files, and a museum store.  A series of publications documents the Center's work and highlights premier artists working in the field of [[wood turning]] and art in wood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35191">'''Thermophotovoltaic''' (TPV) energy conversion is a direct conversion process from heat to [[electricity]] via [[photon]]s. A basic thermophotovoltaic system consists of a [[thermal]] [[Anode|emitter]] and a [[photovoltaic]] [[diode]] cell.

The [[temperature]] of the thermal emitter varies between different systems from about 900&amp;nbsp;°C to about 1300&amp;nbsp;°C, although in principle TPV devices can extract energy from any emitter with temperature elevated above that of the photovoltaic device (forming an optical [[heat engine]]). The emitter can be a piece of solid material or a specially engineered structure.[[Thermal radiation|Thermal emission]] is the spontaneous emission of photons due to thermal motion of charges in the material. For these TPV temperatures, this radiation is mostly at [[near infrared]] and [[infrared]] [[frequencies]]. The photovoltaic diodes absorbs some of these radiated photons and converts them into electricity.

Thermophotovoltaic systems have few to no [[moving parts]] and are therefore quiet and require little maintenance. These properties make thermophotovoltaic systems suitable for remote-site and portable electricity-generating applications. Their [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]]-[[cost]] properties, however, are often poor compared to other electricity-generating technologies. Current research in the area aims at increasing system efficiencies while keeping the system cost low.

TPV systems usually attempt to match the optical properties of thermal emission ([[wavelength]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], direction) with the most efficient absorption characteristics of the photovoltaic cell, since unconverted thermal emission is a major source of inefficiency. Most groups focus on [[gallium antimonide]] (GaSb) cells. [[Germanium]] (Ge) is also suitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

TPV cells have been proposed as auxiliary power conversion devices for capture of otherwise lost heat in other power generation systems, such as steam turbine systems or solar cells.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (TPV) powered automobile, designed and built by the Vehicle Research Institute (VRI) at [[Western Washington University]].

TPV research is an active area. Among others, the [[University of Houston]] TPV Radioisotope Power Conversion Technology development effort is attempting to combine a thermophotovoltaic cell with [[thermocouple]]s to provide a 3 to 4-fold improvement in system efficiency over current [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.

==History==
[[Henry Kolm]] had constructed an elementary TPV system at [[MIT]] in 1956. However, [[Pierre Aigrain]] is widely cited as the inventor based on the content of lectures he gave at MIT between 1960–1961 which, unlike Kolm's system, led to research and development.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;{{Cite journal

==Background==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TPV schematic.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic of TPV systems. &lt;br /&gt;'''Left:''' Here a blackbody emitter is heated(either by solar concentration or combustion) causing it emit radiation. The radiation passes through a filter that allows only optimal wavelengths for conversion and reflects others back to the emitter where they can absorbed again generating additional heat and photons. That light passed through the filter is absorbed by the PV converter to generate electricity. Any unabsorbed light passes to the reflector where it is sent back to the PV to be converted or to the emitter to be reabsorbed. In practical systems, reflector geometries must be used to surround the material to prevent emitted light from escaping to the surroundings. &lt;br /&gt;'''Right:''' A similar system, where the [[blackbody]] emitter and narrow-band filter are replaced with a selective emitter.]] --&gt;

Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) are a class of power generating system that convert thermal energy into electrical energy. They consist of, at a minimum, an emitter and a photovoltaic power converter. Most TPV systems include additional components such as concentrators, filters and reflectors.

The basic principle is similar to that of traditional photovoltaics (PV) where a [[p-n junction]] is used to absorb [[optical power|optical energy]], generate and separate electron/hole pairs, and in doing so convert that energy into electricity. The difference is that the optical energy is not directly generated by the Sun, but instead by a material at high temperature (termed the emitter), that causes it to emit light. In this way thermal energy is converted to electrical energy.

The emitter can be heated by sunlight or other techniques. In this sense, TPVs provide a great deal of versatility in potential fuels. In the case of solar TPVs, large concentrators are needed to provide reasonable temperatures for efficient operation.

Improvements can take advantage of filters or selective emitters to create emissions in a wavelength range that is optimized for a specific photovoltaic (PV) converter. In this way TPVs can overcome a fundamental challenge for traditional PVs, making efficient use of the entire solar spectrum. For [[black body]] emitters, photons with energy less than the [[bandgap]] of the converter cannot be absorbed and are either reflected and lost or pass through the cell. Photons with energy above the bandgap can be absorbed, but the excess energy, &lt;math&gt;\Delta G = E_{photon} - E_{g} &lt;/math&gt;, is again lost, generating undesirable heating in the cell. In the case of TPVs, similar issues can exist, but the use of either selective emitters (emissivity over a specific wavelength range), or optical filters that only pass a narrow range of wavelengths and reflect all others, can be used to generate emission spectra that can be optimally converted by the PV device.

To maximize efficiency, all photons should be converted. A process often termed photon recycling can be used to approach this. Reflectors are placed behind the converter and anywhere else in the system that photons might not be efficiently directed to the collector. These photons are directed back to the concentrator where they can be converted, or back to the emitter, where they can be reabsorbed to generate heat and additional photons. An optimal TPV system would use photon recycling and selective emission to convert all photons into electricity.

==Efficiency==
The upper limit for efficiency in TPVs (and all systems that convert heat energy to work) is the [[Carnot efficiency]], that of an ideal heat engine. This efficiency is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \frac{T_{cell}}{T_{emit}}&lt;/math&gt;

where T&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the PV converter. For the best reasonable values in a practical system, T&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;~300K and T&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt;~1800, giving a maximum efficiency of ~83%. This limit sets the upper limit for the system efficiency. At 83% efficiency, all heat energy is converted to radiation by the emitter which is then converted by the PV into electrical energy without losses, such as thermalization or [[Joule heating]]. Maximum efficiency presumes no entropy change, which is only possible if the emitter and cell are at the same temperature. More accurate models are quite complicated.

===Emitters===
Deviations from perfect absorption and perfect black body behavior lead to light losses. For selective emitters, any light emitted at wavelengths not matched to the bandgap energy of the photovoltaic may not be efficiently converted (for reasons discussed above) and leads to reduced efficiency. In particular, emissions associated with [[phonon]] resonances are difficult to avoid for wavelengths in the deep infrared, which cannot be practically converted. Ideal emitters produce no infrared.

===Filters===
For black body emitters or imperfect selective emitters, filters reflect non-ideal wavelengths back to the emitter. These filters are imperfect. Any light that is absorbed or scattered and not redirected to the emitter or the converter is lost, generally as heat. Conversely, practical filters often reflect a small percentage of light in desired wavelength ranges. Both are inefficiencies.

===Converters===
Even for systems where only light of optimal wavelengths is passed to the converter, inefficiencies associated with non-radiative recombination and [[Joule heating|ohmic losses]] exist. Since these losses can depend on the light intensity incident on the cell, real systems must consider the intensity produced by a given set of conditions (emitter material, filter, [[operating temperature]]).

===Geometry===
In an ideal system, the emitter would be surrounded by converters so no light is lost. However, realistically, geometries must accommodate the input energy (fuel injection or input light) used to heat the emitter. Additionally, costs prohibit the placement of converters everywhere. When the emitter reemits light, anything that does not travel to the converters is lost. Mirrors can be used to redirect some of this light back to the emitter; however, the mirrors may have their own losses.

==Black body radiation==
For black body emitters where photon recirculation is achieved via filters, [[Planck's law]] states that a black body emits light with a spectrum given by:

&lt;math&gt;I'(\lambda,T) =\frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{ e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT}}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where I' is the flux of light of a specific wavelength, λ, given in units of 1/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. h is [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], k is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], c is the speed of light, and T&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt; is the emitter temperature. Thus, the light flux with wavelengths in a specific range can be found by integrating over the range. The peak wavelength is determined by the temperature, T&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt; based on [[Wien's displacement law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{b}{T} &lt;/math&gt;

where b is Wien's displacement constant. For most materials, the maximum temperature an emitter can stably operate at is about 1800&amp;nbsp;°C. This corresponds to an intensity that peaks at λ~1600&amp;nbsp;nm or an energy of ~0.75 eV. For more reasonable operating temperatures of 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, this drops to ~0.5 eV. These energies dictate the range of bandgaps that are needed for practical TPV converters (though the peak spectral power is slightly higher). Traditional PV materials such as Si (1.1 eV) and GaAs (1.4 eV) are substantially less practical for TPV systems, as the intensity of the black body spectrum is extremely low at these energies for emitters at realistic temperatures.

==Active components and materials selection==

===Emitters===

Efficiency, temperature resistance and cost are the three major factors for choosing a TPV radiator. Efficiency is determined by energy absorbed relative to total incoming radiation. High temperature operation is a crucial factor because efficiency increases with operating temperature. As emitter temperature increases, black body radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, allowing for more efficient absorption by photovoltaic cells. Cost is another major commercialization issue.

====Polycrystalline silicon carbide====

Polycrystalline [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) is the most commonly used emitter for burner TPVs. SiC is thermally stable to ~1700&amp;nbsp;°C. However, SiC radiates much of its energy in the long wavelength regime, far lower in energy than even the narrowest bandgap photovoltaic. This radiation is not converted into electrical energy. However, non-absorbing selective filters in front of the PV,&lt;ref&gt;Horne E. (2002). Hybrid thermophotovoltaic power systems. Final report by EDTEK Inc. for the California energy commission.&lt;/ref&gt; or mirrors deposited on the back side of the PV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://klaihem.tripod.com/Aoucher_aSiGe/bitnar.pdf|author=Bitnar, B. |year=2003|title= Silicon, germanium and silicon/germanium photocells for thermophotovoltaics applications|doi=10.1088/0268-1242/18/5/312|journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=S221|bibcode = 2003SeScT..18S.221B }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to reflect the long wavelengths back to the emitter, thereby recycling the unconverted energy. In addition, polycrystalline SiC is cheap to manufacture.

====Tungsten====

Refractory metals can be used as selective emitters for burner TPVs. [[Tungsten]] is the most common choice. It has higher emissivity in the visible and near-IR range of 0.45 to 0.47 and a low emissivity of 0.1 to 0.2 in the IR region.&lt;ref&gt;Malyshev, V. I. (1979). Introduction to Experimental Spectroscopy (in Russian) Nauka, Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; The emitter is usually in the shape of a cylinder with a sealed bottom, which can be considered a cavity. The emitter is attached to the back of a thermal absorber such as SiC and maintains the same temperature. Emission occurs in the visible and near IR range, which can be readily converted by the PV to electrical energy.

====Rare-earth oxides====

Rare-earth oxides such as [[ytterbium]] oxide (Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[erbium]] oxide (Er&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the most commonly used selective emitters for TPVs. These oxides emit a narrow band of wavelengths in the near-infrared region, allowing the tailoring of the emission spectra to better fit the absorbance characteristics of a particular PV cell. The peak of the emission spectrum occurs at 1.29 eV for Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.827 eV for Er&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be used a selective emitter for Si PV cells and Er&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, for GaSb or InGaAs. However, the slight mismatch between the emission peaks and band gap of the absorber results in a significant loss of efficiency. Selective emission only becomes significant at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C and increases with temperature, per Planck's Law. At operating temperatures below 1700&amp;nbsp;°C, selective emission of rare-earth oxides is fairly low, resulting in a further decrease in efficiency. Currently, 13% efficiency has been achieved with Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and silicon PV cells. In general selective emitters have had limited success. More often filters are used with black body emitters to pass wavelengths matched to the bandgap of the PV and reflect mismatched wavelengths back to the emitter.

====Photonic crystals====

[[Photonic crystals]] are a class of periodic materials that allow the precise control of electromagnetic wave properties. These materials give rise to the [[photonic bandgap]] (PBG). In the spectral range of the PBG, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate. The engineering of these materials allows some ability to tailor their emission and absorption properties, allowing for more effective design of selective emitters. Selective emitters with peaks at higher energy than the black body peak (for practical TPV temperatures) allow for wider bandgap converters. These converters are traditionally cheaper to manufacture and less temperature sensitive. Researchers at Sandia Labs demonstrated a high-efficiency (34% of light emitted from PBG selective emitter can be converted to electricity) TPV emitter using tungsten photonic crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lin, S. Y., Moreno, J. and Fleming, J. G.|title=Three-dimensional photonic-crystal emitter for thermal photovoltaic power generation|doi=10.1063/1.1592614|year=2003|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=83|issue=2|pages=380|bibcode = 2003ApPhL..83..380L |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231878/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, manufacturing of these devices is difficult and not commercially feasible.

===Photovoltaic cells===

====Silicon====

Early work in TPVs focused on the use of Si PVs. Silicon's commercial availability, extremely low cost, scalability and ease of manufacture makes this material an appealing candidate. However, the relatively wide bandgap of Si (1.1eV) is not ideal for use with a black body emitter at lower operating temperatures. Calculations using Planck's law, which describes the black body spectrum as a function of temperature, indicates that Si PVs would only be feasible at temperatures much higher than 2000 K. No emitter has been demonstrated that can operate at these temperatures. These engineering difficulties led to the pursuit of lower-bandgap semiconductor PVs.

Using selective radiators with Si PVs is still a possibility. Selective radiators would eliminate high and low energy photons, reducing heat generated. Ideally, selective radiators would emit no radiation beyond the band edge of the PV converter, increasing conversion efficiency significantly. No efficient TPVs have been realized using Si PVs.

====Germanium====

Early investigations into low bandgap semiconductors focused on [[germanium]] (Ge). Ge has a bandgap of 0.66 eV, allowing for conversion of a much higher fraction of incoming radiation. However, poor performance was observed due the extremely high [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective electron mass]] of Ge. Compared to [[III-V semiconductors]], Ge's high electron effective mass leads to a high density of states in the conduction band and therefore a high intrinsic carrier concentration. As a result, Ge [[diode]]s have fast decaying "dark" current and therefore, a low open-circuit voltage. In addition, surface passivation of germanium has proven extremely difficult.

====Gallium antimonide====

The [[gallium antimonide]] (GaSb) PV cell, invented in 1989,&lt;ref name="Fraas"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fraas, L.M., Avery, J.E., Sundaram, V.S., Dinh, V.T., Davenport, T.M. and Yerkes, J.W.|doi=10.1109/PVSC.1990.111616 |title=IEEE Conference on Photovoltaic Specialists|chapter=Over 35% efficient GaAs/GaSb stacked concentrator cell assemblies for terrestrial applications|year=1990|pages=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the basis of most PV cells in modern TPV systems. GaSb is a III-V semiconductor with the [[zinc blende]] crystal structure. The GaSb cell is a key development owing to its narrow bandgap of 0.72 eV. This allows GaSb to respond to light at longer wavelengths than silicon solar cell, enabling higher power densities in conjunction with manmade emission sources. A solar cell with 35% efficiency was demonstrated using a bilayer PV with GaAs and GaSb,&lt;ref name="Fraas"/&gt; setting the [[solar cell efficiency]] record.

Manufacturing a GaSb PV cell is quite simple. [[Czochralski process|Czochralski]] Te-doped n-type GaSb wafers are commercially available. Vapor-based Zn diffusion is carried out at elevated temperatures ~450&amp;nbsp;°C to allow for p-type doping. Front and back electrical contacts are patterned using traditional photolithography techniques and an anti-reflective coating is deposited. Current efficiencies are estimated at ~20% using a 1000&amp;nbsp;°C black body spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Algora, C.  |author2=Martin, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Modelling and Manufacturing GaSb TPV|journal=THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY: Fifth Conference on Thermophotovoltaic Generation of Electricity.

====Indium gallium arsenide antimonide====
[[Indium gallium arsenide antimonide]] (InGaAsSb) is a compound [[III-V semiconductor]]. (In&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1−y&lt;/sub&gt;) The addition of [[GaAs]] allows for a narrower bandgap (0.5 to 0.6 eV), and therefore better absorption of long wavelengths. Specifically, the bandgap was engineered to 0.55 eV. With this bandgap, the compound achieved a photon-weighted internal quantum efficiency of 79% with a fill factor of 65% for a black body at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Charache"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11664-998-0160-x|title=Infrared Materials for Thermophotovoltaic Applications|year=1998|last1=Charache|first1=G.

Devices have been grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) and [[liquid phase epitaxy]] (LPE). The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of these devices are approaching 90%, while devices grown by the other two techniques exceed 95%.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, C.A. |title=Antimony-based III-V thermophotovoltaic materials and devices|journal=THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY: Sixth Conference on Thermophotovoltaic Generation of Electricity: TPV6.

Compositional inconsistencies throughout the device degrade its performance. When phase separation can be avoided, the IQE and fill factor of InGaAsSb approach theoretical limits in wavelength ranges near the bandgap energy. However, the V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is far from the ideal.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; Current methods to manufacture InGaAsSb PVs are expensive and not commercially viable.

====Indium gallium arsenide====

[[Indium gallium arsenide]] (InGaAs) is a compound III-V semiconductor. It can be applied in two ways for use in TPVs. When lattice-matched to an InP substrate, InGaAs has a bandgap of 0.74 eV, no better than GaSb. Devices of this configuration have been produced with a fill factor of 69% and an efficiency of 15%.&lt;ref name="Karlina"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karlina, L.B., Kulagina, M.M., Timoshina, N.Kh., Vlasov, A.S. and Andreev, V.M.|title=In&lt;sub&gt;0.53&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.47&lt;/sub&gt;As/InP conventional and inverted thermophotovoltaic cells with back surface reflector|journal=THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY: TPV7: Seventh World Conference on Thermophotovoltaic Generation of Electricity.

The range of bandgaps for this system is from about 0.4 to 1.4 eV. However, these different structures cause strain with the InP substrate. This can be controlled with graded layers of InGaAs with different compositions. This was done to develop of device with a quantum efficiency of 68% and a fill factor of 68%, grown by MBE.&lt;ref name="Charache"/&gt; This device had a bandgap of 0.55 eV, achieved in the compound In&lt;sub&gt;0.68&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;As. n  has the advantage of being a well-developed material. InGaAs can be made to lattice match perfectly with Ge resulting in low defect densities. Ge as a substrate is a significant advantage over more expensive or harder-to-produce substrates.

====Indium phosphide arsenide antimonide====

The InPAsSb quaternary alloy has been grown by both OMVPE and LPE. When lattice-matched to InAs, it has a bandgap in the range 0.3–0.55 eV. The benefits of a TPV system with such a low band gap have not been studied in depth. Therefore, cells incorporating InPAsSb have not been optimized and do not yet have competitive performance. The longest spectral response from an InPAsSb cell studied was 4.3 μm with a maximum response at 3 μm.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; While this is a promising material, it has yet to be developed. For this and other low-bandgap materials, high IQE for long wavelengths is hard to achieve due to an increase in [[Auger recombination]].

==Applications ==
TPVs promise efficient and economically viable power systems for both military and commercial applications. Compared to traditional nonrenewable energy sources, burner TPVs have little [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions and are virtually silent. Solar TPVs are a source of emission-free renewable energy. TPVs can be more efficient than PV systems owing to recycling of unabsorbed photons. However, TPVs are more complex and losses at each energy conversion step can lower efficiency. Further developments must be made to the absorber/emitter and PV cell. When TPVs are used with a burner source, they provide on-demand energy. As a result, energy storage is  not needed. In addition, owing to the PV's proximity to the radiative source, TPVs can generate current densities 300 times that of conventional PVs.

===Man-portable power===

Battlefield dymamics require portable power. Conventional diesel generators are too heavy for use in the field. Scalability allows TPVs to be smaller and lighter than conventional generators. Also, TPVs have few emissions and are silent. Multifuel operation is another potential benefit.

Early investigations into TPVs in the 1970s failed due to PV limitations. However, with the realization of the GaSb photocell, a renewed effort in the 1990s improved results. In early 2001, JX Crystals delivered a TPV based battery charger to the Army that produced an output of 230 W with [[propane]]. This prototype utilized an SiC emitter operating at 1250&amp;nbsp;°C and GaSb photocells and was approximately 0.5 m tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Guazzoni, G.  |author2=Matthews, S. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=AIP Conference Proceedings|journal=THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY: Sixth Conference on Thermophotovoltaic Generation of Electricity: TPV6.  AIP Conference Proceedings|doi=10.1063/1.1841874|bibcode=2004AIPC..738....3G|chapter=A Retrospective of Four Decades of Military Interest in Thermophotovoltaics|year=2004|volume=738|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power source had an efficiency of 2.5%, calculated by the ratio of the power generated to the thermal energy of the fuel burned. This is too low for practical battlefield use. To increase efficiency, narrow-band emitters must be realized and the temperature of the burner must be raised. Further thermal management steps, such as water cooling or coolant boiling, must be implemented. Although many successful proof-of-concept prototypes were demonstrated, no  portable TPV power sources have reached troop testing or battlefield implementation.

===Spacecraft===

For space travel power generation systems must provide consistent and reliable power without large amounts of fuel. As a result, solar and [[radioisotope]] fuels (extremely high power density and long lifetime) are ideal sources of energy. TPVs have been proposed for each. In the case of solar energy, orbital spacecraft may be better locations for the large and potentially cumbersome concentrators required for practical TPVs. However, because of weight considerations and inefficiencies associated with the somewhat more complicated design of TPVs, conventional PVs will almost surely be more effective for these applications.

Probably more interesting is the prospect of using TPVs for conversion of radioisotope energy. The output of isotopes is thermal energy. In the past thermoelectricity (direct thermal to electrical conversion with no moving parts) has been used because of TPV efficiency is less than the ~10% of thermoelectric converters.&lt;ref name="Teofilo"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Teofilo, V.L., Choong, P., Chang, J., Tseng, Y.L., and Ermer, S.|title=Thermophotovoltaic Energy Conversion for Space|doi=10.1021/jp711315c|year=2008|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=112|issue=21|pages=7841}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stirling engines]] have also been considered, but face reliability concerns, which are unacceptable for space missions, despite improved conversion efficiencies (&gt;20%).&lt;ref name="Wilt"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilt, D., Chubb, D., Wolford, D., Magari, P. and Crowley, C.|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|journal=THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY: TPV7: Seventh World Conference on Thermophotovoltaic Generation of Electricity.  AIP Conference Proceedings|doi=10.1063/1.2711751 |bibcode=2007AIPC..890..335W|chapter=Thermophotovoltaics for Space Power Applications|year=2007|volume=890|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the recent advances in small-bandgap PVs, TPVs are becoming more promising candidates. A TPV radioisotope converter with 20% efficiency was demonstrated that uses a tungsten emitter heated to 1350 K, with tandem filters and a 0.6 eV bandgap InGaAs PV converter (cooled to room temperature). About 30% of the lost energy was due to the optical cavity and filters. The remainder was due to the efficiency of the PV converter.&lt;ref name="Wilt"/&gt;

Low-temperature operation of the converter is critical to the efficiency of TPV. Heating PV converters increases their dark current, thereby reducing efficiency. The converter is heated by the radiation from the emitter. In terrestrial systems it is reasonable to dissipate this heat without using additional energy with a [[heat sink]]. However, space is an isolated system, where heat sinks are impractical. Therefore, it is critical to develop innovative solutions to efficiently remove that heat, or optimized TPV cells that can operate efficiently with higher temperature converters. Both represent substantial challenges. Despite this, TPVs offer substantial promise for use in future space applications.&lt;ref name="Teofilo"/&gt;

===Commercial applications===

====Off-grid generators====

Many homes are located in remote regions not connected to the power grid. Where available, power line extensions can be impractical. TPVs can provide a continuous supply of power in off-grid homes. Traditional PVs on the other hand, would not provide sufficient power during the winter months and nighttime, while TPVs can utilize alternative fuels to augment solar-only production.

The greatest advantage for TPV generators is cogeneration of heat and power. In cold climates, it can function as both a heater or stove and a power generator. JX Crystals developed a prototype TPV heating stove and generator. It burns natural gas and uses a SiC source emitter operating at 1250&amp;nbsp;°C and GaSb photocell to output 25,000 [[British thermal unit|BTU]]/hr simultaneously generating 100 W. However, costs must be significantly reduced to render it commercially viable.

When a furnace is used as a heater and a generator, it is called [[combined heat and power]] (CHP). Many TPV CHP scenarios have been theorized, but a generator using boiling coolant was found most cost efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palfinger, G., Bitnar, B., Durisch, W., Mayor, J.C., Grützmacher, D. and Gobrecht, J.|title=Cost estimate of electricity produced by TPV|doi=10.1088/0268-1242/18/5/317|year=2003|journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=S254|bibcode = 2003SeScT..18S.254P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed CHP would utilize a SiC IR emitter operating at 1425&amp;nbsp;°C and GaSb photocells cooled by boiling coolant. The TPV CHP would output 85,000 BTU/hr and generate 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW. The estimated efficiency would be 12.3% and the investment would be 0.08 €/kWh provided that the lifetime of the CHP furnace is 20 years. The estimated cost of other non-TPV CHPs are 0.12 €/kWh for gas engine CHP and 0.16 €/kWh for fuel cell CHP. This proposed furnace has not been commercialized  because the market was not thought to be large enough.

====Recreational vehicles====

TPVs have been proposed for use in recreational vehicles. With the advent of hybrid and other electrically powered vehicles, power generators with electrical outputs have become more interesting. In particular the versatility of TPVs for fuel choice and the ability to use multiple fuel sources makes them interesting as a wider variety of fuels are being with better sustainability are emerging. The silent operation of TPVs allow the generation of electricity when and where the use of noisy conventional generators is not allowed (i.e. during "quiet hours" in national park campgrounds), and do not disturb others. However, the emitter temperatures required for practical efficiencies make TPVs on this scale unlikely.&lt;ref name="Coutts"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Coutts, T.

'''Whiteout''' is a [[weather]] condition in which visibility and contrast are severely reduced by [[snow]] or [[sand]]. The [[horizon]] disappears from view while the [[sky]] and [[landscape]] appear featureless, leaving no points of visual reference by which to navigate. Whiteout has been defined as: "A condition of diffuse light when no shadows are cast, due to a continuous white cloud layer appearing to merge with the white snow surface. No surface irregularities of the snow are visible, but a dark object may be clearly seen. There is no visible horizon."&lt;ref&gt;''The Crossing of Antarctica'' by Sir [[Vivian Fuchs]] and Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] (Glossary, page 296) Cassell, London, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

A whiteout may be due simply to extremely heavy snowfall rates as seen in [[lake-effect snow|lake effect]] conditions, or to other factors such as diffuse lighting from overcast [[cloud]]s, [[mist]] or [[fog]], or a background of snow. A person traveling in a true whiteout is at significant risk of becoming completely disoriented and losing their way, even in familiar surroundings. Motorists typically have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see. Normal [[snowfall]]s and [[blizzard]]s, where snow is falling at {{convert|1|or|2|in|cm|disp=x| per hour (|}}/h), or where the relief visibility is not clear yet having a clear field of view for over {{convert|30|ft|m|0|abbr=off|sp=us}}, are often incorrectly called whiteouts.

==Types==
There are three different forms of a whiteout:
# In [[blizzard]] conditions, snow already on the ground can become windblown, reducing visibility to near zero.
# In [[snowfall]] conditions, the volume of snow falling may obscure objects reducing visibility to near zero. An example of this is during [[lake-effect snow]] or mountain-effect snow, where the volume of snow can be many times greater than normal snows or blizzards.
# Where ground-level thick fog exists in a snow-covered environment, especially on open areas devoid of features.

==Variations==
A whiteout should not be confused with flat-light. Whilst there are similarities, both the causes and effects are different.

A '''whiteout''' is a reduction and scattering of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brentaski.com/blog/what-colour-ski-googles-is-best.html&lt;/ref&gt;
: Cause: Sunlight is blocked, reduced and scattered by ice crystals in falling snow, wind-blown spin-drift, water droplets in low-lying clouds or localised fog, etc. The remaining scattered light is merged and blended.

: Result: Due to a reduction in reflected light, visual references e.g. the horizon, terrain features, slope aspect, etc. are significantly reduced or completely blocked. This leads an inability to position yourself relative to the surroundings. In severe conditions an individual may experience a loss of [[kinesthesia]] (ability to discern position and movement), confusion, loss of balance and an overall reduction in the ability to operate.

'''Flat-light''' is a diffusion of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brentaski.com/blog/what-colour-ski-googles-is-best.html&lt;/ref&gt;
: Cause: Sunlight is both scattered and diffused by atmospheric particles (e.g. water molecules, ice crystals) and by snow lying on the ground; this causes light to be received from multiple directions. Commonly, the effect is increased during a whiteout and/or later in the day when the sun drops towards the horizon, due to sunlight passing through the atmosphere for a greater distance.

: Result: Light is received from multiple directions with each light source producing overlapping shadows which cancel-out each other. This dulls the area and removes indicators such as tones and contrast, making it difficult to discern similarly coloured slope features. The loss of visual indicators of shape and edge detail results in objects and features seeming to blend into each other, producing a flat featureless vista. An effect of visual blending may be a loss of depth of field resulting in disorientation.

==Hazards==
Whiteout conditions pose threats to mountain climbers, skiers, aviation, and mobile ground traffic. Motorists, especially those on large high-speed routes, are also at risk. There have been many major [[multiple-vehicle collision]]s associated with whiteout conditions. One motorist may come to a complete stop when he or she cannot see the road, while the motorist behind is still moving.

Local, short-duration whiteout conditions can be created artificially in the vicinity of airports and helipads due to aircraft operations. Snow on the ground can be stirred up by helicopter rotor down-wash or airplane jet blast, presenting hazards to both aircraft and bystanders on the ground.

'''Z Matrix''' or ''bus [[impedance matrix]]'' is an important tool in power system analysis. Though, it is not frequently used in

== Context ==
[[Power engineering|Electric power transmission]] needs optimization. Only [[Computer simulation]] allows the complex handling required. The ''Zbus'' matrix is a big tool in that box.

==Formulation==
Z Matrix can be formed by either inverting the [[Ybus matrix]] or by using [[Z bus building algorithm]]. The latter method is harder to implement but more practical and faster (''in terms of computer run time and number of floating-point operations per second'') for a relatively large system.

Formulation:

&lt;math&gt;Z_{bus} = {Y_{bus}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the Zbus is the inverse of the Ybus, it is [[symmetric matrix|symmetrical]] like the Ybus. The diagonal elements of the Zbus are referred to as driving-point [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s of the buses and the off-diagonal elements are called transfer impedances.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, John; Stevenson, William (2003). ''Power System Analysis.'' McGraw-Hill. pp 284&lt;/ref&gt; 

One reason the Ybus is so much more popular in calculation is the matrix becomes [[sparse matrix|sparse]] for large systems; that is, many elements go to zero as the admittance between two far away buses is very small. In the Zbus, however, the impedance between two far away buses becomes very large, so there are no zero elements, making computation much harder.

The operations to modify an existing Zbus are straightforward, and outlined in Table 1.

To create a Zbus matrix from scratch, we
start by listing the equation for one branch:

&lt;math&gt;[V_1] = [Z_a][I_1]&lt;/math&gt;

Then we add additional branches according
to Table 1 until each bus is expressed in the matrix:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
V_1\\
V_2
\end{bmatrix}

= 
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_a &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; Z_b
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
I_1\\
I_2
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
