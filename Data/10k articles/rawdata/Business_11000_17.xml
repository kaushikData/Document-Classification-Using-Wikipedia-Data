The Sixth Avenue Line platforms are located one block west of, and above, the Flushing Line platforms; the platforms are connected by a passageway. Free transfers between the two stations were available on Mondays to Fridays from December 18, 1967, until 1968, by providing paper tickets to passengers, who would exit one station and follow the sidewalk in order to enter the other. The tunnel now permits leaving a train in one station and walking underground to one in the other, and takes away the need for transfer tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/12/17/archives/some-subway-riders-to-get-free-transfers.html|title=Some Subway Riders To Get Free Transfers|date=December 17, 1967|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire station complex was fully renovated in 1998. There are three elevators to street level&amp;nbsp;– one each located on the southwestern and northwestern corners of Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street, and one on the western side of Sixth Avenue between 39th and 40th Streets&amp;nbsp;– but there are no elevators to either platform level, so the station complex is not fully [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]].

In 2010, it was rated the noisiest place in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2010/01/the_bryant_park_subway_stop_is.html|title=The Bryant Park Subway Stop Is Destroying Your Ears|last=Amira|first=Dan|publisher=New York magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/01/04/noisiest-spots-in-nyc-ranked/|title=Noisiest Spots in NYC Ranked|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transfer to the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] at [[Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Times Square]] is proposed as part of the 2015&amp;ndash;2019 MTA Capital Program. A new platform for the shuttle, which would be {{convert|28|ft|m}} wide and located between Tracks 1 and 4 (the outer tracks of the shuttle tunnel), would replace the existing curved platforms for tracks 1, 3, and 4. The platform would be built along the section of the shuttle that runs under 42nd Street, which is located within a straight tunnel. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The Times Square shuttle platform will be extended {{convert|360|ft|m}} east to allow for a second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line platforms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/hearings/160823/Description-of-Projects-Booklet.pdf|title=Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Notice of Public Hearing and Description of Projects – Tuesday, August 23, 2016 4:30 P.M. – Request for Federal Financial Assistance Under the Federal Transportation Authorization For Federal Fiscal Year 2017 Capital Improvement Projects|last=|first=|date=July 28, 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817204721/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/hearings/160823/Description-of-Projects-Booklet.pdf|archive-date=August 17, 2016|dead-url=y|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/pdf/CapitalProgram2015-19_WEB%20v4%20FINAL_small.pdf |title=MTA Capital Program 2015-2019 |last= |first= |date=October 28, 2015 |website=mta.info |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capitaldashboard/allframenew_head.html?PROJNUM=t7041404&amp;PLTYPE=1 |title=T7041404 Reconstruction of Times Square Shuttle - Phase 3 |last= |first= |date= |website=web.mta.info |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''42nd Street–Bryant Park''', opened on December 15, 1940 as part of the opening of the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] from [[47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center]] to [[West Fourth Street–Washington Square (New York City Subway)|West Fourth Street]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/12/15/archives/new-subway-line-on-6th-ave-opens-at-midnight-fete-mayor-and-2000.html|title=New Subway Line on 6th Ave. Opens at Midnight Fete|date=December 15, 1940|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=1|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an express [[metro station|station]], with four tracks and two [[island platform]]s. '''B''' and '''D''' trains stop at the inner express tracks while '''F''' and '''M''' trains stop at the outer local tracks.

Both outer track walls have a scarlet red trim line with a chocolate brown border and small white "42" signs on a black background below them at regular intervals. Red I-beam columns run along both sides of both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. Some of the columns between the express tracks have black "42" signs on a white background.

This station has a full length [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] above the platforms and tracks. It originally extended south from 42nd Street to the [[34th Street–Herald Square (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|34th Street–Herald Square]] station, with additional entrances at 38th Street. The passageway was long, dim, and lightly traveled, and it was finally closed in 1991 after a series of rapes took place there.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/23/nyregion/subway-path-boarded-shut-after-a-rape.html|title=Subway Path Boarded Shut After a Rape|last=Wolff|first=Craig|date=March 23, 1991|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now used for storage. The mezzanine has a florist, orange [[I-beam]] columns, lit-up ads, and space rentals along the walls.

South of this station, there are three sets of crossovers, allowing trains to switch between all four tracks. Those switches are not currently used in revenue service.

===Exits===
On either end of the mezzanine is a fare control area. The full-time side is at the north end. This is where the passageway to the IRT Flushing Line is located. Two staircases from each platform go up to a turnstile bank, where outside there is a token booth, one staircase going up to the southwest corner of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, and a passageway through some abandoned ticket counters under 1095 Avenue of the Americas that lead to a staircase that goes up to the building's pedestrian plaza.&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015/&gt;

On the south end of the mezzanine, two staircases from each platform go up to an unstaffed bank of regular and HEET turnstiles. Outside fare control, there are three staircases going up to the northwestern, northeastern, and southeastern corners of 40th Street and Sixth Avenue with the northwestern one being built inside a building. There is another exit at the northwest corner of Sixth Avenue and 39th Street.&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015/&gt;

This station has another fare control area at its extreme north end. A staircase from each platform goes up to a mezzanine, where a bank of regular and HEET turnstiles provide access to/from the station. Outside fare control, there is a Customer Assistance Booth and a staircase built inside 1100 Avenue of the Americas ([[HBO]] headquarters) that goes up to the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue.

Two modern, glass-enclosed staircases, and one elevator go up to the northwest corner of this intersection outside of the [[Bank of America Tower (New York City)|Bank of America Tower]]. Another elevator, located within a building, leads from the mezzanine to the southwest corner of the intersection via a staircase and wheelchair ramp. One more elevator, at the northwest corner of Sixth Avenue and 39th Street entrance, was created for the 40th Street mezzanine. The station has a total of 3 elevator entrances. However, because there are no elevators from the mezzanine to the platforms, the platforms themselves are not [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]].&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Midtown West|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M10_midtown_west_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=December 11, 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fifth Avenue''' (signed as '''Fifth Avenue – Bryant Park''') on the [[IRT Flushing Line]] has a local station configuration with two tracks serving the '''[[7 (New York City Subway service)|7]]''' train at all times and the '''[[7d (New York City Subway service)|&amp;lt;7&amp;gt;]]''' train on weekdays in the peak direction.

=== History ===
The Fifth Avenue station opened on March 22, 1926, extending the IRT Flushing Line one stop to the west from the line's previous terminus at Grand Central.&lt;ref name="nyt-1926-03-23"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A15F93B591B7A93C1AB1788D85F428285F9|title=Fifth Av. Station of Subway Opened|date=March 23, 1926|newspaper=The New York Times|page=29|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This station served as the western terminus of the line until the Times Square station on the line opened on March 14, 1927.&lt;ref name="nyt-1927-03-15"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A14F73E5B157A93C7A81788D85F438285F9|title=New Queens Subway Opened to Times Sq.|date=March 15, 1927|newspaper=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platforms at Fifth Avenue and all other stations on the Flushing Line with the exception of [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]] were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrAjAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=dyre+avenue+line&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22main+street%22|title=Minutes and Proceedings|last=Authority|first=New York City Transit|date=January 1, 1955|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Layout ===
This station has two tracks and one [[island platform]]. The platform walls have a mosaic golden trimline with "5" tablets at regular intervals along it.

The 2002 artwork here is called ''Under Bryant Park'' by Samm Kunce. It is located in the transfer passageway and consists of glass mosiac and etched granite depicting roots of trees with various literary quotes.

The Fifth Avenue station is the first within the subway system to receive a vending machine that dispenses make up and other retail products. It is part of a pilot program to increase retail activity within the MTA system, and it capitalizes on a new trend in [[vending machine]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/news/2013/10/30/mta-pilots-virtual-retail-subway|title=MTA Pilots Virtual Retail in Subway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station has a full length mezzanine directly above the platform and tracks. The full-time fare control is at the east end. A single stair on the southwest corner of 5th Avenue and 42nd Street in front of the [[New York Public Library Main Building]] goes down to an area that has a full-time token booth and turnstile bank that leads to several staircases down to the platform.&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015/&gt;

Towards the west end, the mezzanine splits in 2 with 1 portion becoming a down hill ramp where there is another staircases up from the platform before leading to the passageway to the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]]. The portion of the mezzanine that curves up leads to some HEET turnstiles and a small fare control area. The two adjacent street stairs here have elaborate ironwork and go up to the south side of 42nd Street between 5th and 6th Avenues on the northern edge of [[Bryant Park]].&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015/&gt;

'''456 Montgomery Plaza''' is a {{convert|379|ft|abbr=on}}, 26-[[storey|story]] [[Office#Grading|class-A office]] [[skyscraper]] on [[Montgomery Street]] in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

==History==

456 Montgomery was constructed in the mid-1980s on the site of the Italian American Bank (designed by [[Albert Pissis]] in 1907) and A. Borel and Company (designed by [[John Galen Howard|Howard and Galloway]] in 1908).&lt;ref name="Cerny2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Dinkelspiel Cerny|title=An Architectural Guidebook to San Francisco and the Bay Area|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkVQx6MWa8MC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=30 November 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-58685-432-4|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern tower retains the classic temple facades at its base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Classical-banks-with-a-tower-on-top-3725281.php |title=Classical banks with a tower on top |last=King |first=John |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=July 22, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original bank facade architects are incorrectly attributed in the earlier comments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gyori, architect representing building owners&lt;/ref&gt;

456 Montgomery, completed in August 1985, is a 26-story steel frame high-rise office tower rising above two circa 1907 landmark granite banking facades. Serving as the primary building entrance at 456 Montgomery is the former Borel Bank (then 440 Montgomery (Albert Pissis)) while at the corner of Montgomery and Sacramento Streets is the original Italian American Bank headquarters (John Galen Howard) that now fronts a leased commercial banking space at 460 Montgomery Street.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gyori, architect representing building owners&lt;/ref&gt;

Preserving the two landmark facades took advantage of a new, and at times controversial, urban design precedent as illustrated by other similar projects such as 353 Sacramento and One Sansome Streets. All three of these projects serve to varying degrees of success as examples of a design strategy intended to resolve conflicts between the architectural preservation and development communities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gyori, architect representing building owners&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Adolf Engström''' (17 February 1855 — 19 June 1924) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Engström got familiar already at early age with large [[machinery]] and [[engineering]] [[workshop]] environment due to his stepfather's work as engineer in the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]]. After completing his [[mechanical engineering]] studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Helsinki Polytechnic School]] in 1877, Engström went to gain experience abroad in [[Sweden]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].

Upon his return in 1884, Engström got vacance in the State Railways. He took successfully part in [[steam locomotive]] designing, which was followed by railway projects in Savonia and Karelia. He worked as director for stone company Ab Granit in 1889–1895, after which he returned to State Railways for another five years.

Engström was appointed manager of [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]] in 1900. During his time the company developed rapidly and the sales increased significantly, largely due to [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[First World War]]. On the other hand, the time was difficult due to increased [[Strike action|strikes]] and confrontation between the workers and employers. Engström left his position as company manager in 1918; this was affected by the death of his son in the previous [[Finnish Civil War]].

== Early life ==
Adolf Engström was born in [[Vörå]], Ostrobothnia.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; His parents were [[land surveyor]] Leonhard Engström and Adolfina née Taxell, who was daughter of [[Messukylä]] [[vicar]] Jonas Gabriel Taxell. The couple had two daughters and sons Adolf and Otto. Leonhard Engström died when Adolf was four years old, and the widow got married to her late husband's older brother Carl Petter Engström, who was [[Mechanical Engineer]]. The family moved to [[Helsinki]] in 1862, and the Ostrobothnian boy had to adopt to a new environment. The stepfather worked for the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]], and that way Adolf got familiar with [[engineering]] [[workshops]] and large [[machinery]] during his childhood. C. P. Engström became Chief Engineer in the State Railways in 1870 and during 1877–1890 he was board member in railway administration.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Studies and early career ==
Engström graduated from Helsinki Swedish Normal Lyceum in 1874 and continued his studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Helsinki Polytechnic School]] and graduated Mechanical Engineer in 1877.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; He wanted to gain abroad useful practical experience abroad, which he could later use for developing his home country.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt; Engström first worked for [[Motala Verkstad|Motala Engineering Works]] in [[Sweden]] as [[draftsman]], and then in [[German Empire|Germany]] for [[Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG]] and [[Hohenzollern Locomotive Works]]. He went next to [[England]], where he worked for [[Beyer Peacock &amp; Co]] in [[Manchester]]. Engström's following step was the [[United States]]; he worked for [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] [[Altoona Works]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt;

== State Railways ==
In 1884 Engström returned to Finland, for State Railways, to take part in a locomotive project. The target was to design a locomotive suitable for [[Oulu]] railway; it should be firewood compatible and also stronger and more [[Fuel efficiency|fuel efficient]], than a type used on [[Vaasa|Nikolaistad]] railway. Engström redesigned the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] and made the structure more robust. This locomotive type was produced total 104 units.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

After the Oulu railway was built, Engström continued in Savonian and Karelian railway projects. He worked for State Railways until 1889.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

Engström returned to State Railways for 1895–1900 to work as engineering workshop manager's assistant.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Ab Granit ==
As there were no new railway development projects, Engström sought for new opportunities. In 1889 he was appointed director and technical manager of Ab Granit, which was a stone company in [[Hanko]]. The company had gained foothold in construction business in Helsinki and grown amongst 30 largest companies of Finland. At the turn of the 1890s the company employed 268 people. The 1894 erected [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] statue in [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]], of which foundation was constructed by Granit, promoted the company's sales in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works ==
Engström was appointed manager of [[Hietalahti shipyard|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] ("Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works") in 1900. He followed engineer [[Edvin Bergroth]], who was the first manager of the company that was re-established after [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt; Bergroth had developed the operations through investments, and Engström received leadership of a financially solid company, which he continued developing determinedly.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.58-77"&gt;Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: ''Toiminta uuden vuosisadan aikana. Vuodet 1901–1914.'' pp. 58–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Engström sometimes faced situations which needed quick decisions – he for example received repair work of a [[shipwreck]]ed vessel which was too large to the [[Dry dock|dock]]; the dock was extended during the salvage process.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904–1905 led to increased order intake of [[torpedo boat]]s for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. During 1900–1914 the company built total about 60 steam and motor vessels. In addition to shipbuilding, the company produced large number of ship engines, [[Boiler (power generation)|steam boilers]] and also [[railway wagon]]s.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt; Engström's personal contribution was significant in the rolling stock production, and the wagon projects balanced the wintertime docking workload drop.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.58-77"/&gt;

Engström developed and modernised the [[shipyard]]; this meant new methods, as electrical [[welding]] and [[pneumatic tool]]s. The dock was further extended in 1910 and 1912 and a new [[brass foundry]] was taken into use in 1914. Two years later a new main engineering workshop was opened. Prior to the [[First World War]], the company employed 597 people and the annual sales reached 2.4 million [[Finnish markka|marks]]. The First World War increased the business again; during 1915–1917 the company docked total 400 vessels. Engström had also further plans which did not actualise, such as a new dock layout, that would have enabled building many large ships simultaneously. All the investments were funded by company profit, and the company did not collect capital from outside during that. By 1919, when Engström left his position, the share capital had grown from half million to six million marks.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

Engström's era as shipyard leader was the time of organisation of labour and employers. The yard experienced some occasional [[Strike action|strikes]] at the late 19th century, and after the yard faced larger strikes and conflicts in 1902, Engström called other engineering industry employers to negotiate about forming an [[employers' association]]. The first general [[collective agreement]] between the [[Trade union|union]] and employers was signed in 1906. Already in 1908 the employers planned to end the agreements because they had not put an end to striking. At the beginning Engström supported collective agreements, but changed his mind in 1909. This led to a long-term strike, which eventually ended to defeat for the union – the engineering industry workers returned to work without having a collective agreement. Consequently, the relations between employers' association and trade unions suffered badly.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Organisational activities ==
Engström was founding member of the 1903 created Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association and deputy chairman until 1911, after which he served as chairman until 1919. He also took part in founding the Swedish Technical Science Academy of Finland &lt;!-- Svenska tekniska vetenskapsakademien i Finland --&gt; and he became honorary member of the Finnish Technical Association in 1920.&lt;!-- Suomen Teknillinen Yhdistys --&gt; During 1903−1911 he was member of Helsinki City Council.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt;

== Committee memberships ==
*Railway Economy Investigation Committee, &lt;!-- Rautateiden talouden tutkimuskomitea --&gt; 1885–1895 and 1906
*Railway Committee, 1892–1893
*Committee for Railway Rolling Stock Construction Promotion, &lt;!-- Komitea rautateiden liikkuvan kaluston rakentamisen edistämiseksi --&gt; 1896

== Personal life ==
Engström got married to Eva Alexandra Karolina née Jansson in 1885. Their only son died in the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918. This made Engström to leave his position as company manager. The couple donated a large sum to be shared as [[scholarship]]s to young technicians, who were orientated to [[shipbuilding]] and engineering industry.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

The '''American Tobacco Company''' was a [[tobacco company]] founded in 1890 by [[James Buchanan Duke|J. B. Duke]] through a merger between a number of U.S. [[tobacco]] manufacturers including [[Allen and Ginter]] and [[Goodwin &amp; Company]]. The company was one of the original 12 members of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] in 1896. The American Tobacco Company dominated the industry by acquiring the [[Lucky Strike]] Company and over 200 other rival firms.  [[Antitrust]] action begun in 1907 broke the company into several major companies in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. American Tobacco Co.]]'', {{ussc|221|106|1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Tobacco Company restructured itself in 1969, forming a holding company called American Brands, Inc., which operated American Tobacco as a subsidiary. American Brands acquired a variety of non-tobacco businesses during the 1970s and 1980s and sold its tobacco operations to [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] in 1994. American Brands subsequently renamed itself [[Fortune Brands]].

== History of the American Tobacco Company ==

=== Origins ===
[[James Buchanan Duke]]’s entrance into the cigarette industry came about in 1879 when he elected to enter a new business rather than face competition in the shredded pouched smoking tobacco business against the [[W. T. Blackwell and Company Tobacco Factory|Bull Durham]] brand, also from [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="PatrickG.Porter" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Patrick G.|title=Origins of the American Tobacco Company|date=1969|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|page=63|edition=1|accessdate=16 November 2015|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/origins-of-the-american-tobacco-company/7E914B46F4C45E1A0D1A513DCBFD1511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duke Cigarettes.JPG|thumb|left|Classic cigarettes by W. Duke &amp; Sons Co. of Durham, NC]]

In 1881, two years after [[W. Duke Sons &amp; Company]] entered into the cigarette business, [[James Bonsack]] invented a cigarette-rolling machine. It produced over 200 cigarettes per minute, the equivalent of what a skilled hand roller could produce in one hour, and reduced the cost of rolling cigarettes by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=27–28}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It cut each cigarette with precision, creating uniformity in the cigarettes it rolled. Public stigma was attached to this machine-rolled uniformity, and [[Allen &amp; Ginter]] rejected the machine almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=28}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke set a deal with the Bonsack Machine Company in 1884. Duke agreed to produce all cigarettes with his two rented Bonsack machines and in return, Bonsack reduced Duke’s royalties from $0.30 per thousand to $0.20 per thousand. Duke also hired one of Bonsack’s mechanics, resulting in fewer breakdowns of his machines than his competitors’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=29}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This secret contract resulted in a competitive advantage over Duke's competitors; he was able to lower his prices further than others could.

In the 1880s, while Duke was beginning to machine-roll all his cigarettes, he saw that growth rates in the cigarette industry were declining. His solution was to combine companies and found “one of the first great holding companies in American history.”&lt;ref name="Porter, Patrick G. p. 59"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Patrick G.|title=Origins of the American Tobacco Company|date=1969|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|page=59|edition=1|accessdate=16 November 2015|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/origins-of-the-american-tobacco-company/7E914B46F4C45E1A0D1A513DCBFD1511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke spent $800,000 on advertising in 1889 and lowered his prices, accepting net profits of less than $400,000, forcing his major competitors to lower their prices and, in 1890, join his consortium by the name of the American Tobacco Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=32–33}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, John Wilber: ''James B. Duke: Master Builder'', p. 85. George H. Doran Company, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;  The five constituent companies of American Tobacco: W. Duke &amp; Sons, [[Allen &amp; Ginter]], [[W.S. Kimball &amp; Company]], [[Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company|Kinney Tobacco]], and [[Goodwin &amp; Company]] – produced 90% of the cigarettes made in 1890, the first year the American Tobacco Company was listed on the [[NYSE]]. Within two decades of its founding, the American Tobacco company absorbed about 250 companies and produced 80% of the cigarettes, plug tobacco, smoking tobacco, and snuff produced in the United States.&lt;ref name="Porter, Patrick G. p. 59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=34}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With Duke's innovation, American Tobacco grew its equity from $25,000,000 to $316,000,000.

=== The "Tobacco Trust" ===

American Tobacco Company quickly became known as the “Tobacco Trust” upon its founding. Duke controlled the cigarette market, and his trust caught the attention of legislators in the United States, a country with historical aversion to [[monopoly|monopolies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|page=34}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

American Tobacco Company focused solely on making and selling cigarettes, leaving growing of tobacco and retail distribution to independent entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=35}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Duke aimed to eliminate inefficiencies and middlemen through [[vertical integration|vertical consolidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=36}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The American Tobacco Company began to expand to Great Britain, China, and Japan. The company also maintained an interest in producing other tobacco products in case fads shifted; Duke wanted to be sure that he would be prepared with a multitude of tobacco styles. The Tobacco Trust's international expansion in conjunction with its consolidation of all types of tobacco “ultimately made the Trust so vulnerable to regulation and judicial dissolution”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=36–37}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] was passed in 1890, and in 1907, the American Tobacco Company was indicted in violation of it.&lt;ref name = "brandt39"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=39}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, when the Department of Justice filed suit against the company, 65 companies and 29 individuals were named in the suit. The Supreme Court ordered the company to dissolve in 1911 on the same day that it ordered the [[Standard Oil Trust]] to dissolve.&lt;ref name = "brandt39"/&gt; The ruling in ''[[United States v. American Tobacco Co.]]'' stated that the combination of the tobacco companies “in and of itself, as well as each and all of the elements composing it whether corporate or individual, whether considered collectively or separately [was] in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize, and a monopolization within the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=John Wilber|title=James B. Duke, Master Builder.|date=1971|publisher=Reprint Co.|location=Spartanburg, S.C.|isbn=9780871520661|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/James_B_Duke_master_builder.html?id=qDMsAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissolution ===
Dissolution proved complicated. The American Tobacco Company had combined many prior companies and processes. One department would manage a certain process for the entire organization, producing brands previously owned by other companies. “Plants had been assigned specific products without regard for previous ownership.”&lt;ref name = "brandt40"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=40}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of eight months, a plan for the dissolution, meant to assure competition among the new companies, was negotiated.&lt;ref name = "brandt40" /&gt;

The trust needed to dissolve in such a way that no manufacturer had a monopoly on any type of tobacco product. Investors, holding millions of dollars of securities, also needed to be considered.  A large question was how to distribute trademarks and brands between the resulting companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=John Wilber|title=James B. Duke, Master Builder.|date=1971|publisher=Reprint Co.|location=Spartanburg, S.C.|isbn=9780871520661|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/James_B_Duke_master_builder.html?id=qDMsAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Tobacco Company's assets were split off into: American Tobacco Company, the existing [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]], [[Liggett &amp; Myers]], and [[Lorillard]]. The monopoly became an [[oligopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=41}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main result of the dissolution of American Tobacco Trust and the creation of these companies was an increase in advertising and promotion in the industry as a form of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Allan M.|authorlink1=Allan M. Brandt|title=The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465070473|pages=42}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liggett &amp; Myers ====

== More recent history ==
At the same time as the antitrust action in 1911, the company's share in [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT) was sold. In 1994, BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganized after antitrust proceedings). This brought the [[Lucky Strike]] and [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]] brands into BAT's portfolio as part of BAT's American arm, Brown &amp; Williamson. B&amp;W later merged with [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] in 2004.

American Tobacco left Durham in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santiago|first1=Leyla|title=Former workers return to American Tobacco after 'remarkable reboot'|url=http://www.wral.com/former-workers-return-to-american-tobacco-after-remarkable-reboot-/13957691/|accessdate=16 November 2015|work=WRAL|publisher=Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown &amp; Williamson took over the [[Reidsville, North Carolina]] operation in 1995 and closed it, costing 1000 people their jobs, but [[Imperial Tobacco|Commonwealth Brands]] took it over in a deal completed in October 1996, when the plant had 311 employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buyout Leaves Owner Upbeat, Workers Uneasy|last=Weidner|first=David|work=[[Greensboro News &amp; Record]]|date=October 24, 1996|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and kept 100 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayodan Will Survive the Closing of Unifi Inc.'s Plant, Town Officials Say|last=Daniel|first=Fran|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=June 25, 1998|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Work Slows at Reidsville Tobacco Plant|work=[[Greensboro News &amp; Record]]|date=December 21, 1996|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITG Brands]] announced November 1, 2018 that the plant would close in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.greensboro.com/business/local_business/itg-brands-moving-tobacco-production-from-reidsville-to-greensboro/article_67b26f83-d734-50b6-95a9-ca7b275ff9e4.html|title=ITG Brands moving tobacco production from Reidsville to Greensboro |work=[[News &amp; Record]]|date= November 1, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redevelopment ===
In 2004, the previously abandoned American Tobacco Campus (ATC) in Durham was reopened as a complex of offices, shops, and restaurants. Developed by [[Capitol Broadcasting]] and reopened as the [[American Tobacco Historic District]], phase 1 consisted of the Fowler, Crowe, Strickland, Reed, and Washington Buildings, and included the construction of two new parking garages and a waterfall feature through the center of the campus designed by Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart of [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and constructed by W. P. Law, Inc. based in [[Lexington, South Carolina]]. Phase 2, consisting of the remaining buildings and expansion of the water feature at the north end of the site, was under construction as of late 2006.  Many office spaces in the ATC are now used by [[Duke University]].  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000 as the American Tobacco Company Manufacturing Plant.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[Watts and Yuille Warehouses]] were listed in 1984 and the [[Smith Warehouse]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

The [[American Tobacco Trail]], named for the company, is a multi-use [[rail-trail]] that begins just south of the Durham complex and runs {{convert|22|mi|km}} towards Chatham and Wake Counties. It follows the route of the railroad ([[Norfolk Southern Railway (former)]] Durham Branch) that once served the factories, but was later abandoned when these facilities were shut down.

=== Advertising ===
In the golden age of radio, as well as early television, American Tobacco was known for advertisements featuring a fast-talking tobacco auctioneer named L. A. "Speed" Riggs. His rapid-fire and song-like patter would always end with the exclamation, "SOLD, American!" Another famous tobacco auctioneer, F. E. Boone, was often heard in tandem with Riggs.

'''Andrew Jack Entrican''' (1858 – 19 February 1936) was an Irish-born New Zealand businessman and local-body politician. He was twice deputy mayor of Auckland.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Entrican was born in [[Stoneyfield]], [[County Tyrone]], Ireland in 1858 to Robert Entrican, a local farmer, and was educated at Edwards School.&lt;ref name=ASobit&gt;{{cite news |title=City's Loss |date=19 February 1936 |work=[[Auckland Star]] |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19420914.2.18.2 |volume=LXVII |issue=42 |page=8 |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 he married Elizabeth Mackay with whom he had one son.&lt;ref name=NZHobit&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Citizen |date=20 February 1936 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19360220.2.108 |volume=LXXIII |issue=22348 |page=12 |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business career===
He began his business career in [[Derry]] with a firm of merchants. When he was 21 he emigrated to New Zealand arriving in [[Auckland]] in January 1880 on the ship ''Ben Nevis''. After his arrival he became the assistant manager of a retail business owned by Charles Major, later taking it over himself in partnership with Samuel Taylor. This business was dissolved in 1885 and Entrican then became a commission agent. In 1887 he established the firm of A. J. Entrican and Company (later joined by his younger brother) and served as executive manager until his death.&lt;ref name=ASobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZHobit/&gt;

===Political career===
In 1897 he was elected to the [[Auckland Harbour Board]] and the following year to the [[Auckland City Council]]. He resigned from the Harbour Board in 1899 but remained on the council until 1918, and again from 1920 until 1935. He served under 10 Mayors, and was deputy to six of them, holding that office for two separate terms for a combined 17 years. A popular councillor he was returned at the top of the City Council poll on three occasions. Entrican returned the Harbour Board in 1907 and remained a member until 1921, serving as chairman between 1910 and 1911.&lt;ref name=ASobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZHobit/&gt;

He contested the {{NZ electorate link|Auckland West}} electorate as the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] candidate in the {{NZ election link|1919}} where he polled third out of three candidates.&lt;ref name="Year-Book 1920"&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. |last1=Hislop |title=The General Election, 1919 |url= http://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&amp;d=AJHR1921-I-II.2.3.2.45 |publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand|National Library]] |accessdate=6 December 2014 |pages=1–6 | year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a trustee of the Auckland Savings Bank, a member of the executive of the Auckland Patriotic Association, the Auckland Fire Board, the Auckland and Suburban Drainage Board.&lt;ref name=NZHobit/&gt;

===Death===
He died on 19 February 1936 of a stroke.&lt;ref name=NZHobit/&gt;

{{Chemical engineering}}
In a [[Process (science)|scientific]] sense, a '''chemical process''' is a method or means of somehow changing one or more [[chemical]]s or [[chemical compound]]s. Such a chemical process can occur by itself or be caused by an outside force, and involves a [[chemical reaction]] of some sort. In an "[[Process (engineering)|engineering]]" sense, a chemical process is a method intended to be used in [[manufacturing]] or on an industrial scale (see [[Industrial process]]) to change the composition of chemical(s) or material(s), usually using technology similar or related to that used in [[chemical plant]]s or the [[chemical industry]].  

Neither of these definitions are exact in the sense that one can always tell definitively what is a chemical process and what is not; they are practical definitions.  There is also significant overlap in these two definition variations.   Because of the inexactness of the definition, chemists and other scientists use the term "chemical process" only in a general sense or in the engineering sense.  However, in the "process (engineering)" sense, the term "chemical process" is used extensively.  The rest of the article will cover the engineering type of chemical process.  

Although this type of chemical process may sometimes involve only one step, often multiple steps, referred to as [[unit operation]]s, are involved.  In a [[Factory|plant]],   each of the unit operations commonly occur in individual vessels or sections of the plant called '''units'''.  Often, one or more [[chemical reaction]]s are involved, but other ways of changing chemical (or material) composition may be used, such as [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]] or [[separation process]]es.  The process steps may be sequential in time or sequential in space along a stream of flowing or moving material; see [[Chemical plant#Continuous and batch operation|Chemical plant]].  For a given amount of a feed (input) material or product (output) material, an expected amount of material can be determined at key steps in the process from empirical data and material balance calculations.  These amounts can be scaled up or down to suit the desired capacity or operation of a particular chemical plant built for such a process.  More than one chemical plant may use the same chemical process, each plant perhaps at differently scaled capacities.  
Chemical processes like [[distillation]] and [[crystallization]] go back to [[alchemy]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].

Such chemical processes can be illustrated generally as '''[[Block diagram|block flow diagram]]s''' or in more detail as '''[[process flow diagram]]s'''.  Block flow diagrams show the units as blocks and the streams flowing between them as connecting lines with arrowheads to show direction of flow.   

In addition to chemical plants for producing chemicals, chemical processes with similar technology and equipment are also used in [[Oil refinery|oil refining]] and other [[Refining|refineries]], [[natural gas processing]], [[polymer]] and [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturing, [[food processing]], and [[water]] and [[wastewater treatment]].

==Unit processing in chemical process==
'''Unit processing''' is the basic processing in [[chemical engineering]].  Together with [[unit operation]]s it forms the main principle of the varied chemical industries.  Each genre of unit processing follows the same chemical law much as each genre of [[unit operation]]s follows the same physical law.

Chemical engineering unit processing consists of the following important processes:

*[[Oxidation]]
*[[Redox|Reduction]]
*[[Hydrogenation]]
*[[Dehydrogenation]]
*[[Hydrolysis]]
*[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]]
*[[Dehydration reaction|Dehydration]]
*[[Halogenation]]
*[[Nitrification]]
*[[Sulfonation]]
*[[Ammoniation]]
*[[Alkaline fusion]]
*[[Alkylation]]
*[[Dealkylation]]
*[[Esterification]]
*[[Polymerization]]
*[[Polycondensation]]
*[[Catalysis]]

{{Buzzword|date=July 2011}}

A '''chief knowledge officer''' ('''CKO''') is an organizational leader, responsible for ensuring that the organization maximizes the value it achieves through "[[knowledge]]". The CKO is responsible for managing intellectual capital and the custodian of Knowledge Management practices in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Dalkir, K, (2005). Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice.  Jordan Hill, Oxford:  Elsevier Inc. 330&lt;/ref&gt; CKO is not just a relabelling of the title "[[chief information officer]]" - the CKO role is much broader. CKOs can help an organization maximize the returns on investment in knowledge (people, processes and [[intellectual capital]]), exploit their intangible assets (know-how, [[patent]]s, customer relationships), repeat successes, share [[best practices]], improve innovation, and avoid knowledge loss after organizational restructuring.

CKOs must have skills across a wide variety of areas. They must be good at developing/understanding the big picture, advocacy (articulation, promotion and justification of the knowledge agenda, sometimes against cynicism or even open hostility), project and people management (oversight of a variety of activities, attention to detail, ability to motivate), communications (communicating clearly the knowledge agenda, have good listening skills and be sensitive to organizational opportunities and obstacles), [[leadership]], [[teamwork]]ing, influencing, and [[interpersonal skills]]. The CKO who successfully combines these skills is well equipped as an excellent [[agent of change]] for their organization.

Other terms for CKO include knowledge manager, director of intellectual capital (e.g. [[Scandia]]), director of knowledge transfer (e.g. [[Buckman Laboratories]]), and knowledge asset manager (e.g. [[Dow Chemical]]).

==Responsibilities==
CKO responsibilities include such things as:
*Collecting relevant data that is useful for the organization as knowledge
*Developing an overall framework that guides [[knowledge management]]
*Actively promoting the knowledge agenda within and beyond the company
*Overseeing the development of the knowledge infrastructure
*Facilitating connections, coordination and communications.

==Knowledge Management Initiative==
Sunassee and Sewry&lt;ref&gt;Nakkiran N Sunassee and David A Sewry, “A Theoretical Framework for Knowledge Management Implementation”. ACM International Conference Proceeding Series; Vol. 30.  Proceedings of the 2002 annual research conference of the South African institute of computer scientists and information technologists on Enablement through technology, Port Elizabeth, South Africa, p. 235 – 245. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=581539&amp;coll=Portal&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=60827173&amp;CFTOKEN=60920289]&lt;/ref&gt; argued that top management needs to create and share a vision for the knowledge management initiative. The vision is the long-term strategy that will drive the knowledge management initiative and provide the scope within which the knowledge management effort and the organization will grow. The vision should also encompass the core beliefs and values of the organization.

The creation of the vision can be done in two ways. Top management can either appoint a Chief Knowledge Officer (CKO), who will create the vision, or they can create a vision and entrust the CKO to carry it out. It is extremely important at this point that the employees of the organization are allowed to share in the making of vision of the organization. This will create a sense of belonging for the employees, and allow them to participate in the change process. It will also make them accept the change process more readily than if they were not allowed to participate in it.

The views of the employees in the organisations should be considered and there should be a proper system created to share the views.

==Knowledge life-cycle==
Sunassee and Sewry proposed a ''knowledge life-cycle'' to create and maintain individual and organizational learning in the organization:

#Create new knowledge
##Identify new knowledge
##Identify old and existing knowledge
#Identify knowledge relevant to organization
#Verify selected knowledge
#Capture and organize knowledge
#Disseminate and use knowledge
#Combine new knowledge and re-evaluate assumptions to create knowledge

The CKO should actively manage all stages of the ''knowledge life-cycle'', but most importantly encourage people to disseminate knowledge, and to use it. The last step of the cycle involves re-evaluating assumptions held by the organization and using these new assumptions with the knowledge created by the organization to create new knowledge. This process will generate innovative knowledge and allow the organization to produce innovative products and business processes.

==Other CKO tasks==
* Encourage individual learning and [[innovative]] thinking
* Implement reward plans and incentives
* Determine what technology is needed for the knowledge management effort and implement these technologies.
* Put processes in place in order to facilitate the creation of organizational learning.
* Measure the impact of knowledge management on the business.

A '''controlling interest''' is an ownership interest in a corporation with enough voting [[stock]] shares to prevail in any [[stockholder]]s' motion. A majority of voting shares (over 50%) is always a controlling interest. When a party holds less than the majority of the voting shares, other present circumstances can be considered to determine whether that party is still considered to hold a controlling ownership interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|last1=Hefter|first1=Michael|last2=Philip|first2=Ryan|last3=Kolker|first3=David|title=Delaware Court Establishes "Taxonomy" For Controlling Stockholder Claims|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/delaware-court-establishes-taxonomy-controlling-stockholder-claims|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware corporation]]s have a 2/3 vote requirement for a motion to pass.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} In theory, this could mean that a controlling interest would have to be over one third of the voting shares.

'''Corporate development''' refers to the planning and execution of strategies to meet organizational objectives. The kinds of activities falling under corporate development may include management team recruitment, phasing in or out of markets or products, arranging strategic alliances, identifying and acquiring companies ([[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]]), securing [[Corporate finance|corporate financing]], [[Divestment|divesting of assets or divisions]], and management of intellectual property. The activities encompassed are often the role of the [[CEO]]. 

==Process==

Corporate strategy depends on the circumstances of a company and the area where development is desired. Corporate development is usually a process that takes place over an extended period of time and may be adjusted or refined as the project moves forward

==Reshaping management==

One of the manifestations of corporate development has to do with reshaping the management arm of the corporation. This may involve a process of phasing certain management positions out of the existing structure or creating new positions in an effort to strengthen the management team. As part of this type of approach, corporate development may also demand that one or more current managers are released from the company and replaced with people who possess skills required to move the company forward. When this is the case, the corporate development team will handle the functions of recruitment and evaluation of potential hires.

==Growing the company==

The process of corporate development can also be applied to the task of growing the company through mergers and acquisitions. In this scenario, the project development will involve identifying potential target companies for acquisitions or unions resulting in a new and more aggressive corporation. The team will consider all possible outcomes from any given potential merger or acquisition and attempt to project if the action is likely to result in positive growth or could possibly impair the company permanently.

Just as a management team may be revamped, corporate development may also be employed to change the current focus for clients. This may mean looking into the potential for breaking into new markets with existing products or developing complementary products that will allow this type of expansion. Corporate development strategy would monitor the trends associated with a corporation's products or services and helps the corporation establish strategies to find more customers. In addition, corporate development works to maximize the profits of a corporation by figuring out the appropriate pricing for a given good or service. A corporate development team also leads discussions with sales department heads regarding how to market corporate goods, organize marketing campaigns, analyze market research and incorporate any customer advice or complaints into marketing strategies in such cases; extensive industry specific business experience is often preferred which is why companies may hire an external firm to help them engage in such moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Corporate_Development_Manager_Career_Profile.html |title=Corporate Development Manager Careers: Salary &amp; Job Description |publisher=Diplomaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the status of the base market, corporate development may also look at shifting away from a shrinking consumer market while seeking market share in a different consumer market with newer products. For example, many typewriter manufacturers during the 1980s and 1990s slowly phased out their core business and began to focus more on computer parts and accessories as a way to continue operations.

==Need for specialists==
Particularly in larger companies, corporate development is provided as a charter for a particular executive or team. In these cases, the opportunities and initiatives are numerous enough to justify specialists, instead of being delegated to the office of the CEO and line of business executives. When focused on product or financial issues, corporate development executives often have [[MBA]], [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] or [[Certified Practising Accountant|CPA]] credentials. Often the internal corporate development executives come from a legal or investment banking background, due to the complex contractual and valuation issues associated with many transactions.

'''Deputy Commissioner''' (popularly abbreviated to "DC") or [[District Magistrate (Bangladesh)|District Magistrate]] is a chief administrative and revenue officer of a [[Districts of Bangladesh|district]] or an administrative sub-unit of a [[Divisions of Bangladesh|division]]. According to the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (Bangladesh)|Code of Criminal Procedure of Bangladesh]], the Government shall appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates and shall appoint one of them to be the District Magistrate.&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections.php?id=75%20Accessed&amp;vol=&amp;sections_id=14300|title=The Code of Criminal Procedure - Executive Magistrate|website=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term District Magistrate is used in the Criminal procedure code to denote the principal executive magistrate of the district. However, after 1960, the district magistrate term came to be redesignated throughout the country as Deputy Commissioner or DC. During the early year, before Bangladesh era, the deputy commissioner's office used to be concerned with internal security and revenue administration. Over the time, however, the office has become increasingly occupied with the general welfare of the people in the district. The Deputy Commissioner is a representative of the Government in the field of law and order, land administration, disaster management and general and local elections. The deputy commissioner works under the general guidance and supervision of the Divisional Commissioner. They are under the administrative control of the Cabinet Division although their posting and transfer are made by the [[Ministry of Public Administration]]. The deputy commissioners are drawn from the members of the [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] (Administration).&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Deputy_Commissioner|title=District Commissioner - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Clarke Cabot''' (August 17, 1818 &amp;ndash; January 5, 1901) was an American architect and artist.

==Early life==

Cabot's father was [[Samuel Cabot Jr.]], a shipping businessman. His mother was Eliza Perkins Cabot.&lt;ref name=EdwardCabotParents&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mckOVGD5E0sC&amp;pg=PA283 |title=Secret Societies of America's Elite: From the Knights Templar to Skull and Bones|first=Steven|last=Sora|publisher=Destiny Books|year=2003|accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had six siblings: Thomas Handasyd Cabot (b. 1814), [[Samuel Cabot III]] (b. 1815), [[James Elliot Cabot]] (b. 1821), Stephen Cabot (b. 1826), Walter Channing Cabot (b. 1829), and Louis Cabot (b. 1837).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59686021 "James Elliot 'Elliot' Cabot,"] FindAGrave.com.

==Career==
{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}

Cabot designed the [[Gibson House Museum|Gibson House]] for widow [[Catherine Hammond Gibson]] and her son [[Charles Hammond Gibson Jr]], as well as the new building for the [[Boston Athenaeum]] between 1847 and 1849.  After the opening of the Boston Athenaeum, he became a leading figure in Boston architectural circles. The Athenaeum was influenced by [[Charles Barry]]'s Italianate club house in London. He is also noted for producing several distinguished [[Queen Anne Style]] houses in the 1870s.

Cabot later formed a firm "Cabot and Chandler" which built numerous residences in the Back Bay and Boston environs. In 1879, Cabot &amp; Chandler responded to H.H. Richardson's introduction of the Stick Style of Architecture into the U.S. by his Sherman Watts House in Newport, with Cabot's splendid mansion for Elbridge Torrey at 1 Melville Avenue in Dorchester, MA.  The same year the firm designed 12 Fairfield Street in Boston's Back Bay for Georgiani Lowell.

==Personal life==
In 1842, Cabot married Martha Eunice Robinson. In 1873, he married Louisa Winslow Sewall. He was the father of football player [[Norman Cabot|Norman Winslow Cabot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harvard College Class of 1898 Quindecennial Report |date=1913 |publisher=Harvard University |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isknAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Enterprise social networking''' focuses on the use of online [[social network]]s or [[social relation]]s among people who share business interests and/or activities. Enterprise social networking is often a facility of [[enterprise social software]] (regarded as a primary component of [[Enterprise 2.0]]), which is essentially  [[social software]] used in "[[Business|enterprise]]" (business/commercial) contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Makkonen | first1 = H. | last2 = Virtanen | first2 = K. | year = 2015 | title = Social capital approach on Enterprise 2.0: a multiple case study | url = | journal = Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management| volume =  27| issue = | pages =  1212–1225| doi = 10.1080/09537325.2015.1061120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It encompasses modifications to corporate [[intranet]]s (referred to as social [[intranet]]s) and other classic [[software]] platforms used by large companies to organize their communication, collaboration and other aspects of their intranets. Enterprise social networking is also generally thought to include the use of a standard external [[social networking service]] to generate visibility for an enterprise.

==History==

Social networking sites started to form in the 1990s; an example of these websites is [[Theglobe.com]], which began in 1995. As other websites such as GeoCities and [[Tripod.com]] started to form online communities, they encouraged their users to interact with each other via [[chat rooms]] and other tools. They also provided easy-to-use publishing tools along with free web space. [[Classmates.com]]’s approach was to link people together via their emails, the website was like a friends search engine.

Businesses eventually realized that social networking websites could provide a fast and efficient way of marketing. Social media websites are great places for businesses to reach their customers, and the environment can provide a means for growing a business. 
In 2005, as social networking websites were becoming more and more popular, [[Myspace]] had more page views than [[Google]]. Myspace was followed by [[Facebook]] which started in February 2004.
When Facebook began, users were limited to college students in the [[United States]], who had to use a college email with a .edu extension to join the network.  In September 2005 some high schools were allowed to join the network, but they needed an invitation to join.  On September 26 of 2006, Facebook announced that anyone around the world older than 13 years old with a valid email would be able to join 
Facebook’s online community. 
In October 2007, Microsoft purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook. That gave them the right to place international ads on Facebook. In July 2010 it was reported that Facebook had more than 500 million active users. This means that one out of fourteen people around the world is a Facebook user.  
The growth of Facebook was a boom in the social networking space.  Facebook became a huge corporation that had 1400 employees in 2009; their estimated revenue was US$800 million in 2009. In 2010, it was reported that there were more than 200 social networking websites on the web.&lt;ref&gt;Get Connected: The Social Networking Toolkit for Business By Starr Hall, Chadd Rosenberg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging trends===

Many companies are starting to implement social networks to promote collaboration amongst their employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/322857/The_new_employee_connection_Social_networking_behind_the_firewall?taxonomyId=16&amp;pageNumber=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hrcommunications.com/Main/Articles/Employee_networking_The_next_generation_1109.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Vendors are now starting to use this as a way to help out the different companies.  Some companies are starting to teach their employees about cloud computing and SaaS.  These new technologies are being added to the enterprise social networks.  These networks are being implemented to get employees collaborating and sharing tips and ideas about how to improve the workplace.  Some social networks are homegrown systems that are built internally.  Companies are using social networks to trade information amongst team members or other people who are part of the company.  Sometimes this might also mean trading documents in real time.  Based on research by Gartner (2010), 50% of enterprises will be using some sort of social network by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/ten-emerging-enterprise-20-technologies-to-watch/1224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/471166/NewsGator_Sharpens_Enterprise_Social_Network_Product&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/486466/Report_Enterprises_Struggle_to_Adopt_Social_Networking_Internally
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business impacts==
Companies such as Jive Software and IBM have recently been doing research to see how social networking can impact enterprise networks.  Different companies have embraced social networking and they are creating their own internal social networking sites. IBM is one example and they have created the Beehive research project, based on their Lotus Connections product.&lt;ref&gt;Geyer, Werner, Dugan, Casey, DiMicco, Joan, Millen, David R, Brownholtz, Beth and Muller, Michael (2008). Use and Reuse of Shared Lists as a Social Content Type.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ucd/gallery/beehive_research.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Atos, which is deploying its in house blueKiwi product across all 76,000 employees to achieve its Zero Email ambition by the end of 2013.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Many companies are encouraging employees to use their social networks so they can connect with other employees, help people socialize when they take a break, or even help contribute to other work-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;DiMicco, Joan, Millen, David R., Geyer, Werner, Dugan, Casey, Brownholtz, Beth and Muller, Michael (2008). Motivations for Social Networking at Work.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some companies are even joining typical social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace to gain more clients, communicate with their clients, or target individuals based on their likes. These companies want to gain the trust of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/481215/Social_Networking_at_Work_Fear_Not_Facebook_MySpace_and_Bebo_&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The year 2009 saw 92% of Inc. 500 companies using at least one social media channel, a dramatic increase over the 77% reported in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.20dbs.com reporting data from http://www.inc.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medpedia]] is one of about 70 medical wikis that allows physicians and researchers to share information. While the information is free and publicly available, contributions are limited to those provided by medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Pamela, 2009. Medical wiki blends social networking with research.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intellipedia]] is a set of three wikis used by the [[United States Intelligence Community|US intelligence community]] to share information of varying classifications.

[[Deloitte]] has been a pioneer in its use of the corporate social networking applications for consulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social by the numbers |url=http://dupress.com/articles/sandy-pentland-mit-interview/|publisher=Deloitte University Press|accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boral]] Limited was one of the first major building and construction materials companies in Australia to adopt Enterprise Social Networking using the [[Yammer]] platform.  Engagement levels of over 25% were achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Skipsey, 2014. Boral Embraces enterprise social networking.  http://www.enterprisesocial.com.au/blog/boral-embraced-enterprise-social-networking.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable uses include [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Pfizer]] as documented by the [[Queensland University of Technology]] (QUT).&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Glen D 2010. USING WEB 2.0 TOOLS TO FACILITATE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER IN COMPLEX ORGANISATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS http://eprints.qut.edu.au/40152/1/c40152.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of social networking in sales organizations has recently been given a new name, S2.0 or Sales 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;Trailer, Barry, 2008. Are You Linked In? Selling Meets Social Networking.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing a private sales social network provides a means to quickly disburse company sales knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Len, 2010. How Enterprise 2.0 Sales Teams Will Use Social Networks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart companies are using social media tools to outsource their work to their customers. In addition to using social networking to market the enterprise, companies are involving customers in the design process. Chicago company [http://threadless.com Threadless] invites their customers to submit their T-shirt designs to the Threadless web site for review by other customers. Smart companies are also involving their customers in technical support using enterprise social networking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialmediatoday.com/freelancewriter/2248606/offering-tech-support-social-media-too-impersonal "Offering Tech Support Via Social Media: Too Impersonal?"], 12 March 2014, Retrieved on 27 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[eBay]] was an early adopter of the practice of allowing users to assist each other online.&lt;ref&gt;Chittoor, Vijay, 2010. Social Media: More than Creating Connections&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Lack of adoption===

If training in the use of enterprise social networking tools is not provided to employees who do not have experience using them, they are unlikely to be widely adopted. The use of enterprise social networking must be championed at the highest levels of the enterprise to provide the resources needed and promote adoption throughout the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Makkonen | first1 = H. | last2 = Virtanen | first2 = K. | year = 2015 | title = Social capital approach on Enterprise 2.0: a multiple case study | doi = 10.1080/09537325.2015.1061120 | journal = Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management| volume =  27| issue = | pages =  1212–1225}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Gartner have said that only 10% of organisations see value in a social collaboration product, primarily due to the lack of change management provided during rollout.

The lack of adoption is a complex issue with many theories put forward:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Toby|title=The Poor State of Enterprise Social Business|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/social-business/the-poor-state-of-enterprise-social-business-018364.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alvarez |first=Guy |title=Is Middle Management the Enemy of Social Business? |url=http://good2bsocial.com/2013/05/13/middle-management-social-business/ |accessdate=2013-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607043304/http://good2bsocial.com/2013/05/13/middle-management-social-business |archivedate=2013-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency===

The sharing of information across the enterprise through social networking creates a transparency that may or may not necessarily be welcomed by all sectors of the organization.

===Perception===

There is often an assumption that social networking will not work well in a particular industry or that its use may be perceived as unprofessional. In addition the ability to justify use of enterprise social networking, based on return on investment is not always readily apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchclife, Dion, 2009. Ten top issues in adopting enterprise social computing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of traditional or conservative organisations perceive social networking as a time wasting tool.  However once employees see usage by other employees, they often begin seeing the value and hence engaging and contributing content.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Privacy and security===

Privacy issues associated with social networking sites can be seen from many perspectives. Some people will argue that this{{clarify|date=March 2014}} is just a part of globalization and the growth of technology, while others will still believe that it{{clarify|date=March 2014}} is a right for any citizen, and will never change their views and perspectives about their privacy. With the increase in popularity of social networking, many users have given up their personal privacy in order to join these networks. Social media privacy issues didn’t begin with social networking sites; they have historically been persistent issues with many other types of social media such as text messaging, instant messaging and computer-supported collaboration work.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[Oscar H. Gandy Jr.|Oscar Gandy]] in 1993 claimed that in the age of digital media, people probably do not have any privacy. He stated that “the [[panoptic]] sort is an antidemocratic system of control that cannot be transformed because it can serve no purpose other than that for which it was designed — the rationalization and control of human existence.”  Gandy demanded creation of an agency that would ensure the survival of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, Oscar H., 1993. The panoptic sort: A political economy of personal information. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a policy perspective, according to Schement and Curtis (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Schement, Jorge Reina and Curtis, Terry, 1994. ''Tendencies and tensions of the information age: The production and distribution of information in the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; privacy is seen “as security against intrusion by government”. According to Garfinkel (2000) “Privacy isn’t just about hiding things. It’s about self–possession, autonomy, and integrity.” &lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, 2000, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Because social tools make many things that were normally private much more public, including all types of corporate data, many organizations would rather wait for best practices or to see what their peers are doing before delving very far into social networking. Privacy can become a huge issue at the enterprise level, when customer and employee data are at stake. Security concerns must be addressed prior to embarking upon creation of an enterprise social network.{{Light, Ben and McGrath, Kathy 2010}}

===Behavioral issues===

One of the significant areas of concern with the use of social networking internally within organisations is the impact and effect of behavioral issues. As the interactions within a social network are loosely coupled to business process and structured information systems, the effect of individual personalities and human psychology become more pronounced within social networks. Such emerging concerns cover issues such as attention management, death by trivia, dominant personalities, behavioral adoption and influence strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Chester. ''Enterprise Social Networking and Collaboration''. Martin Butler Research. 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-9567032-1-7}} p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">An '''executory contract''' is a [[contract]] that has not yet been fully performed or fully executed. It is a contract in which both sides still have important performance remaining. However, an obligation to pay money, even if such obligation is material, does not usually make a contract executory. An obligation is material if a [[breach of contract]] would result from the failure to satisfy the obligation.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2006/07/articles/business-bankruptcy-issues/executory-contracts-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter-in-bankruptcy/|title=Executory Contracts -- What Are They And Why Do They Matter In Bankruptcy?|author=Bob Eisenbach|publisher=In the (Red)|date=July 18, 2006|accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contract that has been fully performed by one party but not by the other party is an executory contract.

==In US bankruptcy law==
In [[US bankruptcy law]], "executory contract" assumes a special meaning, a contract in which continuing obligations exist ''on both sides'' of the contract at the time of the bankruptcy petition. It still requires both debtor and counterparty to make further performance. A [[trustee in bankruptcy|trustee]] or [[debtor in possession]] may assume any prepetition executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, preserving obligations of both the debtor and the counterparts by the bankruptcy process. If he rejects it, there is a [[breach of contract]] as of the date of the petition.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy /&gt; Affirmation and rejection are subject to court approval.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy /&gt; {{UnitedStatesCode|11|365}}.

==Installment contracts==
Many installment contracts are commonly executors such as [[installment credit]] loans, period loan payments, [[mortgage loan|mortgages]], and paychecks.

[[File:Harvey Ball.jpg|thumb|Ball posing with a selection of Smiley merchandising]]

'''Harvey Ross Ball''' (July 10, 1921 – April 12, 2001) was an American commercial artist. He is recognized as the designer of a popular [[smiley]] graphic picture, which became an enduring and notable international icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=William H. | last=Honan |author-link=William H. Honan | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/14/us/h-r-ball-79-ad-executive-credited-with-smiley-face.html | date=2001-04-14 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | page=C6 | title=H. R. Ball, 79, Ad Executive Credited With Smiley Face}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball was born and raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] by his parents Ernest G Ball and Christine or Kitty Ross Ball.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Archives Vital Records, Birth of Harvey R Ball, 1921, vol.144, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Ball had 5 siblings, three younger by the names of Merrit, Virginia, and Raymond, and two older by the names of Jessie and Ernest Jr.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1930," database with images, ''FamilySearch''(&lt;nowiki&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XQTF-P94&lt;/nowiki&gt; : accessed 10 May 2018), Ernest G Ball, Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 109, sheet 20B, line 75, family 287, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 971; FHL microfilm 2,340,706.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as a student at Worcester South High School, he became an apprentice to a local sign painter, and later attended the [[Worcester Art Museum]] School, where he studied fine arts.

==Military service==
Ball was based in Asia and the Pacific during World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star for heroism during the Battle of Okinawa. He served 27 years in the National Guard, retired as a full Colonel in 1973 and then served six years in the Army Reserves. He retired as a Brigadier General in 1979. Ball was awarded the Veteran of the Year award from the Worcester Veterans Council in 1999.

==State Mutual and the birth of the smiley==
After [[World War II]], Ball worked for a local advertising firm until he started his own business, Harvey Ball Advertising, in 1959. He designed the [[smiley]] in 1963.

The State Mutual Life Assurance Company of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] (now known as [http://www.hanover.com/thg/companies.htm '''Hanover Insurance''')] had purchased Guarantee Mutual Company of Ohio. The merger resulted in low employee morale. In an attempt to solve this, Ball was employed in 1963 as a freelance artist, to come up with an image to increase morale. What he created was a smiley face, with one eye bigger than the other. In less than ten minutes, Harvey Ball came up with the simple yet world-changing smiley face. The simplicity of the image brought smiles to the faces of the executives, who paid him $45 for his creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Now You Know More: The Book of Answers |series= Now You Know |volume= 2 |author= Doug Lennox , illustrated by Catriona Wight |edition= illustrated |publisher= Dundurn |year= 2004 |isbn= 9781550025309 |page= 50 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=P4gCzZsOY0UC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=smiley+wmca#v=onepage&amp;q=smiley%20wmca&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the smiley face became part of the company's friendship campaign whereby State Mutual handed out 100 smiley pins to employees. The aim was to get employees to smile while using the phone and doing other tasks. The buttons became popular, with orders being taken in lots of 10,000. More than 50 million smiley face buttons had been sold by 1971, and the smiley has been described as an international icon.

Ball never applied for a trademark or copyright of the smiley and earned just $45 for his work (US&amp;nbsp;$315 in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars). State Mutual, similarly, did not make any money from the design. Ball's son, Charles, is reported to have said his father never regretted not registering the copyright. [[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] reported Charles Ball as saying "he was not a money-driven guy, he used to say, 'Hey, I can only eat one steak at a time, drive one car at a time.'"

==From smiley to icon==
[[Image:Harvey Ball 1998.jpg|thumb|right|Ball (seated) at a public signing, 07/18/1998]]
The phrase "Have a happy day" became associated with the smiley although it was not part of Ball's original design. [[Philadelphia]]n brothers Bernard and Murray Spain designed and sold products with the phrase and logo in the early 1970s. They [[trademark]]ed the combination and later changed the phrase to "[[Have a nice day]]", which itself has become a phrase in everyday use in [[North America]]

The smiley was introduced to France in 1972 as a signal of a good news story in the newspaper ''France Soir''. Frenchman Franklin Loufrani used the image this way and made swift moves to trademark the image. His company now turns over $100 million a year and became embroiled in a copyright dispute with [[Walmart]] over the image in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bh91h&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] broadcast a radio documentary on 4 February 2012 called ''Smiley's People'' that covered the story of the smiley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bh91h&lt;/ref&gt; This is currently available for [http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/worldsbestradio/2013/pieces.php?iid=458538&amp;pid=1 playback].

==Promotion==
On July 18, 1998, around the 35th anniversary of the design's inception, Ball appeared at [[That's Entertainment (comic shop)|That's Entertainment]] to meet fans and sign smiley pins and art. At this appearance Ball was shown copies of the graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'' issue #1, which featured a notorious image of a smiley face with a splatter of blood across it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=3172 Watchmen, DC, 1986 series], entry in the [[Grand Comics Database]], includes picture of cover with the smiley&lt;/ref&gt; Store Manager Ken Carson was quoted as saying Ball seemed amused to see it on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Smiley face connection|date=March 6, 2009|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20090306/NEWS/903060414/-1/eworcester&amp;template=eworcester|author=Craig S. Semon|work=[[Worcester Telegram]]}}&lt;!--another link http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Smiley+face+connection.-a0195055018--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing features of Ball's smiley face==
[[File:Authentic_Worcester-made_smiley_face,_Harvey_Ball.jpg|thumb|right|Distinguishing features of a Worcester-made smiley face]]
A Harvey Ball smiley face can be identified by three distinguishing features: Narrow oval eyes (with the one on the right slightly larger than the one on the left), a bright sunny yellow color, and a mouth that is not a perfect arc, which has been claimed to be similar to a "Mona Lisa Mouth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jimmy |last=Stamp |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face? |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=March 13, 2013 |access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face has creases at the sides of the mouth, and the mouth is slightly off-center (with the right side a little higher than the left) and the right side of the mouth is a slightly thicker than on the left.

==World Smile Foundation==

The World Smile Corporation was founded by Ball in 1999. The Corporation licenses Smileys and organizes [[World Smile Day]]. World Smile Day raises money for the Harvey Ball World Smile Foundation, a non-profit charitable trust that supports children's causes. World Smile Day is held on the first Friday of October each year and is a day dedicated to "good cheer and good works". The catch phrase for the day is "Do an act of kindness - help one person smile".

==Death and legacy==
Ball died on April 12, 2001, aged 79, as a result of [[liver failure]] following a short illness.

The land that was owned by the Ball Family, off Granite Street in Worcester, was purchased by the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|City of Worcester]] in June 2007, with help from [http://www.massaudubon.org Mass Audubon] and a $500,000 grant from the state Executive Office of Environmental Affairs' Division of Conservation Services.  This property links Mass Audubon's Broad Meadow Brook Sanctuary with the developing [[Blackstone River Bikeway]]. It is now known as the "Harvey Ball Conservation Area" and is home to the appropriately named "Smiley Face Trail".

'''Latigent LLC''' was an international provider of [[Business Intelligence]], Enterprise RSS, and [[Call Center]] Reporting and Analytics software.

==History==
Latigent, LLC of [[Chicago, IL]], was founded in 2002, as a privately held and funded company, by Chris Crosby and Jason Kolb, two veterans of the contact center industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Both founders believed that there was a more efficient way of using the information typically gathered in the contact center to better serve the customer and more profitably serve the enterprise.  As a result, the Latigent BlueVue performance management product was born and introduced to the market in 2003.

In December 2005, Latigent released BlueVue II, a Business Information (BI) suite.  Besides reporting functionality and complete data warehousing capabilities, BlueVue II also offered data integration capabilities for performance management.

On September 27, 2007 [[Cisco Systems]] announced a definitive agreement to acquire Latigent LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_092707.html Announced A Definitive Agreement to Acquire Latigent LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6522">{{+r|date=March 2016}}A '''loan agreement''' is a [[contract]] between a borrower and a lender which regulates the mutual promises made by each party. There are many types of loan agreements, including "facilities agreements," "revolvers," "term loans," "working capital loans."  Loan agreements are documented via a compilation of the various mutual promises made by the involved parties.

Prior to entering into a loan agreement, the "borrower" first makes representations about his affairs surrounding his character, creditworthiness, cashflow, and any collateral that he may have available to pledge as security for a loan. These representations are taken into consideration and the lender then determines under what conditions (terms), if any, they are prepared to advance money.

Loan agreements, like any contract, reflect an "offer," the "acceptance of the offer," "consideration," and can only involve situations that are "legal" (a term loan agreement involving heroin drug sales is not "legal").  Loan agreements are documented via their commitment letters, agreements that reflect the understandings reached between the involved parties, a promissory note, and a collateral agreement (such as a [[mortgage]] or a [[personal guarantee]]).   Loan agreements offered by regulated banks are different from those that are offered by finance companies in that banks receive a "banking charter" granted as a privilege and involving the "public trust."

Loan agreements are usually in written form, but there is no legal reason why a loan agreement cannot be a purely [[oral contract]] (although oral agreements are more difficult to enforce).

==Types==

For commercial banks and large finance companies, "loan agreements" are usually not categorized although "loan portfolios" are often broadly characterized into "personal" and "commercial" loans while the "commercial" category is then subdivided into "industrial" and "commercial real estate" loans. "Industrial" loans are those that depend on the cashflow and creditworthiness of the company and the widgets or service that it sells.  "Commercial real estate" loans are those that repay loans but that depend on the rental revenues paid by tenants who lease space, usually for extended times.  More granular categorizations of loan portfolios exist but these are always variations around the larger themes.

The loan agreements originated by commercial banks, savings banks, finance companies, insurance organizations, and investment banks are very different from each other and all feed a different purpose.  "Commercial banks" and "Savings banks," because they accept deposits and benefit from FDIC insurance, generate loans that incorporate the concepts of the "public trust."  Prior to interstate banking, that "public trust" was easily measured by State bank regulators who could see how local deposits were used to fund the working capital needs of local industry and businesses, and the benefits associated with those organization's employment.  "Insurance" organizations, who collect premiums for providing either life or property/casualty coverage, created their own types of loan agreements.  "Banks" and "Insurance" organizations' loan agreements and documentation standards evolved from their individual cultures and were governed by policies that somehow addressed each organizations liabilities (In the case of "banks," the liquidity needs of their depositors; in the case of insurance organizations, the liquidity needs associated with their expected "claims" payments).

"Investment banks" create loan agreements that cater to the needs of the investors whose funds they attempt to attract; "investors" are always sophisticated and accredited organizations not subject to bank regulatory supervision and the need to cater to the public trust.  Investment banking activities are supervised by the SEC and their main focus is on whether the correct or proper disclosures are made to the parties who provide the funds.

Types of Loans:
* bilateral loans
* [[syndicated loan]]s

Categorizing loan agreements by type of facility, usually results in two primary categories:
* term loans, which are repaid in set installments over the term, or
* revolving loans (or [[overdraft]]s) where up to a maximum amount can be withdrawn at any time, and interest is paid from month to month on the drawn amount.

Within these two categories though, there are various subdivisions such as [[interest-only loan]]s, and [[Balloon payment mortgage|balloon payment]] loans.  It is also possible to subcategorize on whether the loan is a [[secured loan]] or an unsecured loan, and whether the [[interest|rate of interest]] is fixed or floating.

==Contents of Loan agreement==

Forms of loan agreements vary tremendously from industry to industry, country to country, but characteristically a professionally drafted commercial loan agreement will incorporate the following terms:

# Parties to contracts with their addresses
# Definitions or interpretation provisions
# Facility and purpose&lt;ref&gt;Purpose provisions serve a variety of purposes in different jurisdictions, but they are often used to seek to impose a [[Quistclose trust|''Quistclose'' trust]] on the loan proceeds if the stated purpose of the loan becomes impossible.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conditions precedent to utilization
# Repayment provisions
# Prepayment and cancellation provisions
# Interest and interest periods
# Provisions dealing with [[gross-up]] in relation to any [[withholding]] imposed
# Payments provisions
# [[Misrepresentation|Representations]] of the [[borrower]]
# Representations of the lender
# Covenants of the borrower&lt;ref&gt;Such as a [[negative pledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Events of [[default (finance)|default]]
# Remedies in the event of default
# Provisions for penalties and liquidated damages
# For syndicated loans, provisions relating to the facility agent and security agent and voting of the lenders
# Formulae for calculations
# Provisions for fees of the lenders
# Provisions for expenses
# [[Securitization]] provisions
# Amendments and waivers provisions
# Covenants relating to changes in parties
# [[Set-off (law)|Set-off]] clause
# [[Severability clause]]
# [[Counterparty|Counterpart]]s clause
# Addresses for notices
# Language provisions
# [[Choice of law clause]]

The '''Mackay Trophy''' is awarded yearly by the [[United States Air Force]] for the "most meritorious [[flight]] of the year" by an Air Force person, persons, or organization.  The trophy is housed in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/trophy/mackay.cfm Smithsonian Mackay Trophy Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901071348/http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/trophy/mackay.cfm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is administered by the U.S. [[National Aeronautic Association]].

The award was established on 27 January 1911 by [[Clarence Mackay]], who was then head of the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company and the [[Commercial Cable Company]]. Originally, aviators could compete for the trophy annually under rules made each year or the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] could award the trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year.

|| The crew of Knife 04, an MH-53M Pave Low helicopter, distinguished themselves by extraordinary acts of valor and heroism during the rescue of their sister ship’s crew on 02 Nov 01. On that date Knife 04 was chalk two on a short notice tasking for an urgent personnel recovery mission behind enemy lines. Due to severe weather along the route and a radar malfunction in the lead aircraft, Knife 04 assumed lead in an attempt to get the formation clear of the weather. While flying through the blinding weather, the two aircraft lost sight of one another. As Knife 04 tried to relocate their wingman, they lost radio contact. Contacting airborne command and control assets, Knife 04 confirmed that the other aircraft was on the ground. Several attempts to reach the downed crewmembers that had sustained injuries and were now exposed to subzero temperatures and enemy ground forces were unsuccessful. Knife 04 began coordinating the first of four aerial refuelings and initiated on scene command responsibilities while evading bad weather and taking enemy ground fire. As the weather cleared, Knife 04 located the crash site and began an approach to the rugged area.  The extremely slim power margin forced them to dump all but the very minimum fuel required for the approach. After a perilous landing, the downed aircrew were brought aboard. The takeoff in blinding snow with rotor speed decreasing to dangerous levels was accomplished through superior effort and ability from the crew. During the egress from hostile territory, Knife 04 was forced to aerially refuel several times as the minimum power margin prohibited their loading all of the required fuel in one engagement.

While supporting of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], Jolly 11 Flight launched to rescue a five-person crew of a [[U.S. Army]] [[CH-47 Chinook]] that crashed in a sandstorm with near zero-visibility.  En route to the crash scene, crews realized their forward looking [[infra-red]] and [[night vision goggles]] were ineffective.  Despite this handicap the crew of Jolly 11 was able to locate the survivors.  Both aircraft then made near zero-visibility approaches relying nearly exclusively on the flight engineers and aerial gunners inputs for precision navigation.  Following the successful survivor contacts and recovery by the Flight’s [[Pararescuemen]], Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 were individually engaged by separate multiple [[surface-to-air missiles]] attacks.  Using evasive maneuvers Jolly 11 evaded two missiles.

Captain Markle, unable to employ weapons due to the enemy's close proximity to the team, flew a dangerously low pass over the area while releasing self-protection [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]].  When flares momentarily halted enemy fire.  The ground controller requested a few more close passes to the special forces team time to create more distance between themselves and the Taliban.  The seporation allowed Captain Markle to strafe the enemy area with more than 1,000 [[GAU-8 Avenger|30 millimeter]] rounds on his final pass.  The special forces team was able to disengage with no casualties.  Captain Markle was credited with destroying three [[machine gun]] nests and killing 40 enemy combatants.

|The aircrew of the Pacific Air Forces` Ironhand 41 flight, orchestrated four flawless attacks during an eight-hour night, flying F-16Cs over 500 miles in enemy-controlled terrain.  Their attacks destroyed three Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) blockades, multiple armored vehicles, one observation post, and killed ISIL fighters who were firing upon 40,000 trapped Yazidi civilians who had fled to Mount Sinjar.  Their outstanding battle management caused the cessation of ISIL indirect fires on civilians, ended ISIL freedom of movement around Mount Sinjar, facilitated the evacuation corridor by reducing pressure on Peshmerga ground forces, and ultimately saved the lives of 40,000 civilians including women, children, elderly, and the infirm.

|On July 26, 2015, United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Cohen, Major Seth Taylor, Captain Danielle Kangas, and Captain Mathew Park, arrived on scene over Hassekah, a major city in northeast Syria, where friendly Syrian Kurdish ground units were battling the last significant holdout of a group of Islamic State enemy personnel.  A firefight in the southeast portion of the city had erupted, pinning Kurdish ground units in a dense urban city block.  Overcoming targeting complicated by weather and limited communications, Lieutenant Colonel Cohen and Major Taylor expertly coordinated and employed several successful munitions in support of Kurdish forces despite highly restrictive attack parameters. Captain Kangas and Captain Park tracked and executed an effective attack on fleeing enemy soldiers wearing blankets to reduce their infrared signature.  In a four-hour period, the crews of WEASEL 41 and WEASEL 51 flight employed 15 precision guided munitions, destroying eight enemy fighting positions, with no friendly or civilian casualties. This marked the end of a three-month operation in Northern Syria that resulted in friendly Kurdish forces retaking over 17 thousand square kilometers of territory, securing the Syria/Turkey border between Iraq and the Euphrates River.

After the crew of SPOOKY 43 arrived overhead, the combined American and Afghan special operations force (also referred to as “friendlies”) was caught in a deadly ambush by a large insurgent force.  The friendlies were engaged by small arms, heavy machine gun, and grenade fire from multiple defensive fighting positions.  The crew of SPOOKY 43 provided close air support to the friendly ground force with the 25, 40, and 105-millimeter guns, to allow the them the freedom to maneuver and provide care for casualties.  In order to protect the ground team from enemy personnel, the crew of SPOOKY 43 expertly employed the 105-millimeter gun at an unprecedented 12 meters from the friendly personnel.  Due to the outstanding airmanship and bravery under extremely challenging circumstances, SPOOKY 43 destroyed 10 defensive fighting positions, 27 enemy insurgents, and three enemy technical vehicles, saving the lives of 50 combined American and Afghan special operations forces personnel who would have otherwise perished in the enemy ambush. The professional ability and outstanding aerial accomplishments of the crew of SPOOKY 43 reflect credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.

'''Michael Cudahy''' (December 7, 1841 – November 27, 1910) was an American industrialist who, along with two brothers, established the [[Cudahy Packing Company]] in 1890.

==Early life==
Cudahy was born in [[Callan, County Kilkenny]] in 1841 to Patrick and Elizabeth (née Shaw) Cudahy. The family emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1849, and eventually settled in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=ingham&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingham|first=John N. |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders |volume=1|year=1983 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-21362-3|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1213&amp; Cudahy, Patrick entry], ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History'', Wisconsin Historical Society website; accessed October 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestockexpo.org/ssclub/ssbook_pdfs/abc.pdf "Saddle and Sirloin Portrait Catalogue"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183359/http://www.livestockexpo.org/ssclub/ssbook_pdfs/abc.pdf |date=2008-07-03 }}, livestockexpo.org; accessed October 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Jeff. [http://staff.onmilwaukee.com/buzz/articles/cudahy.html "Milwaukee Talks: Michael Cudahy"], OnMilwaukee.com, August 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cudahy dropped out of school at age 14 and found a job working at Layton and Plankinton, Milwaukee, an area [[meat packing]] plant. He worked his way up the ranks and eventually became a private meat inspector. By 1869, Cudahy was a manager in charge of the packing house at Plankinton, Armour and Company, which had been established in Milwaukee in 1852. In 1873, he was made partner in [[Armour and Company]].&lt;ref name=ingham/&gt;&lt;ref name="era"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SwQlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hxEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2043,1210066&amp;dq=michael+cudahy+obituary&amp;hl=en|title=MICHAEL CUDAHY PASSES|date=1910-12-02|work=The New Era|page=2|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of his brothers [[Patrick Cudahy|Edward and Patrick]], he established the Cudahy Packing Company in [[South Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=ingham/&gt;&lt;ref name="era"/&gt;

===Real estate===
By the late 19th century, Cudahy had become a wealthy man living a comfortable life.  He took an interest in [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]] as a summer home. He also owned a home in Hubbard's Annex on the island in the late 19th century, which he later sold to his brother Edward. He then went to California in 1897 and traded in real estate to expand his fortune. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}} He returned to Mackinac Island in 1904 and bought {{convert|150|acre|km2}}, making him one of the largest landowners on Mackinac Island. In 1908, Cudahy sold his share of the Cudahy Meatpacking Company and acquired a 2,800 acre (11&amp;nbsp;km²) [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]] east of [[Los Angeles, California]].  He subdivided the ranch and sold it as one acre (4,000&amp;nbsp;m²) lots. This area was incorporated in 1960 as the City of [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Cudahy handpicked renowned architect Frederick Wainwright Perkins to fulfill his visions of a West Bluff mansion. Perkins also designed the Governors Mansion on the island. In 1904, construction was completed on his mansion which he named Stonecliffe which was the largest private home on Mackinac Island. It went through a number of owners after Cudahy's death in 1910.  In 1970, Stonecliffe was purchased by an entrepreneur named George Staffan who converted the mansion and associated buildings into a first class resort hotel called The Inn at Stonecliffe in which capacity it continues to function to this day.

==Personal life==
In 1866, Cudahy married Catharine Sullivan. The couple had seven children, four boys and three girls.&lt;ref name=ingham /&gt;

==Death==
On November 27, 1910, Cudahy died of [[Acute lung injury|double pneumonia]] at a [[Chicago]] hospital. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="era" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbs|first=Michelle |title=Generations Of Pride: A Centennial History of Cudahy, Wisconsin|year=2006|publisher=Reminder Printing, Inc.|isbn=0-9791768-0-8|page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association''' ('''MSWCOA''') was an association of mine owners in South Wales that was active between 1873 and 1955.
It fought wage increases, safety regulations, unionisation and other changes that would cut into profits. 
It managed to link miners wages, which were based on piece-work, to the price of coal.
It was involved in various labour disputes, including a lengthy strike in 1926. 
The coal mines became unprofitable in the 1930s, and were nationalized in 1947, making the association irrelevant.

==Organization==

The Coal Owners Association has its origins in the Aberdare Steam Collieries Association, founded in 1864.
In 1870 this association was restructured and renamed the South Wales Steam Collieries Association.
It joined with the Iron Masters in 1873, taking the name of Monmouthshire and South Wales Collieries Association.{{efn|The legal status of [[Monmouthshire]] was unclear until the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act]] took effect in 1974. The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542|Laws in Wales Acts (1542)]] had listed the counties of Wales but excluded Monmouthshire, leaving the county's status ambiguous for over four centuries. This led to many organisations such as the [[South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines]] taking a long-winded and seemingly redundant form for their names.}}
In 1880 the association was restructured again.
In 1890 it took its final name, the  Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners Association.{{sfn|Troughton|2013}}

The executives of the Coal Owners Association included a chairman, vice chairman and secretary.
Secretaries included Alexander Dalziel (1874–84), W. Gascoyne Dalziel (1884–1916), Finlay A. Gibson (1916–46) and Iestyn R. Williams (1947–50). 
Each of the three districts of [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Swansea]] had a chairman and vice-chairman.
There was a chairman of the Sliding-Scale committee, a chairman of the Finance committee and a solicitor. Other committees were the Conciliation Board, District Boards, Commercial Committee, Disputes Committee and Coal Cutters and Conveyers Committee.{{sfn|Troughton|2013}}
At meetings of the association and district boards, each member in good standing had votes weighted depending on their mines' assured tonnage. Membership fees were also based on assured tonnage, so the larger owners paid more and had a greater say in decisions.{{sfn|Drage|1892|p=106}}

==Activities==
The Coal Owners Association represented the owners of the mines so they could present a common front when dealing with the miners and could resist wage increases.
It also represented the owners in court cases resulting from labour disputes, and presented the owners' views on proposed legislation.
The association was strongly opposed to safety legislation, working hours reductions and recognition of trade unions, and this resulted in a series a labour disputes.{{sfn|Troughton|2013}}
The members agreed to observe contracts made by the Association with workmen regarding their wages and employment conditions.
They agreed not to hire workmen from another colliery during a strike at that colliery.{{sfn|Drage|1892|p=106}}

[[File:Sir William Lewis.jpeg|thumb|[[William Lewis, 1st Baron Merthyr|William Thomas Lewis]], founding member and inventor of the sliding scale]]
The association defined the "Sliding Scale", an arrangement that regulated all coal mining wages based on the price of coal.{{sfn|Troughton|2013}}
Different sliding scales were defined in 1875, 1880, 1882, 1890 and 1892. 
The scale of 1 January 1892 was agreed by representatives of the Coal Owners Association and delegates representing the colliery workmen other than engine men, stokers and outside fitters.
The principle was that wages were based on the rates actually paid by the collieries under the December 1879 agreement, with a percentage increase or decrease based on the selling price of coal. 
This price was determined every two months as the average net selling price of coal delivered free on board at the docks of [[Cardiff Docks|Cardiff]], [[Newport Docks|Newport]], [[Swansea docks|Swansea]] and [[Barry Docks|Barry]].{{sfn|Board of Trade (Labour Department)|1894|p=106}}
The hewers received piece rates based on the net weight of coal extracted after eliminating small coal, paid every two weeks.{{sfn|Board of Trade (Labour Department)|1894|p=107}}
The Sliding-Scale committee had to mediate constant disputes over wages between members.{{sfn|Troughton|2013}}
''[[The Times]]'' of 29 December 1891 described the Association as follows,
{{blockquote|The Association, which included sixty-seven of the most important coalowners and coalowning companies in July 1890, and possessed at that time a very large balance in cash, which has been increased to £100,000 at least, is practically a society for mutual assistance and indemnity against loss from strikes. Each member subscribes beforehand—and this is important—in proportion to his output, and the function of the Association is to regulate the action of members as to wages. ... if the men employed by a member ask for an increase of wages, the member asks the advice of the Association. If the Association tells him to yield, then yield he must ... if the Association tells him to resist, then he may resist in the full knowledge that he will be indemnified against loss of profits upon an agreed scale...{{sfn|Jeans|1894|p=73}} }}
The ''Times'' went on to describe that the men were fully aware of the huge resources of the mineowner, backed up by the Association, and also that if they worked at a colliery immediately before a strike they would not be employed by any of the Association members.{{sfn|Jeans|1894|p=73}} 
The sliding scale was used to force both coalowners and workers to accept standard wages. 
If a worker refused, he would not find work in any of the Association's collieries.{{sfn|Jeans|1894|p=74}}

==History==
[[File:William Abraham - Mabon.jpeg|thumb|[[William Abraham (trade unionist)|William Abraham]], a workers' leader in the 1898 strike and first president of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] ]]

===Before World War I===
The driving force behind creation of the Association was [[William Lewis, 1st Baron Merthyr|William Thomas Lewis]] (1837–1914), one of the largest colliery owners, who also owned most of the Cardiff Docks and many other enterprises. 
[[Sidney Webb]] described him in the 1890s as "the best-hated man" among Welsh workers.{{sfn|Rochester|2011|p=85}}
Lewis was the architect of the sliding scale agreement, introduced in 1875.{{sfn|Jones|1990|p=84}}{{sfn|Breverton|2013|loc=PT361}}
The arrangement was unstable.
In 1892 concern was expressed that the sliding scale, which had raised the men's wages by 60%, might be terminated by December, affecting 80,000 men in 200 collieries.{{sfn|Brown|1892|p=276}}
In August–September 1893 the South Wales coal workers went on strike over a 25% wage reduction caused by the sliding scale linked to a fall in the price of coal.{{sfn|The Crisis in the Coal Trade 1893|p=456}}
The strike seemed to be collapsing by 31 August 1893, when it was estimated that 60,000 miners were working, more than half the total.
That day the Emergency Committee of the Coal Owners' Association published a statement saying collieries producing half the assured output of the Association were at work.{{sfn|The Crisis in the Coal Trade 1893|p=457}}

With coal prices falling from the mid-1890s, [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|D.A. Thomas]] campaigned for a cooperative organization that would treat the South Wales coalfield as a single enterprise, and would regulate production and prices. Although owners who controlled 79.3% of output were willing to adopt Thomas's plan, as chairman of the Coal Owners Association Lewis ensured that it was rejected in 1896.{{sfn|Jones|1990|p=84}}
The [[Welsh coal strike of 1898]] began as an attempt by the colliers to remove the sliding scale. The strike quickly turned into a disastrous [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] which lasted for six months.
In the end the sliding scale stayed in place.{{sfn|Davies|Jenkins|2008|p=827}}
After the strike the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] (SWMF) was founded in October 1898, with [[William Abraham (trade unionist)|William Abraham]] (Mabon) as the first president.
In 1889 the SWFM joined the newly formed [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] based in [[Newport, Wales]].{{sfn|Breverton|2013|loc=PT361}}

In 1907 the Association represented 80% of the output of the South Wales Coal Field, which then had 588 mines in operation and employed about 174,000 workmen.{{sfn|Humble Address ... 1907}}

The Eight Hours Day Act of 1908 limited working hours to eight hours, but since it excluding winding times the average bank-to-bank hours in the UK were in fact eight hours and thirty nine minutes.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=141}}{{efn|The "bank" is the area at the top of the mine shaft. "Winding" is the process of lowering or raising the cage in the shaft. Miners would have to wait their turn before descending or coming back up, and this waiting period and the period in the cage did not count in the working day calculation.}}
The Coal Owners' Association published figures for many of the South Wales collieries that showed that bank-to-bank hours had been reduced from nine and a half to eight and a half hours.
To partially offet the reduction, meal times had been cut by ten minutes.
The 1908 Act allowed for an additional 60 hours to be worked annually over and above the eight hours daily, and the owners insisted on these hours being worked.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=142}}

There was a strike in 1912 where the Coal Owners Association wanted troops sent into the [[Rhondda valley]] to suppress the disturbances.
Sir [[Charles Edward Troup]] (1857–1941) of the Home Office was reluctant to comply.{{sfn|Pellew|1982|p=92}}

===World War I===

During [[World War I]] (1914–18) the Admiralty requisitioned coal throughout the war at the price that it chose.
Coal for domestic use was regulated from July 1915 by the Coal Prices Limitation Act.{{sfn|Bougen|Ogden|Outram|1988|p=620}}
During labour negotiations in 1916 the owners found themselves forced to retreat from selling prices as the key factor in setting wages towards one in which profit became the main consideration.{{sfn|Bougen|Ogden|Outram|1988|p=621}}
In May 1919 the former chairman of the Association, Hugh Bramwell, told a Coal Industry Commission hearing, 
{{blockquote| It was early in 1916 that the [coal owners'] Mining Association decided that their relations  with their workmen could not be the same after the war as they had been previously, and  they appointed a committee to consider what was the best arrangement to make. That  committee sat for a number of meetings, and found that they had different opinions, and  they appointed a sub-committee who did draw up a scheme both on the productive and on  the distributive side. When that proposal came again before the Mining Association, the  part on the distributive side was wiped out, and the part on the productive side was  modified. They have been at it ever since, trying to arrive at some scheme that they could  put forward, and their present proposals practically amount to a profit sharing scheme as  has been described.{{sfn|Bougen|Ogden|Outram|1988|p=620}} }}

The State took control of the South Wales coal industry in November 1916, halting discussion of profit sharing and joint consultation as ways to solve the industry problems, although these would re-emerge after the war.{{sfn|Bougen|Ogden|Outram|1988|p=622}}

===After World War I===
[[File:Clifford Cory.jpg|thumb|[[Clifford Cory]] (1859–1941), at one time chairman of the association]]
Following [[World War I]] (1914–18) there was discussion about the possibility of the mines being nationalized. 
Some of the owners were open to this if they could get sufficient compensation. 
[[Sir Evan Williams, 1st Baronet|Evan Williams]], chairman of the MSWCOA and soon to become president of the [[Mining Association of Great Britain]] (MAGB), told the MSWCOA that there would inevitably be some change in structure, and "there are certain owners who think it would be advisable to accept Nationalisation. There is, to an extent, an amount of justification for this, but it must be remembered that it is not in the Nation's interests, as well as the Owner's interests, that this should be resorted to."{{sfn|Supple|2006|p=214}}

In 1921 there was a three-month lockout in the UK coal industry in response to wage reductions that were as high as 49% for labourers in South Wales.{{sfn|Bougen|Ogden|Outram|1988|p=619}}
[[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]] wrote in 1985, "The lockout ... became a fight to the finish, to be settled, if not by actual starvation, by the expenditure of all personal resources, the exhaustion of every source of credit, and the hunger of wives and children." The miners completely failed to obtain their objectives.{{sfn|Clegg|1985|p=322}}

The South Wales miners were involved in the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]], and the miners did not accept the settlement in May 1926.
However there were large stocks of coal in the country, and imports from the USA and Europe started arriving in July 1926.
The strong community spirit in South Wales meant that miners there held out longer than elsewhere in the United Kingdom, since it was "social suicide" to return to work.{{sfn|Bruley|2010|p=112}}
Miners began to trickle back to work in October, and in growing numbers in November, although until the strike ended there were no more than 38,000 miners working in South Wales out of a total of 250,000.
On 19 November 1926 the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] accepted defeat and allowed the opening of district negotiations. 
On 30 November 1926 the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] executive council met the Coal Owners Association and agreed to order an immediate return to work.{{sfn|Bruley|2010|p=112}}

By the mid-1920s it was clear that the coal industry was in long-term decline.
In 1927 the Coal Owners Association accepted that wages could not be further lowered and other approaches must be tried such as production quotas to manage prices.
25% of the work force was wholly or temporarily out of work by June 1928.{{sfn|McKendrick|Outhwaite|2002|p=235}}

Until the mid-1930s the somewhat isolated [[anthracite]] mining district in rural [[West Glamorgan]], [[Brecon]] and [[Carmarthen]] was not covered by the MSWCOA policies, but the pits in this region had many strikes. 
The owners here were criticized by other coalowners for failing to apply tougher policies such as reprisal, extended lay-offs and prosecution of unofficial strikers.{{sfn|Church|Outram|2002|p=54}}

===Silicosis===

Compensation for growing numbers of certified [[silicosis]] cases was causing severe financial problems at some coal companies by the late 1930s.
In 1937 the MSWCOA set up a Coal Dust Research Committee to investigate dust-induced respiratory disease.{{sfn|McIvor|Johnston|2013|p=78}}
The committee pioneered ways of sampling mine dust, but at the time there was no device capable of accurately sampling dust in the mines.{{sfn|McIvor|Johnston|2013|p=80}}
The committee understood that the main cause of health problems was dust particles less than 5 microns in diameter, but thought silica dust was the main threat, rather than coal dust, and therefore argued that protection was only needed for men exposed to silica dust.{{sfn|McIvor|Johnston|2013|p=78}}
The chairman of the MSWCOA stated,
{{blockquote|... from the information supplied by experts, it is inevitable that there will be some extension of the regulations, and the owners must try and ensure these extensions are as small as possible. Silicosis affects South Wales more than any other district in the country, and medical examination might prove many men to be suffering from silicosis who were not previously aware of it. And resultant claims for compensation would be inevitable. It is not thought to be in the interests of the trade to apply a medical examination to men at present in the employ of the owners.{{sfn|McIvor|Johnston|2013|p=78–79}} }}

===Last years===

The MSWCOA became less relevant after the coal mines were nationalized in 1947 and placed under the [[National Coal Board]].
The association ceased activity in 1955.{{sfn|Troughton|2013}}
The records of the Coal Owners Association are now held by the [[National Library of Wales]], and provide a valuable source of information on the history of coal mining and industrial relations in the South Wales coalfields.
Two volumes of surveys by Alexander Dalziel, an early secretary of the association, include reports and personal observations on many aspects of mining including underground workings, lamp lighting, ventilation, wages payment, colliery management, miners' housing and stable arrangements at pits.{{sfn|Troughton|2012}}

'''Paul Andrew Campbell''' (born 1959) is a British entrepreneur and musician. He is the founder of amazing, the [[digital media]] brand, and CEO of Amazing Media, operator of amazingtunes.com and Amazing Radio.

==Education==
Campbell was born in north-east England and educated at [[RGS Newcastle]] and [[New College, Oxford]], where he read English Literature.

==Early career==
Campbell started his media career as a BBC General Trainee in 1980. He became a Producer of File on 4, the BBC Radio 4 current affairs programme, in 1982. After producing BBC Television programmes such as [[Russell Harty]] and [[Brass Tacks (BBC TV series)|Brass Tacks]], he left the BBC to freelance as a TV Producer with Diverse Production and then [[Zenith Productions]] in 1987.

In 1989 he founded Bell Television, a London-based television production company which made programmes for [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky Television]] and [[Channel 4]]. Bell diversified into radio, commercials, corporate films and new media, building its first website for [[The Barbican Centre]] in 1992.

In 2005, looking for ways to extend the amazing brand, Campbell conceived the idea of amazingtunes.com while reading a biography of [[Steve Jobs]]. The concept combined his digital media and music experience and was designed to re-shape the music industry with an ethical business model which rewarded musicians fairly for their work.

'''Porto Digital''' is an initiative in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]] to foster technological innovation in the northern region of Brazil. It began in July 2000 on the island called [[Recife Antigo|Old Recife]], where the port was located from the time of the 17th century Dutch occupation of the area. Recife is the capital of the state of [[Pernambuco]] in the Northeast region of Brazil. The Porto Digital has grown steadily since 2000, reporting 240 technology companies and 500 entrepreneurs within the zone, and another 150 similar companies in Recife but not on the island by 2014.&lt;ref name=Engel2014 /&gt;

==History and development ==
[[File:Pontes do Bairro do Recife Antigo.jpg|thumb|View of Porto Digital in 2012]]
Porto Digital was created in [[Recife]] in July 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oremi.com.br/artigo/arquivos/081016150721_030-BRA_Proceedings.pdf |title=A City and its Science Park: building a local innovation system for urban and economic development |work=XXV IASP World Conference 2008 |first=Fabio Queda |last=Bueno da Silva |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of a  joint effort  of the [[Pernambuco]] state government, private sector and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]](IDB). Most of the funding for the creation of the Porto Digital Science Park came from the privatization of CELPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaplac.org/library/AlbernazAmi03.pdf |title=The Internet in Brazil: From Digital Divide to Democracy? |last=Albamaz |first=Ami |date=May 3, 2002 |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |publisher=Association of Academic Programs in Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state’s electricity company. The companies and incubators that form the Science Park are mostly housed in buildings most of which warehoused sugar in colonial times, on the island that is known as [[Recife Antigo|Old Recife]]. The city is the ninth largest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/as-300-cidades-mais-populosas-do-brasil-em-2013 |title=As 300 cidades mais populosas do Brasil em 2013 |trans-title=The 300 most populous cities in Brazil in 2013 |date=September 9, 2013 |last=Prates |first=Marco |language=Portuguese |newspaper=Exame |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porto Digital  hosts C.E.S.A.R., the most innovative R&amp;D institute of Brazil, according to a Federal Government assessment in 2004.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Science Park was evaluated as the largest of Brazil in 2005 by AT Kearney and won in 2007 the prize of the best Brazilian Science Park, given by the Brazilian Association of Science Parks and Business Incubators (ANPROTEC).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was described in 2013 as a coordinated effort between the federal and state governments, becoming an economic keystone in Pernambuco state since its start in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRqcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Porto+Digital+Recife+status&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jHp2h5JPsm&amp;sig=KhZB6Jtz3PwKA2D2jgnOnxljm-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-oubwu83SAhVB9IMKHQWhCN8Q6AEITDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Porto%20Digital%20Recife%20status&amp;f=false |title=Development Centre Studies Start-up Latin America Promoting Innovation in the Region: Promoting Innovation in the Region |page=142 |date=September 2, 2013 |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] |isbn=9789264202306 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government investments==

The local and federal government do not directly pool resources in order to invest in the park, they offer however a certain amount of fiscal incentives to its companies. The biggest ones are a discount of up to 60 per cent on the '''ISS''', a sort of municipal services tax and the "Lei de Informática" (Leis 8.248/91, 10.176/01 e 11.077/04) which concedes reduction of the '''IPI''' taxes for companies which develop hardware and automation solutions. In a country with one of the world’s most onerous tax systems, fiscal incentives are a game changing and decisive factor for the success of a tech hub in the region. The incentives are not only tax reductions but also labor incentives: by reducing bureaucracy and costs involved in the process of hiring new workforce.

The lack of real government funding for the tech hub is mainly due to lack of long-term planning strategy to foster the technological sector of the region. A program similar to Ohio’s [[Third Frontier]] could not only benefit the region but the whole country. Ohio’s Third Frontier showed an unprecedented large scope of financial support at different key sectors of Ohio’s economy. The public sector dollars are very important in creating momentum in a very short amount of time, which would not necessarily happen so fast with exclusive private sector rounds of investment. Two key aspects of the Third Frontier program are the outside match requirement (government funds must be matched by another funding source). The second factor in the process is the validation and recommendation options for allocation of resources. This work alongside the private sector produces high standards of professionalism and transparency in the process.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Third Frontier has also been able to measure its success through metrics such as job creation and the increase in productivity and quality in existing jobs. The most similar program to Ohio’s Third Frontier is the Start-up Brasil program implemented by the Brazilian federal government. Start-up Brasil was created by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) - in order to provide support to emerging technology-based companies and to strengthen their connection to accelerators. The funds made available by the federal government for the program allow up to R$200,000 in direct investment for selected startups.

Start-up Brasil focus on domestic companies, that have been incorporated for less than four years. International companies can also apply for the program as long as they incorporate in Brazil within a certain time frame.

The accelerators act as third party evaluators by selecting and mentoring startups for the program; there is no outside match requirement, that is, government funds do not have to be matched by another funding source.

==Corporate partnerships  ==
Business incubator and innovation center Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (C.E.S.A.R) is the largest business of Porto Digital and works as a flagship company of the technological park. One of the reasons for the success of the Digital Port is the high-skilled workforce delivered by the Center of Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco, (UFPE). Sergio Cavalcante, CEO of C.E.S.A.R is also a professor at CIn, which shows a healthy and close relationship between industry and academy. An entrepreneurial spirit is also cultivated in the university through an “Entrepreneurship Project” Course “Projetao”, which helps students develop innovative ideas and turn them into products. Many of the products developed on this course grew to be real products sold by real startups. One success story is that of In Loco Media (previously UBee) which developed an accurate indoors location app. The company offers a mobile Ad-network powered by its indoor location technology and boasts to be the largest Brazilian mobile advertising company. Porto Digital is a research development center for international clients like [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/fiat-chrysler-invests-53m-in-brazil-r-d-center/ |title=Fiat Chrysler invests $53m in Brazil R&amp;D center |date=December 7, 2015 |accessdate=December 8, 2015 |publisher=ZDNet |last=Mari |first=Angelica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Goals of Porto Digital ==
The strategy of Porto Digital includes 10 year plans. Its vision and main objective is to be the best environment in the country for disruptive innovation and entrepreneurship on IT related areas and also on [[creative industries]]. Porto Digital intends to be a vital asset for the economical development of the state of Pernambuco and to be an anchor for the [[sustainable development]] of the region. The first strategic goal is to have, by 2020, 20,000 professionals employed and the aggregated value of 400 innovative enterprises. To achieve these goals, Porto Digital develops 40 articulated projects on 6 strategic areas:

1. Increase the capacity of Porto Digital to attract new investments and to strengthen the competitiveness of the businesses installed on the technological park;

2. Integration of the Porto Digital with other sectors of the economy which lack appropriate technological support;

3. National expansion and internationalization of Porto Digital;

4. Strengthening of the image and brand of the technological park;

5. Actions to promote social, economic and environmental susteinability;

6. Strengthening of the technical and managerial capabilities of the Porto Digital.

In 2014, Porto Digital included 500 entrepreneurs and 240 institutions, with another 150 related companies located in Recife but not in the Porto Digital zone.&lt;ref name=Engel2014&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgyZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Porto+Digital+Recife+status&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CRNxd_0-jn&amp;sig=RKo4fNrEbxsP4NNL6L8ID9ow4vI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-oubwu83SAhVB9IMKHQWhCN8Q6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Porto%20Digital%20Recife%20status&amp;f=false |title=Global Clusters of Innovation: Entrepreneurial Engines of Economic Growth around the World |date=September 26, 2014 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |last=Engel |first=Jerome S. |page=316 |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |isbn=978-1783470839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==

The private organization responsible for running Porto Digital is a non-profit organization called the Porto Digital Management Unit (NGPD) and was entrusted by the government to be a flexible option to govern the technological park. NGPD not only runs Porto Digital but also tries to forge ties with other institutions which also promote social and economic development in the region.

Its management structure is based on an Administrative Council, with 18 members. These members represent the firms installed in the park, other companies with ties to the Porto Digital, the state government, [[UFPE]] university and Recife City Hall.
It is the Council’s responsibility to decide policies and strategies which enable and promote Porto Digital’s development. 
 
The Council has the freedom to appoint a board of directors of the NGPD comprising a president, a director of innovation and business competition and an executive officer. The NGPD’s permanent technical staff members all have degrees in fields related to innovation, information technology, project management, urban planning, etc.

'''Sebastian Salbert''' better known as '''Rahim''' (born November 17, 1978 in [[Katowice]]&lt;ref name="dlastudenta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rahim (Sebastian Salbert) - Biografia, Życiorys - Muzyka|url=http://muzyka.dlastudenta.pl/artysta/Rahim/biografia,9213.html|website=muzyka.dlastudenta.pl|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Poles|Polish]] [[rapper]], [[hip hop production|producer]] and [[entrepreneur]]. He is the owner of [[record company]] MaxFloRec, the former member of groups such as 3xKlan, MZD, Erka and [[Paktofonika]]. Since 2003 He has been the one half of a duo [[Pokahontaz]] which he creates with [[Fokus (rapper)|Fokus]]. He has released several albums under his [[alter ego]] '''Straho'''.

In 2001 he, along with his then group [[Paktofonika]], received the Polish music award [[Fryderyk]] in ''Album of the year - hip-hop'' category for their album ''[[Kinematografia]]''. In 2011, magazine Machina classified him at number 25 on list of "30 best Polish rappers".

He has a younger brother, Minx, who is a [[beatbox]]er and won Polish championship in beatbox in 2007.

== Biography ==
Sebastian Salbert was born on November 17, 1978 in [[Katowice]]{{r|dlastudenta}}, where he spent his early childhood. He moved out to [[Mikołów]] with his family later where he lives to this day.&lt;ref name="maxflo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rahim - Wokaliści - Artyści - MaxFlo|url=http://maxflo.pl/Rahim.html|website=maxflo.pl|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to be active as an artist in 1994 when he, along with Maczo, B.U.C and DJ Bambus, formed a group 3xKlan. In 1996, he produced two track for [[Kaliber 44]]'s debut album ''[[Księga Tajemnicza. Prolog]]'' and rapped on a track "Psychodela".&lt;ref name="ksiega"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaliber 44 - Księga Tajemnicza. Prolog|url=https://www.discogs.com/Kaliber-44-Ksi%C4%99ga-Tajemnicza-Prolog/release/1379791|website=Discogs|accessdate=29 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1997, 3xKlan released their debut and the only album ''Dom pełen drzwi'' which stylistically and lyrically was similar to Kaliber's debut. A few tracks from the album such as "Pozytywka" and "Łza wyobraźni" gained some popularity in Poland, peaking at Szczecińska Lista Przebojów chart. The album was also nominated for the [[Fryderyk]] award in category "Album of the year – rap &amp; hip-hop".&lt;ref name="3xklanfryderyk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=www.onyx.pl|first1=Onyx Sp. z o.o., tel. +48 572 400 000,|title=Nominowani i laureaci :: Nagroda muzyczna - Fryderyk :: Związek Producentów Audio-Video|url=http://www.zpav.pl/fryderyk/nominowani/index.php?year=1997|website=www.zpav.pl|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was a part of short-lived projects eRKa and MZD.

In 1998, after the dissolution of 3xKlan, Rahim contacted with two rappers from Katowice: [[Magik (rapper)|Magik]] and [[Fokus (rapper)|Fokus]], and after a short period of time they created a new group [[Paktofonika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miszczak|first1=Radek|title=Radek Miszczak: Beaty, rymy, życie: leksykon muzyki hip-hop|date=2005|publisher=Kurpisz S.A.|isbn=9788389738752|page=381|edition=Wyd. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, the group signed a contract with Gigant Records. On 18 December 2000, the debut album ''[[Kinematografia]]'' was released. Eight days after the release, Magik committed suicide by jumping out of the window. One year after the release of ''Kinematografia'', Rahim decided to co-produce the album ''Zawieszeni w czasie i przestrzeni'' of [[side-project]] [[Pijani Powietrzem]]. The album was finally released on 2002. On September 2002, Paktofonika's second and final studio album ''[[Archiwum kinematografii]]'', containing old Magik's verses, was released. Meanwhile, he was working on his studio album ''Experyment: PSYHO'' which eventually was released on November 17, 2002 under his [[alter ego]] name Straho.

In 2003, Paktofonika performed their last show at [[Spodek]] in [[Katowice]] and on the same day Rahim, along with Fokus and DJ Bambus, announced the start of the group [[Pokahontaz]]. In 2004 he founded his own [[record label]] MaxFloRec which is the continuation of MaxFloStudio which was opened in 1998.&lt;ref name="maxflohist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Info - O nas - MaxFlo|url=http://maxflo.pl/Info.html|website=maxflo.pl|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, the group released their first studio album ''Receptura''. The album was promoted with singles "Wstrząs dla mas", "Nie1", and "Cyfroni" and it debuted at number 3 on Polish [[OLiS]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oficjalna lista sprzedaży :: OLIS - Official Retail Sales Chart|url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=254&amp;lang=pl|website=olis.onyx.pl|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he produced the debut album ''Miraż'' for hip-hop group Projektor. 

On 2007, Rahim started collaborating with [[L.U.C]], an [[alternative hip hop]] and [[nu jazz]] artist, and on October 19, 2007 they released their joint album ''Homoxymoronomatura''. The album was promoted with singles "Hemoglobina" and "Nibyminipocieszne Psychomarionety". On November, the same year, Rahim released, as previously under his nickname Straho, his second studio album ''DynamoL''. The album features guest appearances from rappers like [[Abradab]], Grubson and the group Projektor.

A year later, he performed in a play "Szepty", directed by Jack Burban at [[Polish Theatre in Wrocław]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wywiad z Rahimem|url=http://iwiesz24.pl/wywiad-z-rahimem|accessdate=4 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926145515/http://iwiesz24.pl/wywiad-z-rahimem|archive-date=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he released ''Homoxymoronomatura Live'' - a [[live album|live version]] of ''Homoxymoronomatura''. In 2010, Rahim released his first debut studio album under his normal pseudonym. The album, titled ''Podróże po amplitudzie'', was finally released on March 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rah!m* - Podróże Po Amplitudzie|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rahm-Podr%C3%B3%C5%BCe-Po-Amplitudzie/release/2179683|website=Discogs|accessdate=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 2010, a [[remix album]] of the album, titled ''Amplifikacja'' was released. The remixes were produced by producers such as: [[O.S.T.R]], DiNO, Vixen and others.

On 2012, Rahim, along with Fokus, were focused on working on ''[[Jesteś Bogiem]]'', a movie, directed by Leszek Dawid, which tells a story of [[Paktofonika]]. The movie was released on September 21, 2012 and received highly positive reviews. On October 19, [[Pokahontaz]] released their second studio album ''Rekontakt'' which debuted at number 2 on Polish [[OLiS]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=www.onyx.pl|first1=Onyx Sp. z o.o., tel. +48 22 3377222,|title=Oficjalna lista sprzedaży :: OLIS - Official Retail Sales Chart|url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=775&amp;lang=|website=olis.onyx.pl|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recaredo Santos Tornero Olmos''' (October 14, 1842 – July 26, 1902) was a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] editor, journalist and director of ''[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]'' and founder of ''[[El Comercio (Chile)|El Comercio]]''.

== Biography ==
Tornero was born in [[Valparaíso]], on October 14, 1842. His parents were Carmen Olmos de Aguilera Orrego, and Spanish immigrant José Santos Tornero Monteros, the proprietary of the first public library in Chile. He studied in the National Institute of Santiago, and he later went to France to study on the [[Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris]]. He returned to Chile in 1860,&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; and he succeeded his father as director of ''[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]'' in 1866.&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales 2° Educación Media|author=Verónica Méndez Montero, Carolina Santelices Ariztía and Rodrigo Martínez Iturriaga|language=Spanish|publisher=Santillana|year=2009|isbn=978-956-15-1557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elena Stuven Olmos, and they had 4 children: Carmela, Recaredo, Teresa and Enrique.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

His father's enterprises included the Spanish Library ({{lang-es|Librería Española}}), the [[printing house]] of ''[[El Mercurio]]'' and the [[Valparaíso]] newspaper of [[El Mercurio de Valparaíso|the same name]]. They remained in the family for 33 years. In 1866, Tornero and his brother Orestes bought the enterprise from their father.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

Orestes maintained the library and its dependencies, while Recaredo continued administering the printing house and the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Later, they formed Tornero &amp; Sons Society ({{lang-es|Sociedad Tornero e Hijos}}) with his father, who was living in outside Chile.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt;

[[File:Chile Ilustrado main page.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Front page of ''[[Chile Ilustrado]]'' (1872).]]

Since 1867, Tornero was the only editor of ''[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]'' until 1870, when he partnered with Camilo Letelier.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Blanco Cuartín assumed as main editor of the newspaper later; who proposed a cultural and literary-scoped topic.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt;

He published ''[[Chile Ilustrado]]'' in 1872, the first illustrated album of Chile, with a descriptive guide, historic, politic, industrial, social and statistical review of the country and a rich graphic backup,&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"/&gt; with more than 200 wood engravings and 10 lithographs.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; He was awarded for this book on [[1876 Philadelphia Exposition]].&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt;

After 9 years as director, he sold his part of the newspaper to Camilo Letelier.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt; He revisited Europe in 1877, where he stayed until 1880.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt; He bought machinery in Europe to create the first paper factory in Chile, after which he began publishing foreign works translated into Spanish.&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Icarito"&gt;{{Cite web

After his comeback to Valparaíso, Tornero established a library and a printing house in Almendral. When his brother Orestes died in 1881, he took over Mercurio library, that was mainly focused on editing teaching books and works translated from French.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

He founded ''[[El Comercio (Chile)|El Comercio]]'' newspaper in 1890, on the eve of the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]], to support President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], who had bad relationship with the Chilean press.&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"/&gt;

'''Robert Adler''' (December 4, 1913 – February 15, 2007) was an [[Austria]]n-born American inventor who held numerous [[patent]]s.
He worked for Zenith retiring as the company's Vice President and Director of Research. His work included developing early sound based remote controls for televisions, which were the standard for 25 years until replaced by IR remotes that could transmit more complex commands.

==Achievements==
Adler was born in [[Vienna]] in 1913, the son of Jenny (née Herzmark), a doctor, and Max Adler, a social theorist.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/obituaries/20adler.html|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders|author=Lane, A.T.|date=1995|volume=1|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313264566|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=VlR8YCE8lkQC|page=8|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/j/o/h/Marshall-John/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0210.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a Ph.D. in [[Physics]] from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1937. Following Austria's annexation by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, Dr. Adler, who was [[Jew]]ish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/744/000165249/|title=Robert Adler|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; left the country. He traveled first to [[Belgium]], then to [[England]], where he acted on the advice of friends, who recommended that he emigrate to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="inventorspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventorspot.com/adler|title=Inventor of Remote Control: Robert Adler|publisher=inventorspot.com|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After emigrating to the United States, he began working at [[Zenith Electronics]] in the research division in 1941. In his lifetime, Adler was granted 58 US [[patent]]s.

==Contributions to the remote control==
The invention Adler is best known for is the wireless [[remote control]] for [[television]]s. While not the first remote control, its underlying [[technology]] was a vast improvement over previous remote control systems.

The "[[Flash-Matic|Zenith Flash-Matic]]" remote control, invented by [[Eugene Polley]], another [[engineer]] at [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]], was the first wireless remote control, replacing the signal cable based remote control devices, which never were a success. The Flash-Matic used directional [[flashlight]] in the transmitter device, and photo cells in the television set itself. One of the major shortcomings of this technology was that if the television set was exposed to direct sunlight, it could inadvertently trigger one of the remote control functions. The company president sent the engineers back to the drawing board to come up with a better solution.

[[Image:Zenith Space Commander 600.jpg|thumb|right|A Zenith Space Commander 600 remote control.]]
A system based on [[radio waves]] was briefly considered but rejected because the signals could easily travel through walls and could inadvertently change the channel on a neighbor's television. Furthermore, the marketing people at Zenith desired a remote control which did not require batteries, as it was perceived at the time that if the battery died, the customer might think something was wrong with the television set itself.

Adler's solution was to use sound waves to transmit signals to the TV. The first remote control he developed, the "Space Command", used [[aluminum]] rods, analogous to [[tuning fork]]s, struck by hammers toggled by the buttons on the device, to produce high-frequency tones that would be interpreted to control functions on the television set.

In the 1960s, Adler modified the remote control to use [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] signals, a technology which went on to be used in television sets manufactured for the next 25 years, until replaced by infrared systems which could transmit more complex commands (but, alas, require batteries to run).

==Professional accomplishments==
By the time of his retirement from Zenith, officially in 1982, Adler was the company's Vice President and Director of Research. He remained a technical advisor to Zenith until 1999. In 1980, Adler was awarded the  [[Edison Medal]]. In 1997, Adler and Polley were jointly awarded an [[Emmy Award]] by the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]]. Adler's latest patent application was filed on October 6, 2006 for work on [[touch-screen]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220070024599%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20070024599&amp;RS=DN/20070024599&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Robert Adler died in a [[Boise, Idaho]] [[nursing home]] of [[heart failure]] at age 93 years old.

Anthony was a Harvard Business School faculty member from 1940 to 1982. In 1942 he became research assistant to [[Ross G. Walker]] (1891-1970), Harvard Professor of Business Administration since 1936. After his service in the US Navy from 1943 to 1946 he returned to Harvard, where he was appointed Full professor in 1956. In 1965 he took another leave of absence from Harvard to serve as the [[Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)|Under Secretary of Defense]] under his friend, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"&gt;Dennis Hevesi, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/business/18anthonyobit.html?_r=0 Robert N. Anthony Dies at 90; Made Accounting Easier to Learn]," in ''New York Times,'' Dec. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 and 1974, he was president of the [[American Accounting Association]].&lt;ref name="HG 2006"&gt;"[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/12.14/15-anthonyobit.html HBS professor, member of Accounting Hall of Fame Robert Anthony dies]" in ''Gazette,'' Harvard University, Dec. 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== Planning and management control ===
Harvard Business School professor [[Regina Herzlinger]] explained about the impact of Anthony's work in the 2006 obituary in the [[Harvard Gazette]]: 
:''Bob Anthony took a field that was something that only accountants did and transformed it into one that informed top managers in the planning and control of their organizations... He had a monumental impact not only on his students, through his teaching and textbooks, but also on the business, nonprofit, and government worlds through his many influential articles and powerful personal demeanor - his knowledge, intellectual clarity, sense of duty and honor, and managerial perspective.''&lt;ref name="HG 2006"/&gt;
And furthermore:
:''Bob was also a marvelous writer. He made the murky subject of accounting clear. These exceptional qualities of mind and character, coupled with a Yankee work ethic, helped him to transform the field of managerial accounting from the province of accountants to the tool of managers.''&lt;ref name="HG 2006"/&gt;
And Harvard accounting professor [[Charles Christenson]] added: 
:''Bob did more than anyone else to introduce a conceptual structure to management control. In his numerous publications, he has ranged across all the important questions. 'Management Control in Industry Research Organizations,' for example, examined the problem of measuring intellectual output - a much more difficult task than measuring more tangible output. His 1965 book, 'Planning and Control Systems,' became the bible of the field.&lt;ref name="HG 2006"/&gt;

=== Comptroller at the US Department of Defense ===
In 1965 Anthony served as [[comptroller]] at the [[US Department of Defense]] under Robert S. McNamara, where he supervised the quality of accounting and financial reporting of the organization. Antony was credited for aligning the accounting service among the five military services. [[Charles Christenson]] explained: 
:''He changed the way the Defense Department operated... There was a substantial cost overrun on the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman missile program]]. Secretary McNamara wanted procedures to keep that from happening again. Bob made sure all the branches were on the same wavelength.''&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"/&gt;

Anthony wrote or had a role in writing 27 books on accounting and management control. A selection:

==Early life==
Sean Mulryan was born in September 1954,&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite web|title=BALLYMORE LIMITED|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04936525/officers|website=Companies House|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of John and Josephine Mulryan.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He grew up in rural poverty in the village of Oran, near [[Castlerea]], Co Roscommon,&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=SC/&gt; in the west of Ireland, in a farming family with seven children.&lt;ref name=HP&gt;''Homes &amp; Property'': [http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/news/sean-mulryan-man-who-owns-land-every-corner-london Sean Mulryan: the man who owns land in every corner of Londo], accessdate: 1 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulryan left school at the age of 17, and trained as a bricklayer. Aged 19, he bought his first plot of land.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; At 26 he set up his own company and shortly afterwards founded Ballymore, which is now considered one Europe's biggest property developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/archive/55-archives/at-home-with-sean-mulryan|title=At home with Sean Mulryan – Roscommon People – The People's Paper|last=People|first=Roscommon|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballymore Group==
Ballymore Group was founded in 1982 by Mulryan, then aged 28, who is the chairman. David Brophy is the group chief executive.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;prnewswire.co.uk: [http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/ballymore-announces-group-reorganisation-152879555.html Ballymore Announces Group Reorganisation – DUBLIN, July 3 /PR Newswire UK/ --], accessdate: 30 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballymore has become one of the biggest providers of residential space in London.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;irishtimes.com: [http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/the-irish-developer-with-a-big-vision-for-london-1.2284778 The Irish developer with a big vision for London --]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, it was reported that the previous year's profits at the UK arm of Ballymore had increased almost three-fold to £154.9m (€217.6m).&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/exceptional-gains-push-sean-mulryans-ballymore-uk-profits-to-217m-34342258.html  Exceptional gains push Sean Mulryan's Ballymore UK profits to €217m --]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballymore Group works on large-scale projects in London and across Europe, with a particular focus on urban regeneration.

In 2016, it was reported that Oran native Sean Mulryan launched the latest development in Dublin, 
which is a €700&amp;nbsp;million development in the docklands.&lt;ref name=RoscommonDaily&gt;roscommondaily.com: [http://roscommondaily.com/2016/10/oran-native-700m-ballymore/ Oran native launches €700m Ballymore development --]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of the Mulryan family have been involved in Ballymore. John Mulryan is a son of Sean Mulryan and the managing director of Ballymore UK, meanwhile, Sean's brother Donal Mulryan used to work for Ballymore before starting his own development company, West Properties, which owns various developments in the UK, including Skyline Central, the tallest apartment complex in Manchester.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes2&gt;irishtimes.com: [http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/docklands-project-brings-ballymore-back-to-centre-stage-1.2819321 Docklands project brings Ballymore back to centre stage --]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BDCMagazine&gt;bdcmagazine.com: [http://www.bdcmagazine.com/building-news/construction-news/housing/8744-8744 Featuring Ballymore: Interview With Sean Mulryan (Chairman &amp; Group Chief Executive) --]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, he is one of the richest men in Ireland.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; According to London's ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', Mulryan owns more land in London than the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

On 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved [[Ballymore Group]]'s plans for the 15 acre development in [[Nine Elms]].

Outside of his work with Ballymore, Mulryan is set to join the board of the Ireland West Airport Knock in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quinlan|first1=Ronald|title=Knock Airport to bring Ballymore's Mulryan on board|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/knock-airport-to-bring-ballymores-mulryan-on-board-35687591.html|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knock confirmed the appointment in May 2017, along with two other new Directors.

Radziwiłł was one of the organisers of the [[Sikorski Historical Institute]] in [[London]] and founder of St. Anne's Church at [[Fawley Court]], the site of Divine Mercy College, a school for boys of Polish origin, set up by the [[Marian Fathers]] in 1953 near [[Henley-on-Thames]], England.

He died on 27 July 1976, in [[London]] at the age of 62. His body was interred in the crypt of St Anne's Church at [[Fawley Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Prince Radziwill Dead at 62; Ex-Husband of Lee Bouvier |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/29/archives/prince-radziwill-dead-at-62-exhusband-of-lee-bouvier.html |quote=[[London]], 28 June 1976 (AP) Prince Stanislas Radziwill, former husband of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]' younger sister, [[Lee Bouvier]], died yesterday at the home of a friend, sources close to the family reported today.

Upon becoming a British subject and in keeping with standard practice, Radziwiłł would have needed permission to use his princely title from [[Queen Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref name=time/&gt; but did not receive special dispensation and was known in Britain as ''Mr. Radziwiłł'' legally and as ''Prince Radziwiłł'' by courtesy.

'''Thomas Nelson Page''' (April 23, 1853 – November 1, 1922) was a lawyer and American writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=PAGE, Thomas Nelson|magazine=The International Who's Who in the World|year=1912|page=829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-wRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA829}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the [[List of United States ambassadors to Italy|U.S. ambassador to Italy]] under the administration of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] during [[World War I]].

==Biography==
Born at [[Oakland (Montpelier, Virginia)|Oakland]], one of the Nelson family plantations, in the village of [[Beaverdam, Virginia|Beaverdam]] in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] to John Page, a lawyer and a plantation owner, and Elizabeth Burwell (Nelson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunitz|first=Stanley.|title= American Authors 1600-1900. A Biographical Dictionary of American Literature|year=1938|publisher=H.W Wilson|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a scion of the prominent Nelson and Page families, each [[First Families of Virginia]].   Although he was from once-wealthy lineage, after the [[American Civil War]], which began when he was only 8 years old, his parents and their relatives were largely impoverished during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and his teenage years. In 1869, he entered Washington College, known now as [[Washington and Lee University]], in [[Lexington, Virginia]] when [[Robert E. Lee]] was president of the college. In Page's later literary works, Robert E. Lee would come to serve as the model figure of Southern Heroism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simms|first=L. Moody|title=Thomas Nelson Page|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-01247.html|work=American National Biography Online|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page left Washington College before graduation for financial reasons after three years, but continued to desire an education specifically in law. To earn money to pay for his degree, Page tutored the children of his cousins in Kentucky. From 1873 to 1874, he was enrolled in the law school of the [[University of Virginia]]. At Washington College and thereafter at UVA, Nelson was a member of the prestigious fraternity Delta Psi, AKA St. Anthony Hall.

Admitted to the [[Virginia Bar Association]], he practiced as a lawyer in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] between 1876 and 1893, and also began his writing career. He was married to Anne Seddon Bruce on July 28, 1886.  She died on December 21, 1888 of a throat hemorrhage.

[[File:Thomas Nelson Page in 1916.jpg|thumb|Thomas Nelson Page in 1916.]]
He remarried on June 6, 1893, to Florence Lathrop Field, a widowed sister-in-law of retailer [[Marshall Field]]. In the same year Page, who had become disillusioned with the Southern legal system, gave up his practice entirely and moved with his wife to Washington, D.C. There, he kept up his writing, which amounted to eighteen volumes when they were compiled and published in 1912. Page popularized the [[plantation tradition]] genre of Southern writing, which told of an idealized version of life before the Civil War, with contented slaves working for beloved masters and their families. He based much of his writing on his personal experience living on a plantation in the Antebellum South. Page viewed the Antebellum South as a representation of moral purity, and often vilified the reforms of the [[Gilded Age]] as a sign of moral decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Theodore L.|title=Thomas Nelson Page|year=1967|publisher=Twayne Publishers Inc|location=New York|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1887 collection of short stories, ''In Ole Virginia'', is Page's quintessential work, which provides an depiction of the Antebellum South.  Criticism of Page's works runs the gamut, largely based upon whether the critic holds traditionalist or revisionist viewpoints of the antebellum South, War and Reconstruction years. His most well-known short-story from that collection was "Marse Chan." "Marse Chan" was popularized because of Page's ability to capture southern dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunitz|first=Stanley.|title= American Authors 1600-1900. A Biographical Dictionary of American Literature|year=1938|publisher=H.W Wilson|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another short-story collection of his is entitled ''The Burial of the Guns'' (1894). As a result of his literary success, Page was popular amongst the Capital elite, and was regularly invited to socialize with politicians from around the country.&lt;ref name="Dauer, Richard Paul 1972"&gt;Dauer, Richard Paul. "Thomas Nelson Page, Diplomat" (MA, College of William and Mary, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first quarter of the 20th century, he founded a library in the [[Sycamore Tavern]] structure near Montpelier, Virginia, in memory of his wife, Florence Lathrop Page.&lt;ref name="vaNRHPnom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Hanover/042-0085_Sycamore_Tavern_1974_Final_Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Sycamore Tavern |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission staff| date=January 1974|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Page was appointed as [[List of United States ambassadors to Italy|U.S. ambassador to Italy]] for six years between 1913 and 1919. Despite being untrained in Italian and having little experience in governmental affairs, Page was determined to do a good job. He eventually learned Italian, formed beneficial relationships with Italian government officials, and accurately reported on the Italian state during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Dauer, Richard Paul 1972"/&gt; During his time as ambassador Page managed to maintain and improve American-Italian relations during [[World War I]], and provided a sympathetic ear to the Italian and Triple Entente cause in the U.S government. After a disagreement with President Wilson over the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], in which he argued for increased Italian benefits, Page resigned his post in 1919. His book entitled ''Italy and the World War'' (1920) is a memoir of his service there.

Returning to his home in Oakland, Virginia, Page continued to write for the remainder of his years. He died in 1922 at Oakland in Hanover County, Virginia.

==Historical sites==
Page was an activist in stimulating the [[Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities]] to mobilize to save historical sites at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and elsewhere, especially in the [[Historic Triangle of Virginia]], from loss to development. He was involved in gaining Federal funding to build a [[seawall]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1900, protecting a site where the remains of James Fort were later discovered by [[archeology|archaeologists]] working on the [[Jamestown Rediscovery]] project which began in 1994.

==Family==
[[File:Thomas Nelson Page House - Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|The [[Thomas Nelson Page House]] in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C. is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]
The Page and Nelson families were each among the [[First Families of Virginia]]. The Page lineage in Virginia began with the arrival at Jamestown of [[John Page (Middle Plantation)|Colonel John Page]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1650. Col. Page was a prominent founder of [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]], which was later renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. The Page family included [[Mann Page]], U.S. Congressman and Governor [[John Page (Virginia)|John Page]].  The Nelson lineage began with [[Thomas "Scotch Tom" Nelson]], a Scottish immigrant who settled at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], and his son, William Nelson, who was a royal governor of Virginia. Thomas Nelson Page was a direct descendant of [[Thomas Nelson, Jr.]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and a governor after Statehood, and thus of [[Robert Carter I|Robert "King" Carter]], who served as an acting royal governor of Virginia and was one of its wealthiest landowners in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The Nelson family had settled in Hanover County, where Thomas's mother Elizabeth Burwell Nelson, married John Page.

A contemporary cousin of Thomas Nelson Page was [[William Nelson Page]] (1854–1932), who became a civil engineer and mining manager had helped develop the natural resources of western Virginia and southern West Virginia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. William Page is credited with, in partnership with millionaire financier [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]], planning and [[Building the Virginian Railway]]. His family's Victorian-era mansion, the [[Page-Vawter House]] in [[Ansted, West Virginia]], is a [[National Historical Landmark]] as is a former [[company store]] of the Page Coal and Coke Company in [[Pageton, West Virginia|Pageton]].Other cousins were Confederate officers [[Robert Edward Lee]] and [[Richard Lucian Page]]

The ruins of [[Rosewell Plantation]], the home of early members of the Page family and one of the finest mansions built in the colonies, sit on the banks of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]]. In 1916, a fire swept the mansion leaving a magnificent shell which is testament to 18th century craftsmanship and dreams. There are ongoing [[archeology|archaeological]] studies at the site.

==Writing themes==
Thomas Nelson Page was one of the best-known writers of his day. He served as Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to Italy, and the president referred to him as a "national ornament".&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Shirley. Womenfolks, growing up down South. New Haven, Conn.: Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Nelson Page 2.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Thomas Nelson Page, 1903.]]
Page's postbellum fiction featured a nostalgic view of the South in step with what is termed [[Lost Cause]] ideology. Slaves are happy and simple, slotted into a paternalistic society. For example, the former slave in Marse Chan is uneducated, speaks phonetically, and has unrelenting admiration for his former master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Thomas Nelson|title=Marse Chan excerpted from in Ole Virginia |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gentry are noble and principled, with fealty to country and to chivalry—they seem like knights of a different age. The strain epitomized by Page would carry through the postwar era, cropping up again in art with films like ''[[Birth of a Nation]]''. The ideology and thoughts that appear in Page's writing and in Southern ideology are no mere simplistic, archaic world-view; they are part of a complex history that has informed, for worse and for better, the evolution of the Southern mind to today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cash|first=W.J.|title=Mind of the South|publisher=Vintage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Nelson Page lamented that the slavery-era "good old darkies" had been replaced by the "new issue" (blacks born after slavery) whom he described as "lazy, thriftless, intemperate, insolent, dishonest, and without the most rudimentary elements of morality" (pp.&amp;nbsp;80, 163). Page, who helped popularize the images of cheerful and devoted Mammies and Sambos in his early books, became one of the first writers to introduce a literary black brute. In 1898 he published ''Red Rock'', a [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] novel, with the heinous figure of Moses, a loathsome and sinister black politician. Moses tried to rape a white woman: "He gave a snarl of rage and sprang at her like a wild beast" (pp.&amp;nbsp;356–358). He was later lynched for "a terrible crime".

[[File:Photo of Thomas Nelson Page.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Thomas Nelson Page.]]
Page dealt with the morality of [[lynching]] by acquitting the mob from any guilt, holding, instead, the supposedly debased Negroes responsible for their own violent executions.  The following excerpts are taken from Page's essay, "The Negro: The Southerner's Problem," published in 1904.  Page expected his reader to read his entire book with care before making judgments on complex, difficult subjects, in accordance with a society that read in depth. In his words in his introduction:

{{quote|In this discussion, one thing must be borne in mind:  In characterizing the Negroes generally, it is not meant to include the respectable element among them, except where this is plainly intended.  Throughout the South there is such an element, an element not only respectable, but universally respected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/negrosoutherners00page#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Negro.''] New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, pp. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With that in mind, Page's works include the following for which the disclaimer was necessary:

{{quote|Lynching does not end ravishing, and that is the prime necessity... The charge that is often made, that the innocent are sometimes lynched, has little foundation. The rage of a mob is not directed against the innocent, but against the guilty; and its fury would not be satisfied with any other sacrifices than the death of the real criminal. Nor does the criminal merit any consideration, however terrible the punishment. The real injury is to the perpetrators of the crime of destroying the law, and to the community in which the law is slain...
The crime of lynching is not likely to cease until the crime of ravishing and murdering women and children is less frequent than it has been of late. And this crime, which is well-nigh wholly confined to the Negro race, will not greatly diminish until the Negroes themselves take it in hand and stamp it out...
As the crime of rape of late years had its baleful renascence in the teaching of equality and the placing of power in the ignorant Negroes' hands, so its perpetuation and increase have undoubtedly been due in large part to the same teaching. The intelligent Negro may understand what social equality truly means, but to the ignorant and brutal young Negro, it signifies but one thing: the opportunity to enjoy, equally with white men, the privilege of [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|cohabiting with white women]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, Thomas Nelson (1904). [https://archive.org/stream/negrosoutherners00page#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Negro.''] New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, pp. xi, 108, 109, 111, 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likewise, Thomas Nelson Page complained that African American leaders should cease "talk of social equality that inflames the ignorant Negro,"&lt;ref name="Page 1904, p. 111"&gt;Page (1904), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead, work to stop "the crime of ravishing and murdering women and children."&lt;ref name="Page 1904, p. 111"/&gt;

{{Tobacco}}

The '''tobacco industry''' comprises those persons and companies engaged in the growth, preparation for sale, shipment, advertisement, and distribution of [[tobacco]] and tobacco-related products. It is a global industry; tobacco can grow in any warm, moist environment, which means it can be farmed on all continents except [[Antarctica]].

Tobacco, one of the most widely used addictive substances in the world{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, is a plant native to the Americas and historically one of the half-dozen most important crops grown by American farmers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} More specifically, tobacco refers to any of various plants of the genus ''[[Nicotiana]]'' (especially ''[[Nicotiana tabacum|N. tabacum]]'') native to [[tropical]] America and widely cultivated for their leaves, which are dried and processed chiefly for smoking in [[Tobacco pipe|pipe]]s, [[cigarette]]s, and [[cigar]]s; it is also cut to form [[chewing tobacco]] or ground to make [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] or dipping tobacco, as well as other less common preparations. From 1617 to 1793 tobacco was the most valuable staple export from the English American mainland colonies and the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Until the 1960s, the United States not only grew but also manufactured and exported more tobacco than any other country.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Tobacco is an agricultural [[commodity]] product, [[Agricultural economics|similar in economic terms]] to agricultural [[food]]stuffs: the price is in part determined by crop yields, which vary depending on local weather conditions.  The price also varies by specific [[species]] or [[cultivar]] grown, the total quantity on the market ready for sale, the area where it is grown, the health of the plants, and other characteristics individual to product quality.

Since 1964 conclusive medical evidence of the deadly effects of tobacco consumption has led to a sharp decline in official support for producers and manufacturers of tobacco, although it contributes to the agricultural, fiscal, manufacturing, and exporting sectors of the economy. Laws around the world now often have some restrictions on smoking, but almost 6 trillion cigarettes are still produced each year, representing over a 12% increase since the year 2000.&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/industry/manufacturing/text/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524045738/http://tobaccoatlas.org/industry/manufacturing/text/ |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |title=Manufacturing Cigarettes |deadurl=yes |publisher=[[World Lung Foundation]] and [[American Cancer Society]] |accessdate=June 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; China accounts for over 40% of current world production.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt; Tobacco is often heavily taxed to gain revenues for governments and as an incentive for people not to smoke.&lt;ref name="whotax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/downloads/doc_download/2381-chapter-28-tobacco-prices-and-taxes.html |title=Tobacco Prices and Taxes |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of tobacco}}
For a history of how tobacco has been grown and marketed, see [[tobacco]], [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and articles on similar topics.

==Position of industry ==
The phrase "tobacco industry" generally refers to the [[company|companies]] involved in the manufacture of [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], chewing tobacco and [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] tobacco. [[China National Tobacco Co.]] has become the largest tobacco company in the world by volume. Following extensive merger and acquisition activity in the 1990s and 2000s, four firms dominate international markets - in alphabetical order:

* [[Altria]] formerly [[Philip Morris Cos.]]
* [[British American Tobacco]] 
* [[Imperial Tobacco]]
* [[Japan Tobacco]]
*

Altria, formerly called the [[Philip Morris Cos.]] (Philip Morris Companies Inc.), still owns the Philip Morris tobacco business in the United States, but Philip Morris International has been fully independent since 2008. In most countries these companies either have long-established dominance, or have purchased the major domestic producer or producers (often a former [[state monopoly]]). Until 2014 the United States had one other substantial independent firm, [[Lorillard]], which Reynolds American, Inc. acquired. India has its own major player, [[ITC Limited]] (25.4%-owned by British American Tobacco). A small{{quantify|date=November 2015}} number of state monopolies survive, as well as some small independent firms.

[[Tobacco advertising]] is becoming increasingly restricted by the governments of countries around the world citing health issues as a reason to restrict tobaccos appeal{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Industry outlook in the United States==

{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

[[File:Smoking Dangers - 1905 new.png|thumb|left|180px|Anti-smoking ad, 1905]]

The tobacco industry in the United States has suffered greatly since the mid-1990s, when it was successfully sued by several U.S. states. The suits claimed that tobacco causes cancer, that companies in the industry knew this, and that they deliberately understated the significance of their findings, contributing to the illness and death of many citizens in those states.

The industry was found to have decades of [[Legacy Tobacco Documents Library|internal memos]] confirming in detail that tobacco (which contains [[nicotine]]) is both [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] and [[carcinogen]]ic (cancer-causing). The industry had long denied that [[nicotine addiction|nicotine is addictive]].&lt;ref name=Glantz2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glantz|first=SA|title=The truth about big tobacco in its own words|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=321|issue=7257|pages=313–314|date=August 2000|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7257/313|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7257.313|pmc=1118313|pmid=10926570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suit resulted in a [[Master Settlement Agreement|large cash settlement]] being paid by a group of tobacco companies to the states that sued. Further, since the suit was settled, other individuals have come forth, in [[class action]] [[lawsuit]]s, claiming individual damages. New suits of this nature will probably continue for a long time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Since the settlement is a heavy tax on the profits of the tobacco industry in the US, regressive against smokers, and further settlements being made only add to the financial burden of these companies, it is debatable if the industry has a money-producing long term outlook.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The tobacco industry has historically been largely successful in this litigation process, with the majority of cases being won by the industry. During the first 42 years of tobacco litigation (between 1954 and 1996) the industry maintained a clean record in litigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daynard | first1 = RA | last2 = Bates | first2 = C | last3 = Francey | first3 = N | year = 2000 | title = Tobacco litigation worldwide | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7227| pages = 111–3 | pmid = 10625272 | pmc=1117367 | doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7227.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to tactics described in a [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] internal memo as "the way we won these cases, to paraphrase [[George S. Patton|Gen. Patton]], is not by spending all of Reynolds' money, but by making the other son of a bitch spend all of his."&lt;ref&gt;Haines v Liggett Group, Inc, 818 F Supp 414, 421 (DNJ 1993), quoted in Daynard et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 2005 only 59% of cases were won by the tobacco industry either outright or on appeal in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Douglas CE, Davis RM, Beasley JK. [http://tc.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/15/suppl_4/iv9 Epidemiology of the third wave of tobacco litigation in the United States, 1994–2005]. ''Tobacco Control'' 2006;15(suppl_4):iv9-iv16; {{doi|10.1136/tc.2006.016725}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the continued success of the industry's efforts to win these cases is questionable. In Florida, the industry has lost 77 of the 116 "Engle progeny" cases that have gone to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Craver, Winston-Salem Journal, 24 June 2014 [http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/national_international/reynolds-loses-another-engle-case-in-florida/article_edb613a2-fc05-11e3-8257-001a4bcf6878.html Reynolds loses another "Engle" case in Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has
also denied the industry's major grounds for appeal of Engle cases.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Nohlgren, Tampa Bay Times, 24 June 2014 [http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/us-supreme-court-sides-against-big-tobacco-in-florida-litigation/2183646  U.S. Supreme Court sides against Big Tobacco in Florida litigation ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] which has been called a "sweeping anti-smoking" bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31481823/ns/politics-white_house/ |title=Obama signs sweeping anti-smoking bill - politics - White House - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other restrictions, this Act banned the use of any constituent, additive, herb or spice that adds a "characterizing flavor" to the tobacco product or smoke (Section 907)(a)(1)(A).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1256enr.txt.pdf|title=FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this ban is to prevent children and teenagers from becoming addicted to cigarettes at a young age with the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] citing that "studies have shown that 17 year old
smokers are three times as likely to use flavored cigarettes as are smokers over the age of 25".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Questions and Answers on the Ban of Cigarettes that Contain Certain Characterizing Flavors|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/FlavoredTobacco/UCM183230.pdf|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|agency=US Food and Drug Administration|date=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban however does not apply to [[menthol cigarette]]s, which are exempt from the bill.

Lawsuits against the tobacco industry are primarily restricted to the United States due to differences in legal systems in other countries. Many businesses class ongoing lawsuits as a cost of doing business in the US and feel their revenue will be only marginally affected by the activities.

[[Big Tobacco|Large tobacco companies]] have entered the [[electronic cigarette#History|electronic cigarette]] market by either buying some of the small e-cigarette companies or by starting their own e-cigarette companies.&lt;ref name=Orellana-BarriosPayne2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orellana-Barrios|first1=Menfil A.|last2=Payne|first2=Drew|last3=Mulkey|first3=Zachary|last4=Nugent|first4=Kenneth|title=Electronic Cigarettes—A Narrative Review for Clinicians|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=128|issue=7|year=2015|pages=674–681|issn=0002-9343|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.01.033|pmid=25731134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco control==
On May 11, 2004, the U.S. became the 108th country to sign the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|Global Treaty on Tobacco Control]]. This treaty places broad restrictions on the sale, advertising, shipment, and taxation of tobacco products. The U.S. has not yet ratified this treaty in its [[United States Senate|senate]] and does not yet have a schedule for doing so.

Most recently, there has been discussion within the tobacco control community of transforming the tobacco industry through the replacement of tobacco [[corporation]]s by other types of business organizations that can be established to provide tobacco to the market while not attempting to increase market demand.&lt;ref&gt;C. Callard, D. Thompson and N. Collishaw, Curing The Addiction To Profits: A Supply-Side Approach To Phasing Out Tobacco (Ottawa: Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2007, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Altria Group]] (formerly Philip Morris) did not have to pay $79.5 million in punitive damages awarded to Mayola Williams in a 1999 Oregon court ruling, when she sued Phillip Morris for responsibility in the cancer death of her husband, Jesse Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17239146/ |title=Supreme Court throws out Philip Morris verdict - Business - US business - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court's decision overturns a ruling made by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] that upheld the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003687.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204130206/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003687.php |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2008, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out a $800 billion class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of a group or class of people who smoked light cigarettes. The plaintiffs' lawyers were confident that they would be able to win this suit due to the success of the Schwab case &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=14138|title=US: Tobacco Makers Lose Key Ruling on Latest Suites|author=Johnston, David Kay and Melanie Warner|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-09-26|accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein tobacco companies were found guilty of fraud-like charges because they were selling the idea that light cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. The ruling by the three-judge panel will not allow the suit to be pursued as a class, but instead need proof for why individual smokers chose light cigarettes over regular cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/business/03cnd-tobacco.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title=Suit on Light Cigarettes Is Thrown Out|author=Saul, Stephanie|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-04-03|accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco industry in popular culture==

The tobacco industry has had a long relationship with the entertainment industry. In silent era movies, back-lit smoke was often used by filmmakers to create sense of mystery and sensuality in a scene. Later, cigarettes were deliberately placed in the hands of Hollywood stars as an early phase of [[product placement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C Mekemson1, S A Glantz2 |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/suppl_1/i81.full |title=How the tobacco industry built its relationship with Hollywood - Mekemson and Glantz 11 (suppl 1): i81 - Tobacco Control |publisher=Tobaccocontrol.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; until health regulating bodies tightened rules on tobacco advertisement and anti-smoking groups pressured actors and studio executives against such tactics. [[Big Tobacco]] has since been the subject focus of films such as the [[docudrama]] ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' (1999) and ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You For Smoking]]'' (2005).

These issues have also constituted a recurring storyline in the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[Mad Men]]'', from [[Mad Men (season 1)|season 1]] beginning with the pilot episode ([[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (Mad Men)|"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"]]) through season 7's midseason finale, [[Mad Men (season 7)|"Waterloo"]]. In another television show, the [[Netflix]] original program [[List of Orange Is the New Black episodes#Season 2 .282014.29|''Orange Is the New Black'' season 2]], episode 2 ("Looks Blue, Tastes Red"), "[[List of characters from Orange Is the New Black#Inmates|Black Cindy]] bring[s] some [[Ralph Nader|Naderism]] to Lichtfield (a women's federal penitentiary) when talking about [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]: 'Nah they ain't so bad.

==Types of Business License==

The types of Business Licenses issued in Dubai and other emirates in United Arab Emirates (UAE) are professional, commercial and industrial. The professional license covers services offered by professionals, artisans and craftsmen; the commercial license covers all trading and commercial activities performed with an intention of making profit ; the industrial license covers all industrial and manufacturing activities. The type of license depends on the business activity of the company or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baijumasoodu.com/articles/details/39|title=Types of Business License|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction of the Company==

In UAE, a company can be formed in any of the following three jurisdictions: Mainland, Free Zone and Offshore. The licensing authority in mainland is the Department of Economic Development of the respective emirates. In Free Zones, the relevant Free Zone Authority will be the licensing authority and respective Offshore Authority in the case of Offshore jurisdiction.

==Legal Forms of Business==
The common legal forms of business in the UAE are:
* [[Sole proprietorship]]
* Civil Company
* [[Limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]] (LLC)
* [[Partnership]]
* Private Share [[Holding company|Holding Company]]
* [[Share (finance)|Public Share]] Holding Company
* Branches
* Representative Offices
Under UAE Law, there are five types of business establishments applicable to foreign entities interested in establishing a formal presence in the UAE. UAE government has implemented wide range of economic and administrative policies which has made UAE an attractive business destination.

A company can create a permanent establishment, create an entity in a UAE free zone, enter into a commercial agency agreement, establish a branch office, create a civil company (currently possible to establish a company in Dubai,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/dubai|title=Business Setup in Dubai FreeZone {{!}} Dubai Freezone Company Formation {{!}} WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharjah &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/sharjah|title=Sharjah Freezone Incorporation {{!}}Company Registration Sharjah {{!}}WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ajman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/ajman|title=Ajman Freezone {{!}}Company Formation &amp; Registration in Ajma FreeZone {{!}}WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Limited Liability Company ===

A [[Limited Liability Company]] (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 1 (as per Article 8 of the Federal Commercial Company Law of 2015) and a maximum of 50 [[shareholders]] whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum [[share capital]] (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company’s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line.

A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a [[Memorandum of Association]] or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.

=== Free Zone Company ===

Establishing a business entity in one of the UAE's many [[Free trade zone]]s (FTZs) can be an attractive option for foreign investors. UAE has over 35 FTAs of which more than 20 are located in Dubai. 
The main attraction for setting up a company in a free zone is that there is no UAE national shareholding required. All free zones in UAE offer the following incentives:
* 100% foreign ownership of the enterprises
* 100% cent import and export tax exemptions
* 100% repatriation of capital and profits
* No currency restrictions
* [[Corporate tax]] exemption for 15 years, renewable for an additional 15 years
* No personal [[income taxes]]

UAE Free Zone companies can only operate within the free zone boundaries and are generally limited to performing solely those activities listed in their license(s).

It is mandatory for every company registered in the Free Zone to lease minimum office space within that particular Free Zone. A Free Zone Company can obtain UAE residence visas for the director, shareholder and also employees of the company through the Free Zone where it is registered.

=== Offshore Company ===

UAE [[Offshore company]] registration is a very popular method of doing business in the Middle East region. 
In UAE there are three offshore jurisdictions – Dubai (Jebel Ali Offshore Company)  [[Ras Al Khaimah]]and Ajman. They offer similar services but serve different strategic goals of offshore company registration.The Jebel Ali Offshore Company is an International Business Crown/holds the only offshore vehicle that is permitted to own / hold real estate in the Emirate of Dubai.

The RAK Offshore and the RAK International Company (RAKIC) are International Business Companies. They provide a flexible and credible option for foreign investors to register an offshore company in UAE without the need to establish a physical presence in the UAE.

UAE Offshore companies offer the following benefits:
* No Corporate tax
* 100% foreign ownership
* Limited Liability Company
* No TIEAs
* Absolute Privacy and Confidentiality
* Ability to maintain multi-currency Bank accounts in the UAE
* Virtual office facilities available in the UAE

=== Branch / Representative Office ===

A branch office has the same legal identity as its [[parent company]] and conducts business under the name of its parent company. A branch office may only be engaged in activities similar to those of its parent company but it is not permitted to carry on the business of importing the products of its parent company, a function reserved for local trade agents. In some cases the Branch of a foreign company are required to obtain an additional license from UAE Ministry of Economy.

[[Representative office]], on the other hand, is limited to promoting its parent company’s activities i.e. gathering information and soliciting orders and projects to be performed by the company’s head office.

A UAE national must be appointed as a ‘service agent’ for the branch or representative office.

=== Civil Company ===

A civil company is a business partnership for professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants.
A civil company is 100% owned by the professional partners (except for engineering civil company), however, a UAE National Local Service Agent is normally required.  
A foreign company can be a partner in a civil company, as long as the foreign company is in the same field as the civil company.
