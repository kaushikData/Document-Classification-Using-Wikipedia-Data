The '''Banca Giuratale''' ({{lang-mt|Banka Ġuratali}}), also known as the '''Municipal Palace''' ({{lang-mt|Palazz Muniċipali}}), is a public building in [[Mdina]], [[Malta]]. It was built in the 18th century to house the city's administrative council and courts, and was later used as a private residence and a school. It now houses part of the [[National Archives of Malta]].

==History==
The Banca Giuratale was built between 1726 and 1728 to house the Università, the civil administrative council of Mdina, after their original premises were taken over by Grand Master [[António Manoel de Vilhena]] in order to build [[Palazzo Vilhena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mdina|url=http://www.malta.com/en/about-malta/city-village/mdina|website=malta.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027170813/http://www.malta.com/en/about-malta/city-village/mdina|archivedate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by [[Charles François de Mondion]], a French architect who was responsible for rebuilding many buildings in Mdina.&lt;ref name=nicpmi/&gt; It also housed the district court.&lt;ref name=allaboutmalta&gt;{{cite web|title=The Banca Giuratale|url=http://allaboutmalta.blogspot.com.mt/2012/06/banca-giuratale.html|website=allaboutmalta.blogspot.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027164208/http://allaboutmalta.blogspot.com.mt/2012/06/banca-giuratale.html|archivedate=27 October 2015|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|Maltese uprising]] against the [[French occupation of Malta]], the Banca Giuratale was the meeting place of the National Assembly, which was set up by the Maltese to govern the island and blockade the French forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malta under the French: The Blockade|url=http://www.kagoon.com/3-blockadenotes-pdf-1/main|website=kagoon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027170439/http://www.kagoon.com/3-blockadenotes-pdf-1/main|archivedate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mha.org.au/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/33-malta-and-the-french-revolution source]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was leased to private individuals in 1831. In 1881, the Education Department converted it into a secondary school, which closed in 1969.&lt;ref name=allaboutmalta/&gt; The Sisters of St. Dorothy subsequently used the building as a private school, until the lease was terminated in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sisters of Saint Dorothy|url=http://www.stdorothysmalta.org.mt/aboutus.html|website=Malta Dorothean Province|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027164103/http://www.stdorothysmalta.org.mt/aboutus.html|archivedate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuschieri, Doreen (25 October 2010).

[[Times of Malta]]. Retrieved 12 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, the Banca Giuratale has housed the Legal Documentation Section of the [[National Archives of Malta]]. The archives contain all the court records from 1530 to 1899,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Repositories|url=https://secure2.gov.mt/nationalarchives/default.aspx?page_info_id=102|website=[[National Archives of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027162809/https://secure2.gov.mt/nationalarchives/default.aspx?page_info_id=102|archivedate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the documents of the ''Consolato del Mare di Malta'', Malta's maritime tribunal between 1697 and 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vella|first1=Fiona|title=Law of the sea|url=http://fionavella.com/features/2015/03/law-of-the-sea/|website=fionavella.com|date=18 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027165235/http://fionavella.com/features/2015/03/law-of-the-sea/|archivedate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Banca Giuratale of Mdina along with [[Banca Giuratale (Victoria, Gozo)|that of Gozo]] was depicted on the [[Maltese lira|Lm]]2 banknote that was in circulation between 1989 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maltese Lira|url=http://www.centralbankmalta.org/maltese-lira|website=[[Central Bank of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927045101/http://www.centralbankmalta.org/maltese-lira|archivedate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mdina's [[Local councils of Malta|local council]], which is housed in the [[Corte Capitanale]], requested to use the Banca Giuratale as its premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mdina Council wants to use Banca Giuratale|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-02-20/news/mdina-council-wants-to-use-banca-giuratale-306085/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW?url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name=nicpmi&gt;{{cite web|title=Banca Guiratale|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01188.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=27 October 2015|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Nikola's Palace.jpg|thumb|300px|Bar Royal Palace]]

Bar Royal Palace is a (former) royal summer [[residence]] in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], [[Montenegro]]. The palace was constructed by king [[Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš]] in 1885, and was a gift to his daughter Princess [[Princess_Zorka_of_Montenegro|Zorka]] and his son-in-law, Prince [[Peter_I_of_Serbia|Petar Karađorđević]]. The complex includes the large and the small palace, a chapel, houses for the guards and a winter garden. A spacious ballroom was added in 1910.

At the front of the palace, there was a wooden pier. Between 1866 and 1916, King Nikola owned ten yachts. One of them, Sibil, was bought from [[Jules Verne]], the novelist. The last yacht bought was the Rumija. In 1915, it was sunk in the Bar harbour by the Austro-Hungarian navy. 

Currently, the palace houses the city museum of Bar. Also, it is used as a venue for festivals, concerts, exhibitions and literary events.

The '''Battle of Segre''' is the collective name of a series of battles that took place along the [[Segre River]] between 4 April 1938 and the 3 January 1939, during the [[Spanish Civil War]] after the Nationalist Faction had broken the lines of the [[Spanish Republican Army]] in the [[Aragon Offensive]].&lt;ref name="Ealham2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Ealham|title=Living Anarchism: José Peirats and the Spanish Anarcho-syndicalist Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ip5bCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101|date=14 December 2015|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-84935-239-0|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although seldom mentioned in historical works, it was one of the most protracted battles of the Civil War.

==History==
After having been overwhelmed in [[Aragon]], the Segre River became for the Spanish Republic a crucial line not only for halting the devastating eastward advance of the rebel armies, but also to ensure that the vital [[hydroelectric dam]]s of the [[Pre-Pyrenees]] did not fall in Francoist hands.&lt;ref name="Ep"&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Regreso/batalla/Segre/elpepuespcat/20060709elpcat_16/Tes El País - Regreso a la batalla del Segre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in April there were constant battles in the Segre Front along a long defensive line of republican positions and fortifications. During most of 1938 there would be numerous attacks, counterattacks and skirmishes from both sides along the Segre River.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramón Salas Larrazabal]] (2006); pág. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A great number of manpower and material was sent to the [[Eastern Army (Spain)|Eastern Army]] of the newly created [[Eastern Region Army Group]] in that front. The Spanish republic was able to hold unto that line until the beginning of January 1939 when it became impossible to keep holding the resistance in the Segre against the overwhelming pressure of the rebels.&lt;ref name="Ep"/&gt;

Photographer [[Robert Capa]] took pictures of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Marines of the [[151 Brigada Mixta]] who fought in this battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediastore.magnumphotos.com/CoreXDoc/MAG/Media/TR3/f/8/1/6/PAR115600.jpg Robert Capa picture of the 151 Brigada Mixta at the Battle of the Segre]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Benvenuti Situla ''' is a bronze [[situla]] that dates to ca. 600 B.C. It is a product of the [[situla art]] that spread north from the [[Etruscans]] in this period, in this case to the [[Este culture]] that flourished in [[Este, Veneto]] during the 7th century BC. The vessel is now conserved in the local [[National Museum Atestino]].&lt;ref name="BenvenutiAtestino1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leo Benvenuti|author2=Museo nazionale Atestino|author3=Giulia Fogolari|title=La situla Benvenuti nel Museo di Este|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJQxQwAACAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Atesa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relief work on the vessel depicts scenes of aristocratic life.&lt;ref name="Gardiner2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

'''Broadcast law''' is the field of [[law]] that pertains to [[broadcasting]]. These laws and [[regulation]]s pertain to [[radio station]]s and [[TV station]]s, and are also considered to include closely related services like [[cable TV]] and [[cable radio]], as well as [[satellite TV]] and [[satellite radio]]. Likewise, it also extends to [[broadcast network]]s.

Broadcast law includes technical [[parameter]]s for these facilities, as well as content issues like [[copyright]], [[profanity]], and [[localism (politics)|localism]] or [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]].

== US ==

In the US, broadcasting falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].

Some of the more notable aspects of broadcast law involve:
* [[frequency allocation]]: The division of the spectrum into unlicensed frequency bands -- [[ISM band]] and [[U-NII]]—and licensed frequency bands -- [[television channel frequencies]], [[FM broadcast band]], [[amateur radio frequency allocations]], etc.
* [[low-power broadcasting]]
* [[Fairness Doctrine]]
* [[public broadcasting]]

=== History ===
The Radio Act of 1927 was the first major broadcasting law in the country. Among its provisions was the equal opportunity provision, providing a foundation for the equal time rule. This provision requires radio and television stations and cable systems which originate their own programming to treat legally qualified political candidates equally when it comes to selling or giving away air time. Concerns that, without mandated equal opportunity for candidates, some broadcasters might try to manipulate elections led to its creation by legislators(1). The Communications Act of 1934 amended the Radio Act and the equal time provision is located Section 315 of the Communications Act.

The Communications Act of 1934 was another hallmark moment in broadcasting law history, because it created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the purpose of "regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world wide wire and radio communications service . . . ."  (In this context, the word "radio" covers both broadcast radio and television.)  The FCC has the authority to "make such regulations not inconsistent with law as it may deem necessary to prevent interference between stations and to carry out the provisions of [the] Act(2)."

In 1949, the FCC enacted a policy, referred to as the "Fairness Doctrine," for the purpose of ensuring balanced and fair coverage of all controversial issues by a broadcast station. The FCC adopted the view that station licensees were "public trustees," and, therefore, had an obligation to broadcast discussion of contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. It was later established that stations should also actively seek out issues of importance to their community and air programming about those issues. During the 1980s, the Reagan Administration pressured the FCC to eliminate the fairness doctrine(3).

== UK ==
In the UK, broadcasting has been regulated by the [[Ofcom|Office of Communications (Ofcom)]] since 2002.
  
Scheduled radio and television broadcasting services need a licence from Ofcom under the Broadcasting Act 1990 or 1996, and must comply with the Ofcom [http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/ Broadcasting Code] made under section 319 of the [[Communications Act 2003]], together with a number of other codes relating to access, electronic programme guides, advertising, and so on. The [[BBC]] is subject to some but not all of the requirements of the Broadcasting Code.

On-demand television services are regulated by the Authority for Video on Demand, so long as they fall within the definition of regulated services in section 368A(1) of the Communications Act, and must comply with the programme standards set out in Part 4A of the Communications Act.

The Champion Teleport facility is a fully integrated digital communications platform capable of receiving, processing, and broadcasting (either via satellite, or fiber) of thousands of satellite and IP broadcast streams from television, radio, and the internet.  In addition to MPEG/2 broadcasting,  the Champion Teleport is also capable of two-way satellite broadband and  is connected by multiple fiber optic lines to several terrestrial backbone providers of Internet connectivity.   We have the ability to transmit up to 500 TV stations and thousands of audio and radio channels over satellite on K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, C, and K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; bands (when available) and VSAT connections directly to North and South America, Europe, The Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.

Located in Oxford, Connecticut, the Champion Teleport is one of only about a dozen such facilities in the world.  The FCC licensed the teleport in 1996 and the teleport cannot be replicated without spending tens of millions of dollars and considerable time to obtain zoning permits and construction, creating an immediate barrier to entry.  The teleport was upgraded in the last two years to become a unique platform for broadband applications combining a satellite earth station, fiber hubs, television, video and audio post and pre-production studios with control centers and conditional access.

Champion Teleport was originally AlphaStar Digital Television, which was one of the original four Direct-To-Home (DTH) satellite television broadcast companies that included DirecTV, EchoStar, PrimeStar, and AlphaStar. Champion now specializes in Internet and intranet broadband content origination, aggregation, multimedia data storage, streaming and digital media services that can then be distributed by a combination of fiber and live 24/7 satellite broadcasts or on demand.

Originally built as a part of President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program, the Champion Teleport was designed according to military specifications including—complete redundancy, climate controls, secret rooms,  and the ability to withstand a direct attack.  It was intended to protect the US by tracking the former Soviet Union's satellites and missiles. As a result the teleport is geographically located to serve as a gateway to the world where it can downlink and uplink satellite feeds from most countries around the globe.

'''Crested Ten''' is a variety of [[Irish whiskey]] made by [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|Jameson]]. It has an [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] of 40%.

The brand was launched in 1963 and is Jameson's oldest bottled brand. Not 10 years old as the name suggests, it is a fuller, richer, spicy, sherried version of the regular Jameson with the majority of the blend being 7-8 years with approximately 60% of the blend being pot still and 40% grain. Full-bodied with soft, delicate sherry undertones, toasted wood, perfectly balanced with fruit, spices and chocolate.
'A whiskey of great finesse which is balanced beautifully between sweet and dry, light notes and heavy ones. Like all great Irish whiskeys, for the most satisfying results, this should not be sipped but taken by the mouthful and swallowed slowly.' Jim Murray, A Taste of Irish Whiskey. 

As of 2006, it is not widely available outside Ireland.

The '''Cretan owl''' (''[[Athene (bird)|Athene]] cretensis'') is an [[extinct]] [[species]] of [[owl]] from the [[Pleistocene]] of the island of [[Crete]], in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. It was first named by Weesie in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nia.gr/paleontologie.htm Palaeontological fieldwork done by Dutch-Greek teams] Retrieved on 2008-08-25&lt;/ref&gt; In life, it would have been at least 60&amp;nbsp;cm tall, and flightless or nearly flightless. The Cretan owl became extinct after [[human]]s moved into Crete.

The '''cuegle''' is a monster in [[Cantabrian mythology|Cantabrian folklore]]. Walking on two legs and roughly humanoid in shape, it is believed to have black skin, a long beard, grey hair, three arms without hands or fingers, five rows of teeth, a single stubby horn and three eyes in its head: one green, one red, and one blue. It is said to have great strength despite its small size.&lt;ref name=Cantabria&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cantabriajoven.com/mitologia/seres.html| title = Monsters and Creatures of Cantabria (Spanish)| work = Cantabria Joven| accessdate = 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cuegle attacks people and livestock, and is reputed to steal babies from the [[Bassinet|cradle]].  It may be protected against by placing [[oak]] or [[holly]] leaves, which it [[Apotrope|finds repulsive]], in the cradle.

It held its first session in [[Tallinn]] in January 1999. Finnish diplomat [[Max Jakobson]] was appointed chairman of the commission. For purposes of independence (no conflict of interest), there were no Estonian citizens among its members.

Research of the Commission has been relied on by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], for example in its decision to not grant [[certiorari]] to review a complaint by [[August Kolk]] and [[Pyotr Kislyy]], who had been convicted of [[crimes against humanity]] due to their roles in the [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eesti Päevaleht]] 27 May 2008: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/430436 Max Jakobsoni komisjon lõpetab uurimise] by [[Anneli Ammas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was disbanded in 2007 and was succeeded by the [[Estonian Institute of Historical Memory]].

Goodbye Conflict, Welcome Development
The '''g7+''', established in 2010, is an intergovernmental voluntary organisation bringing together countries that are either facing active conflict or  have recent experience of conflict and fragility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/sites/default/files/resources/g7plus-Charter_0.pdf|title=The g7+ charter|last=|first=|date=|website=g7plus.org|publisher=g7+ Media|access-date=|accessdate=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 20 member countries from Asia, the Pacific, Africa and the Caribbean with a combined population of 260 million.

== Organizational purpose of the g7+ ==
# Facilitate sharing of lessons learned and good practices for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding, to further the common goals of stability, peace and good governance, and to promote cooperation among member countries.
# Advocate for reforms in aid management policies and other international engagement in its member countries, to be founded on the principles of effective engagement in development tailored to fragile situations.
# Promote and advocate for country-led peace- and statebuilding as the basis for any development framework.
# Promote effective institutions through assisting members in improvements in the spheres of politics, public administration, natural resources, economics and finance.

== Background ==
The g7+ was first conceived at the [[3rd High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/theaccrahighlevelforumhlf3andtheaccraagendaforaction.htm|title=Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/theaccrahighlevelforumhlf3andtheaccraagendaforaction.htm|title=Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana, in 2008 where a side meeting convened the representatives of countries in a fragile situation to discuss how development cooperation works in these countries. The group was further formalized at the first Dialogue for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (IDPS) meeting, held in Dili, Timor-Leste in April 2010.

The broader IDPS Meeting produced the Dili Declaration&lt;ref name="Dili Declaration {{!}} g7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/en/resources/dili-declaration|title=Dili Declaration {{!}} g7+|website=www.g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dili Declaration {{!}} g7"/&gt; recognising the group and adopting a number of its recommendations. The group has since expanded to represent twenty member countries namely [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name="Afghanistan {{!}} g7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/en/member-countries/afghanistan|title=Afghanistan {{!}} g7+|website=www.g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Afghanistan {{!}} g7"/&gt; [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Comoros]], [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Haiti]], [[Liberia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Somalia]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[South Sudan]], [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]], [[Togo]] and [[Yemen]].

== Governance ==
The preeminent decision making body of the group is a Ministerial forum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/en/ministerial-forum|title=Ministerial Forum {{!}} g7+|website=g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is convened every year in a member country. Each member state is represented by a Minister. Decisions are made based on consultation among the member countries. The Ministers endorse strategic priorities and an annual plan based on these. The group is chaired by a Minister, selected based on consensus from member countries for a 2-year tenure. The current chair is Sierra Leone's Minister of Finance and Development, Dr [http://www.g7plus.org/en/chair-g7 Momodu Lamin Kargbo].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/en/chair-g7|title=The Chair &amp; Deputy Chair {{!}} g7+|website=www.g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The g7+ Secretariat&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/en/secretariat|title=The Secretariat  {{!}} g7+|website=g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; functions as an executive body facilitating implementation of the strategic plans and ensuring coordination. The Secretariat is permanently hosted in the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Timor-Leste, based in Dili. Consultations at technical level are held periodically and on an ad hoc basis among the country focal points, who are senior officials from each member countries.

== Peacebuilding and Statebuilding ==

Countries with acute crises, or those which have just emerged from war, conflict or natural disaster, experience difficulties in attaining economic and social development. The World Development Report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/WDR2011_Full_Text.pdf|title=World Development Report|last=World|first=Bank|date=|website=Worldbank.org|publisher=World Bank|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/0,,contentMDK:23252415~pagePK:478093~piPK:477627~theSitePK:477624,00.html|title=WDRs - World Development Report 2011|website=web.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (World Bank, 2011) found that hardly any of these countries achieved a single [https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ Millennium Development Goal]. One of the underlying reasons, according to the report, of lagging behind in achieving any development benchmarks in these countries is a lack of peace and strong institutions. The g7+ countries share such challenges and thus sustainable peace and effective state institutions are recognized to be a precursor for economic and social growth. In addition, g7+ countries faced similar of challenges in realizing aid effectiveness principles in their countries, according to the 2008 Paris Declaration monitoring survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/2008surveyonmonitoringtheparisdeclaration.htm|title=2008 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to further state fragmentation. Thus the g7+ hold the belief  that their countries must prioritise peacebuilding and statebuilding to provide foundations that allow them to move towards stability and resilience.

== New Deal ''for engagement in Fragile states'' ==
Through the forum of the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding bringing together g7+ members and donors, a new set of principles for engaging in fragile situations was negotiated and agreed. These principles were embedded in a framework called the New Deal ''for Engagement in Fragile States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/sites/default/files/basic-page-downloads/A%20New%20Deal%20for%20engagement%20in%20Fragile%20States.pdf|title=New Deal Engagement in Fragile States|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=2011|website=g7plus.org|publisher=g7plus|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was endorsed in November 2011, during the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/fourthhighlevelforumonaideffectiveness.htm|title=Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Busan, South Korea, by more than 40 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/busanadherents.htm|title=Countries, Territories and Organisations Adhering to the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international organisations.

The New Deal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/en/our-work/new-deal-implementation|title=New Deal Implementation {{!}} g7+|website=www.g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for country-led peacebuilding and statebuilding goals (PSGs) to be prioritized at country level by government and development partners.

'''The PSGs are:'''
# Inclusive Politics to be fostered to reconcile and resolve conflicts
# Security to be established for all the people
# Access to Justice 
# Economic Foundations through the generation of sustainable employment 
# Build capacity to generate and deliver Revenue and Services

The New Deal aims to ensure mutual accountability between governments, civil society, donors and other international actors. It seeks to address the root causes of conflict and fragility and to pursue a country-led approach for development partnerships, in line with aid effectiveness principles. It seeks harmonization among donors in their development cooperation to avoid aid fragmentation.

The g7+ seeks to promote the implementation of the New Deal principles in its member countries, through improved engagement between governments, development partners and civil society, in order to create better partnerships towards peace and resilience.

Since the endorsement of the New Deal, a monitoring survey was conducted in 2014 to assess the progress of its implementation. The IDPS (International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding) also conducted an independent review of the New Deal&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/sites/default/files/resources/Independent-Review-Full-Review.pdf|title=Independent Review of the New Deal|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=April 2016|website=g7plus.org|publisher=CIC|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2016, to assess the relevance of the New Deal principles in the current era. Both of the studies confirmed that New Deal principles are one of the most effective means for leaving no-one behind in the achievement of Sustainable Development.

== The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ==
The g7+ group also played a crucial role in successfully negotiating the inclusion of a Sustainable Development Goal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SDG) on peace, justice and strong institutions Goal number 16&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300|title=Sustainable Development Goals .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2030 Agenda that was adopted at the 70th United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, in New York.

The g7+ is now seeking to support the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs in its member countries. The g7+ seeks to maintain the momentum of prioritizing peaceful societies, justice and accountable institutions within Agenda 2030. In addition, the group advocates for a special attention to be granted to the countries in a fragile situation in the implementation of Agenda 2030 due to the peculiarity of their challenges.

To this end, the g7+ will monitor progress across SDGs on the key areas which are common to the membership. The result of this monitoring will then be published to show trends across the g7+ countries while implementing Agenda 2030. The 4th g7+ Ministerial Meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/en/resources/kabul-communique-kabul-afghanistan-23rd-24th-march-2016|title=Kabul Communique: kabul, Afghanistan, 23rd - 24th March 2016 {{!}} g7+|website=www.g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 23–24 March 2016 in Kabul, Afghanistan, endorsed g7+ joint tracking of key SDG indicators that will be agreed among the members.

== Peer Learning and Fragile-to-Fragile Cooperation ==
Peer-to-peer learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/en/peer-learning-and-cooperation|title=Peer Learning and Cooperation {{!}} g7+|website=g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the priorities that emerged in November 2012 at the g7+ Haiti Ministerial Meeting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g7plus.org/en/news-item/g7-concludes-successful-2nd-ministerial-retreat-presentation-haiti-declaration|title=The g7+ concludes a successful 2nd Ministerial Retreat with the presentation of the Haiti Declaration {{!}} g7+|website=www.g7plus.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key pillar of the Fragile-to-Fragile Cooperation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/sites/default/files/basic-page-downloads/Fragile-To-Fragile-Cooperation-g7%2B_0.pdf|title=Fragile-to-Fragile Cooperation note|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=2012|website=g7plus.org|publisher=g7plus|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (F2F) concept. F2F aims at mobilising cooperation among member countries, developing a network to share knowledge and expertise among them, and applying the collective skills of the group to the specific challenges each country faces.

In the spirit of sharing knowledge, in 2013 and 2014 the g7+ carried out a research and mutual learning project on natural resources management,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/sites/default/files/basic-page-downloads/NRM%2Bbooklet-EN-PW.PDF|title=Natural Resources in g7+ countries|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=2015|website=g7plus|publisher=g7plus|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the publication of a manual entitled "Natural Resources in g7+ countries".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the g7+  Secretariat published a report called "Aid Instruments for Peace and Statebuilding: Putting the New Deal into practice"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/sites/default/files/basic-page-downloads/New%20Deal%20Innovations%20-%20Complete%20-%205-.pdf|title=Aid Instruments for Peace and Statebuilding|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=March 2016|website=g7plus|publisher=g7plus|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, in which different g7+ country case studies highlighted good examples of the application of New Deal principles in the use of aid instruments.

In the spirit of solidarity and under g7+ Fragile-to-Fragile Cooperation, the g7+ group also help in achieving peace and resilience. This is done by launching missions of eminent persons and other senior officials from member countries into a member country facing challenges. In addition, the group helps in mobilizing international support for the member country in trouble. The group also advances cooperation among member countries, for instance, the Government of Timor-Leste assisted Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/sites/default/files/downloadable-newsletters/g7%2Bnewsletter-CARedition-2015.pdf|title=g7+ Newsletter special edition CAR|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=2015|website=g7plus.org|publisher=g7plus|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their electoral processes in 2014 and 2015 and assisted Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in their fight against Ebola.

== Policy Advocacy ==
The g7+ as a group also aims to advocate at a global level for better policies for international engagement in countries affected by conflict and fragility. In addition to successfully advocating for Sustainable Development Goal number 16 to be included in Agenda 2030, the g7+ also have managed to influence donor processes such as the World Bank IDA17&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ida.worldbank.org/financing/replenishments/ida17-replenishment|title=IDA17 Replenishment|date=2016-01-30|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IDA18&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ida.worldbank.org/financing/replenishments/ida18-replenishment-1|title=IDA18 Replenishment|date=2016-02-16|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; allocation rounds. g7+ advocacy is based on the principles of New Deal ''for engagement in fragile states''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g7plus.org/sites/default/files/basic-page-downloads/A%20New%20Deal%20for%20engagement%20in%20Fragile%20States.pdf|title=New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States|last=g7plus|first=g7plus|date=2012|website=g7plus.org|publisher=IDPS|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on such matters as national ownership, use of country systems, context sensitive flexible policies and predictable aid. Advocacy is practiced through a combination of research publications, public position statements and regular formal and informal dialogue with key international development partners through the IDPS and other fora. The Independent Review of the New Deal &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in 2016 found that ''"The g7+ has become an increasingly influential constituency on the world stage"'' (Hearn 2016).

'''General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea''' ('''GFTUK'''{{korean|context=north|조선직업총동맹|朝鮮職業總同盟}}) is the sole legal [[trade union]] federation in [[North Korea]]. GFTUK was formed on November 30, 1945 as the '''General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea'''.{{sfn|Yonhap|2002|p=389}} In January 1951, it was reorganized and adopted its current name.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://korea-dpr.com/politicorganization.html|title=Democratic People's Republic of Korea_Juche Korea|website=korea-dpr.com|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; GFTUK is one of the most important [[mass organization]]s in the country.&lt;ref name="ScalapinoKim1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scalapino|first1=Robert A.|author2=Chun-yŏp Kim|title=North Korea Today: Strategic and Domestic Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsVxAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, Center for Korean Studies|isbn=978-0-912966-55-7|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 1.6 million members.{{sfn|Yonhap|2002|p=389}}

The unions of GFTUK are affiliated to the various branch organizations of WFTU. The head of the international department of GFTUK is Im Jong Gi.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All workers of 30 years of age are required to be members of GFTUK if they are not members of the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), the [[Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea]], or the [[Korean Democratic Women's League]].{{sfn|Yonhap|2002|p=389}}

The website of the [[Korean Friendship Association]] states that "(The GFTUK) conducts ideological education to ensure its members fully understand the Juche idea and gets them to take part in socialist construction and the management of the socialist economy with the attitude befitting masters. It has its organizations in different branches of industry." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the ''North Korea Handbook'' states that the GFTUK is not designed to serve its members but the WPK.{{sfn|Yonhap|2002|p=389}} GFTUK is directly controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee of the WPK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015: Korea, Democratic People's Republic of|publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor; U.S. Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2015&amp;dlid=252771|access-date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guineans in France''' consist of migrants from [[Guinea]] and their descendants living and working in France. They are one of the [[diaspora]]s from [[Black Africa]] in France.

==History==
During the [[1960s]], [[Black Africa]]ns began to immigrate to [[France]] in large numbers. These immigrants mostly came from the [[Senegal River|Senegal]] Valley ([[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Guinea]]) and were composed mainly of male workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politique-africaine.com/numeros/pdf/067041.pdf|format=PDF|title=L‘immigration africaine en France : regards des autres et repli sur soi |website=Politique-africaine.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the [[1970s]], the population of [[Guinea]]ns in [[France]] had more than doubled because immigration laws permitting family reunifications.  The growth of this population slowed significantly during the [[1990s]], but has increased in the 21st century, with immigrants now increasingly settling outside the Île-de-France to cities like [[Lyon]] or [[Marseille]].

'''[[Japan]]''' emerged as one of the largest [[foreign aid]] donors in the world during the 1980s.

In 1991 Japan was the second largest foreign aid donor worldwide, behind the [[United States]]. Japan's ratio of foreign aid to [[gross national product|GNP]] in this year was 0.32%, behind the 0.35% average for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]'s Development Assistance Committee member countries, but ahead of the United States ratio of 0.20%.

The foreign aid program began in the 1960s out of the [[War reparations|reparations payments]] Japan was obliged to pay to other Asian countries for war damage. The program's budget remained quite low until the late 1970s, when Japan came under increasing pressure from other industrial countries to play a larger role. During the 1980s, Japan's foreign aid budget grew quickly, despite the budget constraints imposed by the effort to reduce the fiscal deficit. From 1984 to 1991, the [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) budget increased at an average annual rate of 22.5%, reaching US$11.1 billion by 1991. Part of this rise was the result of exchange rate movements (with given yen amounts committed in the budget becoming larger dollar amounts). During the 1980s, foreign aid rose at a lower, but still strong, rate of between 4% and 12% annually in the government budget, with an average annual rate of growth from 1979 to 1988 of 8.6%.

During the 1970s, the government took positive measures to increase its Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing countries and to contribute to the stabilization of the international trade and monetary system. These measures were generally welcomed abroad, although some countries felt that the steps taken were not executed as rapidly or were not as extensive as similar efforts by some other advanced industrialized nations. Japan's ODA increased tenfold during the decade and stood at US$3.3 billion in 1980, but this ODA as a percentage of GNP was still below the average of other donor countries.

In the 1980s, Japan's ODA continued to rise rapidly. ODA net disbursements, in nominal terms, averaged around US$3 billion per year in the early 1980s and then jumped to US$5.6 billion in 1986 and US$9.1 billion in 1990. Japan's share of total disbursements from major aid donors also grew significantly, from nearly 11.8% in 1979 to about 15% in the mid-1980s, and later to more than 19% in 1989 dropping back to under 17% in 1990. Japan's ODA as a percentage of its GNP, however, did not increase substantially during the 1980s, remaining at about 0.3%.

Japan continued to concentrate its economic assistance in Asia (about 60% of total commitments in 1990), reflecting its historical and economic ties to the region. Japan made modest increases in aid to Africa with the announcement in 1989 of a US$600 million grant program for the next three years. In 1990, Japan also pledged large amounts of assistance to Eastern Europe, but most of that aid was to be in the form of market rate credits and investment insurance, which did not qualify as ODA. In other regions, Japan appeared likely to continue allocating relatively small shares of assistance. Nevertheless, by 1987 Japan had become the largest bilateral donor in twenty-nine countries, nearly double the number in which that had been the case ten years earlier.

The continued growth of Japan's foreign aid appears to be motivated by two fundamental factors. First, Japanese policy is aimed at assuming international responsibilities commensurate with its position as a global economic power. Second, many believed, the growing Japanese foreign aid program comes largely in response to pressure from the United States and other allies for Japan to take on a greater share of the financial burdens in support of shared security, political, and economic interests.

Such assistance consisted of grants and loans and of support for multilateral aid organizations. In 1990 Japan allocated US$6.9 billion of its aid budget to bilateral assistance and US$2.3 billion to multilateral agencies. Of the bilateral assistance, US$3.0 billion went for grants and US$3.9 billion for concessional loans.

Japan's foreign aid program has been criticized for better serving the interests of Japanese corporations than those of [[developing country|developing countries]]. In the past, tied aid (grants or loans tied to the purchase of merchandise from Japan) was high, but untied aid expanded rapidly in the 1980s, reaching 71% of all aid by 1986. This share compared favorably with other Development Assistance Committee countries and with the United States corresponding figure of 54%. Nevertheless, complaints continued that even Japan's untied aid tended to be directed toward purchases from Japan. Aid in the form of grants (the share of aid disbursed as grants rather than as loans) was low relative to other Development Assistance Committee countries and remained so late in the 1980s.

Bilateral assistance was concentrated in the developing countries of [[Asia]], although modest moves took place in the 1980s to expand the geographical scope of aid. In 1990 some 59.3% of bilateral development assistance was allocated to Asia, 11.4% to [[Africa]], 10.2% to the [[Middle East]], and 8.1% to [[Latin America]]. Asia's share was down somewhat, from 75% in 1975 and 70% in 1980, but still accounted for by far the largest share of bilateral aid. During the 1980s, increased aid went to [[Pakistan]] and [[Egypt]], partly in response to pressure from the United States to provide such aid for strategic purposes. Japan had little involvement in Africa, but the severe drought of the 1980s brought an increase in the share of development assistance for that continent.

The five largest recipients of Japanese ODA in 1990 were in Asia: [[Indonesia]] (US$1.1 billion), [[People's Republic of China]] (US$832 million), [[Thailand]] (US$448.8 million), the [[Philippines]] (US$403.8 million), and [[Bangladesh]] (US$370.6 million). Earlier in the 1980s, China had been the largest single recipient for several successive years. These large aid amounts made Japan the largest single source of development assistance for most Asian countries. For the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[ASEAN]]) countries, for example, Japan supplied 55% of net ODA received in 1987, compared with 11% from the United States and only 10% from the multilateral aid agencies.

The rapid economic growth and rising competitiveness of China readjusted [[Sino-Japanese relations]], and ODA and yen loans to China will gradually phase out until the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].

The largest use of Japan's bilateral aid is for economic [[infrastructure]] ([[transportation]], [[telecommunication|communications]], [[river development]], and energy development), which accounted for 31.5% of the total in 1990. Smaller shares went to development of the production sector (17.1%) and [[social infrastructure]] (19.7%). In general, large construction projects predominate in Japan's bilateral foreign aid. Within the category of social infrastructure, education absorbed 6.7% of the bilateral aid in 1990, water supply and sanitation made up 3.4%, and only 2% went for health. Food aid (0.4% of total bilateral aid in 1990) and debt relief (4.3%) also were included in Japan's official development assistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">The '''Luandi''' ({{zh|t=攣鞮|s=挛鞮|p=Luándī|w=Luant'i}}; alternatively written as '''Xulianti''' {{zh|t=虛連題|s=虚连题|p=Xūliántí}}) was a clan and the ruling dynasty of the ancient [[Xiongnu]] that flourished between 3rd century BCE to 4th century CE. The form '''Luandi''' (挛鞮) comes from [[Hanshu]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=gb&amp;id=67867 Hanshu], chapter 94a, l. 7a&lt;/ref&gt; while the form Xulianti comes from  [[Hou Hanshu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=gb&amp;id=77825 Hou Hanshu], chapter 89, l. 7b&lt;/ref&gt; . [[Anna Dybo]] reconstructed 攣鞮's [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation as ''*r(h)wan-de'' &amp; posits that the clan's name was an Iranic loanword, cognate with [[Saka language|Khotanese]] ''runde'', plural of ''rre'' from ''*rwant-'' "king".&lt;ref&gt;Dybo, Anna (2014), [https://kpfu.ru/portal/docs/F230999094/01.pdf “Early contacts of Turks and problems of Proto-Turkic reconstruction”], in ''Tatarica, 2,'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; There were four other noble tribes: [[Huyan]], [[Xubu]], [[Qiulin]] and [[Lan (tribe)|Lan]].  The Huyan belonged to the dominating left wing, and the Lan and the Xubu belonged to the right wing.&lt;ref&gt;Taskin B.S., "Materials on Sünnu history", Science, Moscow, 1968, p. 130 (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luandi was a clan that held some of the highest positions in the Xiongnu society, including the title of [[chanyu]] within the Xiongnu confederacy. In the confederation, Luandi was a paternal dynastic tribe, [[Huyan]] was an initially maternal dynastic tribe, and Xubu was a subsequently maternal dynastic tribe.  They were the three most prominent tribes ("Houses" in N. Bichurin)&lt;ref&gt;Bichurin N.Ya., ''"Collection of information on peoples in Central Asia in ancient times"'', vol. 1, Sankt Petersburg, 1851, p. 15 ( note 1: ''Huyan'' and ''Xubu'' always were in marital relationship with ''Chanyu''. ''Xubu'' had a post of the State Judge. The custom of taking for the Khan maidens only from the same houses also survived in the Chingis-khan's house.)&lt;/ref&gt; in the Xiongnu.

The earliest prominent figure from the clan itself was perhaps their leader [[Touman]]. Later on, a branch of the Luandi changed their family name to [[Liu]] (劉).

The '''Marshall Islands''', officially the '''Republic of the Marshall Islands''' ({{lang-mh|Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ}}),{{NoteTag|Pronunciations:&lt;br /&gt;* [[English language|English]]: ''Republic of the Marshall Islands'' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Marshall Islands.ogg|ˈ|m|ɑr|ʃ|əl|_|ˈ|aɪ|l|ən|d|z}}&lt;br /&gt;* [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]]: ''{{lang|mh|Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ}}'' ({{IPAc-mh|icon|ha|haw|we|wey|l|yey|P|yay|n|_|ha|haw|wo|woh|r|hoh|K|huy|n|_|mh|hah|ah|J|yeh|lh}})}} are an [[island country]] and a [[United States]] [[associated state]] near the [[equator]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], slightly west of the [[International Date Line]]. Geographically, the country is part of the larger island group of [[Micronesia]]. The country's population of 53,158 people (at the 2011 Census&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;) is spread out over 29 [[coral atoll]]s,&lt;ref name=ciafact&gt;{{cite web |publisher= CIA World Factbook |title=Marshall Islands Geography |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 1,156 individual [[island]]s and [[islet]]s.

The islands share [[Maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] to the west, [[Wake Island]] to the north,{{NoteTag|[[Wake Island]] is claimed as a territory of the Marshall Islands, but is also claimed as an [[Unorganized territory|unorganized]], [[unincorporated territory]] of the United States, with ''de facto'' control vested in the [[Office of Insular Affairs]] (and all military defenses managed by the United States military).}} [[Kiribati]] to the southeast, and [[Nauru]] to the south.

In 2016, 73.3% of the population were defined as being "urban". The UN also indicates a population density of 295 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (765 people per mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and its projected 2020 population is 53,263.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/marshall-islands-population/|title=Marshall Islands Population (2017) - Worldometers|website=Worldometers.info|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micronesian colonists reached the Marshall Islands using canoes circa [[2nd millennium BC]], with interisland navigation made possible using [[Marshall Islands stick chart|traditional stick chart]]s. They eventually settled here.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15598732|title=Marshall Islands profile - Timeline|date=July 31, 2017|accessdate=August 22, 2017|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islands in the archipelago were first explored by [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] in the 1520s, starting with [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese at the service of Spain, [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Miguel de Saavedra. Spanish explorer [[Alonso de Salazar]] reported sighting an atoll in August 1526.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; Other expeditions by Spanish and English ships followed. The islands derive their name from British explorer [[John Marshall (British captain)|John Marshall]], who visited in 1788. The islands were historically known by the inhabitants as "jolet jen Anij" (Gifts from God).&lt;ref name=pacificrisa/&gt;

Spain claimed the islands in 1592, and the European powers recognized its sovereignty over the islands in 1874. They had been part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] formally since 1528. Later, Spain sold some of the islands to the [[German Empire]] in 1885, and they became part of [[German New Guinea]] that year, run by the trading companies doing business in the islands, particularly the Jaluit Company.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; In [[World War I]] the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the Marshall Islands, which in 1920, the [[League of Nations]] combined with other former German territories to form the [[South Pacific Mandate]]. During [[World War II]], the [[United States]] took control of the islands in the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] in 1944. Nuclear testing began in 1946 and concluded in 1958.

The US government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. The [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in 1979 provided independence to the Marshall Islands, whose constitution and president (Amata Kabua) were formally recognized by the US. Full sovereignty or [[Self-government]] was achieved in a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a [[United Nations]] member state since 1991.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; Politically, the Marshall Islands is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with the United States, with the US providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the [[United States Postal Service]]. With few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a [[service economy]], as well as some [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]]; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands' [[gross domestic product]]. The country uses the [[United States dollar]] as its currency.

The majority of the citizens of the Republic of Marshall Islands, formed in 1982, are of Marshallese descent, though there are small numbers of immigrants from the United States, China, [[Philippines]], and other Pacific islands. The two [[official language]]s are [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], which is a member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], and [[English language|English]]. Almost the entire population of the islands practices some religion, with three-quarters of the country either following the [[United Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands]] (UCCCMI) or the [[Assemblies of God]].

{{Main|History of the Marshall Islands}}
{{more citations needed|date=January 2009}}

Evidence suggests that around 3,000 years ago successive waves of human migrants from [[Southeast Asia]] spread across the Western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] populating its many small islands. The Marshall Islands were settled by [[Micronesia]]ns in the 2nd millennium BC. Little is known of the islands' early history.  Early settlers traveled between the islands by canoe using traditional [[stick chart]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/orientation.htm The History of Mankind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110432/http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/orientation.htm |date=September 27, 2013}} by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, Book II, Section A, The Races of Oceania page 165, picture of a stick chart from the Marshall Islands. MacMillan and Co., published 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Alonso de Salazar]] landed there in 1526, and the archipelago came to be known as "''Los Pintados''" ("The Painted (Ones)", possibly referring to the autochthonous people first found there), "''Las Hermanas''" ("The Sisters") and "''Los Jardines''" ("The Gardens") within the [[Spanish Empire]], first falling within the jurisdiction of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]], to then be administered directly by Madrid (through the General Captaincy of Manila in the still-Spanish Philippines) upon the [[Latin American wars of independence|independence of Latin America]] and the dissolution of New Spain starting in 1821.

They were only formally possessed by Spain for much of their colonial history, and were generally considered part of the "[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Islas_Marianas_Palaos_y_Carolinas.JPG Carolines]" (present-day Federated State of Micronesia, Palau, and the US Territories of Marianas and Guam, as well as the Marshall Islands themselves), or alternatively the "Nuevas Filipinas" ("New Philippines"). The islands were mostly left to their own affairs except for short-lived religious missions (documented in 1668 and 1731) during the 16th and 17th centuries. They were largely ignored by European powers except for cartographic demarcation treaties between the Iberian Empires (Portugal and Castilian Spain) in 1529, 1750 and 1777. The archipelago corresponding to the present-day country was independently named by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]], after [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[explorer]] [[John Marshall (British captain)|John Marshall]], who visited them together with [[Thomas Gilbert (captain)|Thomas Gilbert]] in 1788, en route from [[Botany Bay]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (two ships of the [[First Fleet]]), and started establishing German and British trading posts, not formally contested by Spain.

The Marshall Islands were formally claimed by Spain in 1874 through its capital in the East Indies, [[Manila]], marking the start of several strategic moves by the [[German Empire|Second Reich]] during the 1870s and 80s to annex them (claiming them to be "by chance unoccupied"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repositorio.uc.cl/bitstream/handle/11534/9719/000319582.pdf?sequence=1|title=LA CUESTION DE LAS ISLAS CAROLINAS.

This policy would culminate in a tense naval episode in 1885, which did not degenerate into a conflict due to the poor readiness of Spain's naval forces and the unwillingness for open military action from the German side.

Following [[papal]] mediation and German compensation of $4.5 million, Spain reached an agreement with Germany in 1885: the 1885 Hispano-German Protocol of Rome. This accord established a [[protectorate]] and set up trading stations on the islands of [[Jaluit]] (Joló) and [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]] to carry out the flourishing [[copra]] (dried [[coconut]] meat) trade. Marshallese [[Iroij]] (high chiefs) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration, rendered tacitly effective by the wording in the 1885 Protocol, which demarcated an area subject to Spanish sovereignty (0-11ºN, 133-164ºE) omitting the Eastern Carolines, that is, the Marshall and Gilbert archipelagos, where most of the German trading posts were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El conflicto sobre las Islas Carolinas entre España y Alemania (1885): la mediación internacional de León XIII|last=Corral|first=Carlos|publisher=Editorial Complutense|year=1995|isbn=9788474914849|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disputes were rendered moot after the selling of the whole Caroline archipelago to Germany 13 years later.

At the beginning of [[World War I]], [[Japan]] assumed control of the Marshall Islands. The Japanese headquarters was established at the German center of administration, [[Jaluit]]. On January 31, 1944 American forces landed on [[Kwajalein]] [[atoll]] and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on February 3, following intense fighting on Kwajalein and [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] atolls. In 1947, the United States, as the occupying power, entered into an agreement with the [[UN Security Council]] to administer much of [[Micronesia]], including the Marshall Islands, as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

From 1946 to 1958, it served as the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] for the United States and was the site of 67 [[nuclear test]]s on various atolls. The world's first [[hydrogen bomb]], codenamed "[[Ivy Mike|Mike]]", was tested at the [[Enewetak]] atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, (local date) in 1952, by the United States.

Nuclear testing began in 1946 on [[Bikini Atoll]] after residents were evacuated. Over the years, 67 weapon tests were conducted, including the 15-megaton Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test, which produced significant fallout in the region. The testing concluded in 1958. Over the years, just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the US government, and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. Many of the islanders and their descendants still live in exile, as the islands remain contaminated with high levels of radiation.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/02/bikini-atoll-nuclear-test-60-years|title=Bikini Atoll nuclear test: 60 years later and islands still unliveable|first=Agence|last=France-Press|date=March 1, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant [[radar]] installation was constructed on [[Kwajalein]] atoll.

On May 1, 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands, the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]]. The constitution incorporates both American and British constitutional concepts.

There have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the 1999 parliamentary election, taking control of the presidency and cabinet.

The islands signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received [[United States dollar|US$]]180M for continued American use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250M in compensation for [[nuclear test]]ing, and US$600M in other payments under the compact.

Despite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij. It was not until 1999, following [[political corruption]] allegations, that the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] government was overthrown, with [[Imata Kabua]] replaced by the [[commoner]] [[Kessai Note]].

Twenty-four of the atolls and islands are inhabited. Atolls are uninhabited due to poor living conditions, lack of rain, or nuclear contamination. The uninhabited atolls are:

* [[Ailinginae Atoll]]
* [[Bikar Atoll|Bikar (Bikaar) Atoll]]

* [[Bokak Atoll]]
* [[Erikub Atoll]]

The average altitude above sea level for the entire country is {{convert|7|feet}}.&lt;ref name="rmiembassyus.org"/&gt;

===Shark sanctuary===

In October 2011, the government declared that an area covering nearly {{convert|2000000|km2|sqmi|-3|sp=us}} of ocean shall be reserved as a [[shark sanctuary]]. This is the world's largest shark sanctuary, extending the worldwide ocean area in which sharks are protected from {{convert|2700000|to|4600000|km2|sqmi|-3|sp=us}}. In protected waters, all shark fishing is banned and all [[bycatch|by-catch]] must be released. However, some have questioned the ability of the Marshall Islands to enforce this zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15142472 |title=Vast shark sanctuary created in Pacific |publisher=BBC News |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial claim on Wake Island===

The Marshall Islands also lays claim to [[Wake Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|wq|Wake Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Wake has been administered by the [[United States]] since 1899, the Marshallese government refers to it by the name ''Enen-kio''.

===Climate===

[[File:ClimateMajuroMarshallIslands.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Average monthly temperatures (red) and precipitation (blue) on [[Majuro]].]]
The climate has a [[dry season]] from December to April and a [[wet season]] from May to November. Many Pacific [[typhoon]]s begin as tropical storms in the Marshall Islands region, and grow stronger as they move west toward the [[Mariana Islands]] and the [[Philippines]].

Due to its very low elevation, the Marshall Islands are threatened by the potential effects of [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=storm-surges-rising-seas-could-doom-pacific-islands-this-century|title=Storm Surges, Rising Seas Could Doom Pacific Islands This Century|author=Julia Pyper, ClimateWire|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/02/world/The-Marshall-Islands-Are-Disappearing.html|title=The Marshall Islands Are Disappearing|date=December 2, 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the president of [[Nauru]], the Marshall Islands are the most endangered nation in the world due to flooding from [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Marcus | authorlink=Marcus Stephen| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+sinking+feeling%3A+why+is+the+president+of+the+tiny+Pacific+island...-a0273079165

([[Majuro]], the capital atoll, elects five senators.) The President, who is head of state as well as head of government, is elected by the 33 senators of the Nitijela. Four of the five Marshallese presidents who have been elected since the Constitution was adopted in 1979 have been traditional [[paramount chief]]s.&lt;ref name=mv&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Giff Johnson]] |title=Huge funeral recognizes late Majuro chief |url=http://mvariety.com/2010112432258/local-news/huge-funeral-recognizes-late-majuro-chief.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110714141135/http://mvariety.com/2010112432258/local-news/huge-funeral-recognizes-late-majuro-chief.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 14, 2011|work=[[Marianas Variety News &amp; Views]] |date=November 25, 2010 |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, senator Hilda Heine was elected by Parliament as the first female president of the Marshall Islands; previous president [[Casten Nemra]] lost office after serving two weeks in a vote of [[no confidence]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

Legislative power lies with the Nitijela. The upper house of Parliament, called the '''Council of Iroij''', is an advisory body comprising twelve tribal chiefs. The executive branch consists of the President and the Presidential Cabinet, which consists of ten ministers appointed by the President with the approval of the Nitijela. The twenty-four electoral districts into which the country is divided correspond to the inhabited islands and [[atoll]]s. There are currently four political parties in the Marshall Islands: [[Aelon̄ Kein Ad]] (AKA), [[United People's Party (Marshall Islands)|United People's Party]] (UPP), [[Kien Eo Am]] (KEA) and [[United Democratic Party (Marshall Islands)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP). Rule is shared by the AKA and the UDP. The following senators are in the legislative body:

{{further|Foreign relations of the Marshall Islands|Compact of Free Association}}
The Compact of Free Association with the United States gives the U.S. sole responsibility for international defense of the Marshall Islands. It gives islanders the right to emigrate to the United States and to work there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/02/world/The-Marshall-Islands-Are-Disappearing.html|title=The Marshall Islands Are Disappearing |first1=Coral|last1=Davenport|first2=Josh|last2=Haner|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2015, the [[Iranian navy]] seized the Marshall Island-flagged [[MV Maersk Tigris|MV ''Maersk Tigris'']] near the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. The ship had been chartered by Germany's Rickmers Ship Management, which stated that the ship contained no special cargo and no military weapons. The ship was reported to be under the control of the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] according to [[the Pentagon]]. Tensions escallated in the region due to the intensifying of [[Saudi–Yemeni War|Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen]]. The Pentagon reported that the destroyer [[USS Farragut (DDG-99)|USS ''Farragut'']] and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship ''Tigris'' and it was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained. [[US Defense Department|US defense]] officials have said that they would review U.S. defense obligations to the Government of the Marshall Islands in the wake of recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as "inappropriate". It was reported in May 2015 that [[Tehran]] would release the ship after it paid a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/marshall-islands-ship-seized-by-iran-2015-4|title=Marshall Islands ship seized by Iran – Business Insider|author=Armin Rosen|date=April 29, 2015 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-to-release-cargo-vessel-after-it-pays-fine-2015-5|title=Iran to release cargo vessel after it pays fine – Business Insider|date=May 6, 2015|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991 the [[Republic of Marshall Islands Sea Patrol]], a division of [[Marshall Islands Police]], has operated the 160 ton patrol vessel [[RMIS Lomor (03)|RMIS ''Lomor'']]. ''Lomor'' is one of 22 [[Pacific Forum patrol vessel]]s [[Australia]] provided to smaller nations in the [[Pacific Forum]].  While some other nations' missions for their vessels include sovereignty, protection, the terms of the Compact of Free Association restrict ''Lomor'' to civilian missions, like fishery protection and [[search and rescue]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Marshall Islands}}
[[File:Marshall Islands treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Marshall Islands's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]

The islands have few natural resources, and their imports far exceed exports. According to the CIA, the value of exports in 2013 was approximately $53.7 million while estimated imports were $133.7 million. Agricultural products include coconuts, tomatoes, melons, taro, breadfruit, fruits, pigs and chickens. Industry is made of the production of copra and craft items, tuna processing and tourism. The GDP in 2016 was an estimated $180 million, with a real growth rate of 1.7%. The GDP per capita was $3,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/marshall_islands/marshall_islands_economy.html|title=Marshall Islands Economy 2017, CIA World Factbook|website=Theodora.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] reported in mid-2016 that the economy of the Republic had expanded by about 0.5 percent in the Fiscal Year 2015 thanks to an improved fisheries sector. A surplus of 3% of GDP was recorded "owing to record-high fishing license fees. Growth is expected to rise to about 1.5 percent and inflation to about 0.5 percent in FY2016, as the effects of the drought in earlier 2016 are offset by the resumption of infrastructure projects."&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Republic-of-the-Marshall-Islands-2016-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-44150|title=Republic of the Marshall Islands : 2016 Article IV Consultation-Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Republic of the Marshall Islands|website=Imf.org|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Republic of Marshall Islands passed the [[Sovereign Currency Act of 2018|Sovereign Currency Act]], which made it the first country to issue their own [[cryptocurrency]] and certify it as legal tender; the currency is called the "sovereign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-marshall-islands/marshall-islands-to-issue-own-sovereign-cryptocurrency-idUSKCN1GC2UD|title=Marshall Islands to issue own sovereign cryptocurrency|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipping ===
The Marshall Islands plays a vital role in the international shipping industry as a [[flag of convenience]] for commercial vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/business/international/marshall-islands-shipping-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html|title=Marshall Islands, the Flag for Many Ships, Seeks to Rein In Emissions|last=Galbraith|first=Kate|date=June 3, 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 3, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104014023/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/business/international/marshall-islands-shipping-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html|archive-date=January 4, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marshallese registry began operations in 1990, and is managed through a joint venture with International Registries, Inc., a US-based corporation that has offices in major shipping centers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-shipping-law-review-edition-4/1144034/marshall-islands|title=Marshall Islands - The Shipping Law Review - Edition 4 - The Law Reviews|website=thelawreviews.co.uk|language=en|accessdate=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104022404/http://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-shipping-law-review-edition-4/1144034/marshall-islands|archive-date=January 4, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the Marshallese ship registry was the second largest in the world, after that of [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/news/europe/marshall-islands-becomes-the-world-s-second-largest-ship-registry.html|title=Marshall Islands becomes the world's second largest ship registry|last=Hand|first=Marcus|date=March 22, 2017|work=Seatrade Maritime News|accessdate=January 3, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815151641/http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/news/europe/marshall-islands-becomes-the-world-s-second-largest-ship-registry.html|archive-date=August 15, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some flag countries, there is no requirement that a Marshallese flag vessel be owned by a Marshallese individual or corporation. Following the 2015 seizure of the ''[[MV Maersk Tigris]]'', the United States announced that its treaty obligation to defend the Marshall Islands did not extend to foreign-owned Marshallese flag vessels at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/01/u-s-treaty-obligation-to-defend-marshall-islands-ships/|title=U.S. treaty obligation to defend Marshall Islands ships|last=Kopel|first=David|date=May 1, 2015|work=Washington Post|accessdate=January 3, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013825/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/01/u-s-treaty-obligation-to-defend-marshall-islands-ships/|archive-date=January 4, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of ship-to-ship transfers by Marshallese flag tanker vessels, the Marshall Islands have statistically been one of the largest importers of crude oil from the United States, despite the fact that the islands have no oil refining capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oil-marshall-islands/how-the-marshall-islands-became-a-top-u-s-crude-export-destination-idUSL8N1AT07P|title=How the Marshall Islands became a top U.S. crude export destination|last=|first=|date=2016-08-12|work=Reuters|accessdate=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104073406/https://www.reuters.com/article/oil-marshall-islands/how-the-marshall-islands-became-a-top-u-s-crude-export-destination-idUSL8N1AT07P|archive-date=January 4, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour===
In 2007, the Marshall Islands joined the [[International Labour Organization]], which means its labour laws will comply with international benchmarks. This may impact business conditions in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Media_and_public_information/Press_releases/lang--en/WCMS_083235/index.htm |title=Republic of the Marshall Islands becomes 181st ILO member State |publisher=Ilo.org |date=July 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724051220/http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Media_and_public_information/Press_releases/lang--en/WCMS_083235/index.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===

The [[income tax]] has two brackets, with rates of 8% and 12%.&lt;ref name="rmiparliament.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rmiparliament.org/cms/legislation/current/by-title.html?view=acts_by_category |title=Official Homepage of the NITIJELA (PARLIAMENT)|publisher=NITIJELA (PARLIAMENT) of the Republic of the Marshall Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[corporate tax]] is 3% of revenue.&lt;ref name="rmiparliament.org"/&gt;

===Foreign assistance===

[[United States government]] assistance is the mainstay of the economy. Under terms of the Amended [[Compact of Free Association]], the U.S. is committed to provide US$57.7 million per year in assistance to the Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2013, and then US$62.7 million through 2023, at which time a trust fund, made up of U.S. and RMI contributions, will begin perpetual annual payouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/Firstpginfo/laws/public%20law%20108-188,%20December%2017,%202003.pdf |title=COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2003 |format=PDF |work=Public Law 108–188, 108th Congress |date=December 17, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026023104/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Firstpginfo/laws/public%20law%20108-188%2C%20December%2017%2C%202003.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army]] maintains the [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site]] on [[Kwajalein]] Atoll. Marshallese land owners receive rent for the base.

===Agriculture===

===Industry===
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and [[copra]].

===Fishing===
Majuro is the world's busiest [[tuna]] transshipment port in the world, with 704 transshipments totaling 444,393 tons in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.undercurrentnews.com/2016/10/13/marshall-islands-majuro-is-worlds-tuna-hub/|title=Marshall Islands’ Majuro is world’s tuna hub|work=Undercurrent News|access-date=January 5, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majuro is also a tuna processing center; the Pan Pacific Foods plant exports processed tuna to a number of countries, primarily the United States under the [[Bumble Bee Foods|Bumble Bee]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mh.usembassy.gov/majuro-tuna-plant-exports-world-wide/|title=Majuro Tuna Plant Exports World-Wide|last=|first=|date=November 23, 2012|work=U.S. Embassy in the Republic of the Marshall Islands|accessdate=January 5, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106063625/https://mh.usembassy.gov/majuro-tuna-plant-exports-world-wide/|archive-date=January 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing license fees, primarily for tuna, provide noteworthy income for the government.&lt;ref name="imf.org" /&gt;

In 1999, a private company built a tuna loining plant with more than 400 employees, mostly women. But the plant closed in 2005 after a failed attempt to convert it to produce tuna steaks, a process that requires half as many employees. Operating costs exceeded revenue, and the plant's owners tried to partner with the government to prevent closure. But government officials personally interested in an economic stake in the plant refused to help. After the plant closed, it was taken over by the government, which had been the guarantor of a $2 million loan to the business.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Energy===
On September 15, 2007, Witon Barry (of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of [[Majuro]]) said power authorities, private companies, and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with [[coconut oil]] as alternative to [[diesel fuel]] for [[vehicles]], [[electricity generation|power generators]], and [[ships]]. Coconut [[tree]]s abound in the Pacific's [[tropical]] [[islands]].

==Education==

The [[Ministry of Education (Marshall Islands)|Ministry of Education]] is the education agency of the islands. [[Marshall Islands Public School System]] operates the state schools in the Marshall Islands.

In the 1994-1995 school year the country had 103 elementary schools and 13 secondary schools. There were 27 private elementary schools and 1 private high school. Christian groups operated most of the private schools.&lt;ref name=McMurrayetalp127&gt;McMurray, Christine and Roy Smith. ''Diseases of Globalization: Socioeconomic Transition and Health''.

Historically the Marshallese population was taught in English first with Marshallese instruction coming later, but this was reversed in the 1990s to keep the islands' cultural heritage and so children could write in Marshallese. Now English language instruction begins in grade 3. Christine McMurray and Roy Smith wrote in ''Diseases of Globalization: Socioeconomic Transition and Health'' that this could potentially weaken the children's English skills.&lt;ref name=McMurrayetalp127/&gt;

The '''perun''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: ''Перун'', older spelling: ''Перунъ'') was the [[currency]] that was planned for introduction in [[Montenegro]] by [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]] in 1851. However, he died the same year, and Montenegro remained without a currency until the 1906 introduction of the [[Montenegrin perper|perper]] by [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]]. It was named after [[Perun]], whom Njegoš considered to be the supreme god of [[Slavic mythology]]. If introduced, one Perun would have had equal value to two [[thaler]]s. Montenegro later used the [[Austria]]n currencies until 1906 when [[Montenegro]] started using the [[Montenegrin perper]].

[[Image:Niger saharan medieval trade routes.PNG|thumb|750px|center|Saharan trade routes circa 1400, with the modern territory of [[Niger]] highlighted]]
* [[Spanish Sahara]] &amp;ndash; name used for the modern territory of Western Sahara when it was ruled as a colonial territory by Spain between 1884 and 1975.
** [[Ifni War]] &amp;ndash; series of armed incursions into Spanish West Africa by Moroccan insurgents and Sahrawi rebels that began in October 1957 and culminated with the abortive siege of Sidi Ifni.
** [[Polisario Front]] emerges &amp;ndash; formally constituted on May 10, 1973 with the express intention of militarily forcing an end to Spanish colonization.
*** [[El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed]] &amp;ndash; first Secretary General of the Polisario Front.
** [[Green March]] &amp;ndash; strategic mass demonstration in November 1975, coordinated by the Moroccan government, to force Spain to hand over the disputed, autonomous semi-metropolitan Spanish Province of Sahara to Morocco. The demonstration of some 350,000 Moroccans advanced several miles into the Western Sahara territory, escorted by near 20,000 Moroccan troops, and meeting very little response by the Sahrawi Polisario Front.
** [[Madrid Accords]] &amp;ndash; treaty between Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania to end the Spanish presence in the territory of Spanish Sahara, which was until the Madrid Accords' inception a Spanish province and former colony.
** [[Tropas Nómadas]] &amp;ndash; auxiliary regiment to the colonial army in Spanish Sahara composed of Sahrawi tribesmen, equipped with small arms and led by Spanish officers, guarding outposts and sometimes conducting patrols on camelback. Following the Spanish Government's decision to hand over the territory to Morocco and Mauritania towards the end of 1975, numbers of them deserted. Many of the Tropas Nómadas soldiers are believed to have joined Polisario and Spanish-trained fighters formed the core of the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army set up to fight Morocco and Mauritania after the Green March.
** [[1975 United Nations visiting mission to Spanish Sahara]] &amp;ndash; United Nations General Assembly in 1975 dispatched a visiting mission to the territory and the surrounding countries, in accordance with its resolution 3292 (December 13, 1974), to assist in the decolonization process.

*** [[Sahrawi refugee camps]] &amp;ndash; set up in the Tindouf Province, Algeria in 1975-76 for Sahrawi refugees fleeing from Moroccan forces.  With most refugees still living in the camps, the refugee situation is among the most protracted ones worldwide.
*** [[First Battle of Amgala (1976)]] &amp;ndash; Units from the Algerian Army were attacked by units from the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces on the night of 27 January.  Algeria claimed their troops were providing food and medical supplies to refugees at Amgala, while Morocco said the Algerian troops were heavily armed and were aiding Polisario.
*** [[Settlement Plan]] &amp;ndash; agreement made in 1991 between the Polisario Front and Morocco on the organization of a referendum, which would constitute an expression of self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, leading either to full independence, or integration with the kingdom of Morocco. It resulted in a cease-fire which remains in effect (more or less) to this day.
*** [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 690]] &amp;ndash; adopted unanimously on 29 April 1991, established MINURSO (see below) to implement the Settlement Plan (see above).

[[File:Kosice (Slovakia) - St. Elizabeth's Catedral 2.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[St. Elisabeth Cathedral]] in [[Košice]]]]

The Major Seminary - [[St Charles Borromeo Seminary]] is at the very heart of the Archdiocese of Košice. It is located in downtown Košice, just walking distance from [[St. Elisabeth Cathedral]]. It has been forming Roman Catholic seminarians since 1994. 

==History==
It was first created in 1804 under name Diocese of Košice as a suffragan to the [[Archdiocese of Eger]]. In 1977, the metropolitan was changed to the newly established [[Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava|ecclesiastical province of Trnava]]. On 31 March 1995, a new [[ecclesiastical province]] was created, changing the status of the diocese into archdiocese with the suffragans of [[Diocese of Spiš|Spiš]] and [[Diocese of Rožňava|Rožňava]].

'''Shridhar Chillal''' (born 1938) is an [[Indian people|Indian]] man who held the [[world record]] for the longest [[nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] ever reached on a single [[hand]], with a combined length of 909.6 centimeters (358.1 inches). Chillal's longest single nail is his thumbnail, measuring 197.8 centimeters (77.87 inches). He stopped cutting his nails in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swatman|first1=Rachel|title=Check out the longest fingernails ever in Shridhar Chillal's Record Holder Profile Video|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/9/record-holder-profile-video-shridhar-chillal-and-the-longest-fingernails-ever-398817|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=Guinness World Records|date=29 September 2015|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although proud of his record breaking nails, Chillal has faced increasing difficulties due to their weight, including [[disfigurement]] of his fingers and loss of function in his left hand. [[Nerve injury|Nerve damage]] caused from the nails' immense weight has also caused [[Hearing loss|deafness]] in Chillal's left ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Record fingernails go under the hammer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/11/lukeharding|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=The Guardian|date=11 December 2000|location=New Delhi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chillal has appeared in films and television displaying his nails, such as ''[[Jackass 2.5]]''.

On 11 July 2018, Chillal had his fingernails cut with a power tool at the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] museum in [[New York City]], where the nails will be put on display. A technician wearing protective gear cut the nails during a "nail clipping ceremony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mahdawi|first1=Arwa|title=Nails in the coffin: man with world's longest fingernails finally cuts them off|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/longest-fingernails-shridhar-chillal-cut-off|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=The Guardian|date=12 July 2018|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States Navy operations during World War I'''  began on April 6, 1917, after the formal [[American entry into World War I|declaration of war]] on the [[German Empire]]. The [[United States|American]] navy focused on countering enemy [[U-boat]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while convoying men and supplies to [[France]] and [[Italy]]. Because of United States' late entry into the war, her [[capital ship]]s never engaged the German fleet, and few decisive submarine actions occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 861–865.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
=== Atlantic Ocean ===
The main theater of [[World War I]] was the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In order to relieve the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Europe]]an allies already on the battle front, the United States Navy was tasked with transporting millions of American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic to France. The [[United States Navy]] was ill-prepared for war, and the only solution was to begin deploying whatever was available on convoy duty and arming merchantmen with small [[naval gun]]s manned by [[United States Navy Armed Guard|armed guard]] detachments.

Congress declared war on April 6, 1917, which meant the [[United States Coast Guard]] automatically became a part of the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].{{#tag:ref|Under the January 28, 1915 act creating the Coast Guard from the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] the Coast Guard comes under orders of the Secretary of the Navy when Congress declares war or when the President directs such an action to be taken. (U.S. Congress, "Act to Create the Coast Guard", ''Congressional Record'', 63rd Congress, 3rd session, 1915, volume 2, part 2.)&lt;ref name=Larzelere7-8&gt;Larzelere, pp 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} [[Destroyer]]s and similar escort warships were considered the most effective means of sinking enemy submarines and protecting merchantmen. Therefore, destroyer squadrons were based in the [[British Isles]] at major ports including [[Cobh|Queenston]], [[Ireland]]. The capital ships took up positions with the British [[Royal Navy]] in the [[North Sea]] for an uneventful [[Blockade of Germany|blockade]] of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] that would last even after the armistice into 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 863–865.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Action of 15 October 1917|victory]] for the United States Navy took place in the Atlantic on October 15, 1917. The destroyer {{USS|Cassin|DD-43|6}}, commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] W. N. Vernon, encountered [[SM U-61|''U-61'']] off [[Mine Head]], Ireland. After chasing the U-boat for an hour, U-61 turned around and fired a single [[torpedo]], which struck ''Cassin'' on port the side. [[Gunner's Mate]] [[Petty Officer First Class|First Class]] [[Osmond Ingram]] noticed the torpedo just before it struck and alarmed the [[K-gun]] crew, who began firing [[depth charge]]s. ''Cassin'' was heavily damaged, but her crew kept her afloat and continued firing. Ingram was killed and later was to receive the [[Medal of Honor]], while nine others were wounded. ''Cassin'' struck ''U-61''{{'}}s conning tower, which forced her crew to disengage and retreat.&lt;ref name=NHHCcassin&gt;"Cassin", DANFS, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:U-58 captured 1917.jpg|left|thumb|German officers and crewmen evacuating the [[SM U-58|''U-58'']] on November 17, 1917.]]

On November 17, 1917, two destroyers became the first U.S. Navy ships to sink an enemy submarine. {{USS|Fanning|DD-37|6}} and {{USS|Nicholson|DD-52|6}} were escorting convoy OQ-20 eastbound, when a lookout sighted the periscope of [[SM U-58|''U-58'']]. The U-boat was forced to surface by depth charges and was subsequently defeated in a brief surface engagement. At least one shot from ''Nicholson'' struck the u-boat, killing two men and causing heavy damage. The thirty-nine survivors abandoned the sinking ''U-58'' and were taken prisoner. [[Lieutenant]]s [[Frank Berrien]] and [[Arthur S. Carpender]] both received the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B07E7D71E3AE433A25753C3A9649D946696D6CF | work=The New York Times | title=TELLS WHOLE STORY OF SINKING U-BOAT; Destroyers Fanning and Nicholson Dropped Depth Charges, Bringing Submarine to Surface SANK IN A FEW MINUTES Four Officers and 35 sailors Surrender and Receive Chivalrous Treatment--British Praise.

Four United States Navy ships were lost during World War I, only two by enemy action, though six merchant ships with armed guards aboard were also destroyed. The first combat loss was {{USS|Jacob Jones|DD-61|6}}, a destroyer, which was sailing to Ireland in a zig-zag pattern with five other warships from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. On December 17, ''Kapitänleutnant'' [[Hans Rose]] of [[SM U-53|''U-53'']] sighted the destroyer and attacked with a spread of torpedoes. One was spotted by the Americans, but despite taking evasive action, she was fatally damaged. [[Commander]] [[David W. Bagley]] ordered his crew to abandon ship, and as she sank the armed depth charges aboard began to detonate, adding to the already heavy casualties. Sixty-six of her crew were killed, and more injured; only thirty-eight survived. ''Jacob Jones'' was the first American destroyer ever lost in battle, and she went down within eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Feuer, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHHCjacobjones&gt;"Jacob Jones", DANFS, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest loss of life for the U.S. Navy during the war was on the [[collier (ship type)|collier]] [[USS Cyclops (AC-4)|USS ''Cyclops'']] in March 1918. She left [[Barbados]] on 4 March 1918 bound for [[Baltimore, Maryland]], but was never seen again. She may have been sunk by a German submarine, but it is more likely that she capsized because of the shifting of her cargo of coal. ''Cyclops'' was lost with 236 crewmen and passengers.

Three [[United States Army]] and navy transports, [[USS Henry R. Mallory (ID-1280)|USAT ''Henry R. Mallory'']], [[USS Tenadores (1913)|USAT ''Tenadores'']] and {{USS|Mercury|ID-3012|6}}, received credit for [[Action of 4 April 1918|defeating a U-boat on April 4, 1918]]. Sailing back to the United States from France, a U-boat surfaced at 11:45 and fired her torpedoes at the ''Mallory''. Lookouts spotted the tracks, and the ship was able to evade the torpedo. The submarine was then spotted, and all three ships opened fire with their main guns, hitting the u-boat as it submerged. The Americans began dropping depth charges, but the unknown u-boat was not seen again.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Christabel star.jpg|right|thumb|{{USS|Christabel|SP-162|6}}{{'}}s white star, the symbol for a U-boat kill.]]

The [[auxiliary cruiser|auxiliary]] [[yacht]] {{USS|Christabel|SP-162|6}} [[Action of 21 May 1918|engaged on May 21]] the [[SM UC-56|''UC-56'']] twice off the coast of [[Spain]] while escorting a British merchantman.&lt;ref name=NHHCchristabel&gt;"Christabel", DANFS, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;
That afternoon an oil slick was spotted by ''Christabel''{{'}}s crew and later was spotted the wake of the submarine. Depth charges were dropped, but the submarine escaped, and returned to harass the convoy that night. At about 11:00pm lookouts on ''Cristabel'' sighted a periscope and immediately maneuvered to fire depth charges. Several successive hits damaged the U-boat, but it escaped and had to cruise on the surface to [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] to prevent its sinking. The crew of ''UC-56'' were interned by Spain, but the U-boat was scuttled rather than be handed over. During the action, a few depth charges became loose aboard ''Christabel'', and at great personal risk [[Ensign]] [[Daniel Augustus Joseph Sullivan]] secured them, earning him the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name=NHHCsullivan&gt;Lieutenant Commander Daniel A.J. Sullivan, USNRF, (1884–1941)", Online Library – People, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June the British [[ocean liner]] {{SS|Dwinsk||6}} was [[Action of 18 June 1918|attacked]] by [[SM U-151|''U-151'']] about 400 miles east of the [[Bermudas]]. Twenty-two crewmen were lost, but the rest survived in the [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]]. The U-boat remained in the area to use the lifeboats as bait for Allied ships. A few hours, later the auxiliary cruiser [[SS Kronprinz Wilhelm|USS ''Von Steuben'']] arrived and found the lifeboats. But before she reached, them a torpedo was spotted. Two guns opened fire, one on the incoming torpedo and the other on ''U-151''{{'}}s periscope. The cruiser also began evasive maneuvers and the torpedo missed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/v/von-steuben-i.html |title= Von Steuben I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SM U-156|''U-156'']], under Richard Feldt, [[Attack on Orleans|raided]] the port of [[Orleans, Massachusetts]], on the morning of July 18. Feldt surfaced in the dark and positioned his boat off [[Nauset Beach]]. He then began shelling the civilian [[tugboat]] {{SS|Perth Amboy||6}} and four wooden [[barge]]s with his deck gun. All five targets were destroyed. A few shells missed and struck shore, becoming the first enemy shells on the continental United States since the 1846 [[Siege of Fort Texas]] at the beginning of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]]. Nine Coast Guard [[Curtiss HS]] [[seaplane]]s spotted the U-boat and dropped bombs on her, but all failed to detonate.&lt;ref name=Larzelere135&gt;Larzelere, p 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, [[USS California (ACR-6)|USS ''San Diego'']] suffered an explosion while sailing from the [[Portsmouth Naval Yard]] to [[New York City]]. The [[armored cruiser]] was northeast of [[Fire Island]] when it is thought torpedo struck her port side below the waterline at the engine room below. The damage prevented a water tight hatch from sealing and the engine room and fire room No. 9 both flooded in minutes. [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Harley H. Christy]] was convinced he was under a U-boat attack and ordered his men to battle stations. They began firing at anything that even vaguely resembled a periscope. When it was clear the ship could not be saved, Captain Christy gave the order to abandon ship. Twenty-eight minutes after the explosion, ''San Diego'' slipped under the waves, taking six crewmen with her. There was later some controversy over the sinking, as no U-boat was reported in the area. Eventually, the sinking was blamed on a [[sea mine]] possibly laid by ''U-156''. USS ''San Diego'' was the only U.S. Navy capital ship lost in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/california-ii.html |title= California II}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Mount Vernon torpedoed.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie|USS '' Mount Vernon'']] on September 5 after being torpedoed.]]
The only [[lightvessel]] of the lost in combat was [[Diamond Shoal Lightship No. 71 (LV-71)|Diamond Shoal Lightship No. 71]]. On August 6, she was patrolling off North Carolina's [[Diamond Shoals]] when she encounter a sinking [[cargo ship]], {{SS|Merak||6}}, a victim of [[SM U-140|''U-140'']]. The survivors were rescued, and ''LV-71''{{'}}s captain, Master Walter Barnett, sent out a warning to friendly that a U-boat was in the area. "U-140" intercepted the message and returned. Upon arrival, she surfaced and Commander [[Waldemar Kophamel]] demanded the Americans abandon the lightship. As ''LV-71'' was unarmed, her crew had no choice but to row ashore in their boat, while the U-boat destroyed ship with its deck gun. There were no casualties on either side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131030004612/http://www.outer-banks.com/hatteraskeepers/lightship.asp |archivedate= 2013-10-30 |url= http://www.outer-banks.com/hatteraskeepers/lightship.asp |title= Diamond Shoals Lightships |website= North Carolina's Outer Banks }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?22426 |title= SS Merak (+1918) |website= Wrecksite.eu |accessdate= 19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messimer, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie|USS '' Mount Vernon'']] was a German-owned ocean liner that was seized and armed by the United States Navy. On the morning of September 5, 1918, ''Mount Vernon'' was off the coast of France accompanied by four destroyers, when the periscope of [[SM U-82|''U-82'']] was sighted. The auxiliary cruiser immediately [[Action of 5 September 1918|opened fire]] with her main guns, damaging the submarine. However, ''U-82'' managed to fire a torpedo. ''Mount Vernon'' tried to dodge the torpedo, but was unsuccessful. Thirty-six sailors were killed and thirteen wounded, but the ship was saved. {{USS|Winslow|DD-53|6}}, {{USS|Conner|DD-72|6}}, {{USS|Wainwright|DD-62|6}} and USS ''Nicholson'' all dropped depth charges, but the U-boat got safely away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/m/mount-vernon-iii.html |title= Mount Vernon III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Sea ===
With the encouragement of [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/policy-and-ideasroosevelt-historyfdr/early-political-career|title=Early Political Career|publisher=Roosevelt Institute|accessdate=2012-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115082124/http://rooseveltinstitute.org/policy-and-ideasroosevelt-historyfdr/early-political-career|archive-date=2015-01-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States manufactured 100,000 [[naval mine]]s for the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] to prevent U-boats from reaching Atlantic shipping lanes.  The United States North Sea Mine Force commanded by Rear Admiral [[Joseph Strauss (admiral)|Joseph Strauss]] aboard the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force flagship USS {{USS|Black Hawk|AD-9|2}} laid the new type of mine in deeper water than had ever before been mined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/nsminebr.htm|title=The North Sea Mine Barrage|publisher=The Great War Society|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rear Admiral]] [[Lewis Clinton-Baker]], commanding the Royal Navy minelaying force at the time, described the barrage as the "biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history."  The official statistics on lost German submarines compiled on 1 March 1919 credited the North Sea mine barrage with the certain destruction of four U-boats, probable destruction of two more, and possible destruction of another two.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, Reginald Rowan ''The Yankee mining squadron; or, Laying the North Sea mining barrage'' (1920) United States Naval Institute pp.5,15,18-22,27-36,43-47,56,82-83,101&amp;108&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mediterranean Sea ===
American naval operations in the Mediterranean took the form of escorting convoys and delivering supplies. The Mediterranean was not without enemies, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces in northern Italy and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were two major threats though by 1917 their navies were mostly defeated or blockaded by ships of the [[Otranto Barrage]]. Other than the land [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], the Americans engaged in only two memorable battles in the Mediterranean theater.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was when {{USS|Lydonia|SP-700|6}} together with {{HMS|Basilisk|1910|6}} [[Action of 8 May 1918|sank]] a U-boat off [[Algiers]] on May 8, 1918. ''Lydonia'' and ''Basilisk'' were steaming with a convoy from [[Bizerte]] to [[Gibraltar]] when they came across the German submarine {{SMU|UB-70||2}}. A coordinated depth charge attack ensued but the Germans were able to torpedo the British merchant ship {{SS|Ingleside||6}}, which sank. After a fifteen-minute running battle, the depth charging was stopped and survivors of the ''Ingleside'' were rescued. Heavy seas prevented an immediate assessment of possible damage to the submarine but later evaluations credited USS ''Lydonia'' and HMS ''Basilisk'' with sinking ''UB-70'' when she failed to show up at any port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/l/lydonia.html |title= Lydonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HMS Britannia (1904) sinking on 9 November 1918.jpg|right|thumb|{{HMS|Britannia|1904|6}} sinking after being torpedoed by [[SM UB-50|''UB-50'']] on November 9, 1918.]]
Twelve American [[submarine chaser]]s under Captain [[Charles P. Nelson]] were part of [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)|attack]] on the Austro-Hungarian held naval base at [[Durrës|Durazzo]], [[Albania]]. The battle began on October 11 with Italian and British aircraft bombarding Austro-Hungarian concentrations within the city while the allied fleet was still crossing the [[Adriatic Sea]]. When they arrived, the larger ships engaged shore batteries while the Americans plotted a path through a sea mine field and engaged two Austro-Hungarian submarines, {{SMU|U-29|Germany|2}} and {{SMU|U-31|Germany|2}}. Two destroyers and a [[torpedo boat]] were also damaged by American and British ships with help from some Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]] and one merchant vessel was sunk. In the end no Americans were hurt in the battle and the naval base was left in ruins. For his leadership and courage at Durrazo Captain Nelson received the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] as well as other foreign decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/nelson-dd-623.html |title= Nelson DD-623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 863-864.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coast Guard Captain [[Leroy Reinburg]] of {{USS|Druid|SP-321|6}} engaged enemy submarines near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] in November 1918. The ''Druid'' was operating as part of the [[Gibraltar Barrage]], a squadron of American and British ships assigned to keeping enemy U-boats from passing from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic. On November 8, 1918, men aboard USS ''Druid'' sighted three surfaced submarines going through the strait. The weather was foul and the seas rough but the barrage squadron attacked anyway, first with gunfire and then with depth charges. {{HMS|Privet|1916|6}} reported that she shot a hole through one of the submarines' conning towers with a {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} gun but other than that no other damage was thought to have occurred. USS ''Druid'' and her compatriots were successful in defending the strait and on the following day the Americans helped rescue the British crew of the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Britannia|1904|6}} which had been torpedoed by [[SM UB-50|''UB-50'']] while passing through Gibraltar into the Mediterranean. The war ended three days later on November 11.&lt;ref name=Larzelere117&gt;Larzelere, p 117&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pacific Ocean ===
American naval forces in the [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|Pacific Theater]] of World War I were far removed from the conflict with Germany and the other [[Central Powers]]. Although Imperial Germany possessed Pacific colonies at the beginning of the war, all of the isolated colonies had easily been conquered by the Allies by 1915. The only significant United States naval presence in the Pacific was a [[cruiser]] squadron under [[Admiral]] [[Austin M. Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was only one engagement in the theater involving the United States, and it took place just one day after the United States declared war. In December 1914 the German [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SMS|Cormoran|1909|6}} was [[commerce raiding]] in the South Pacific, when her commander put in for provisions on the then neutral island of [[Guam]], a United States territory. Captain [[Adalbert Zuckschwerdt]] needed coal, but there was little to be had. As a result, the ship was stranded and her crew were interned for the next three years. When the war with Germany finally began on April 6, 1917, the old [[schooner]] {{USS|Supply|1873|6}} was ordered to demand the ''Cormoran'' surrender or be sunk. Captain Zuckschwerdt refused to hand over his ship, knowing it would be used against his country. Instead, he ordered his men to [[Scuttling of SMS Cormoran|scuttle]] her. In an attempt to prevent this, the captain of the USS ''Supply'' ordered the [[United States Marines]] on board to open fire on German crew. Nine German sailors would be killed, either by the rifle fire or the explosion that sank the ''Cormoran''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/supply-ii.html |title= Supply II}}&lt;/ref&gt;
