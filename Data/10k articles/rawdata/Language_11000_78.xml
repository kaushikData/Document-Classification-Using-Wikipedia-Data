      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11847">'''Absenteeism''' is a habitual [[pattern]] of absence from a [[duty]] or [[Law of obligations|obligation]] without good reason. Generally, absenteeism is unplanned absences.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1999|title=Workplace attendance and absenteeism|url=https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/faculties-library/workplace-attendance-and-absenteeism.pdf?sfvrsn=4|journal=The Australasian Faculty of Occupational medicine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absenteeism has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an implicit contract between employee and employer. It is seen as a management problem, and framed in economic or quasi-economic terms. More recent scholarship seeks to understand absenteeism as an indicator of psychological, medical, or social adjustment to work.

== Workplace ==
High absenteeism in the [[workplace]] may be indicative of poor [[Employee morale|morale]], but absences can also be caused by workplace hazards or [[sick building syndrome]]. Measurements such as the [[Bradford factor]], a measurement tool to analyze absenteeism which believes short, unplanned absences effect the work group more than long term absences, do not distinguish between absence for genuine illness reasons and absence for non-illness related reasons. In 2013, the UK [[CIPD]] estimated that the average worker had 7.6 absent days per year and which cost employers £595 per employee annually.&lt;ref&gt;CIPD. (2017). ''2016 annual survey report of absence management.'' Retrieved from absence-management_2016_tcm18-16360.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement methods are not exact and all encompassing, resulting in skewed results depending on variables being observed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Genowska|first=Agnieszka|last2=Fryc|first2=Justyna|last3=Pinkas|first3=Jaroslaw|last4=Jamiolkowski|first4=Jacek|last5=Szafraniek|first5=Krystyna|last6=Szpak|first6=Andrzej|last7=Bojar|first7=Bojar|date=2017|title=Social costs of loss in productivity-related absenteeism in Poland|url=|journal=International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health|volume=|pages=|separator=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, employees can feel obliged to come to work while ill, and transmit [[communicable disease]]s to their co-workers. This leads to even greater absenteeism and reduced productivity among other workers.

Work forces often excuse absenteeism caused by medical reasons if the employee provides supporting documentation from their medical practitioner. In Poland, if employees themselves, or anyone under their care including children and elders, falls ill, sick leave can be applied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The psychological model that discusses this is the "withdrawal model", which assumes that absenteeism represents individual withdrawal from dissatisfying working conditions. This finds empirical support in a negative association between absence and [[job satisfaction]], in particular, the satisfaction with the work itself. Factors attributed to absence from work can include [[Occupational stress|stress]], family related concerns, work culture, the employees ability to do the job, and supervisor-subordinate relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Medical-based understanding of absenteeism finds support in research that links absenteeism for medical reasons with mental and behavioral disorders, diseases of the digestive system, neoplasms, and diseases of the genitourinary system.This excludes pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium. The cost of this, in euros, is 7.43 billion per year for men and 9.66 billion for females (6.7 billion euro after taking out pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium.)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Research shows that over one trillion dollars are lost annually due to productivity shortages as a result of medical-related absenteeism. The line between psychological and medical causation is blurry, given that there are positive links between both work stress and depression, and absenteeism. Depressive tendencies may lie behind some of the absence ascribed to poor physical health, as with adoption of a "culturally approved sick role". This places the adjective "sickness" before the word "absence", and carries a burden of more proof than is usually offered.

Evidence indicates that absence is generally viewed as "mildly deviant workplace behavior." For example, people tend to hold negative stereotypes of absentees, under report their own absenteeism, and believe their own attendance record is better than that of their peers. Negative attributions about absence then bring about three outcomes: the behavior is open to social control, sensitive to social context, and is a potential source of [[workplace conflict]].

One tactic companies use to combat unplanned absences is the notion of paying back unused sick time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Managing ===
Absenteeism is a habitual pattern correlated with emotional labor and personal reasoning, but there are resolutions to finding ways to alleviate the cause. Kelley, et al. (2016) says stress accounts for twelve percent of absenteeism in the workplace a year, which is a matter in which the company needs to stay in communication with the employee and work towards a solution. A great example of finding progress is forming an [[employee assistantship program]] (EAP), which is “a strategy to help workers deal with issues outside of work that employees bring to the workplace” (Quinley, 2003). This not only involves stress, but other mental health factors that employees deem worthy of attention. EAP can help those employees bring a more positive attitude to work, which can allude to the creation of a positive workplace environment.

Another matter in which employees’ absenteeism can be reduced is involving the employees’ personal matters (i.e. children at home, ill family, etc.) and the willingness of the company to be flexible. Perfect attendance is hard to accomplish in the workplace. Outside matters always play factors in absences, which can be spontaneous and uncontrollable. Flexibility is a key factor when working a balanced business, and it’s important for communication to flow effectively in the workplace.

Every company is different, and absence in the workplace should be limited. Effective communication can help in this effort to avoid problems in the workplace. Absenteeism not only affects the individual(s) work, but also the company from a group standpoint. Communication remains top priority when dealing with absenteeism. Communicating and willing to work together to achieve a common goal is a main reason that managing this pattern effectively are ways to avoid absenteeism in the workplace.

=== Planned vs unplanned ===
Planned absences from work include scheduled time off, retirement, and sabbaticals. These absences cause little to no disruption to work spaces because of the time given to work around the absence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Unplanned absence from work is defined as leave that is not planned or predictable. It includes sick time off, injured time off, special circumstances, and absence without permission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unplanned absences indicate an important factor of the health of the workplace, including employee satisfaction and commitment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Bullying ===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Nearly every workplace that has a bully in charge will have elevated [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]] and absenteeism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism and psychopathy ===
{{Main |Narcissism in the workplace | Psychopathy in the workplace}}
According to Thomas, there tends to be a higher level of [[Occupational stress|stress]] with people who work or interact with a [[narcissist]], which in turn increases absenteeism and [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = D | title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boddy finds the same dynamic where there is a corporate [[psychopath]] in the organization.&lt;ref name = Boddy&gt;{{Citation | last = Boddy | first = CR | title = Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In school ==
While occasional school absenteeism may not be problematic, excessive absenteeism has shown to have a negative impact. Students with poor attendance records are found to be at a disadvantage both academically and socially. Compared to their peers, these students are more at risk of academic under-performance and early school leaving. They are also at risk of having more restricted opportunities in terms of further education and employment, and are likely to experience social and emotional problems in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, M., Darmody, M., &amp; McCoy, S. (2013). Persistent absenteeism among Irish primary school pupils. Educational Review, 65(4), 488-501. doi:10.1080/00131911.2013.768599&lt;/ref&gt; Missing school can be a habit-forming behavior and can be challenging to deal with despite growing awareness of the causes of absenteeism.

Research evidence suggests that early interventions are six times more likely to be successful than those after students’ non-attendance has reached the persistent stage.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, K. (2012). The strategic management of truancy and school absenteeism: finding solutions from a national perspective. Educational Review, 64(2), 211-222. doi:10.1080/00131911.2011.598918&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, there is normally one initial reason, referred to as “the trigger point”, for the students’ non-attendance. By the time students’ absences have reached the persistent stage, there are at least several more reasons used to justify the action.

There are positive and negative reinforcements regarding student absenteeism. A positive reinforcement meaning that the student will receive either more attention from their parent or guardian, or receive tangible benefits from not going to school. A negative reinforcement meaning that the student is avoiding school. Dube and Orpinas conducted a study by surveying 99 upper-elementary and middle schools, targeting students with attendance problems. Three major profiles were identified from these students. Dube and Orpinas found that 17.2 percent missed school to avoid fear, anxiety problems, or escape from social or evaluative situations; 60.6 percent missed school to gain parental attention or tangible benefits; and 22.2 percent had no profile.&lt;ref&gt;Dube, Shanta R. and Pamela Orpinas. "Understanding Excessive School Absenteeism as School Refusal Behavior." Children &amp; Schools, vol. 31, no. 2, Apr. 2009, pp. 87-95. EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt; All three groups significantly differed in mean scores for behavioral difficulties. Children who fit within multiple profiles had the highest level of behavioral problems, and children in the no-profile group had the lowest. Children with multiple profiles had higher mean scores on frequency of victimization and total number of traumatic or stressful events than did those in the other groups.

Although there are many theories to treating absenteeism, there is no universal treatment. There is however, a step by step process identified by Evie Bald, to manage absenteeism. This process includes identifying chronic absenteeism, identifying the reasoning behind the absences, work with families to address issues, and offer positive reinforcements if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Blad, E. (2017). Schools Fight Back Against Chronic Absenteeism: Districts work to ensure students are in school. Education Week, 37(9), 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adele Eva Goldberg''' (born November 9, 1963) is an American [[linguist]], best known for the [[Construction Grammar]] in the tradition of [[Cognitive linguistics]]. 

Goldberg's research focus is on the [[psychology of language]], including theoretical and experimental aspects of [[grammar]] and its representation, acquisition of form-function correspondences, and syntactic priming. Her works aim to illuminate parallels between language and other cognitive processes.

She is best known for her work on ''constructions'': grammatical pairings of form and functions that are related to one another in a systematic network of learned knowledge; ''statistical preemption'': the idea that competition between grammatical constructions in context can account for the ill-formedness of certain expressions that would otherwise be licensed;  the creation and development of the ''novel construction-learning paradigm'': which is akin to learning novel words with novel meanings; and the suggestion that both statistics (particularly in the form of skewed input) and the functions of constructions play an important role in learning.

She argues that the functions of constructions often help demystify traditional linguistic puzzles such as island constraints, one-anaphora, and obligatory modifiers.

With Francesca Citron, she investigates the neural processing of conventional metaphors and their physical and emotional correlates.

Since 2004, she has been Professor of Psychology and Linguistics at [[Princeton University]]. From 1997-2004, she was Associate Professor of Linguistics at the [[Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology|Beckman Institute]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. From 1997 to 1998, she was Associate Professor of Linguistics and from 1992 to 1997 Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Personal Life==
In 1985, Goldberg received a B.A. in Mathematics and Philosophy from [[University of Pennsylvania]]. She received an M.A. in 1989 in linguistics, and in 1992 a PhD in linguistics, both from the [[University of California at Berkeley]], studying with [[George Lakoff]], [[Charles J. Fillmore|Charles Fillmore]], and [[Dan Slobin]]. [https://academictree.org/linguistics/tree.php?pid=25096 Her academic family tree is here]. She is married to [[Ali Yazdani]], a professor of physics, and they have two children. Her brother is [[Ken Goldberg|Ken Y. Goldberg]], an IEOR professor at UC Berkeley.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

In manufacturing, an '''airshaft''' is a device used for handling winding reels in the processing of [[web-fed]] materials, such as continuous-process [[printing press]]es.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.convertech.com/converting-terminology-glossary/&lt;/ref&gt;

Airshafts—also called Air Expanding shafts—are used in the manufacturing processes for fitting into a core onto which materials such as paper, card and plastic film are wound. An airshaft is designed so that, on fitting into a core, it can be readily expanded, thereby achieving a quick and firm attachment, it may also be easily deflated to facilitate easy withdrawal of the shaft after winding of product is complete. Their efficient design makes them ideal for mounting onto bearing housings to enable the winding or unwinding of rolls of stock material with the minimum of equipment down time. The advantage of using an airshaft is its ability to grip the core, without damage, whilst providing a positive interface to control the web via motors &amp; brakes. Airshafts are available as either lug type (with bladder down the centre) or strip type (bladders on the periphery of the shaft).

Air shafts are used on many [[converting]] machines. An example of one of these machines is a [[Roll slitting|slitting machine]] or slitter rewinder which is used to cut or slit large rolls of material into smaller rollers.

Air shaft is a machine part or shaft which tightens the core or roll on filling air.
Air Shafts are of two types 
1) Contains Inflatable Rubber tube inside also called Lug shafts.
2) Which contains  bladder multiple outside also called Multi-tube Shaft .
 In Lugs type Air shaft, shaft consist of air bladder inside it. It is manufactured using Aluminium or Iron pipe as outer pipe in which there are u-shaped slot are there in which lugs are fitted manually. Then Inflatable bladder placed inside pipe below lugs. Then bladder is connected  using a brass air valve. So, when we fill air using Air valve the bladder inflated and lugs comes out of shafts body (pipe) and tights the core in which shafts is placed.

In Multi tube Air Shafts there are small flat tubes placed outside the body of shafts which get in round shapes on filling air in it using Brass Air Valve and Lugs comes out of body and tight the core.

 These times  Air Shafts &amp; Multi tube Shafts are finding very important placed in industries where they use any kind of cores or rolls. Its main application is on Printing-Packaging industries &amp; Textile Industries.

'''Amos Sutton''' (1802 in [[Sevenoaks]] in Kent &amp;ndash; 17 August 1854 in [[Cuttack]], [[Odisha]]) was an English [[General Baptist]] [[missionary]] to Odisha, [[India]], and [[hymn]] writer.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sweetser Burrage ''Baptist Hymn Writers and Their Hymns'' 1888 "AMOS SUTTON. 1802-1854. This devoted missionary of Christ, of humble parentage, was born at Sevenoaks in Kent, January 21, 1802. When his school life was over, he was placed in a large business establishment in the metropolis, but the temptations of a great city proved too strong for him. Returning to his home in the country, the faithful ministry of his pastor was blessed to his conversion, and he was baptized, and joined the Baptist church at Sevenoaks. Soon he was actively employed in Sunday-school teaching,"&lt;/ref&gt; He published the first English grammar of the [[Odia language]] (1831),&lt;ref&gt;Current Trends in Linguistics Thomas Albert Sebeok- 1976 Volume 14 - Page 135 "Oriya teaching material.

== Biography ==
At the age of 21, he was recruited by General Baptist Foreign Missionary Society for missionary service. He was trained for the ministry under J.G. Pike, founder of the Connexion's Missionary Society in [[Derby]]. After a brief period in home ministry, he was sent as a missionary to India in 1824 by [[BMS World Mission|Baptist Missionary Society]], two years after [[William Bampton]] and [[James Peggs]], the first two Baptist missionaries, had entered Odisha. Sutton along with his wife, Charlotte Sutton ''née'' Collins, sailed to Calcutta (now [[Kolkata]]) and joined the missionary work at station [[Cuttack]] in modern-day [[Odisha]] on 11 March 1825. Soon after their arrival to his mission station, his first wife Charlotte died in [[Puri]] due to sickness. He later married Elizabeth Coleman, an [[Americans|American]] Baptist missionary widow.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hym"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwa-baptist-heritage.org/hst-oris.htm |title=Who are the Baptists? - Bengal Orissa Mission |quote=Mrs. and Rev.

=== Missionary work ===
The missionary began the evangelism and recorded the first Odia conversion in 1828. By 1841, Sutton had trained three Odia [[evangelism|evangelists]] at Cuttack. By 1846, when the students increased to eight, he formalised the class as the ''Cuttack Mission Academy''. By 1805, the Baptist missionary society and later Amos Sutton under the auspices of [[Serampore Trio]] — [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], [[Joshua Marshman]], and [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]]—attempted to preach to [[Telugu people|Telugu-speaking people]] in the northernmost parts of present [[Andhra Pradesh]] — adjoining areas of Odisha such as [[Chicacole]] (present [[Srikakulam]]) and [[Vizagapatnam]] (present [[Vizag]] or [[Visakhapatnam]]). Baptist missionary attempts and Amos Sutton’s objective to evangelize [[Telugu people|Telugus]] failed and the missionaries didn't venture to the Telugu regions again, confining themselves to Odia-speaking districts.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fnd"/&gt;

As the Baptist Missionary Society was not able to support the Odisha missionary work, through his second wife he was able to get contact details of the American [[Free Will Baptists]]. Sutton contacted the Free Will Baptists Mission mentioning the great needs of Odisha and adjoining Telugu-speaking areas; accordingly, he received an invitation from the convention to visit America.&lt;ref name="bwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fnd"/&gt;

Sutton and his wife visited England and the United States and spent two years between 1833 and 1835 sharing their mission fields. During their visit to United States, he spoke at the seventh General conference of the Free Will Baptists in October 1833 before an audience of 3,000 people inspiring them to devote their life to the missionary service. At this conference, [[Jeremiah Phillips]] and Eli Noyes came forward to offer their service to Odia-speaking people.&lt;ref name="hym"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fnd"/&gt;

While visiting his relatives in the United States in 1835, he urged the Baptist convention in [[Virginia]] to take over the abandoned work among the Telugus; accordingly, [[Samuel S. Day]], a [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[Baptist]] missionary, and E. L. Abbot, including their wives were sent by American Baptist Foreign Mission Board to the Telugu-speaking provinces along with Sutton.&lt;ref name="bwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fnd"/&gt;

On 22 September 1835, Amos Sutton, Jeremiah Phillips, Eli Noyes, Samuel S. Day, including their wives and several other missionaries sailed to India. After 136 days of sailing, they arrived Calcutta. From Calcutta, they travelled by land and joined their respective mission stations – E. L. Abbot departed to [[Burma]], while the Day family proceeded to the Telugu-speaking provinces and arrived at Vizagapatnam – Amos Sutton, Eli Noyes, and Jeremiah Phillips proceeded to the Odia-speaking provinces and arrived at Cuttack where the British Baptist Missionaries were already working – Jeremiah Phillips and Eli Noyes dedicated their missionary service to [[Santals]]. Amos Sutton soon became the corresponding secretary of the new Free Will Baptist Missionary.&lt;ref name="bwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fnd"/&gt;

== Bibliography ==
Sutton devoted himself to learning the local Odia language, as soon as he arrived the mission station. Sutton being a gifted translator, soon compiled an Odia grammar, and dictionary in three volumes, as well as translating a number of English books such as [[Pilgrim's Progress]] by [[John Bunyan]] – in Odia named ''Swaga Jatrira Britanta'' – and also a complete translation of the Bible. Amos Sutton's ''Introductory Grammar of Oriya language'' published in 1831, happens to be the oldest publication available in the Oriya Language Collection to date.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hym"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nat"&gt;

He published the first volume of his Odia dictionary in 1841, and the next two volumes by 1843. It was  printed in the Odisha mission press at Cuttack. The Odia dictionary gives Odia meaning of Odia words with English synonyms. Sutton also prepared a dictionary named ''Sadhu Bhasharthabhidhan'', a vocabulary of current [[Sanskrit]] terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha mission press in 1844.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hym"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"&gt;{{cite book |last= Amaresh |first= Datta|title= Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|publisher= Sahitya Akademi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1030 |year= 1988 |pages= 1029–1030 |isbn=978-81-260-1194-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published ''Dharmapustakara Adibhaya'' between 1842 and 1843. He also published the ''History Of The Mission To Orissa: The Site Of The Temple Of Juggernaut'' in 1835. In addition to Odia tracts, he published ''A Narrative of the Mission to Orissa'' in 1844, ''Orissa and its Evangelization'' in 1850, ''an autobiography, the Happy Transformation'' in 1844, and compiled ''Padarthavidyasara'' to be taught as textbook in the schools of Odisha.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hym"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sutton |first= Amos |author2=American Sunday-School Union|title= History of the mission to Orissa|publisher= American Sunday-School Union |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_1QoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |year= 1835|work= Harvard University }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Datta |first= Amaresh |title= Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature |publisher= Sahitya Akademy|url= |year= 1988 |page= 1134 |isbn=978-81-260-1194-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a hymn writer, he prepared the first Odia hymn book—179 of the hymns being of his own composition. He composed hymns, especially for divine worship, public, private, and social occasions. Amos Sutton's hymns appear to have been the first [[Protestant]] hymnal printed in [[India]]. On his visit to England in 1833, he composed a farewell hymn to the tune of ''Auld Lang Syne'' – "Hail sweetest, dearest tie, that binds". This soon became very popular and is still in common use.&lt;ref name="hym"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.libraries.claremont.edu/sc/2010/06/first-protestant-hymnal-printe.html |title= Protestant Hymnal Printed in India  |quote= Believed to be the first Protestant hymnal printed in India is Amos Sutton's Hymns Especially Designed for Divine Worship Public, Social, and Private |publisher=blogs.libraries.claremont.edu |accessdate= 24 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|ga|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}''''' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''{{lang|ga|An Caighdeán}}'', is an artificial [[standard language|standard]] for the spelling and grammar of the [[Irish language]], to be used in official publications and taught in most schools in the state.  The standard is based on the living [[vernacular]] dialects, generally favouring [[Connacht Irish]] over [[Munster Irish]] and [[Ulster Irish]].

It was first published in 1958 by combining spelling reforms, promulgated in 1945 to 1947, with grammar standards, published in 1953.&lt;ref name="oireachtas2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/about/rannoganaistriuchain/ancaighdeanoifigiuil/ |title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil |year=2012 |publisher=Oireachtas |accessdate=8 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/finance/1958/18.pdf |title=Ciorclán 18/1958:- Gramadach na Gaeilge agus Litriu na Gaeilge. |date=12 September 1958 |work=Circulars |publisher=Government of Ireland |language=Irish |accessdate=8 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Revised editions were published in 2012&lt;ref name="gaelport2012"/&gt; and 2017.

Since 2013, the [[Houses of the Oireachtas Commission]], through the translation department, has been responsible for periodic updates to the standard, with reviews at least once every seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/3/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3 |title=Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2013, Section 3 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, successive governments were committed to promoting the Irish language, with separate teaching materials in each of the three living vernacular dialects. Official publications were often issued with Irish translations, including the texts of all [[act of parliament|acts]] of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament). The Oireachtas establish the ''{{lang|ga|Rannóg an Aistriúchán}}'' (Translation Branch) for this work, which developed ad-hoc conventions to reconcile the different dialect forms and avoid favouring a single dialect in its output. When [[Éamon de Valera]] instigated [[constitution of Ireland|a new Constitution]], which was adopted in 1937, he established a committee to propose spelling reforms for the "popular edition" of the Irish-language text.{{#tag:ref|The "popular edition" is the one distributed to the public, as opposed to the formally "enrolled edition" which is a physical document used by the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] and which uses the unreformed spellings.|group="nb"|name=""}} The committee was unable to agree, but member [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] sent his notes to de Valera, who forwarded them to ''{{lang|ga|Rannóg an Aistriúchán}}'', which developed a system circulated within the [[civil service]] in 1945, and revised in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/finance/1947/27.pdf |title=Circular 27/1947:- Irish Spelling |date=30 September 1947 |work=Circulars |publisher=Government of Ireland |accessdate=8 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/dictionaries.shtml |title=Beginners' Blas |accessdate=18 March 2011 |date=June 2005 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Siadhail 1981, p.75 fn.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition was reprinted regularly between 1960 and 2004;&lt;ref name="oireachtas2012"/&gt; there were minor revisions in 1960 and 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Nic Pháidín (2008) p.102&lt;/ref&gt; A revised edition was published in 2012 both online and in hardcopy.&lt;ref name="gaelport2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe don Ghaeilge|url=http://www.gaelport.com/nuacht/Caighdean-athbhreithnithe-don-Ghaeilge/|accessdate=2012-08-02|newspaper=Gaelport.com|date=2012-08-02|author=Niamh Ní Shúilleabháin|language=Irish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the {{lang|ga|Caighdeán}} closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers,&lt;ref&gt;Uíbh Eachach (2012) p.7: {{lang|ga|"Rinneadh iarracht ar leith san athbhreithniú seo foirmeacha agus leaganacha atá ar fáil go tréan sa chaint sna mórchanúintí a áireamh sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil Athbhreithnithe sa tslí is go mbraithfeadh an gnáthchainteoir mórchanúna go bhfuil na príomhghnéithe den chanúint sin aitheanta sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil agus, mar sin, gur gaire don ghnáthchaint an Caighdeán Oifigiúil anois ná mar a bhíodh."}}&lt;/ref&gt; including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Uíbh Eachach (2012) p.7: {{lang|ga|"Triaileadh, mar shampla, aitheantas a thabhairt don leathnú atá ag teacht ar úsáid fhoirm an ainmnigh in ionad an ghinidigh sa chaint."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context influencing the differences between dialects has changed over time.  On one hand, the shrinking of the Irish-speaking areas over the past two centuries means that where there was once a continuum of dialects from one end of the country to the other, the dialects are now each geographically isolated.  On the other hand, national TV and radio stations have increased certain types of mixing between the dialects in recent decades, reducing the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701154842/http://www.irishlanguage.net:80/irish/dialects.asp|title=irishlanguage.net Dialects of Irish|quote=In recent times, however, contacts between speakers of different dialects have become more common, and mixed dialects have originated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Its development had three purposes.  One was to create a standard written form that would be mutually intelligible by speakers with different dialects.&lt;ref name="blas"/&gt;  Another was to simplify Irish spelling by removing many [[silent letter]]s which had existed in [[Classical Irish]].  And lastly, to create a uniform and less-complicated grammar which should provide less of a hinderance to learners and thus combat the decline of the language.

The building blocks of the Caighdeán come from the three main dialects, namely [[Ulster Irish]], [[Munster Irish]], and [[Connacht Irish]].  Connacht Irish, which is the dialect with the most speakers, is used proportionally more than Ulster or Munster Irish.  The standard is described by [[Mícheál Ó Siadhail]] as being "to an extent based on a 'common core' of all Irish dialects, or the most frequent forms, and partly on random choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ó Siadhail |first= Mícheál|date= 1980 |title= Learning Irish|publisher= Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies |page= 221 |isbn= 0-300-12177-6 |author-link= Mícheál Ó Siadhail |quote=This standard is to an extent based on a 'common core' of all Irish dialects, or the most frequent forms, and partly on random choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A side effect of simplifying the spelling was that similarity to [[Scottish Gaelic]] was reduced.  For example, while pre-Caighdeán Irish had separate spellings for the three words "bay" ("''bádh''"), "sympathy" ("''báidh''"), and "drowning" ("''bádhadh''"), the Caighdeán replaced all three by "''bá''".  The older forms resembled the Scottish Gaelic words "''bàgh''", "''bàidh''", and "''bàthadh''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Machine translation for closely related language pairs|author=Kevin P. Scannell|url=https://borel.slu.edu/pub/ga2gd.pdf|quote=The single greatest disaster in terms of mutual understanding between the languages was the introduction of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil (Official Standard) on the Irish side in the 1940’s (Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, 1962).  As an example, the Scottish Gaelic words bàgh (bay), bàidh (sympathy), and bàthadh (drowning) are immediately recognizable and distinguishable in pre-standard Irish (Dinneen, 1927) as bádh, báidh, and bádhadh, respectively, while the Caighdeán tragically conflates all three into the indescript “bá” (Ó Dónaill, 1977). Similar examples abound.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciation and silent letters===

The Caighdeán does not recommend any pronunciation but it is affected by pronunciation because it aims to represent the all current pronunciations.  So, if an "''mh''" is silent in Ulster and Connacht, but pronounced (as a "v") in Munster, then the "''mh''" is kept.  This is why so many silent letters remain, despite the Caighdeán having the goal of eliminating silent letters.  Letters have been removed when they are no longer pronounced in any dialect, so {{lang|ga|beiriú}} and {{lang|ga|dearbhú}} replaced  {{lang|ga|beirbhiughadh}} and {{lang|ga|dearbhughadh}}.  Examples also exist where preserving multiple pronunciations would have been difficult and a winner and a loser had to be picked, such as the word for "again" which most native speakers pronounce as {{lang|ga|arís}} but a large minority pronounce as {{lang|ga|aríst}}.  The Caighdeán uses the former.

'''Bajuni''' (''Kibajuni''), also known as '''Tikulu''' (''Tikuu''), is a variety of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] spoken by the [[Bajuni people]] who inhabit the tiny [[Bajuni Islands]] and coastal [[Kenya]], in addition to parts of southern [[Somalia]], where they constitute a minority ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Mwakikagile, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Abdullahi, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Maho (2009) considers it a distinct dialect.

{{Use Bangladeshi English|date=October 2017}}

'''Bangladeshi English''' or '''Banglish''' is one of the dialects of [[English language|English]] characteristic of [[Bangladesh]].

== Use ==
An estimated 18 million Bangladeshis can use English as a [[second language]].

[[Education in Bangladesh|Education]], [[newspaper]]s, business and nongovernmental organizations in English are prevalent throughout Bangladesh.

English is the principal language of the [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi upper judiciary]], including the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]] and the [[Dhaka High Court]]. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is the sole [[official language]], but English is often used secondarily for official purposes, especially in the judiciary. The [[Government of Bangladesh]] extensively uses English as a [[working language]]. Bangladeshi laws are written in both English and Bengali.

== History ==
The territory of modern Bangladesh was the heartland of the [[Bengal Presidency]] in the [[British Empire]].

Historically, the Bengali [[bhadralok]] class were heavily influenced by the [[British accent]]. The efforts of [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]] played a key role in building an English-speaking Muslim intelligentsia and middle class in Bengal. Modern Bangladeshi English is noted for its neutral accent, in comparison to other forms of Asian English, and has been influenced by the [[American accent]]. Spellings continue to be adopted from [[British English]]. English was an official language of [[East Pakistan]]. After independence, the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was written in both English and Bengali in 1972.

However, successive Bangladeshi governments have converted many original English-medium universities, schools and colleges to Bengali instruction in order to spread mass education. In 1987, President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] replaced English with Bengali as the language of most of the lower courts, which was reversed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=English |title=English – Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=2014-06-08 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the High Court banned the use of "Banglish", described as a slang mixture of Bengali and English, in radio and television programs to prevent the corruption of both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/337843/bangladesh-bans-banglish-to-protect-local-tongue/ |title=Bangladesh bans 'Banglish' to protect local tongue – The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
[[Bangladeshi English literature|English literature in Bangladesh]] includes the early works of [[Begum Rokeya]], one of the world's earliest [[feminist science fiction]] writers, and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], whose English translation of [[Gitanjali]] won him the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1913.

== Numbering system ==
The [[Indian numbering system]] is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken,
numbers less than 100,000/100 000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English.  Numbers including and beyond 100,000 /
100 000 are expressed in a subset of the South Asian numbering system.

Thus, the following scale is used:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! In digits (International system) !! In digits (South Asian system) !! In words ([[long and short scales]]) !! In words (South Asian system)
|-
| colspan="2" | 10 || colspan="3" | ten
|-
| colspan="2" | 100 || colspan="3" | one hundred
|-
| colspan="2" | 1,000 || colspan="3" | one thousand
|-
| colspan="2" | 10,000 || colspan="3" | ten thousand
|-
| 100,000 || 1,00,000 || one hundred thousand || one [[lakh|lokkho]]
|-
| 1,000,000 || 10,00,000 || one million || ten [[lakh|lokkho]]
|-
| 10,000,000 || 1,00,00,000 || ten million || one [[crore|koti]]
|}

'''Bihari''' is the western group of [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]], mainly spoken in the [[Indian states]] of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] and also in [[Nepal]].

Despite the large number of speakers of these languages, only Maithili has been constitutionally recognised in India, which gained constitutional status via the [[Ninety-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|92nd amendment to the Constitution of India]], of 2003 (gaining assent in 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Speakers==

The number of speakers of Bihari languages is difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources. In the urban region most educated speakers of the language name [[Hindi]] as their language because this is what they use in formal contexts and believe it to be the appropriate response because of unawareness. The educated and the urban population of the region return Hindi as the generic name for their language.&lt;ref name=Cardona2003 &gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cardona |editor1-first=George |editor1-link=George Cardona |editor2-last=Jain |editor2-first=Dhanesh |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages |date=11 September 2003 |page=500 |location= |publisher=Routledge |series=Routledge Language Family Series |isbn=978-0415772945 |quote=...the number of speakers of Bihari languages are difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources.

{{Optical disc authoring}}

'''Blu-ray''' or '''Blu-ray Disc''' ('''BD''') is a [[digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage]] format. It was designed to supersede the [[DVD]] format, and is capable of storing several hours of video in [[HD TV|high-definition]] (HDTV 720p and 1080p) and [[4K resolution|ultra high-definition]] resolution ([[4K resolution|2160p]]). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as [[feature film]]s and for the physical distribution of video games for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. The name "Blu-ray" refers to the [[blue laser]] (actually a [[Violet (color)|violet]] laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.

The plastic disc is {{Convert|120|mm|in}} in diameter and {{Convert|1.2|mm|in}} thick, the same size as DVDs and [[Compact disc|CDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ALA-16-LC-response.pdf |title=6JSC/ALA/16/LC response |date=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |publisher=rda-jsc.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray discs contain 25&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] per layer, with dual-layer discs (50&amp;nbsp;GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100&amp;nbsp;GB) and quadruple-layer discs (128 GB) are available for ''BD-XL'' re-writer drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Harry |last=Butler |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2011/02/23/pioneer-bdxl-bdr-206-review/1 |title=Pioneer BDXL BDR-206MBK Review |publisher=bit-tech.net |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray discs with up to 2160p resolution (3840×2160 pixels) and at up to 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]]. [[DVD-Video]] discs were limited to a maximum resolution of 480p ([[NTSC]], 720×480 pixels) or 576p ([[PAL]], 720×576 pixels).&lt;ref name=dvdfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.4 |title=DVD Frequently Asked Questions (and Answers) |work=Jim Taylor |date=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822172353/http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.4 |archivedate=August 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of [[multimedia]] formats.

The BD format was developed by the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. [[Sony]] unveiled the first Blu-ray disc prototypes in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in Japan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release on June 20, 2006, beginning the [[high-definition optical disc format war]], where Blu-ray Disc competed with the [[HD DVD]] format. [[Toshiba]], the main company supporting HD DVD, conceded in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm |title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses |publisher=Toshiba |date=February 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later released its own Blu-ray Disc player in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Yomiuri Shimbun.

==History==
[[File:Blu-ray disc (BD-RE).JPG|thumb|A blank rewritable Blu-ray Disc ([[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-RE]])]]

===Early history===
The information density of the [[DVD]] format was limited by the wavelength of the [[laser diode]]s used. Following protracted development, [[blue laser]] diodes operating at 405 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] became available on a production basis, allowing for development of a more-dense storage format that could hold higher-definition media. [[Sony]] started two projects in collaboration with [[Panasonic]], [[Philips]], and [[TDK]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://inlatest.com/20101102199/bluray-emmy/ Panasonic, Sony, Philips And TDK Awarded Emmy For Blu-Ray Contribution]&lt;/ref&gt; applying the new diodes: [[Ultra Density Optical|UDO]] (Ultra Density Optical),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200011/00-54E1/ |title=Sony Develops Next Generation Optical Disk Storage System For the Data Server Market |date=November 1, 2000 |work=[[Sony]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DVR Blue (together with [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/31062/new_highcapacity_dvd_to_hold_225gb.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601063200/http://www.pcworld.com/article/31062/new_highcapacity_dvd_to_hold_225gb.html |archivedate=2010-06-01

The core technologies of the formats are similar. The first DVR Blue prototypes were unveiled at the [[CEATEC]] exhibition in October 2000 by [[Sony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=4922 |title=Sony Shows 'DVR-Blue' Prototype |accessdate=October 17, 2007 |date=October 11, 2000 |work=CD R Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trademark for the "Blue Disc" logo was filed February 9, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trademarkia.com/blue-disc-b-76207670.html |title=Blue Disc B&amp;nbsp;— Trademark by Blu-ray Disc Association Universal City, CA&amp;nbsp;— Serial Number: 76207670 |accessdate=September 19, 2010 |work=Trademarkia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 19, 2002, the project was officially announced as Blu-ray Disc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1952.html |title=Replacement for DVD unveiled |accessdate=October 17, 2007 |first=Barry |last=Fox |date=February 19, 2002 |work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200205/02-0520E/ |title=Disclosure of Specifications for Large Capacity Optical Disc Recording Format Utilizing Blue-Violet Laser "Blu-ray Disc" Begins |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |date=May 20, 2002 |publisher=Sony}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Blu-ray Disc Association|Blu-ray Disc Founders]] was founded by the nine initial members.

The first consumer device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the Sony BDZ-S77, a US$3,800 BD-RE recorder that was made available only in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/sony-bdz-s77-recorder-review |title=Sony BDZ-S77 Recorder Review |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Maxim |last=Liadov |work=Pricenfees}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were released for this player. Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with [[digital rights management]] before they would release movies for the new format, and they wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) used on DVDs. On October 4, 2004, the name "Blu-ray Disc Founders" was officially changed to the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]] (BDA), and [[20th Century Fox]] joined the BDA's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itworld.com/041004foxbluray |title=Fox trots towards Blu-ray |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |date=October 4, 2002 |publisher=ITworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/117242/article.html &lt;!-- original URL was: http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,117242-page,1/article.html --&gt; |title=New Blu-ray Details Emerge |accessdate=October 17, 2007 |first=Martyn |last=Williams |date=August 5, 2004 |work=PCWorld |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717172217/http://www.pcworld.com/article/117242/article.html |archivedate=2015-07-17 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, [[TDK]] announced that they had now developed an ultra-hard yet very thin polymer coating ("[[Durabis]]") for Blu-ray discs; this was a significant technical advance because a far tougher protection was desired in the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD, while technically Blu-ray Disc required a much ''thinner'' layer for the denser and higher frequency blue laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news2615.html |title=Exclusive TDK Durabis Coating Technology Makes Cartridge-Free, Ultra-Durable Blu-ray Discs a Reality |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |date=January 9, 2005 |work=Phys.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartridges, originally used for scratch protection, were no longer necessary and were scrapped. The BD-ROM specifications were finalized in early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/06/blu-ray_spec_done/ |title=Blu-ray Disc developers complete specification |accessdate=October 17, 2007 |first=Tony |last=Smith |date=January 6, 2006 |work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AACS LA, a consortium founded in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2004/07/64212 |title=Can Odd Alliance Beat Pirates? |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Katie |last=Dean |date=July 15, 2004 |work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been developing the DRM platform that could be used to securely distribute movies to consumers. However, the final AACS standard was delayed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,123924-page,1/article.html |title=Toshiba Hints at HD DVD Delay |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Martyn |last=Williams |date=December 14, 2005 |work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then delayed again when an important member of the Blu-ray Disc group voiced concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/69559 |title=AACS copy protection for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD delayed again |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Craig |last=Morris |date=February 14, 2006 |work=Heise |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102222432/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/69559 |archivedate=November 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the initial hardware manufacturers, including Toshiba, Pioneer, and Samsung, an interim standard was published that did not include some features, such as managed copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,124961-page,1/article.html |title=Burning Questions: No Copying From First High-Def Players |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Melissa J. |last=Perenson |date=March 21, 2006 |work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition from HD DVD===
{{Main|High-definition optical disc format war}}

The [[DVD Forum]], chaired by [[Toshiba]], was split over whether to develop the more expensive blue laser technology. In March 2002 the forum approved a proposal, which was endorsed by [[Warner Bros.]] and other [[film studio|motion picture studios]]. The proposal involved compressing [[high-definition video]] onto dual-layer standard [[DVD-9]] discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020301S0091 |title=Picture's fuzzy for DVD |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Junko |last=Yoshida |date=March 1, 2002 |work=EE Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20011212S0060 |title=Forum to weigh Microsoft's Corona as DVD encoder |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Junko |last=Yoshida |date=December 12, 2001 |work=EE Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this decision, however, the DVD Forum's Steering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue-laser high-definition video solution. In August, Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard, Advanced Optical Disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,104570-page,1/article.html |title=Toshiba, NEC Share Details of Blue-Laser Storage |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |date=August 29, 2002 |work=PCWorld |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000320/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id%2C104570-page%2C1/article.html |archivedate=November 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally adopted by the DVD Forum and renamed [[HD DVD]] the next year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1044249/dvd-forum-backs-toshiba-nec-format |title=DVD Forum backs Toshiba-NEC format |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |date=November 28, 2003 |work=The Inquirer |publisher=Incisive Financial Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being voted down twice by DVD Forum members who were also Blu-ray Disc Association members—a situation that drew preliminary investigations by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6458096.html |title=Opinion: Trust's worth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804053736/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6458096.html |archivedate=4 August 2007 |date=6 Jul 2007 |last=Sweeting |first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HD DVD had a head start in the high-definition video market, as Blu-ray Disc sales were slow to gain market share. The first Blu-ray Disc player was perceived as expensive and buggy, and there were few titles available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/video-players-and-recorders/samsung-bd-p1000/4505-6463_7-31799185.html#more |title=Samsung BD-P1000 Review |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |first=David |last=Katzmaier |date=June 30, 2006 |work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the Sony [[PlayStation 3]], which contained a Blu-ray Disc player for primary storage, helped support Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/02/23/dlclaud123.xml |title=Blu-ray Wins&amp;nbsp;— Telegraph |date=February 23, 2008 |publisher=The Telegraph (UK) |accessdate=February 23, 2008 |location=London |first=Claudine |last=Beaumont |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226094151/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fconnected%2F2008%2F02%2F23%2Fdlclaud123.xml |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign for the format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7252506.stm |title=How the PS3 led Blu-ray's triumph |publisher=BBC News |first=Will |last=Smale |date=February 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AVCHD]] camcorders were also introduced in 2006. These recordings can be played back on many Blu-ray Disc players without re-encoding but are not compatible with HD DVD players. By January 2007, Blu-ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=10323 |title=Blu-ray Tips Scales |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |first=Stephanie |last=Prange |date=February 23, 2007 |work=Home Media Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114230056/http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=10323 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the first three quarters of 2007, BD outsold HD DVD by about two to one. At [[International CES|CES 2007]], Warner proposed [[Total Hi Def]]—a hybrid disc containing Blu-ray on one side and HD DVD on the other, but it was never released.

In a June 28, 2007, press release, Twentieth Century Fox cited Blu-ray Disc's adoption of the BD+ anticopying system as key to their decision to support the Blu-ray Disc format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdplusllc.com/news |title=BD+ Technologies Launches Content Protection Licensing Program |publisher=BD+ Technologies, LLC |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/02/how-crypto-won.html |title=How Crypto Won the DVD War |publisher=Wired |first=Ryan |last=Singel |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 4, 2008, a day before [[International CES|CES]] 2008, [[Warner Bros.]] (the only major studio still releasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc format) announced that it would release only in Blu-ray Disc after May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carnoy |first=David |title=Warner goes Blu-ray exclusively, delivering crushing blow to HD DVD |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9840585-1.html |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively included other studios that came under the Warner umbrella, such as [[New Line Cinema]] and [[HBO]]—though in Europe, HBO distribution partner, the [[BBC]], announced it would, while keeping an eye on market forces, continue to release product on both formats. This led to a chain reaction in the industry, with major U.S. retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], and [[Circuit City Stores|Circuit City]] and Canadian chains such as [[Future Shop]] dropping HD DVD in their stores. A then major European retailer, [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]], dropped HD DVD from its inventory.&lt;ref name=woolsworth&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2008/01/consumers-analysts-retailers-give-hd-dvd-the-cold-shoulder.ars |title=Consumers, analysts, retailers give HD DVD the cold shoulder |first=Eric |last=Bangeman |publisher=Ars Technica |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] and [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]]—major [[Video rental shop|DVD rental]] companies—said they would no longer carry HD DVD.

Following these new developments, on February 19, 2008, Toshiba announced it would end production of [[HD DVD]] devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7252172.stm |title=Toshiba drops out of the HD DVD war |accessdate=February 19, 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Blu-ray Disc to become the industry standard for high-density optical discs. [[Universal Studios]], the sole major movie studio to back HD DVD since its inception, said shortly after Toshiba's announcement: "While Universal values the close partnership we have shared with Toshiba, it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on Blu-ray Disc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bluray20feb20,0,5286548.story?page=2 |title=Blu-ray winner by KO in high-definition war |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=February 20, 2008 |first1=Dawn C. |last1=Chmielewski |first2=Bruce |last2=Wallace |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324113847/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bluray20feb20%2C0%2C5286548.story?page=2 |archivedate=March 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount Pictures, which started releasing movies only in HD DVD format during late 2007, also said it would start releasing in Blu-ray Disc. Both studios announced initial Blu-ray lineups in May 2008. With this, all major Hollywood studios supported Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN2118265320080221 |title=All Hollywood studios now lined up behind Blu-Ray |publisher=Reuters (the Hollywood Reporter) |accessdate=February 21, 2008 |date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future scope and market trends===
{{Update|date=April 2018}}
According to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the US were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales.&lt;ref name="sale"/&gt; 16.3 million DVD software units were sold in the first two years (1997–98) compared to 8.3 million high-definition software units (2006–07).&lt;ref name="sale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sale2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NECoxHEGdHLwGG |title=High-Definition Sales Far Behind Standard DVD's First Two Years |work=MovieWeb |publisher=Watchr Media |date=February 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |last=Gallagher |first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason given for this difference was the smaller marketplace (26.5 million HDTVs in 2007 compared to 100 million SDTVs in 1998).&lt;ref name="sale2"/&gt; Former HD DVD supporter [[Microsoft]] did not make a Blu-ray Disc drive for the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9893090-7.html|title=Report: Microsoft says no Blu-ray for Xbox 360 |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=March 18, 2008 |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |last=Ricciuti |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 360's successor Xbox One features a Blu-ray drive, as does the PS4, with both supporting 3D Blu-ray after later firmware updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Richard |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/23/ps4-blu-ray-3d/ |title=PS4 will add Blu-ray 3D support next week |work=Engadget |publisher=AOL Inc. |date=July 23, 2014 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Richard |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/18/xbox-one-august-update-friend-feed-blu-ray-3d/ |title=Xbox One's next update makes it easier to keep up with friends, and play Blu-ray 3D |publisher=Engadget.com |date=July 23, 2014 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the "format war" ended, Blu-ray Disc sales began to increase. A study by The [[NPD Group]] found that awareness of Blu-ray Disc had reached 60% of U.S. households. Nielsen VideoScan sales numbers showed that for some titles, such as 20th Century Fox's ''Hitman'', up to 14% of total disc sales were from Blu-ray, although the average Blu-ray sales for the first half of the year were only around 5%. In December 2008, the Blu-ray Disc version of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' sold 600,000 copies on the first day of its launch in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="DarkKnightDay"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/High-Def_Disc_Sales/Warner/Disc_Sales:_Dark_Knight_Tops_600K_On_Release_Day/2324 |title=Disc Sales: 'Dark Knight' Tops 600K On Release Day |publisher=High-Def Digest |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the launch, ''The Dark Knight'' BD had sold over 1.7 million copies worldwide, making it the first Blu-ray Disc title to sell over a million copies in the first week of release.&lt;ref name="DarkKnightWeek"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Warner/Disc_Sales/Disc_Sales:_Dark_Knight_Blu-ray_Breaks_1M_First-Week_Barrier/2341 |title=Disc Sales: 'Dark Knight' Blu-ray Breaks 1M First-Week Barrier |publisher=High-Def Digest |date=December 17, 2008 |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Singulus Technologies]] AG, Blu-ray is being adopted faster than the DVD format was at a similar period in its development. This conclusion was based on the fact that Singulus Technologies has received orders for 21 Blu-ray dual-layer machines during the first quarter of 2008, while 17 DVD machines of this type were made in the same period in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.infoniac.com/hi-tech/blu-ray-is-being-adopted-much-faster-than-dvd.html |title=Blu-ray is Being Adopted Much Faster Than DVD 11 Years Ago |publisher=InfoNIAC.com |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GfK Retail and Technology, in the first week of November 2008, sales of Blu-ray recorders surpassed DVD recorders in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/multimedia/display/20081210121641_Sales_of_Blu_Ray_Disc_Recorders_Leave_Behind_Sales_of_DVD_Recorders_in_Japan.html |title=Sales of Blu-ray Disc Recorders Leave Behind Sales of DVD Recorders in Japan |work=xbitlabs.com |date=December 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 16, 2009 |last=Shilov |first=Anton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218173208/http://xbitlabs.com/news/multimedia/display/20081210121641_Sales_of_Blu_Ray_Disc_Recorders_Leave_Behind_Sales_of_DVD_Recorders_in_Japan.html |archivedate=December 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Digital Entertainment Group, the number of Blu-ray Disc playback devices (both set-top box and game console) sold in the U.S. had reached 28.5 million by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="2010sales"/&gt;

The [[Holographic Versatile Disc]] (HVD), described in the ECMA-377 standard, has been in development by The Holography System Development (HSD) Forum using a green writing/reading laser (532&amp;nbsp;nm) and a red positioning/addressing laser (650&amp;nbsp;nm).

[[File:Blu-ray 200GB.png|thumb|Front of an experimental 200&amp;nbsp;GB rewritable Blu-ray Disc]]

Although the Blu-ray Disc specification has been finalized, engineers continue to work on advancing the technology. By 2005, quad-layer (128&amp;nbsp;GB) discs had been demonstrated on a drive with modified optics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdk.com/procommon/press/article.asp?site=con&amp;recid=3 |title=TDK Announces 100GB Blue Laser Disc Technology |publisher=TDK |accessdate=September 27, 2007 |year=2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071106052909/http://www.tdk.com/procommon/press/article.asp?site=con&amp;recid=3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standard unaltered optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=19493 |title=Hitachi Demos Four-Layer Blu-ray Disc Playback |publisher=cdrinfo.xom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitachi stated that such a disc could be used to store 7&amp;nbsp;hours of 32&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s video (HDTV) or 3&amp;nbsp;hours and 30&amp;nbsp;minutes of 64&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s video ([[ultra-high-definition television]]). In August 2006, [[TDK]] announced that they had created a working experimental Blu-ray Disc capable of holding 200&amp;nbsp;GB of data on a single side, using six 33&amp;nbsp;GB data layers.&lt;ref name="TDK200GB_announcement"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.tdk.com/procommon/press/article.asp?site=con&amp;recid=127|title=TDK Announces Blue Laser Disc Technology to Support 200&amp;nbsp;GB Capacity|publisher=TDK|accessdate=November 27, 2006|date=August 31, 2006|archive-url=https://archive.today/20061216235637/http://www.tdk.com/procommon/press/article.asp?site=con&amp;recid=127#|archive-date=December 16, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, behind closed doors at [[International CES|CES]] 2007, [[Ritek]] revealed that they had successfully developed a high-definition optical disc process that extends the disc capacity to ten layers, which increases the capacity of the discs to 250&amp;nbsp;GB.

In January 2007, [[Hitachi]] showcased a 100&amp;nbsp;GB Blu-ray Disc, consisting of four layers containing 25&amp;nbsp;GB each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20070111/126348/ |title=Hitachi Demonstrates 4 Layer BD Playback Using 'Standard Drive' |date=January 11, 2007 |last=Harada |first=Mamoru |work=Techon.nikkebp.co.jp |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[TDK]]'s and [[Panasonic]]'s 100&amp;nbsp;GB discs, they claim this disc is readable on standard Blu-ray Disc drives that are currently in circulation, and it is believed that a firmware update is the only requirement to make it readable to current players and drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/126871/hitachi-showcases-100gb-bluray-disc.html |title=Hitachi showcases 100GB Blu-Ray disc |date=October 3, 2007 |last=Turton |first=Stuart |work=[[PC Pro]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2008, [[Pioneer Corporation]] unveiled a 400&amp;nbsp;GB Blu-ray Disc (containing 16 data layers, 25&amp;nbsp;GB each) that will be compatible with current players after a firmware update. Its planned launch was in the 2009–10 time frame for ROM and 2010–13 for rewritable discs. Ongoing development was underway to create a 1&amp;nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] Blu-ray Disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitimes.com/news/a20081201PD212.html |title=Pioneer showcases 16-layer 400GB optical disc |accessdate=June 13, 2011 |last1=Hwang |first1=Adam |first2=Jimmy Hsu |last2=Taipei |work=Digitimes.com |date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At CES 2009, Panasonic unveiled the DMP-B15, the first portable Blu-ray Disc player, and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the LC-BD60U and LC-BD80U series, the first LCD HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc players. Sharp has also announced that they will sell HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc recorders in the United States by the end of 2009. Set-top box recorders were not being sold in the U.S. for fear of unauthorized copying. However, personal computers with Blu-ray recorder drives were available. On January 1, 2010, Sony, in association with Panasonic, announced plans to increase the storage capacity on their Blu-ray Discs from 25&amp;nbsp;GB to 33.4&amp;nbsp;GB via a technology called i-MLSE ([[Maximum likelihood]] Sequence Estimation). The higher-capacity discs, according to Sony, would be readable on existing Blu-ray Disc players with a firmware upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=3977 |title=FSony, Panasonic Propose Blu-ray Capacity Increase |work=Blu-ray.com |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |last=Dreuth |first=Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is later used on BDXL discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BD-R white paper, 5th ed, Oct 2010|url=http://blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/BD-R_physical_specifications-18326.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2010, the research team of Sony and Japanese Tohoku University announced the joint development of a blue-violet laser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201007/10-0720E/index.html |title=Joint development of the world's first blue-violet ultrafast pulsed semiconductor laser |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help create Blu-ray discs with a capacity of 1 TB using only two layers (and potentially more than 1 TB with additional layering). By comparison, the first blue laser was invented in 1996, with the first prototype discs coming four years later.

On August 5, 2015, The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) announced it will commence licensing the Ultra HD Blu-ray format starting August 24, 2015. The Ultra HD Blu-ray format delivered high dynamic range content that significantly expanded the range between the brightest and darkest elements, expanded color range, high frame rate (up to 60fps) and up to 3840×2160 resolution, object-based sound formats, and an optional "digital bridge" feature. New players were required to play this format, which were able to play both DVDs, traditional Blu-rays and the new format. New Ultra HD Blu-ray discs hold up to 66&amp;nbsp;GB and 100&amp;nbsp;GB of data on dual- and triple-layer discs, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blu-ray Disc Association to Commence Licensing of Ultra HD Blu-ray |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150805005853/en/Blu-ray-Disc-Association-Commence-Licensing-Ultra-HD |website=Business Wire |publisher=agent@blu-raydisc.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser and optics===
While a [[DVD]] uses a 650&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] red laser, Blu-ray Disc uses a 405&amp;nbsp;nm "[[blue laser|blue]]" [[laser diode]]. Although the laser is called "blue", its color is actually in the [[Violet (color)|violet]] range. The shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area, thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a DVD, and can consequently be spaced more closely, resulting in a shorter track pitch, enabling a Blu-ray Disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD. The lasers are GaN ([[gallium nitride]]) laser diodes that produce 405&amp;nbsp;nm light directly, that is, without [[Second-harmonic generation|frequency doubling]] or other [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Products/SC-HP/laserdiodewld/tec/index03.html 3. Laser Diodes for Blu-ray Discs], Sony, says Blu-ray Disc laser diodes use GaN&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional DVDs use 650&amp;nbsp;nm red lasers, and [[Compact Disc|CDs]] use 780&amp;nbsp;nm near-infrared lasers.

The minimum "[[Angular resolution|spot size]]" on which a laser can be focused is limited by [[diffraction]] and depends on the wavelength of the light and the [[numerical aperture]] of the [[lens (optics)|lens]] used to focus it. By decreasing the wavelength, increasing the numerical aperture from 0.60 to 0.85, and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects, designers can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot, which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area.&lt;ref name="BDF physical format whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/BD-ROMwhitepaper20070308-15270.pdf |format=PDF |title=White paper, Blu-ray Disc, 1.C Physical Format Specifications for BD-ROM, 5th Edition |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Blu-ray Disc, the spot size is 580&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="spot_size"&gt;{{cite web |title=Inﬂuence of Pit-Shape Variation on the Decoding Performance for Two-Dimensional Optical Storage (TwoDOS) |url=http://ese.wustl.edu/~jao/magneticpubs/icc_pits_paper.pdf |first1=Naveen |last1=Singla |first2=Joseph A. |last2=O’Sullivan |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011091430/http://www.ese.wustl.edu/~jao/magneticpubs/icc_pits_paper.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a reduction of the pit size from 400&amp;nbsp;nm for DVD to 150&amp;nbsp;nm for Blu-ray Disc, and of the track pitch from 740&amp;nbsp;nm to 320&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="BDF physical format whitepaper"/&gt; See ''[[compact disc]]'' for information on optical discs' physical structure. In addition to the optical improvements, Blu-ray Discs feature improvements in data encoding that further increase the amount of content that can be stored.&lt;ref name="encoding"&gt;{{Cite thesis |title=Design and Analysis of Parity-Check-Code-Based Optical Recording Systems |url=http://alexandria.tue.nl/extra2/200710217.pdf |format=PDF |first=Kui |last=Cai |year=2007 |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |chapter=Introduction |pages=1-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard-coating technology===
Since the Blu-ray Disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc compared to the [[DVD]] standard, it was more vulnerable to scratches in early designs.&lt;ref name="BDF general whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/general_bluraydiscformat-15263.pdf |format=PDF |title=White paper, Blu-ray Disc Format, General |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Founders |accessdate=April 16, 2009 |date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discs were therefore housed in [[caddy (hardware)|cartridges]] for protection, resembling [[Professional Disc]]s introduced by Sony in 2003. Using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium, so designers chose hard-coating of the pickup surface instead. [[TDK]] was the first company to develop a working scratch-protection coating for Blu-ray Discs, naming it [[Durabis]]. In addition, both Sony's and Panasonic's replication methods include proprietary hard-coat technologies. Sony's rewritable media are spin-coated, using a scratch-resistant and antistatic coating. [[Mitsubishi Kagaku Media|Verbatim]]'s recordable and rewritable Blu-ray Discs use their own proprietary technology, called Hard Coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verbatim.com/subcat/optical-media/blu-ray/ |title=Blank Blu-ray Media: Blu ray Recordable (BD-R, BD-R LTH) / Rewritable (BD-RE) Discs, Blu-ray DVD |publisher=Verbatim |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blu-ray Disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches by [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]].&lt;ref name="BDF physical format whitepaper"/&gt; In contrast, DVD media are not required to be scratch-resistant, but since development of the technology, some companies, such as Verbatim, implemented hard-coating for more expensive lines of recordable DVDs.

The table shows the speeds available. Even the lowest speed (1×) is sufficient to play and record real-time 1080p video; the higher speeds are relevant for general data storage and more sophisticated handling of video. BD discs are designed to cope with at least 5000rpm of rotational speed.

The usable data rate of a Blu-ray Disc drive can be limited by the capacity of the drive's data interface. With a [[USB 2.0]] interface, the maximum exploitable drive speed is 288&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] or 36&amp;nbsp;[[MB/s]] (also called 8× speed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingusb.com/hi-speed-usb.html#8 |title=USB 2.0, Hi-Speed USB FAQ |publisher=Everythingusb.com |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[USB 3.0]] interface (with proper cabling) does not have this limitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingusb.com/superspeed-usb.html |title=SuperSpeed USB 3.0 FAQ |publisher=Everythingusb.com |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor do even the oldest version of [[Serial ATA]] (SATA, 150 MB/s)&lt;ref name="SATA1a"&gt;{{cite web

===Packaging===
Pre-recorded Blu-ray Disc titles usually ship in packages similar to but slightly smaller (18.5&amp;nbsp;mm shorter and 2&amp;nbsp;mm thinner: 135&amp;nbsp;mm × 171.5&amp;nbsp;mm × 13&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cd-info.com/packaging/blu-ray-cases/index.html |title=Blu-ray Case Information |publisher=cd-info.com |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as more rounded than a standard [[DVD]] [[Optical disc packaging#Keep case|keep case]], generally with the format prominently displayed in a horizontal stripe across the top of the case (translucent blue for Blu-ray video discs, clear for Blu-ray 3D video releases, red for PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits Games, transparent for regular PlayStation 3 games, transparent dark blue for PlayStation 4 games, transparent green for Xbox One games and black for Ultra HD Blu-ray video releases). Warren Osborn and The Seastone Media Group, LLC created the package that was adopted worldwide following the Blu-ray versus HD DVD market adoption choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com.ar/patents/US20060124479 |title=Blu-ray Case Patent |publisher=cd-info.com |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the fact that Blu-ray cases are smaller than DVD cases, more Blu-Rays than DVDs can fit on a [[Shelf (storage)|shelf]], making Blu-ray an arguably better choice for situations with limited storage space.

===Variants===

====Mini Blu-ray Disc====
The "Mini Blu-ray Disc" (also, "Mini-BD" and "Mini Blu-ray") is a compact 8-centimetre-diameter (~3&amp;nbsp;in) variant of the Blu-ray Disc that can store 7.8&amp;nbsp;GB of data in its single layer configuration, or 15.6&amp;nbsp;GB on a dual layer disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blu-ray Disc – The Scoop |url=http://www.acronova.com/blog/blu-ray-disc/ |publisher=Acronova Technologies Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in concept to the [[MiniDVD]] and [[Mini CD|MiniCD]]. Recordable (BD-R) and rewritable (BD-RE) versions of Mini Blu-ray Disc have been developed specifically for compact camcorders and other compact recording devices.&lt;ref name="Verbatim_MiniBR"&gt;{{cite web

====Blu-ray Disc recordable====
{{Main|Blu-ray Disc recordable}}

"Blu-ray Disc recordable" refers to two [[optical disc]] formats that can be recorded with an [[Optical disc drive|optical disc recorder]]. BD-Rs can be written to once, whereas BD-REs can be erased and re-recorded multiple times. The current practical maximum speed for Blu-ray Discs is about 12× (54&amp;nbsp;MB/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blu-Ray FAQ|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/faq|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=1.7}} Higher speeds of rotation (10,000+ rpm) cause too much wobble for the discs to be written properly,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} as with the 20× (27.7&amp;nbsp;MB/s) and 52× (7.8&amp;nbsp;MB/s) maximum speeds, respectively, of standard [[DVD]]s and [[Compact Disc|CDs]]. Since September 2007, [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-RE]] is also available in the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;cm Mini Blu-ray Disc size.&lt;ref name="Verbatim_MiniBR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20070803/137462/ Hitachi First in Industry to Release Blu-ray Disc Camcorder] Naoki Asakawa, Nikkei Electronics, Nikkei Business Publications, August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2007, [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] and [[Mitsubishi]] codeveloped BD-R LTH ("Low to High" in groove recording), which features an [[organic compound|organic]] dye recording layer that can be manufactured by modifying existing CD-R and DVD-R production equipment, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=21422 |title=Pioneer and Mitsubishi Develop Low cost BD-R Discs Using Organic Recording Layers |publisher=CDRInfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, [[Taiyo Yuden]], Mitsubishi, and [[Hitachi Maxell|Maxell]] released the first BD-R LTH Discs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=22521 Taiyo Yuden, Mitsubishi and Maxell Release First LTH BD-R Discs] cdrinfo.com&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2008, Sony's PlayStation 3 officially gained the ability to use BD-R LTH Discs with the 2.20 firmware update.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/13371.cfm PS3 firmware update v2.20 available&amp;nbsp;– added support for LTH BD-R] afterdawn.com&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 Verbatim/Mitsubishi announced the industry's first 6X BD-R LTH media, which allows recording a 25&amp;nbsp;GB disc in about 16 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS108367+21-May-2009+BW20090521 Verbatim/MKM certified BD-R LTH type media makes performance leap to 6X] reuters.com&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with the previous releases of 120&amp;nbsp;mm [[optical disc]]s (i.e. [[Compact disc|CDs]] and standard [[DVD]]s), Blu-ray recorders hit the market almost simultaneously with Blu-ray's debut.

====BD9 and BD5====
The BD9 format was proposed to the Blu-ray Disc Association by [[Warner Home Video]] as a cost-effective alternative to the 25/50&amp;nbsp;GB BD-ROM discs. The format was supposed to use the same codecs and program structure as Blu-ray Disc video but recorded onto less expensive 8.5&amp;nbsp;GB dual-layer DVD. This red-laser media could be manufactured on existing DVD production lines with lower costs of production than the 25/50&amp;nbsp;GB Blu-ray media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=16769 |title=BD9 Licensing Further Delays The Launch of Blu-ray Burners |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |date=April 11, 2006 |work=cdrinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of BD9 for releasing content on "pressed" discs never caught on. With the end of the format war, manufacturers ramped production of Blu-ray Discs and lowered prices to compete with DVDs. On the other hand, the idea of using inexpensive DVD media became popular among individual users. A lower-capacity version of this format that uses single-layer 4.7&amp;nbsp;GB DVDs has been unofficially called BD5. Both formats are being used by individuals for recording high-definition content in Blu-ray format onto recordable DVD media.&lt;ref name="Doom9_BDAuth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=134402 |title=Quick Blu-ray content (BD, BD-5 and BD-9) authoring guide (PS3+PowerDVD)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Consequently, the discs recorded in BD9 and BD5 formats are not guaranteed to play on standard Blu-ray Disc players. [[AVCHD]] and [[AVCREC]] also use inexpensive media like DVDs, but unlike BD9 and BD5 these formats have limited interactivity, codec types, and data rates. As of March 2011, BD9 was removed as an official BD-ROM disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Blu-ray Disc specifies the use of [[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF) 2.50 as a convergent-friendly format for both PC and consumer electronics environments. It is used in the latest specifications of BD-ROM, BD-RE, and BD-R.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="re3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bd-books" /&gt; In the first BD-RE specification (defined in 2002), the BDFS (Blu-ray Disc File System) was used. The BD-RE 1.0 specification was defined mainly for the [[digital recording]] of [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]]. The BDFS was replaced by UDF 2.50 in the second BD-RE specification in 2005, in order to enable interoperability among consumer electronics Blu-ray recorders and [[personal computer]] systems. These [[optical disc recording technologies]] enabled PC recording and playback of BD-RE.&lt;ref name="bd-books" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/re1-spec.php |title=RE1 Format Specification |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=June 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701055209/http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/re1-spec.php |archivedate=July 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/re2-spec.php |title=RE2 Format Specification |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; BD-R can use UDF 2.50/2.60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/r3-spec.php |title=R3 Format Specification (BDXL) |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blu-ray Disc application for recording of [[digital broadcasting]] has been developed as ''System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications'' (BDAV). The requirements related with [[computer file]] system have been specified in ''System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0'' (BDFS).&lt;ref name="filesystem" /&gt; Initially, the BD-RE version 1.0 (BDFS) was specifically developed for recording of digital broadcasts using the Blu-ray Disc application (BDAV application). But these requirements are superseded by the ''Blu-ray Rewritable Disc File System Specifications version 2.0'' (UDF) (a.k.a. ''RE 2.0'') and ''Blu-ray Recordable Disc File System Specifications version 1.0'' (UDF) (a.k.a. ''R 1.0''). Additionally, a new application format, BDMV (''System Description Blu-ray Disc Prerecorded Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications'') for High Definition Content Distribution was developed for BD-ROM. The only file system developed for BDMV is the ''System Description Blu-ray Read-Only Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0'' (UDF) which defines the requirements for UDF 2.50.&lt;ref name="bd-books" /&gt;&lt;ref name="filesystem" /&gt;

===Media format===

====Container format====
Audio, video, and other streams are [[Multiplexing|multiplexed]] and stored on Blu-ray Discs in a [[Digital container format|container format]] based on the [[MPEG transport stream]]. It is also known as [[BD-AV|BDAV MPEG-2 transport stream]] and can use filename extension [[.m2ts]].&lt;ref name="bdav-videohelp"&gt;Videohelp.com [http://www.videohelp.com/hd What is Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD?] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5icX0gHtz?url=http://www.videohelp.com/hd |date=2009-07-29 }}, Retrieved on July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bda-av" /&gt; Blu-ray Disc titles authored with menus are in the BDMV (Blu-ray Disc Movie) format and contain audio, video, and other streams in BDAV container.&lt;ref name="bdvm"&gt;AfterDawn.com [http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/bd-mv.cfm Glossary – BD-MV (Blu-ray Movie) and BDAV container] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5icX48JmH?url=http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/bd-mv.cfm |date=2009-07-29 }}, Retrieved on July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bdav"&gt;AfterDawn.com [http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/bdav.cfm Glossary – BDAV container], Retrieved on July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the BDAV (Blu-ray Disc Audio/Visual) format, the consumer oriented alternative to the BDMV format used for movie releases. The BDAV format is used on BD-REs and BD-Rs for audio/video recording.&lt;ref name="bdav" /&gt; BDMV format was later defined also for BD-RE and BD-R (in September 2006, in the third revision of BD-RE specification and second revision of BD-R specification).&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/r2-spec.php |title=R2 Format Specification |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="re3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/re3-spec.php |title=RE3 Format Specification |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blu-ray Disc employs the MPEG transport stream recording method. That enables transport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are broadcast, without altering the format.&lt;ref name="bda-bdre"&gt;Blu-ray Disc Association (March 2008) [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/BD-RE_Part3_V2.1_WhitePaper_080406-15271.pdf BD-RE – Audiovisual Application Format Specification for BD-RE 2.1] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5idsN03Hs?url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/BD-RE_Part3_V2.1_WhitePaper_080406-15271.pdf |date=2009-07-30 }} (PDF), [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/en/Technical/TechnicalWhitePapers/BDRE.html Technical White Papers – BD RE], Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It also enables flexible editing of a digital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just by rewriting the playback stream. Although it is quite natural, a function for high-speed and easy-to-use retrieval is built in.&lt;ref name="bda-bdre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bda"&gt;Blu-ray Disc Association (August 2004) [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/general_bluraydiscformat-15263.pdf Blu-ray Disc Format, White paper] (PDF) Page 22, Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Blu-ray Disc Video use MPEG transport streams, compared to DVD's [[MPEG program stream]]s. An MPEG transport stream contains one or more MPEG program streams, so this allows multiple video programs to be stored in the same file so they can be played back simultaneously (e.g. with "[[picture-in-picture]]" effect).

====Codecs====
The BD-ROM specification mandates certain codec compatibilities for both hardware decoders (players) and movie software (content).&lt;ref name="bda-av"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/2b_bdrom_audiovisualapplication_0305-12955-15269.pdf |title=White paper Blu-ray Disc Format – 2.B Audio Visual Application Format Specifications for BD-ROM |format=PDF |page=15 |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association |date=March 2005 |accessdate=July 26, 2009 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=====Video=====
Originally BD-ROMs stored video up to 1920×1080 pixel resolution at up to 60 (59.94) [[Field (video)|fields]] per second. Currently with UHD BD-ROM videos can be stored at a maximum of 3840×2160 pixel resolution at up to 60 (59.94) frames per second, progressively scanned. While most current Blu-ray players and recorders can read and write 1920×1080 video at the full 59.94p and 50p progressive format, new players for the UHD specifications will be able to read at 3840×2160 video at either 59.94p and 50p formats.

Discs encoded in MPEG-2 video typically limit content producers to around two hours of high-definition content on a single-layer (25&amp;nbsp;GB) BD-ROM. The more-advanced video formats (VC-1 and MPEG-4 AVC) typically achieve a video run time twice that of MPEG-2, with comparable quality.

MPEG-2 was used by many studios (including [[Paramount Pictures]], which initially used the [[VC-1]] format for [[HD DVD]] releases) for the first series of Blu-ray Discs, which were launched throughout 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?ReleaseDate=2006 Statistics Page]. Blu-rayStats.com. Retrieved on December 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern releases are now often encoded in either MPEG-4 AVC or VC-1, allowing film studios to place all content on one disc, reducing costs and improving ease of use. Using these formats also frees a lot of space for storage of bonus content in HD ([[1080i]]/[[1080p|p]]), as opposed to the [[Standard-definition television|SD]] ([[480i]]/[[480p|p]]) typically used for most titles. Some studios, such as [[Warner Bros.]], have released bonus content on discs encoded in a different format than the main feature title. For example, the Blu-ray Disc release of ''[[Superman Returns]]'' uses VC-1 for the feature film and MPEG-2 for some of its bonus content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehdroom.com/news/Superman_Returns_Review_Blu-ray/2505 |title=Superman Returns Review (Blu-ray)|accessdate=October 27, 2011 |last=Fitzgerald |first=Shawn |date=April 23, 2008 |work=TheHDRoom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Warner and other studios typically provide bonus content in the video format that matches the feature.

=====Audio=====
For audio, BD-ROM players are required to implement [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3), [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], and [[Linear pulse-code modulation|linear PCM]]. Players may optionally implement [[Dolby Digital Plus]] and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] as well as [[Lossless audio|lossless]] formats [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twice.com/article/CA6323699.html |work=TWICE.com |title=1st HD DVD Players To Decode All Mandatory, Optional Audio Codecs |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |last=Palenchar |first=Joseph |date=April 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409074432/http://www.twice.com/article/CA6323699.html |archivedate=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; BD-ROM titles must use one of the mandatory schemes for the primary soundtrack. A secondary audiotrack, if present, may use any of the mandatory or optional codecs.

====Bit rate====
For users recording [[digital television]] programming, the recordable Blu-ray Disc standard's initial data rate of 36&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s is more than adequate to record high-definition broadcasts from any source ([[IPTV]], cable/satellite, or terrestrial). BD Video movies have a maximum data transfer rate of 54&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 48&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (for both audio and video data), and a maximum video bit rate of 40&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. This compares to HD DVD movies, which have a maximum data transfer rate of 36&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 30.24&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, and a maximum video bitrate of 29.4&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videohelp.com/hd |title=What is Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD? |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5icX0gHtz?url=http://www.videohelp.com/hd |archivedate=July 29, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Java software interface===
{{Main|BD-J}}
At the 2005 [[JavaOne]] trade show, it was announced that [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Java edition|Java]] cross-platform software environment would be included in all Blu-ray Disc players as a mandatory part of the standard.&lt;ref name="2005JavaOne"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foote |first1=Bill |last2=Moll |first2=Erik |title=Java Technology Goes to the Movies: Java Technology in Next-Generation Optical Disc Formats |publisher=2005 JavaOne conference, Session TS-7091 |url=http://www.jovial.com/slides/2005_TS-7091_Foote_Moll_DF.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Java is used to implement interactive menus on Blu-ray Discs, as opposed to the method used on [[DVD]]-video discs. DVDs use pre-rendered MPEG segments and selectable subtitle pictures, which are considerably more primitive and rarely seamless. At the conference, Java creator [[James Gosling]] suggested that the inclusion of a [[Java virtual machine]], as well as network connectivity in some BD devices, will allow updates to Blu-ray Discs via the Internet, adding content such as additional subtitle languages and promotional features not included on the disc at pressing time.&lt;ref name="cnet_nextgen_dvd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/Java-to-appear-in-next-gen-DVD-players/2100-1046_3-5766409.html |title=Java to appear in next-gen DVD players |last1=Shankland |first1=Steven |date=June 26, 2005 |publisher=[[CNET]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This Java Version is called BD-J and is built on a profile of the [[Globally Executable MHP]] (GEM) standard; GEM is the worldwide version of the [[Multimedia Home Platform]] standard.

===Player profiles===
The BD-ROM specification defines four Blu-ray Disc player profiles, including an audio-only player profile (BD-Audio) that does not require video decoding or [[BD-J]]. All of the video-based player profiles (BD-Video) are required to have a full implementation of BD-J.

{{note|profiles_table_note_b}}b A secondary audio decoder is typically used for interactive audio and commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|profiles_table_note_c}}c Profile 3.0 is a separate audio-only player profile. The first Blu-ray Disc album to be released was ''Divertimenti'', by record label Lindberg Lyd, and it has been confirmed to work on the PS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mic.no/mic.nsf/doc/art2008052914313262368505 |title=Music on Blu-ray |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |first=Christian |last=Lysvåg |publisher=Music Information Centre Norway |date=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/29/first-blu-ray-record-divertimenti-released/ |title=First Blu-ray record, Divertimenti, released |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |first=Joshua |last=Fruhlinger |publisher=engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{{note|profiles_table_note_d}}d Also known as Initial Standard profile.&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|profiles_table_note_e}}e Also known as Final Standard profile.&lt;/small&gt;

On November 2, 2007, the Grace Period Profile was superseded by Bonus View as the minimum profile for new BD-Video players released to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6495668.html |title=Blu-ray Disc Assn. promotes new Bonus View |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181606/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6495668.html |archivedate=18 December 2008 |last=Ault |first=Susanne |date=7 Oct 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Blu-ray Disc software not authored with interactive features dependent on Bonus View or BD-Live hardware capabilities is played on Profile 1.0 players, it is able to play the main feature of the disc, but some extra features may not be available or will have limited capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Joshua_Zyber/High-Def_FAQ:_Blu-ray_Profiles_Explained/1186|title=High-Def FAQ: Blu-ray Profiles Explained |first=Joshua |last=Zyber |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=November 23, 2007 |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====BD-Live====
The biggest difference between Bonus View and BD-Live is that BD-Live requires the Blu-ray Disc player to have an Internet connection to access Internet-based content. BD-Live features have included Internet chats, scheduled chats with the director, Internet games, downloadable featurettes, downloadable quizzes, and downloadable movie trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/1219/tinkerbell.html |title=Tinker Bell (Blu-ray) |first=Peter |last=Bracke |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/1437/hellboyii.html |title=Hellboy II: The Golden Army (Blu-ray) |first=Joshua |last=Zyber |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/1738/kungfupanda.html |title=Kung Fu Panda (Blu-ray) |first=Kenneth |last=Brown |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=November 9, 2008 |accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some Bonus View players may have an Ethernet port, it is used for firmware updates and is not used for Internet-based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.docs.sony.com/release/specs/BDPBX1_mksp.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sony BDP-BX1 player specifications |date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Profile 2.0 also requires more local storage in order to handle this content.

Profile 1.0 players are not eligible for Bonus View or BD-Live compliant upgrades and do not have the function or capability to access these upgrades, with the exception of the latest players and the [[PlayStation 3]]. Internet is required to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9808376-1.html |title=Blu-ray Profile 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 explained--Ask the Editors |work=[[CNET]] |last=Moskovciak |first=Matthew |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/samsungs-already-awesome-hd-disc-hybrid-bd+up5000-upgraded-to-profile-11-bye-bye-format-bitching-314480.php |title=Samsung’s Already Awesome HD Disc Hybrid BD-UP5000 Upgraded to Profile 1.1 (Bye Bye Format Bitching) |work=[[Gizmodo]].com |date=October 24, 2007 |last=Rothman |first=Wilson |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/term.cfm/profile_1_1 Profile 1.1], afterdawn.com, December 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Region codes===
[[File:Blu-ray-regions with key.svg|thumb|400px|Regions for the Blu-ray Disc standard:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blu-raydisc.com/en/Technical/FAQs/Blu-rayDiscforVideo.aspx |title=Blu-ray Disc for Video |accessdate=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;div style="font-size:110%;"&gt;
{{legend|#ffa208|Region A/1}}
{{legend|#77b830|Region B/2}}
{{legend|#ce5dff|Region C/3}}&lt;/div&gt;]]

As with the implementation of [[DVD region code|region codes for DVDs]], Blu-ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region. This is intended to permit content providers (motion picture studios, [[television production company]] etc.) to enact regional [[price discrimination]] and/or [[exclusive license|exclusive]] [[content licensing]]. According to the Blu-ray Disc Association, all Blu-ray Disc players and Blu-ray Disc-equipped computer systems are required to enforce regional coding. However, content providers need not use region playback codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.blu-raydisc.com/#/pages/faq "How does regional coding work in the computer space?"] us.blu-raydisc.com FAQ Retrieved October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some current estimates suggest 70% of available [movie] Blu-ray Discs from the major studios are region-code-free and can, therefore, be played on any Blu-ray Disc player, in any region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regionfreemovies.com/ "Latest Confirmed Region Free Blu-Rays"]. Retrieved October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie distributors have different region coding policies. Among major U.S. studios, [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Studios]], and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] have released most of their titles region-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Warner |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Warner |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;although titles released by Warner's [[New Line Cinema]] division were initially region-coded, but subsequently have been released without region-coding. Titles released by other labels on behalf of New Line are still subject to region-coding.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Paramount |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Paramount |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Universal |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Universal |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Sony |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Sony |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Disney |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Disney |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] have released a mix of region-free and region-coded titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=MGM |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics MGM |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Lionsgate |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Lionsgate |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[20th Century Fox]] has released most of their titles region-coded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Fox |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics 20th Century Fox |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vintage film restoration and distribution company [[The Criterion Collection]] uses US region coding in all Blu-ray releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/help#q20 |title=Help - The Criterion Collection (20.) |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/help#q11 |title=Help - The Criterion Collection (11.) |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blu-ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into three regions, labeled A, B, and C.

In circumvention of region coding restrictions, stand-alone Blu-ray Disc players are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of Blu-ray Discs (and DVDs) with ''any'' region code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/06/26/first-region-free-blu-ray-players-available/ "First Region Free Blu-ray Players Available"] engadgethd.com. Retrieved October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructions ("hacks") describing how to reset the Blu-ray region counter of computer player applications to make them multi-region indefinitely are also regularly posted to video enthusiast websites and forums. Unlike DVD region codes, Blu-ray region codes are verified only by the player software, not by the [[Regional Playback Control|optical drive's firmware]].

The latest types of Blu-Ray players, suitable for [[UltraHD]] content, is region-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Region-Free 4k UHD Blu-ray Players: Fact or Fiction?|url= http://www.220-electronics.com/blog/region-free-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-players-fact-fiction/|publisher=220 Electronics|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital rights management===
The Blu-ray Disc format employs several layers of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) which restrict the usage of the discs.&lt;ref name="dellbd-romprotection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/vectors/brcp.pdf |title=Blu-ray Disc Next-Generation Optical Storage: Protecting Content on the BD-ROM |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |publisher=[[Dell]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/assets/downloadablefile/5th_japan_05-13343.pdf |format=PDF |title=Overview of BD-ROM security |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |last=Ajima |first=Kosuke |date=March 29, 2006 |publisher=Blu-ray Disc Association Content Protection Group |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070307102259/http://www.blu-raydisc.com/assets/downloadablefile/5th_japan_05-13343.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to extensive criticism of the format by organizations [[Digital rights management|opposed to DRM]], such as the [[Free Software Foundation]],&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/news/blu-ray |title=Don't buy HD-DVD or Blu-ray disks |date=March 24, 2006 |accessdate=September 6, 2010 |first=Matt |last=Lee |publisher=FSF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumers because new releases require player firmware updates to allow disc playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerist.com/2013/09/06/samsungs-disposable-blu-ray-player-wont-play-new-blu-rays/ |title=Samsung’s Disposable Blu-Ray Player Won’t Play New Blu-Rays |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Laura |last=Northrup |publisher=Consumerist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/avatar-blu-rays-have-some-buyers-seeing-red-16828 |title=‘Avatar’ Blu-rays Have Some Buyers Seeing Red |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Brent |last=Lang |publisher=The Wrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection====
Blu-ray equipment is required to implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection ([[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]]) system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it travels across cables. Through a [[Flag (computing)|protocol flag]] in the media stream called the [[Image Constraint Token]] (ICT), a Blu-ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-compliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition formats, the adoption of this protection method was postponed until 2011.&lt;!-- It's already mid-2012, has the ICT protection method been adopted on a wide scale yet? --&gt;&lt;ref name="aacs_adopters"&gt;{{cite web |title=Advanced Access Content System ("AACS") Adopter Agreement |url=http://www.aacsla.com/license/AACS_Adopter_Agrmt_090619.pdf |format=PDF |date=June 2009 |accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advanced Access Content System====
[[File:AACS dataflow.svg|thumb|The AACS decryption process]]

The [[Advanced Access Content System]] (AACS) is a standard for [[Digital distribution|content distribution]] and [[digital rights management]]. It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a [[consortium]] that includes [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Panasonic]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[IBM]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Sony]]. Since the appearance of the format on devices in 2006, [[AACS encryption key controversy#TIMELINE|several successful attacks]] have been made on it. The first known attack relied on the [[trusted client]] problem. In addition, decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player ([[WinDVD]]). Since keys can be revoked in newer releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsla.com/press/ |title=Response to Reports of Attacks on AACS Technology |publisher=AACS |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is only a temporary attack, and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs.

====BD+====
[[BD+]] was developed by [[Cryptography Research|Cryptography Research Inc.]] and is based on their concept of [[Self-Protecting Digital Content]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryptography.com/technology/spdc/bluray.html Content Protection – BD+ and Blu-ray&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] from cryptography.com&lt;/ref&gt; BD+, effectively a small [[virtual machine]] embedded in authorized players, allows content providers to include executable programs on Blu-ray Discs. Such programs can:&lt;ref name="dellbd-romprotection" /&gt;
* Examine the host environment to see if the player has been tampered with. Every licensed playback device manufacturer must provide the BD+ licensing authority with memory footprints that identify their devices.
* Verify that the player's keys have not been changed
* Execute native code, possibly to patch an otherwise insecure system

====BD-ROM Mark====
[[ROM Mark|BD-ROM Mark]] is a small amount of cryptographic data that is stored separately from normal Blu-ray Disc data, aiming to prevent replication of the discs. The cryptographic data is needed to decrypt the copyrighted disc content protected by AACS.&lt;ref name="aacs-bd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsla.com/specifications/AACS_Spec_BD_Prerecorded_0.912.pdf |format=PDF |title=Advanced Access Content System (AACS) Blu-ray Disc Pre-recorded Book, Revision 0.912 |date=July 27, 2006 |accessdate=October 11, 2011 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

During replication, this ROM Mark is transferred together with the recorded data to the disc. In consequence, any copies of a disc made with a regular recorder will lack the ROM Mark data and will be unreadable on standard players.

==Backward compatibility==
The Blu-ray Disc Association recommends but does not require that Blu-ray Disc drives be capable of reading standard DVDs and CDs, for [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/en/Technical/FAQs/Blu-rayDiscFormat.html|title=Can Blu-ray Disc products play DVD and CD?|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Blu-ray Disc players are capable of reading both CDs and DVDs; however, a few of the early Blu-ray Disc players released in 2006, such as the [[Sony BDP-S1]], could play DVDs but not CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluraydiscplayers.org.uk/blu-ray-and-hd-dvd-players/lg-bh100-blu-ray-hd-dvd-player/ |title=LG BH100 Blu-Ray/HD DVD player |accessdate=August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/video-players-and-recorders/pioneer-bdp-hd1/4505-6463_7-31637888.html?tag=rnav |title=Pioneer BDP-HD1 |accessdate=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/blurayandhddvd/p/sonybluraybdps1.htm |title=Sony BDP-S1 Blu-ray Disc Player&amp;nbsp;— Product Profile |accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Blu-ray players cannot play [[HD DVD]]s, and HD DVD players cannot play Blu-ray discs. Some Blu-ray players can also play [[Video CD]]s, and all 4K Blu-ray players can play regular Blu-ray Discs, and most can play DVDs and CDs. The PlayStation 4 does not support CDs.

==Variations==

===High Fidelity Pure Audio (BD-A)===
{{Main|High Fidelity Pure Audio}}

High Fidelity Pure Audio (HFPA) is a marketing initiative, spearheaded by the [[Universal Music Group]], for audio-only Blu-ray optical discs. Launched in 2013 as a potential successor to the [[compact disc]], it has been compared with [[DVD-A]] and [[Super Audio CD|SACD]], which had similar aims.

===AVCHD===
{{Main|AVCHD}}

[[File:Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-Ray Player.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[Panasonic]] Blu-Ray player DMP-BD60 (late 2009) compatible with AVCHD]]
AVCHD was originally developed as a high definition format for consumer [[tapeless]] [[camcorder]]s. Derived from the Blu-ray Disc specification, AVCHD shares a similar [[random access]] directory structure but is restricted to lower audio and video bitrates, simpler interactivity, and the use of AVC-video and Dolby AC-3 (or linear PCM) audio. Being primarily an acquisition format, AVCHD playback is not recognized by all devices that play Blu-ray Disc. Nevertheless, many such devices are capable of playing AVCHD recordings from removable media, such as DVDs, [[Secure Digital|SD]]/[[Secure Digital|SDHC]] memory cards, "[[Memory Stick]]" cards, and [[hard disk drive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avchd-info.org/press/index.html |title=AVCHD Information Web Site press releases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AVCREC===
{{Main|AVCREC}}

AVCREC uses a BDAV container to record high definition content on conventional DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format_spec/avcrec_specs.php |title=AVREC Format Specifications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317015922/http://blu-raydisc.info/format_spec/avcrec_specs.php |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently AVCREC is tightly integrated with the Japanese [[ISDB]] broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of Japan. AVCREC is used primarily in set-top [[digital video recorder]]s and in this regard is comparable to [[HD DVD#HD REC|HD REC]].

===Blu-ray 3D===
[[File:Blu ray 3d (logo).svg|thumb|upright=0.5|The Blu-ray 3D logo]]

The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) created a task force made up of executives from the film industry and the consumer electronics and IT sectors to help define standards for putting [[3D film]] and [[3D television]] content on a Blu-ray Disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/05/20/bda_taskforce/ |title=Blu-ray brains create 3D taskforce |publisher=reghardware.co.uk |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 2009, the BDA officially announced 3D specs for Blu-ray Disc, allowing backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hd-report.com/2009/12/18/3d-specs-finalized-for-blu-ray-to-hit-market-next-year/ |title=3D specifications finalized for Blu-ray, to hit market next year |publisher=HD Report |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2009 |last=Chabot |first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BDA has said, "The Blu-ray 3D specification calls for encoding 3D video using the "Stereo High" profile defined by [[Multiview Video Coding]] (MVC), an extension to the ITU-T H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) codec currently implemented by all Blu-ray Disc players. MPEG4-MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical 50% overhead compared to equivalent 2D content, and can provide full 1080p resolution backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray Disc players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20091217005371&amp;newsLang=en |title=Blu-ray Disc Association Announces Final 3D Specification |publisher=Business Wire |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the MVC (3D) stream is backward compatible with H.264/AVC (2D) stream, allowing older 2D devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams, ignoring additional information for the second view.

Sony added Blu-ray 3D support to its [[PlayStation 3]] console via a [[PlayStation 3 system software|firmware upgrade]] on 21 September 2010.&lt;ref name="3.50"&gt;{{cite web |title=PS3 System Software Update (ver 3.50) |accessdate=September 21, 2010 |url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/09/21/ps3-system-software-update-ver-3-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console had previously gained 3D gaming capability via an update on 21 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/04/21/ps3-3-30-system-software-update/ |title=PS3 goes 3D on 10 June [2010] |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |last=Lempel |first=Eric |accessdate=June 14, 2011 |date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the version 3.70 software update on August 9, 2011, the PlayStation 3 can play DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio while playing 3D Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/08/09/ps3-system-software-update-v3-70/ |title=PS3 System Software Update (v3.70) |work=[[PlayStation Blog|PlayStation.Blog]] |last=Lempel |first=Eric |accessdate=November 2, 2011 |date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolby TrueHD]] is used on a small minority of Blu-ray 3D releases, and [[Bitstream format|bitstreaming]] implemented in slim PlayStation 3 models only (original "fat" PS3 models decode internally and send audio as [[LPCM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5342470/so-the-ps3-slim-can-bitstream-dolby-truehd-and-dts+hd-master-audio-after-all |title=So, The PS3 Slim Can Bitstream Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio After All? |last1=Allen |first1=Danny |date=August 21, 2009 |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, most major home entertainment studios, such as [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]], [[Sony Pictures]], etc. have discontinued the Blu-ray 3D format in North America and other regions.

===Ultra HD Blu-ray===
{{Main article|Ultra HD Blu-ray}}
Ultra HD Blu-ray is a new disc format, incompatible with existing Blu-ray Disc players, that supports 60fps [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high definition television|UHD]] video encoded in [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] with 10-bit [[high dynamic range|HDR]] and a wider color gamut.

{{Template: English language}}

'''Caribbean English''' dialects of the [[English language]] are spoken in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Liberia]], most countries on the Caribbean coast of [[Central America]], and [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]] on the coast of [[South America]]. Caribbean English is influenced by the [[English-based creole languages|English-based Creole varieties]] spoken in the region, but they are not the same. In the Caribbean, there is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken. Scholars generally agree that although the dialects themselves vary significantly in each of these countries, they primarily have roots in [[British English]] and [[Languages of Africa|West African languages]]. Caribbean English in countries with a majority [[Indo-Caribbean|Indian]] population like [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Guyana]] has been influenced by [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and other [[Languages of South Asia|South Asian languages]] in addition to British English and West African languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mahabir |first1=Kumar  |journal=Caribbean Quarterly |volume= 45 |issue= 4|title= The Impact of Hindi on Trinidad English|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40654099?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |location=Trinidad and Tobago |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-01.sil.org/silesr/2002/011/SILESR2002-011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studycountry.com/guide/GY-language.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The English in daily use in the Caribbean include a different set of pronouns, typically, ''me, meh, or mi, you, yuh, he, she, it, we, wi'' or ''alawe, wunna'' or ''unu'', and ''dem'' or ''day''. ''I, mi, my, he, she, ih, it, we, wi'' or ''alawe'', ''allayu'' or ''unu'', and ''dem, den, deh'' for "them" with Central Americans.

Other features:
* Consonant changes like [[h-dropping|''h''-dropping]] or [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]] are common. 
* Some might be "sing-songish": Trinidad, Bahamas
* [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|Rhotic]]: Bajan (Barbadian), Guyanese
* Influenced by [[Irish English]] dialects: Jamaican, Bajan 
*Influenced by [[African American Vernacular English]] dialects: Liberian or [[Liberian English]]
* An accent influenced by any of the above, as well as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and indigenous languages: [[Central American]] English dialects such as the [[Belizean Kriol language|Belizean Creole (Kriol)]], or the [[Mískito Coastal Creole]] and [[Rama Cay Creole]] spoken in Nicaragua

However, the English used in media, education and business and in formal or semi-formal discourse approaches the internationally understood variety of [[Standard English]], but with an Afro-Caribbean cadence.

== Samples ==
Standard English: ''Where is that boy?'' {{IPAc-en|hw|ɛər|_|ɪ|z|_|ð|æ|t|_|b|ɔɪ}}

*[[Barbados]]: ''''Wherr dah boi?'''' ({{IPA|[hwer ɪz dæt bɔɪ]}}) (Spoken very quickly [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]], and contains [[glottal stops]])
*[[Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina|San Andrés and Providencia]]: ''''Weh dah boi deh?'''' ({{IPA|[hwe dæt bɔɪ deh]}})
*[[Jamaica]]: ''''Weh dah bwoy  deh?'''' ({{IPA|[weh da buoy de]}}) (sporadic rhoticity; Irish and Scottish influence); or ''''Wey iz dat boi?'''' {{IPA|[weɪ ɪz dæt bɔɪ]}} (non-rhotic; similar to the accents of south western England and Wales))
*[[Belize]]: ''''Weh iz dat bwoy deh?'''' ({{IPA| [weh ɪz dɑt bɔɪ deɪ]}}) (British and North American influence, deeper in tone)
*[[Trinidad]]: ''''Wey dat boy deh?''''
*[[Bahamas]]: ''''Wey dat boy iz?'''' [Some would more likely say [[Bahamian Creole|bey]] instead of boy]
*[[Guyana]] and [[Tobago]]: ''''Weyr iz daht boy/bai?'''' (urban) or ''''Wey dat boy dey?'''' (rural) ({{IPA|[weɪɹ ɪz dɑt baɪ]}}) (Many variations dependent on urban/rural location, Afro or Indo descent or area, and competency in standard English; Sporadic rhoticity )
* [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]: ''''Wey dah boy deh deh?'''' ({{IPA|[weɪ dɑ bɔɪ deɪ deɪ]}}) (Non-rhotic)
*[[Belize]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]], [[Limón province|Limón]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Virgin Islands]]: ''''Wehr iz daht booy?'''' ({{IPA|[weɹ ɪz dɑt buɪ]}}) (Distinct, sporadic rhoticity, pronunciation becomes quite different from "Creole" pronunciation.)
* [[Dominica]]: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Weh dat boy nuh?'/'Weh dat boy be nuh?' &lt;/nowiki&gt;'''(Spoken harshly and with a deep tone)

The written form of the English language in the former and current British controlled Caribbean countries conforms to the spelling and grammar styles of Britain.

'''Charu Chandra Bhattacharya''' ({{lang-bn|চারুচন্দ্র ভট্টাচার্য}}; 1883–1961) was a prominent science teacher and writer of various scientific articles mainly for children in [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="IndiaAcademy1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=India|first1=National Commission for Compilation of History of Sciences in|last2=Academy|first2=Indian National Science|last3=India|first3=National Institute of Sciences of|title=Indian journal of history of science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar0EAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 October 2011|year=1989|publisher=National Institute of Sciences of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Bhattacharya was born to Basanta Kumar Bhattacharya (father) and Menaka Devion 29 June 1883 (16 [[Asharh]], 1290 in the [[Bengali calendar]]). His ancestral house was at [[Harinavi]], [[South 24 Parganas]], West Bengal, India. From childhood, he was an extraordinary student. He passed the "Entrance Examination" with first class from [[Vidyasagar College|Metropolitan Institution]], [[Calcutta]] in 1899. In 1901, Bhattacharya stood 12th place in the ''F. A.'' examination. He did his graduation (''B. A.'') with an Honours from [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] (affiliated to the [[University of Calcutta]] at that time) in 1903 and Masters (''M. A.'') from the University of Calcutta in 1905 in physics.

His professional career was started through the post of a ''Demonstrator'' at Physics department of Presidency College, later he joined the faculty there. Till 1940, he performed this duty for nearly 35 years. He got [[Jagadish Chandra Bosu]] as a teacher when he was a student; and [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Satyendra Nath Bosu]], [[Shishir Kumar Mitra]] &amp; [[Prashanta Chandra Mahalnabish]] as students when he was a teacher of Presidency College. Another student, [[Pratul Chandra Gupta]] once told that, "...he could explain complex matters in a very simple way."

==Personal life==
All of his writings are in a simple dialect. He preferred [[Chalit Bhasha]] than [[Sadhu Bhasha]] while writing. Bhattacharya died on 26 August 1961.

==Contributions==

===As a writer and publisher===
In 1939, he joined in the publication department of [[Visva Bharati]], [[Shantiniketan]]. At that time, the world was terrified by the [[Second World War]] &amp; the department had not sufficient money. But, even in this situation, Bhattacharya dared to publish the ''Rabindra Rochonaboli'' (Collected works by [[Rabindranath Tagore|Rabindranath]]) and finally did it with Prashanta Chandra Mahalnabish, though these books were not of much demand.

Later, when Rabindranath Tagore planned to publish ''Bishwa Vidya Songroho'' and ''LokShiksha'' series of books to promote literacy, Bhattacharya performed this task. First book of LokShiksha was ''BishwaPorichoy'' by Tagore himself, which the poet dedicated to Satyendra Nath Bosu. In 1943, after two years of death of Tagore, Bhattacharya started writing more books of the Bishwa Vidya Songroho series. His first book was about the great scientist: Jagadish Chandra Bosu and named as ''Jagadish Chandrer Abishkar'' (Innovation of Jagadish) (1943). LokShiksha series consisted of 10 books, out of which 5 were of science, and out of nearly 150 books of BishwaVidyaSongroho, around 50 books were of science.

[[Pulin Bihari Sen]], who was among the pioneers of Bengali publication, once told that, {{quote|...The main achievement of him is that, he has created a new hope in culture of science in Bengali by motivating a group of authors in this way.&lt;ref&gt;From the introduction by [[Shyamal Chakraborty]] of ''Chhotoder Sera Bijnan Rochona Sonkolon~ Charu Chandar Bhattacharya'', published from [[Shishu Sahitya Samsad]]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He can be thought of as a successful successor to [[Jagadananda Roy]] &amp; [[Ramendra Sundar Tribedi]]. His first book on popular science was ''Nabya Bijnan'' (Neo Science; 1918). Later, in 1926, his second book ''Ban(g)alir Khadyo'' (Food of Bengali) was published.

He had a deep connection with ''[[Bongiya Bijnan Parishad]]'', founded by [[Satyendra Nath Bosu]]. He was an active member of the first executive committee. He was elected the vice-president from 1949 to 1958, president during 1960–61. His article, ''Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bosu'' was published in the first issue of the famous magazine, ''Jnan O Bijnan'', published from the organisation. Like [[Visva Bharati]], this organisation also had ''LokBijnan'' and ''Bijnan Probesh'' series. First book of LokBijnan series was Bhattacharya's ''Toriter Avyutthan'' in 1949. The first 4 books of the Bijnan Probesh series were also written by him: ''Praromvo'', ''PodarthoVidya'' in 3 volumes; all of these were published in 1949. On 31 December 1956, he was included in the trustee of Bongiya Bijnan Parishad.

After the demise of [[Rajshekhar Bosu]], he delivered the ''First Rajshekhar Bosu Memorial Lecture'', which later is published in a book entitled ''Poromanur Neucleus'' in 1962. A few more books in this context are: ''Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bosu'' (1938), ''Boijnanik Abishkarer Kahini'' (1953), ''Bishwer Upadan'' (1943), ''Byadhir Porajoy'' (1949), ''PodartoVidyar NoboJug'' (1951).

===As an editor===
In first life, Bhattacharya edited a magazine, ''Beporoya''. Later he edited ''Bosudhara'' for a long time. ''Bhandar'', the journal of ''Samabay Samiti'' was edited by him (during the 1926–1932 years). This magazine was also edited by Tagore.

===As a preceptor===
Besides writing on popular science, he wrote 2 textbooks of science for classes VI &amp; VIII of [[West Bengal Board of Secondary Education]]. Bhattacharya contributed in making Bengali [[terminology]] a lot. Calcutta University once established a committee regarding this, where Rajshekhar Bosu was the president and Bhattacharya was the secretary. He also helped the Central Government of India regarding various measurement and terminologies of science.
His articles are often found in many school level textbooks of literature in West Bengal.

The '''Choctaw language''', traditionally spoken by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Choctaw]] people of the southeastern [[United States]], is a member of the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean family]]. [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]], Choctaw and [[Houma language|Houma]] form the Western branch of the Muskogean language family. Although Chickasaw is sometimes listed as a dialect of Choctaw, more extensive documentation of Chickasaw has shown that Choctaw and Chickasaw are best treated as separate but closely related languages.&lt;ref&gt;Munro 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==

The written Choctaw language is based upon the English version of the Roman alphabet and was developed in conjunction with the civilization program of the United States in the early 19th century. Although there are other variations of the Choctaw alphabet, the three most commonly seen are the Byington (Original), Byington/Swanton (Linguistic), and Modern (Mississippi Choctaw).

===Byington (Original)===

[[File:Choctaw alphabet (Speller).svg|570px|center|thumb|The Choctaw "Speller" alphabet as found in the Chahta Holisso Ai Isht Ia Vmmona, 1800s.]]

===Byington/Swanton (Linguistic)===

[[File:Choctaw alphabet (Byington).svg|570px|center|thumb|The Choctaw linguistic alphabet as found in the ''Choctaw Language Dictionary'' by Cyrus Byington and edited by [[John Swanton]], 1909.]]

===Modern (Mississippi Choctaw)===

[[File:Choctaw alphabet.svg|570px|center|thumb|The Modern Choctaw alphabet as used by the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], Present.]]

===Modern (linguistic variant)===

[[Image:Cyrus Byington.png|200px|right|thumb|Rev. [[Cyrus Byington]] worked nearly 50 years translating the Bible into Choctaw. He stayed with the [[Choctaw people|Choctaws]] in Mississippi before removal and followed them to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) after their [[Choctaw Trail of Tears|'removal']].]]

Many publications by linguists about the Choctaw language use a slight variant of the "modern (Mississippi Choctaw)" orthography listed here, where long vowels are written as doubled. In the "linguistic" version, the acute accent shows the position of the pitch accent, rather than the length of the vowel.

The discussion of Choctaw grammar below uses the linguistic variant of the orthography.

==Dialects==
There are three dialects of Choctaw (Mithun 1999):

# "Native" Choctaw on the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]] in [[southeastern Oklahoma]]
# [[Mississippi Choctaw]] of Oklahoma on [[Chickasaw Nation]] of south central Oklahoma (near Durwood)
# Choctaw of the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]] near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]

Other speakers live near [[Tallahassee]], [[Florida]], and with the Koasati in [[Louisiana]], and also a few speakers live in [[Texas]] and [[California]].

#{{note|1}} The only [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stop is {{IPA|/b/}}. The [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} may become partially voiced between vowels, especially {{IPA|/k/}} and for male speakers. Also, the voiceless stops are slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] at the onset of words&lt;ref name="Broadwell15 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:15)&lt;/ref&gt; and before stressed syllables, behaving like English voiceless plosives.
#{{note|2}} According to one analysis, all words must end in a consonant.&lt;ref name="Broadwell19-20 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:19-20)&lt;/ref&gt; Words apparently ending in a vowel actually have a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or a [[voiceless glottal fricative|glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/h/}} as the final consonant. Such consonants become realized when suffixes are attached.
#{{note|3}} The distinction between phonemes {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is [[phoneme#Neutralization, archiphoneme, and underspecification|neutralized]] at the end of words.

====Free variation====
* There is [[free variation]] of some consonants in Choctaw with some speakers:&lt;ref name="Broadwell15-20 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:15-20)&lt;/ref&gt;
# /ɬ/, the voiceless lateral fricative, is pronounced as a voiceless dental fricative [θ].&lt;ref name="Broadwell15-20 2006"/&gt;
: {{IPA|/ɬ/}}→{{IPA|[θ]}}
# The voiceless labiodental fricative /f/ is pronounced as a voiceless bilabial fricative [ɸ].&lt;ref name="Broadwell15-20 2006"/&gt;
: {{IPA|/f/}}→{{IPA|[ɸ]}}

====Phonological processes of consonants====
* In Choctaw {{IPA|/k/}}, the [[voiceless velar plosive]], is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, a [[voiced velar fricative]], between vowels.&lt;ref name="Broadwell15 2006"/&gt;
: {{IPA|/k/}}→{{IPA|[ɣ]}}/V_V
: imofi-aki-lih→imofiy-əɣə̃:-lih

* The [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/h/}} is pronounced like a [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[ç]}} when it precedes the [[voiceless palato-alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/tʃ/}}.&lt;ref name="Broadwell15 2006"/&gt;
: {{IPA|/h/}}→{{IPA|[ç]}}/_{{IPA|tʃ}}
: katihchish→katiçtʃiʃ

# {{note|v1}} In closed syllables, {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, and {{IPA|[ə]}} occur as [[allophone|allophonic]] variants of {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}}. Traditional orthography distinguishes the lax allophones from the tense vowels but failed to distinguish phonemic long vowels from phonemic short ones.
# {{note|v2}} Nasal vowels are not distinguished by duration as are oral vowels. However, nasal vowels are phonetically long, suggesting an underlying phoneme /N/.

====Pitch====
# In Choctaw, very few words are distinguished only by pitch accent.&lt;ref name="Broadwell16-18 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:16-18)&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns in Choctaw have pitch realization at the penultimate syllable or the ultimate syllable.&lt;ref name="Broadwell16-18 2006"/&gt; Verbs in Choctaw will have pitch realization at morphemes indicating tense, but sometimes, pitch directly precedes the tense morpheme.&lt;ref name="Broadwell16-18 2006"/&gt;

===Syllable structure===
{| class="wikitable"
Syllables of Choctaw&lt;ref name="Broadwell18-20 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:18-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

# As is in the chart above, there are three syllable structure types in Choctaw: light, heavy, and super heavy. Possible syllables in Choctaw must contain at least one vowel of any quality.&lt;ref name="Broadwell18-19 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:18-19)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Syllables cannot end with a consonant clusters CC. However, there is an exception with the structure *(C)VCC if a word in Choctaw ends with the suffix /-t/.&lt;ref name="Broadwell18-19 2006"/&gt;
# Syllables do not begin with consonant clusters CC, but there is an exception in an initial /i-/ deletion, which results in a syllable *CCV .&lt;ref name="Broadwell18-19 2006"/&gt;

====Rhythmic lengthening====
* Rhythmic lengthening is the process of lengthening the vowel duration of an even-numbered CV syllable in Choctaw. However, vowels at the end of words are not permitted to undergo that process. Also, if an even-numbered syllable is a verbal prefixes class I or III, the affix's vowel may not undergo lengthening, and the same holds true for noun prefixes class III as well.&lt;ref name="Broadwell 21-26 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:21-26)&lt;/ref&gt;
: CV-CV-CVC→CV-CV&lt;big&gt;''':'''&lt;/big&gt;-CVC
:salahatok→sala:hatok

====Smallest possible word====
* The smallest possible word in Choctaw must contain either two short vowels or one long vowel.&lt;ref name="Broadwell18-20 2006"/&gt;
: a:t

* /A-/ insertion: there are verbs with only one short vowel in their roots. Without an affix attached to the verb root, the verbs become impossible utterances because Choctaw requires either two short vowel or a long vowel for a word to be formed. An initial A- prefix is thus attached to the root of the verb.&lt;ref name="Broadwell18-21 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:18-21)&lt;/ref&gt;
: *bih → a-bih

===Phonological processes===
====Glide insertion====
* When a verb root ends with a long vowel, a glide /w/ or /j/ is inserted after the long vowel.&lt;ref name="Broadwell125 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:125)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ∅→/wa/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; V:____
# Where V: is oo
# boo-a-h→bóowah
* ∅→/ja/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; V:____
# Where V: can be either ii or aa
# talaa-a-h→talaayah

====/i-/ deletion====
* In Choctaw, there is a group of nouns which contain an initial /i-/ that encodes for 3rd person possession. It may be deleted, but if the /i/ is part of a VC syllable structure, the C is also deleted, because the resulting CCV syllable is rarely a permissible syllable structure at the onset of words.&lt;ref name="Broadwell60-62 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:60-62)&lt;/ref&gt;
:/i/→∅ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; #____
: Part 1: /i + C/→∅ + /C/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; #____ 
: Part 2: /∅ + C/→∅ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; #____
:ippókni'→ppókni'→pókni'

====/-l-/ infix assimilation====
* The verbal infix /l/ is pronounced /h, ch, or ɬ/ when /l/ precedes a voiceless consonant.&lt;ref name="Broadwell124-125 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:124-125)&lt;/ref&gt;
:l → {h, tʃ, ɬ} /_C&lt;sub&gt;[-voice]&lt;/sub&gt;
:ho-l-tinah → ho-ɬ-tinah

====Phonological processes of the suffix /-li/====

* There are several assimilation processes that occur with the suffix /-li/. When the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by /f/ /ɫ/ /h/ /m/ /n/ or /w/, the /l/ assimilates to the corresponding consonant that precedes it.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26-27 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:26-27)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by the consonant /b/, the /l/ is realized as /b/.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26-27 2006"/&gt; Third, when the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by the consonant /p/, the /p/ is pronounced as /b/.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26-27 2006"/&gt; Lastly, when the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by the consonant /t/, the /t/ is pronounced as /l/.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26-27 2006"/&gt;
:/l/→/f, ɫ, h, m, n, w/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; /f, ɫ, h, m, n, w/____
: /kobaf-li-h/→ kobaaffih

: /l/→/b/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; /b/____
: /atob-li-h/→ atobbih

: /p/→/b/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; /b/____
: /tap-li-h/→ tablih

: /t/→/l/ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; ____/l/
: /palhat-li-h/→ pallalih

* There are two deletion processes that occur with the suffix /-li/. If the verbal suffix /-li/ precedes the verbal suffix /-tʃi/, the suffix /-li/ may be deleted if the resulting syllable, after deletion, is a consonant cluster.&lt;ref name="Broadwell130 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:130)&lt;/ref&gt; The other process occurs when the verbal suffix /-li/ precedes the suffix /-t/, which results with the suffix /-li/ being sometimes deleted if the syllable /-li/ has not already gone under phonological processes as described above.&lt;ref name="Broadwell219 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:219)&lt;/ref&gt;
:/li/→∅ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; ____/tʃi/
:balii-li-chi-h→balii-chi-h

:/li/→∅ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; ____/t/
:balii-li--h→balii-t

====Schwa insertion====
* Schwa insertion: when a glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}} or a velar stop {{IPA|/k/}} precedes a voiced consonant within a consonant cluster, a schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} is inserted to break up the consonant cluster.&lt;ref name="Broadwell16 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:16)&lt;/ref&gt;
:∅→{{IPA|/ə/}} &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/h/}}____[+voiced] consonant
:∅→{{IPA|/ə/}} &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|/k/}}____[+voiced] consonant
:'ahnih'→/ahənih/

====Vowel deletion====
* Vowel deletion is the process of a short vowel being deleted at a morpheme boundary. It occurs when an affix containing a short vowel at the morpheme boundary binds to a word that also contains a short vowel at the morpheme boundary.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26 2006"&gt;Broadwell (2006:26)&lt;/ref&gt;
# For most vowel deletion cases, the preceding short vowel is deleted at the morpheme boundary.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26 2006"/&gt;
:V→∅ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; ____V
:/baliil&lt;big&gt;'''i-aa'''&lt;/big&gt;tʃĩ-h/→baliil&lt;big&gt;'''aa'''&lt;/big&gt;tʃĩh
# If a class II suffix attaches to a word that results with two short vowels occurring together, the short vowel that follows the class II suffix is deleted.&lt;ref name="Broadwell26 2006"/&gt;
:V→∅ &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; V____
:/s&lt;big&gt;'''a-i'''&lt;/big&gt;baa-waʃoohah/→s&lt;big&gt;'''a'''&lt;/big&gt;baa-waʃoohah

==Morphology and grammar==

===Verbal morphology===
Choctaw verbs display a wide range of inflectional and derivational morphology. In Choctaw, the category of verb may also include words that would be categorized as adjectives or quantifiers in English. Verbs may be preceded by up to three prefixes and followed by as many as five suffixes. In addition, verb roots may contain infixes that convey aspectual information.

====Verb prefixes====
The verbal prefixes convey information about the arguments of the verb: how many there are and their person and number features. The prefixes can be divided into three sorts: [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] markers, applicative markers, and [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphors]] (reflexives and reciprocals). The prefixes occur in the following order: agreement-anaphor-applicative-verb stem.

=====Agreement affixes=====
The agreement affixes are shown in the following chart. All are prefixes except ''-li'', a suffix.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:137-140)&lt;/ref&gt;

I, II, and III are neutral labels for the three person marking paradigms. Some authors (Ulrich 1986, Davies, 1986) have called them actor–patient–dative or nominative–accusative–dative.

The 1sg I agreement marker is /-li/, the only suffix among the agreement markers. It is discussed in this section along with the other agreement markers.

I, II, and III agreement are conditioned by various kinds of arguments. Transitive active verbs show the most predictable pattern. With a typical transitive active verb, the subject will take I agreement, the direct object will take II agreement, and the indirect object will take III agreement.

As the chart above shows, there is no person-number agreement for third person arguments. Consider the following paradigms:
* ''Habli-li-tok'' 'I kicked him/her/it/them.'
* ''Ish-habli-tok'' 'You kicked him/her/it/them.'
* ''Habli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they kicked him/her/it/them.'
* ''Ii-habli-tok'' 'We kicked him/her/it/them.'
* ''Hash-habli-tok'' 'Y'all kicked him/her/it/them.'
* ''Sa-habli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they kicked me.'
* ''Chi-habli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they kicked you.'
* ''Habli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they kicked him/her/it/them.'
* ''Pi-habli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they kicked us.
* ''Hachi-habli-tok'': 'She/he/it/they kicked y'all.'
* ''Am-anoli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they told me.'
* ''Chim-anoli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they told you.'
* ''Im-anoli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they told him/her/it/them.'
* ''Pim-anoli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they told us.'
* ''Hachim-anoli-tok'' 'She/he/it/they told y'all.'

When a [[transitive verb]] occurs with more than one agreement prefix, I prefixes precede II and III prefixes:
: ''Iichipí̱satok.''
: Ii-chi-pí̱sa-tok
: 1pI-2sII-see{{angbr|{{sc|ngr}}}}-{{sc|pt}}
: 'We saw you.'

:''Ishpimanoolitok.''
:Ish-pim-anooli-tok.
:2sI-1pIII-tell-{{sc|pt}}
:'You told us.'

Intransitive verbs show more complicated patterns of agreement. For intransitive verbs, the subjects of active verbs typically trigger I agreement, the subjects of stative verbs typically trigger II agreement, and III agreement is found with the subjects of some psychological verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:140-142)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Baliililitok.''
:Baliili-li-tok
:run-1sI-{{sc|pt}}
:'I ran.'

:''Saniyah.''
:Sa-niya-h.
:1sII-fat-{{sc|tns}}
:'I am fat.'

:''a̱ponnah.''
:a̱-ponna-h.
:1sIII-skilled-{{sc|tns}}
:'I am skilled.'

This type of morphology is generally referred to as [[active–stative]].

=====Negatives=====

The set of agreement markers labelled N above is used with negatives.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:148-152)&lt;/ref&gt; Negation is multiply marked, requiring that an agreement marker from the N set replace the ordinary I agreement, the verb appear in the lengthened grade (see discussion below), and that the suffix /-o(k)-/ follow the verb, with deletion of the preceding final vowel. The optional suffix /-kii/ may be added after /-o(k)-/. Consider the following example:
* ''Akíiyokiittook.''
* Ak-íiya-o-kii-ttook''
* 1sN-go{{angbr|{{sc|lgr}}}}-{{sc|neg-neg-dpast}}
* 'I did not go.'

Compare this with the affirmative counterpart:
* ''Iyalittook''
* Iya-li-ttook.
* go-1sI-{{sc|dpast}}
* 'I went'.

To make this example negative, the 1sI suffix /-li/ is replaced by the 1sN prefix /ak-/; the verb root ''iya'' is lengthened and accented to yield ''íiya''; the suffix /-o/ is added, the final vowel of ''iiya'' is deleted, and the suffix /-kii/ is added.

=====Anaphoric prefixes=====
Reflexives are indicated with the /ili-/ prefix, and reciprocals with /itti-/:&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:98-99)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ilipísalitok''.
* li-pí̱sa-li-tok.
* {{sc|refl}}-see{{angbr|{{sc|ngr}}}}-1sI-{{sc|pt}}
* 'I saw myself'.

====Verb suffixes====
:While the verbal prefixes indicate relations between the verb and its arguments, the suffixes cover a wider semantic range, including information about valence, modality, tense and evidentiality.

The following examples show modal and tense suffixes like /-aachii̱/ 'irrealis'(approximately equal to future), /-tok/ 'past tense', /-h/ 'default tenses':&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:169-183)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Baliilih.''
:Baliili-h.
:run-{{sc|tns}}
:'She runs.'

:''Baliilaachi̱h.''
:Baliili-aachi̱-h.
:run-{{sc|irr-tns}}
:'She will run.'

There are also suffixes that show evidentiality, or the source of evidence for a statement, as in the following pair:&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:184-190)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Nipi' awashlihli.''
:Nipi' awashli-hli 
:meat fry-first:hand
:'She fried the meat.' (I saw/heard/smelled her do it.)

:''Nipi' awashlitoka̱sha.''
:Nipi' awashli-tok-a̱sha
:meat fry-{{sc|pt}}-guess
:'She fried the meat.' (I guess)

There are also suffixes of illocutionary force which may indicate that the sentence is a question, an exclamation, or a command:&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:191-193)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Awashlitoko̱?''
:Awashli-tok-o̱
:fry-{{sc|pt-q}}
:'Did she fry it?'

:''Chahta' siahokii!''
:Chahta' si-a-h-okii
:Choctaw 1sII-be-{{sc|tns-excl}}
:'I'm Choctaw!' or 'I certainly am a Choctaw!'

====Verbal infixes====
Choctaw verb stems have various infixes that indicate their aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:161-168)&lt;/ref&gt; These stem variants are traditionally referred to as 'grades'. The table below shows the grades of Choctaw, along with their main usage.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name of Grade
! How it is formed
! When it is used
|-
| n-grade
| infix n in the next to last (penultimate) syllable; put accent on this syllable
| to show that the action is durative (lasts some definite length of time)
|-
| l-grade
| put accent on next to last (penultimate) syllable; lengthen the vowel if the syllable is open
| before a few common suffixes, such as the negative /-o(k)/ and the switch-reference markers /-cha/ and /-na/
|-
| hn-grade
| insert a new syllable /-hV̱/ after the (original) next to last (penultimate) syllable. V̱ is a nasalized copy of the vowel that precedes it.
| to show that the action of the verb repeats
|-
| y-grade
| insert -Vyy- before the next to last (penultimate) syllable
| to show delayed inception
|-
| g-grade
| formed by lengthening the penultimate vowel of the stem, accenting the antepenultimate vowel, and geminating the consonant that follows the antepenult.
| to show delayed inception
|-
| h-grade
| insert -h- after the penultimate vowel of the stem.
| to show sudden action
|}

Some examples that show the grades follow:

In this example the l-grade appears because of the suffixes /-na/ 'different subject' and /-o(k)/ 'negative':

:''... lowat táahana falaamat akíiyokiittook.''
:lowa-t táaha-na falaama-t ak-íiya-o-kii-ttook
:burn-{{sc|ss}} complete{{angbr|{{sc|lgr}}}}-{{sc|ds}} return-{{sc|ss}} 1sN-go{{angbr|{{sc|lgr}}}}-{{sc|neg-neg-dpast}}
:'... (the school) burned down and I didn't go back.'

The g-grade and y-grade typically get translated into English as "finally VERB-ed":

:''Taloowah.''
:Taloowa-h 
:sing-{{sc|tns}} 
:'He sang.'

:''Tálloowah.''
:Tálloowa-h 
:sing{{angbr|{{sc|ggr}}}}-{{sc|tns}} 
:'He finally sang.'

The hn-grade is usually translated as 'kept on VERBing':

:''Ohó̱bana nittak pókkooli' oshtattook.''
:Ohó̱ba-na nittak pókkooli' oshta-ttook
:rain{{angbr|{{sc|hngr}}}}-{{sc|ds}} day ten four-{{sc|dpast}}
:'It kept on raining for forty days.'

The h-grade is usually translated "just VERB-ed" or "VERB-ed for a short time":

:{{Lang|cho|Nóhsih}}.
:Nóhsi-h
:sleep{{angbr|{{sc|hgr}}}}-{{sc|tns}}
:'He took a quick nap.

===Nominal morphology===

====Noun prefixes====
Nouns have prefixes that show agreement with a possessor.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:52-63)&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement markers from class II are used on a lexically specified closed class of nouns, which includes many (but not all) of the kinship terms and body parts. This is the class that is generally labeled [[Inalienable noun|inalienable]].

:''sanoshkobo''' 'my head'
:sa-noshkobo' 
:1sII-head

:''chinoshkobo''' 'your head' 
:chi-noshkobo'
:2sII-head

:''noshkobo''' 'his/her/its/their head' 
:noshkobo' 
:head

:''sashki''' 'my mother' 
:sa-ishki' 
:1sII-mother

:''chishki''' 'your mother' 
:chi-ishki'
:2sII-mother

Nouns that are not lexically specified for II agreement use the III agreement markers:

:''a̱ki''' 'my father'
:a̱-ki' 
:1sIII-father

:''amofi''' 'my dog' 
:am-ofi'
:1sIII-dog

Although systems of this type are generally described with the terms alienable and inalienable, this terminology is not particularly appropriate for Choctaw, since alienability implies a semantic distinction between types of nouns. The morphological distinction between nouns taking II agreement and III agreement in Choctaw only partly coincides with the semantic notion of alienability.

====Noun suffixes====
Choctaw nouns can be followed by various determiner and case-marking suffixes, as in the following examples, where we see
determiners such as /-ma/ 'that', /-pa/ 'this', and /-akoo/ 'contrast' and case-markers /-(y)at/ 'nominative' and /-(y)a̱/ 'accusative':&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:64-92)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''alla' naknimat''
:alla' nakni-m-at
:child male-that-{{sc|nom}}
:'that boy (nominative)'

:''Hoshiit itti chaahamako̱ o̱biniilih.''
:Hoshi'-at itti' chaaha-m-ako̱ o̱-biniili-h 
:bird-{{sc|nom}} tree tall-that-{{sc|cntr:acc}} {{sc|superessive}}-sit-{{sc|tns}} 
:'The bird is sitting on that tall tree.' (Not on the short one.)

The last example shows that nasalizing the last vowel of the preceding N is a common way to show the accusative case.

===Word order and case marking===
:The simplest sentences in Choctaw consist of a verb and a tense marker, as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell (2006:32)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''o̱batok.''
:o̱ba-tok
:rain-{{sc|pt}}
:'It rained.'

:''Niyah.''
:niya-h
:fat-{{sc|tns}}
:'She/he/it is fat, they are fat.'

:''Pí̱satok.''
:pí̱sa-tok
:see{{angbr|{{sc|ngr}}}}-{{sc|pt}}
:'She/he/it/they saw her/him/it/them.'

:As these examples show, there are no obligatory noun phrases in a Choctaw sentence, nor is there any verbal agreement that indicates a third person subject or object. There is no indication of grammatical gender, and for third person arguments there is no indication of number. (There are, however, some verbs with suppletive forms that indicate the number of a subject or object, e.g. iyah 'to go (sg.)', ittiyaachih 'to go (du.)', and ilhkolih 'to go (pl)'.)

When there is an overt subject, it is obligatorily marked with the nominative case /-at/. Subjects precede the verb

:''Hoshiyat apatok.''
:hoshi'-at apa-tok 
:bird-{{sc|nom}} eat-{{sc|pt}} 
:'The birds ate them.'

When there is an overt object, it is optionally marked with the accusative case /-a̱/
:''Hoshiyat sho̱shi(-ya̱) apatok.''
:hoshi'-at sho̱shi'(-a̱) apa-tok.
:bird-{{sc|nom}} bug-({{sc|acc}}) eat-{{sc|pt}}
:'The birds ate the bugs.'

The Choctaw sentence is normally verb-final, and so the head of the sentence is last.

Some other phrases in Choctaw also have their head at the end. Possessors precede the possessed noun in the Noun Phrase:

:''ofi' hohchifo'''
:dog name 
:'the dog's name'

Choctaw has postpositional phrases with the postposition after its object:

:''tamaaha' bili̱ka''
:town near
:'near a town'

==Examples==
Some common Choctaw phrases (written in the "Modern" orthography):

*Choctaw: ''{{Lang|cho|Chahta}}''

'''Discontinuous-constituent Phrase Structure Grammar''' (DCPSG) (distinct from Discontinuous Phrase Structure Grammar/DPSG) is a [[Formalism (linguistics)|formalism]] for describing discontinuous [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structures]] in [[natural language]], such as [[Verb phrase|verb phrases]] in [[VSO language|VSO]] languages. The formalism was introduced in the slightly more constrained form of Discontinuous-constituent Phrase Structure Grammar with Subscripts and Deletes (DCPSGsd) in Harman (1963).&lt;ref name="harman1963"&gt;Harman, Gilbert H. 1963. Generative Grammars without Transformation Rules: A Defense of Phrase Structure. ''Language'' 39(4), 597-616.&lt;/ref&gt; DCPSGs describe a superset of the [[Context-free language|context-free languages]], by means of rewrite rules that permit a limited amount of wrapping, similar to that found in [[Head grammar]].
{{TOC right}}

==Description==

Re''write rules of a '''DCPSG''' are identical to those of a CFG, with the addition of a meta-symbol, denoted here as an underscore. ''DCPSG'' rules therefore have the general form &lt;math&gt;X \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a string of terminal symbols and/or non-terminal symbols and at most one underscore.

The rewrite semantics of DCPSG are identical as those of a CFG when the rule being used does not contain an underscore: given a rule &lt;math&gt;X \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

For rules with an underscore, the rewrite [[semantics]] are slightly different: given a rule &lt;math&gt;X \to \alpha \_ \beta&lt;/math&gt;, an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; being inserted immediately after the next non-terminal that is introduced at the same time. Using strict left-most productions, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is simply inserted immediately after the non-terminal that follows &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; prior to the rewrite.
''

==Example==

We can characterize the gross sentence structure of a VSO language such as [[Irish language|Irish]] with the following rules (substituting English words for Irish words, and using subscripts solely for demonstration of discontinuity):

: &lt;chem&gt;S -&gt; VP\ NP_{subj}&lt;/chem&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;VP -&gt; ITV ~|~ TV \ \_ \ NP_{obj}&lt;/chem&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;NP -&gt; \it{John} ~|~ \it{Susan} ~|~ ...&lt;/chem&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;ITV -&gt; \it{ran} ~|~ \it{danced} ~|~ ...&lt;/chem&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;TV -&gt; \it{saw} ~|~ \it{met} ~|~ ...&lt;/chem&gt;

A derivation for the sentence ''saw John Susan'', where ''John'' is the subject, and ''Susan'' is the direct object forming a VP with ''saw'' is:

: &lt;chem&gt;S -&gt; VP\ NP_{subj} -&gt; TV\ NP_{subj} NP_{obj} -&gt; \mathit{saw}\ NP_{subj}\ NP_{obj} -&gt; \mathit{saw}\ \mathit{John}\ NP_{obj} -&gt; \mathit{saw}\ \mathit{John}\ \mathit{Mary}&lt;/chem&gt;

'''English-speaking Quebecers''' (also known as '''Anglo-Quebecers''', '''English Quebecers''', or '''Anglophone Quebecers''', all with the optional spelling '''Quebeckers'''; in French ''Anglo-Québécois'', ''Québécois Anglophone'', or simply ''Anglo'') refers to the English-speaking ([[English Canadian|anglophone]]) minority of the primarily French-speaking ([[francophone]]) province of [[Quebec]], Canada.  The English-speaking community in Quebec constitutes an official linguistic minority population under Canadian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Department of justice Canada  |publisher= Department of Justice Canada  |title=  Constitutuion Acts 1867 to 1982 |accessdate=2006-11-16 |url= http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English-speaking Quebeckers have origins in England, Ireland, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand; in other words, from English-speaking countries with similar religions such as Catholic or Protestant &lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; with large emigration with Canadian provinces, an early and strong English language education program in Quebec schools, and waves of international immigration.  This makes estimating the population difficult. According to the 2011 Canadian census, 599,225 (7.7% of population, including 4% [[Italian Canadian]]) in Quebec declare English as a [[mother tongue]].

More ambiguous are the 834,950 (10.7%) that use mostly English as their [[home language]], and 1,058,250 (13.5%) that comprise the Canadian Official Language Minority, having English as their [[Bilingualism in Canada#Official Languages Regulations|First Official Canadian language spoken]].&lt;ref name="Population by first official language spoken"/&gt;

[[Statistics Canada]] uses census data to keep track of minority language communities in Canada. It has recorded ''[[mother tongue]]'' (the first language learned as a child and still spoken) since 1921, ''[[home language]]'' (language spoken at home) since 1971,  and ''first official language  learned'' (English or French) since 1991. In addition, conversational knowledge of English and French is documented.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

A considerable number of census respondents in each category cite equal proficiency, knowledge, and use of different languages. In this case, census respondents are divided evenly among the language groups involved.

As allophone immigrants (mother tongue other than English or French) generally arrive with knowledge of either English or French and eventually integrate into these two linguistic groups,  ''first official language learned'' is used to determine the Official Language minority population. It is used by the federal government and Quebec anglophone community organizations to determine the demand for minority language services.&lt;ref name="gmcdi_a"/&gt; Specifically, it classifies members of immigrant groups who learn English before French as English-speaking. Half of the people equally proficient since childhood in both English and French are placed into each linguistic community.

The English-speaking population has shown an accelerated decline in population between 1971 and 2001. During this interval, the number of mother tongue anglophones has decreased from 788,830 to 591,365 representing a drop in its share of the Quebec population from 13.1% to 8.3%. This is attributed primarily to an exodus of anglophones to other provinces and raised questions about the sustainability of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Marc V. Levine |title= The Reconquest of Montreal: Language policy and social change in a bilingual city|page = 122 |work= |publisher= |year= 1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CwhnBqgSpwC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=anglophone+exodus#v=onepage&amp;q=anglophone%20exodus&amp;f=false |quote= ... the Anglophone exodus raised fundamental questions about the "survivability" of English-speaking Montreal...|isbn= 978-0-87722-899-8 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration from other countries and integration of allophones helped to partially alleviate the impact of this trend. In 2001, one in three immigrants to Quebec was English-speaking and settled in Montreal. This made the decrease in home-language anglophones less pronounced, particularly in the Montreal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Government of Canada Privy Council Office |title=Action Plan for Official Languages |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2007-04-27 |url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/default.asp?Language=E&amp;Page=ActionPlan&amp;doc=ActionPlan/chap4_e.htm#S4.2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224070544/http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/default.asp?Language=E&amp;Page=ActionPlan&amp;doc=ActionPlan%2Fchap4_e.htm#S4.2 |archivedate=2007-02-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is rapidly changing as the vast majority of immigrants now adopt French as their first language: three quarters of linguistic transfers of allophones arriving between 2001 and 2006 allophones arriving have been towards French instead of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=   The Canadian Press |title= Quebec immigrants turning to French: census | publisher = CTV News | date = 2007-12-04  |accessdate= 2008-01-22 |url= http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071204/quebec_census_071204/20071204/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 census showed an increase of the Anglophone population in Quebec.&lt;ref name="www12.statcan.ca"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/language/anglo_pop.cfm 2006 Census: The Evolving Linguistic Portrait, 2006 Census: Findings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of 16,000 people (from 591,000 in 2001 to 607,000 in 2006) represents a growth rate of +2.7%, which is higher than that for the Francophone population (+2.0%) for the same period.&lt;ref name="www12.statcan.ca"/&gt; This increase is attributed to a much reduced net outmigration of Anglophones, with some 34,000 departures vs 26,000 arrivals (primarily from Ontario).&lt;ref name="www12.statcan.ca"/&gt;

Emigration to other Canadian provinces was perceived as the biggest challenge facing the continued presence of English-language communities in Quebec, particularly outside Montreal, during the 1976 to 2001 period. English-speakers accounted for half the out-migrants from Quebec as they are extremely mobile compared to their francophone neighbours because they share a language and cultural identity with most other Canadians and North Americans.&lt;ref name="going_forward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ocol-clo/going_forward-e/html/archives/sst_es/2004/jedwab/jedwab_2004_e.htm#II_a | title= Going Forward: The Evolution of Quebec’s English-Speaking Community|accessdate=2007-03-17 |last= Jedwab |first= Jack |authorlink= Jack Jedwab |date=November 2004 |publisher= Commissioner of Official Languages |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey on the matter, English-speaking Quebecers cited limited economic prospects and politics ([[Legal dispute over Quebec's language policy|Quebec's language policies]] and the [[Quebec Sovereignty movement|Quebec independence]]) as primary reasons for leaving.&lt;ref name = stay_or_go&gt;{{cite web| first = Marie-Odile| last = Magnan | first2 = Madeleine | last2= Gauthier| work = Groupe sur la recherche sur le migration des jeunes | title = To stay or not to stay: Migrations of young Anglo-Quebecer  | publisher =  Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS): Urbanisation, Culture, et Société |date=October 2005 | url = http://www.ucs.inrs.ca/pdf/RapportMagnanVersionAglaise050222.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-17|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These political factors are also cited as having led to fewer Canadians from other provinces settling in Quebec.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Anglophones are also less likely to migrate within the province than Francophones and Allophones. This is due to a strong sense of belonging among those in the Montreal area, the relative lack of English-language services and institutions outside Montreal, and a weak sense of identification with Quebec.&lt;ref name = "stay_or_go"/&gt;

Despite a lull in this outflux during an economic boom and break from separatist governments in 2003, this outmigration had returned to established levels by 2006 and is projected to continue at these rates over the next five years{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. At the time, this forecast made researcher Jack Jedwab predict a continued long term decline of the community.&lt;ref name="red_migration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acs-aec.ca/Polls/Quebec%20Turns%20Red%20on%20Migration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121802/http://www.acs-aec.ca/Polls/Quebec%20Turns%20Red%20on%20Migration.pdf |archive-date=2007-08-09 |title=Quebec Turns Red Again When it Comes to Interprovincial Migration |accessdate=2007-03-17 |last=Jedwab |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Jedwab |date=2007-01-15 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Association for Canadian Studies |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion of Quebec's English-speaking population resides in or near Montreal. Most reside on the [[Island of Montreal]], particularly in the [[West Island]] and in the western half of [[Montreal]]'s urban core, where there is a network of [[English language]] educational, social, cultural, economic, and medical institutions.

The earliest English-speaking Quebecers arrived in Montreal at the beginning of the British regime in the second half of the 18th century. American merchants, [[United Empire Loyalists]] and [[Scottish Canadian|Anglo-Scot]] [[Protestants]] founded Quebec's public and private English-language institutions and would represent Quebec's elite merchant and financial classes up until the 1960s; the heritage of this era remains in neighbourhoods such as [[Westmount]] and the [[Golden Square Mile]].

[[Irish Quebecers]] established their  schools, churches and hospitals in the mid-19th century in traditionally working-class neighbourhoods such as [[Pointe St. Charles|Point St. Charles]] and [[Griffintown]]. Separate English-language confessional (Protestant and Catholic) school systems emerged and would be guaranteed in the [[British North America Act]] in 1867 thanks to [[D'Arcy McGee]], a prominent Irish Montrealer. In 2000, these school boards were merged into English boards.

An English-speaking [[Black Canadians|Black Canadian]] community grew in the 1860s with the coming of the railway industry centred in Montreal, settling in [[Little Burgundy]] and [[Saint-Henri]].

The early 1900s brought waves of settlers from all over Europe. [[Jewish Canadian|Jews]] from Poland, Romania and Russia established a large Jewish community, and integrated into the English-speaking "Protestant" schools and businesses. Italian immigrants would adopt the Catholic institutions of either the Irish or French-Canadian community. These and many other immigrant communities would initially settle along [[Saint Lawrence Boulevard]] (nicknamed "The Main"), before moving on to more prosperous suburbs such as [[Côte Saint-Luc]] and  [[St. Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Léonard]].

In the 1950s, more immigration from Europe again changed the face of Montreal. Immigrants flocked to Montreal from all across Europe, bolstering the numbers of established cultural communities, with a [[Greek Canadian|Greek]] community planting strong roots in the English-speaking community.

Immigrants of today come from all over the world and are largely more secular than members of the established English-speaking communities. Also, a larger proportion are French-speaking than before. However, immigrants from English-speaking countries such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the United States, and [[Jamaican Canadian|Jamaica]]  usually come with a knowledge of English; [[Asian Canadians|Asians]] account for the fastest growing segment of the population, with over 26,000 Asians coming to Quebec between 1996 and 2001 and having English as their first official language spoken in 2001; as a result, over a quarter  of anglophones now come from [[visible minority]] groups.&lt;ref name="gmcdi_a"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greater Montreal Community Development Initiative (GMCDI) |title=Demographics and the Long-term Development of the English-speaking Communities of the Greater Montreal Region |publisher=The Quebec Community Groups Network |location=Montreal |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.qcgn.ca/files/QCGN/a20070409_demographics.pdf |accessdate=2007-04-18 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121803/http://www.qcgn.ca/files/QCGN/a20070409_demographics.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[First nation]] peoples such as the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], the Cree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscree.qc.ca/ Cree School Board&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Inuit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kativik.qc.ca/ Commission scolaire Kativik School Board - Nunavik&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also use English in their day-to-day lives. These groups blend in easily in a community that defines itself increasingly as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]].

Many American and [[Anglo-Scottish]] merchants settled in [[Quebec City]] in the nineteenth century, but the majority of anglophones were working-class [[Irish Quebecers|Irish immigrants]]. In the 1860s, the proportion of English-speakers reached a historic high of 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morrin Centre |publisher=Literary and Historical Society of Quebec |title=Anglos in Québec |accessdate=2007-03-15 |url=http://www.morrin.org/pages/anglos.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712232855/http://www.morrin.org/pages/anglos.php |archivedate=2007-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Louisa.

All English-speaking communities outside the Montreal metropolitan area have been in decline for over a century. However, communities near Montreal, the border with Ontario, and the border with the United States are still large enough to constitute a sizeable yet shrinking minority in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CBC| title=Where are Quebec's Anglos? Map of population distribution from 2011 Census | accessdate=2013-03-02 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/features/livingenglish/anglophone-census-map/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century and the early 19th century, the [[Eastern Townships]] and the [[Chateauguay Valley]] were pioneered by English-speaking settlers who moved north from the United States; the first were Loyalists (Tories in the U.S.) wishing to remain [[British Empire|British subjects]] after [[The American Revolution]]. Very few of these Loyalists were allowed to stay in the Eastern Townships and were in fact forced by the British to move from the lands that they were squatting on because the British desired to keep the Eastern Townships as an unpopulated buffer zone between the French Canadians and the Americans. By the end of the 1790s, American homesteaders were allowed to come northward to settle lands across the border. Immigrants from England, Scotland, and Ireland would further settle these regions in the mid 19th century, and pioneer the [[Outaouais (region)|Outaouais region]] ([[Gatineau]] and [[Pontiac Regional County Municipality, Quebec|Pontiac region]]) and many [[Laurentides|Laurentian]] communities. By the end of the nineteenth century, many grew into thriving small cities: [[Shawville, Quebec|Shawville]], Aylmer, [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], [[Lachute]], [[Huntingdon, Quebec|Huntingdon]], St. Johns (now [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]]), [[Granby, Quebec|Granby]], [[Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec|Saint-Hyacinthe]], [[Victoriaville]], [[Drummondville]], [[Magog, Quebec|Magog]], [[Sherbrooke]], [[Sawyerville, Quebec|Sawyerville]]. Migration to larger cities in Canada (including Montreal) has since reduced the English-speaking population in these regions.

There has been English-speaking settlement or immigration to some degree in almost all areas of Quebec at one time or another.  What remains today in many regions is only symbolic as anglophones have moved away or assimilated into the French-speaking community. English-speaking communities in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] and the [[Basse-Côte-Nord Territory, Quebec|Lower North Shore]] remain, as well as a small community in the [[Magdalen Islands]].

==Media==
[[File:Cbc-bldg.jpg|right|thumb|[[Maison Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada building]] in [[Montreal]]]]
English-language media tend to come from outside the province. Most local English-language media are based in the Montreal area.

===Television===
The province's English-language television stations are [[CBMT-DT|CBMT]] ([[CBC Television|CBC]]), [[CFCF-DT|CFCF]] ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]]), [[CKMI-DT|CKMI]] ([[Global Television Network|Global]]) and [[CJNT-DT|CJNT]] ([[Citytv]]). These stations are available on cable throughout the province and can also be received for free with the use of home TV antennas in cities located near television transmission towers.

Anglophones in the Outaouais region are served by [[Media in Ottawa–Gatineau|English stations from Ottawa]]. Southern Quebec is also served by American network affiliates from [[Vermont]] and [[North Country, New York|New York's North Country]] who actually depend on the Montreal market for most of their revenue. The [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington, VT]] stations are [[WCAX]] ([[CBS]]), [[WVNY]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WFFF-TV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), and [[Vermont Public Television]] ([[PBS]]). The [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh, NY]] stations are [[WPTZ]] ([[NBC]]) and [[WCFE]] ([[PBS]]). These stations are carried on Montreal-area cable networks, along with other English and French-language cable stations. (See [[Multichannel television in Canada]].) Western Montreal carries more English-language programming to better serve the large English-speaking market.

===Radio===
English-language radio stations in Montreal include [[AM radio|AM]] stations [[CKGM (AM)|CKGM]] (sports), [[CJAD (AM)|CJAD]] (news/talk) and [[CINW (AM)|CINW]] (''oldies''), and [[FM radio|FM]] outlets [[CBME-FM|CBME]] ([[CBC Radio One]]), [[CKUT-FM|CKUT]] ([[campus radio]] from [[McGill University]]), [[CFQR-FM|CFQR]] (''Q92'', adult contemporary), [[CJFM-FM|CJFM]] (''Virgin Radio 96'', Hot AC), [[CBM-FM|CBM]] ([[CBC Radio 2]]) and [[CHOM-FM|CHOM]] (mainstream rock). Listeners in [[Sherbrooke]], [[Lennoxville, Quebec|Lennoxville]] and the [[Eastern Townships]] are served by CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 and the [[Bishop's University]] station [[CJMQ-FM|CJMQ]]. CBC Radio One is also available in many other Quebec communities. Parts of the province also receive English-language signals from [[Ontario]], [[New Brunswick]], [[New York (state)|New York]] or [[New England]]. However, no community in the province besides Montreal has an English commercial station.

===Newspapers and periodicals===
[[File:Gazette Montreal.png|right|thumb|Offices of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' on [[Saint Catherine Street]] in Montreal]]
Quebec has two English-language daily newspapers: the large ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', and the small ''[[The Record (Sherbrooke)|Sherbrooke Record]]'', a local newspaper for the Eastern Townships. Many smaller communities in Quebec also have English-language weekly papers, including ''[[The Equity]]'' in [[Shawville, Quebec|Shawville]], ''[[The Pontiac Journal]]'', a bilingual and bimonthly paper, the ''[[Stanstead Journal]]'' in [[Stanstead, Quebec|Stanstead]], ''[[The First Informer]]'' in the [[Magdalen Islands]], ''[[The Gleaner (Quebec)|The Gleaner]]'' in [[Huntingdon, Quebec|Huntingdon]], the ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph]]'' in Quebec City, ''[[SPEC (newspaper)|SPEC]]'' in the [[Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine|Gaspé]] region, the ''[[West Quebec Post]]'' in [[Buckingham, Quebec|Buckingham]], the ''[[Aylmer Bulletin]]'' in [[Aylmer, Quebec|Aylmer]], the ''[[Townships Sun]]'' in Lennoxville, the ''Suburban, Montreal Island's Largest English Weekly'', the ''Chronicle'' and the ''West End Times'' in the [[West Island|West Island of Montreal]] and ''[[The LowDown to Hull and Back News]]'' in [[La Pêche]]. From the 1990s until 2012, Montreal also had two English alternative weeklies, ''[[Hour Community|Hour]]'' and ''[[Montreal Mirror|Mirror]]''.

''[[Maisonneuve (magazine)|Maisonneuve]]'' is a culturally literate bimonthly general-interest English-language magazine published in Montreal.

==Politics==
{{See also|Politics of Quebec|Legal dispute over Quebec's language policy}}
{{POV section|date=February 2016}}

The politics of language has always played against issues of [[Quebec nationalism]] and [[Quebec separatism]].  English-speaking Quebeckers maintain a strong [[Canadian identity]], with about 99% opposing [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]] in [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980]] and [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995]] referendums. Having no distinct political representation in Quebec, they tend to vote for the federalist [[Liberal Party of Canada]] federally and for the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] at the provincial level. In 2001, English-speaking Quebeckers viewed provincial [[Charter of the French Language|language legislation]] as the principal challenge facing their community and more generally look to the federal government to protect their individual and collective rights from provincial government limits on access to English education, health care, government services, and visibility on public signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Jack Jedwab |publisher=Missisquoi Institute|title=  ‘New’ and Not So New Anglos: An Analysis of Quebec Anglophone opinion on the province’s socio-political realities|accessdate=2007-03-02 |url=http://www.chssn.org/en/pdf/New%20Anglo-final.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian constitution]] protects the language rights of English-speaking communities and individuals in Quebec; however, since 1867, the Quebec provincial government has had full jurisdiction over schools, with only Section 93 of the British North America Act of 1867  ([[Constitution Act, 1867]]) guaranteeing Protestant confessional boards the right to administer most English schools. Section 133 still allows French and English to be used in the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[National Assembly of Quebec|Legislature of Quebec]] and makes both languages mandatory for the laws, records, and journals of those houses. It also gives any person the right to plead in either English or French in any of the Courts of Quebec. In 1982, Section 23 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] guaranteed the right of Canadian citizens educated in English in Canada to attend English schools. This paved the way for the Constitutional Amendment, 1999 (Québec) which was passed unanimously by the federal Parliament and the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] that transformed Protestant confessional school boards into English linguistic school boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = David|last = Young |author2=Lawrence Bezeau | title = Moving From Denominational to Linguistic Education in Quebec | journal = Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy | issue = 24| pages =| publisher =  | date=  2003-02-28 | accessdate = 2007-03-02| url = http://www.umanitoba.ca/publications/cjeap/articles/youngbezeau.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government also maintains the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] of 1988 that ensures equality between English and French in the federal civil service and ensures that official minority language groups in Canada receive service in their language where numbers warrant and that supports the development of communities of speakers of official languages when they constitute a minority in a province or territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages |title=Official Languages Act |year=1988 |accessdate=2007-03-02 |url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/ola_llo.asp?Lang=English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106052455/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/ola_llo.asp?Lang=English |archivedate=2006-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Politics of Quebec|Provincial legislation]] has also delimited the language rights of English-speaking Quebeckers and the role of their institutions since the [[Quiet Revolution]] as French-speaking [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] sought to improve their economic prospects, assimilate immigrants into their community to maintain their population, and establish French as a language of business.  [[Bill 63]], introduced by the [[Union nationale (Quebec)|Union nationale]] government in 1969, required that English schools provide all students with a working knowledge of French. In 1974, the Liberal government of [[Robert Bourassa]] passed [[Bill 22]] and restricted access to English schools to children who could pass a language test. In 1977, the separatist [[Parti Québécois]] passed the more intensive [[Charter of the French Language]] (Bill 101). This law made French the sole language of the civil service and of business in private workplaces with over 50 employees and established the right of all Quebeckers to work solely in French, now the sole official language of the province; it also favoured a demographic shift towards more francophones in Quebec by restricting access to English-language schools to children whose parents had attended Quebec English grade schools or high schools. The Charter is generally seen as emancipatory and a protector of culture and is immensely popular among majority francophone Quebeckers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claude |last=Bélanger |title=The Language Laws of Quebec |publisher=Marianopolis College |year=2000 |url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm |accessdate=2007-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209161455/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm |archivedate=2006-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Charter provisions, though, deeply alienated English-speaking Quebeckers. The Charter cut off access to English schools to all but children who had parents who had received their education in English in Quebec. The Charter also eliminated the Constitutional guarantee to English legal proceedings and eliminated English translations of Quebec laws. It banned all languages other than French on all public signs, both inside and outside. (The regulations for signs would be modified in 1988 and 1993.) The law has therefore polarised Quebec along linguistic lines to this day. [[Legal dispute over Quebec's language policy|Legal challenges]] by  English-speaking Quebeckers using provisions of the Canadian constitution and [[international law]] overturned some of these provisions, forcing subsequent Quebec governments to blunt these Charter provisions many times{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The Charter coupled with the looming [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980 Referendum on Sovereignty]] triggered an exodus of English-speaking Quebeckers between 1976 and 1980, exacerbating the already existing demographic decline. Head offices that employed anglophones moved mostly to Toronto, taking their employees with them. Structural unemployment in the private sector with the mass hiring of francophones in an expanding civil service limited the economic opportunities of especially young non-bilingual anglophones in Quebec leading them to search for work elsewhere. Young highly educated anglophones, despite high rates of bilingualism and increased contact and openness to francophones, cite limited economic prospects caused by linguistic discrimination and an unsatisfactory political climate as the major factors in their departure. By 2001, 50% of mother-tongue anglophones had left the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Marie-Odile | last=Magnan| title= "To Stay or not to Stay:" Migrations of Young Anglo-Quebecers | publisher =  Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) |year = 2005 |url = http://www.ucs.inrs.ca/pdf/RapportMagnanVersionAglaise050222.pdf| accessdate=2007-03-02 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with increasing marginalisation from the political process in Quebec, English-speaking community groups across the province banded together to form [[Alliance Quebec]], a provincial lobby group that would advocate for English-language education, health, and social services. It was supported by the federal [[Commissioner of Official Languages]] and members worked with provincial administrations to maintain and increase access to English government services across the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = GARY  | last=CALDWELL| title= Alliance Québec | publisher =  |year = 2005 |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009296| accessdate=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sign laws governing language are a particular irritant to English-speaking Quebeckers{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. When the original Charter provision requiring French only on commercial signs and in trade names was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1988, the Liberal government of Robert Bourassa passed Bill 178 that made French the only language that could be used on outdoor commercial signs. This required invoking the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] in the [[Canadian Constitution]], which overrode the Supreme Court decision. Discontent with the Liberals led anglophones in Western Montreal to form the [[Equality Party (Quebec)|Equality Party]] in protest, which surprised many by electing 4 candidates in the 1989 provincial election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = R. | last=HUDON| title= Bill 178 | publisher = [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]   |year = 2007 |url =  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009100 |accessdate=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglophone Quebeckers would take the case to the ''Human Rights Committee of the United Nations'', which in 1993 found that the laws banning the commercial display of languages other than French constituted a violation of the right to [[freedom of expression]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. As the sign law would have to be renewed in 1993, the Liberal government passed a law that mandated French on signs.  As recommended by the Supreme Court, this law allowed other languages on the sign, as long as French was predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = R. | last=HUDON| title= Bill 86 | publisher = [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |year = 2007 |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009101 |accessdate=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this law stands up to Supreme Court challenges, many anglophones refer to the [[Office québécois de la langue française|inspectorate]] that enforces the law as "tongue troopers" and "language cops".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = RICKY | last=BLUE| title= No jokes needed&amp;nbsp;— Quebec's Tongue Troopers make fools of themselves| publisher = LOG CABIN CHRONICLES |date= 2005-08-28 |url = http://www.tomifobia.com/ricky_blue/tongue_troopers_fools.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of legally recognised rights, the practice in long-established institutions has often been to provide more service than what rights alone would dictate{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. On the other hand, a long-term trend toward providing even less service than what rights call for has been observed, especially in cases when the service-providing entity is newly created; the only recourse is often to sue for redress{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

In addition to the rights guaranteed by the constitution of Canada, the various regulations outside the Charter recognise other linguistic rights of Quebec anglophones. Quebeckers have the right to receive services in English from all public health care and social service institutions in Quebec, although there is considerable controversy as to whether this is in fact the case as they often don't. The charter also permits bilingual status to cities, but only those with a majority of English mother-tongue residents; other cities are not required to provide services in English but usually do if a significant minority of the population is English-speaking{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Ninety-three municipalities offer bilingual services in Quebec{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

In 2002, Quebec's French Language Charter was amended with ''Bill 104'', which aims to prevent education received in fully private English schools or through temporary certificates from producing constitutional education rights. Several court cases are still pending{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education in Quebec|List of English educational institutions in Quebec}}
In 2001, Quebec had 340 primary and secondary English-language schools administered by nine English-language school boards. As in French-language schools, elementary education goes from Kindergarten to Elementary 6 (K-6), while high school goes from Secondary 1 to 5 (grades 7-11). The curriculum is strictly controlled by the Ministère de l'Education, Quebec's provincial education ministry, and is generally identical to that offered in the French-language public school system.

[[File:Collège Dawson, façade sur Sherbrooke O, Montréal 2005-11-10.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dawson College]], [[Montreal]]]]

The exception is language education. French is taught as a second language in English schools from Grade 1 onwards, and English is symmetrically taught as a second language in French schools from grade 1 onwards. English schools in the Montreal area were pioneers in [[French immersion]] and [[Bilingual Education|bilingual education]] starting in the late 1960s. As a result, they offer a range of established bilingual and short- and long-immersion programs. Programs offering both French and English curricula as a first language have recently been approved by the Minister of Education and are increasingly popular.  English immersion programs are not common in French-language public schools.

Some English-speaking Quebecers also opt to send their children to French-language schools. As a result, programs to integrate English-speaking children into a French-speaking milieu (particularly in English-speaking areas on the West Island) are increasingly popular in French school boards, and have used in French-language private school for years.

In an addition to the public system, many private schools provide instruction in English, including schools serving religious and cultural communities. Quebec subsidizes a large portion of the tuition on the condition that they teach the provincial curriculum; almost all private schools accept these conditions and the accompanying subsidy.

[[File:Mcgill University Arts Building.jpg|right|thumb|[[McGill University]], [[Montreal]]]]

Access to English-language public and semi-private education is restricted by provincial law to children who have at least one parent educated in English in Canada. Temporary residents of Quebec and English-speaking immigrants whose children have special learning needs may apply to the Ministère de l'Education for permission to enter these schools. (see [[Charter of the French Language]]). Access to private schools is open to anyone who can afford the tuition.

[[College education in Quebec|Colleges]] provide 3-year career certification programs or 2-year pre-University curricula following Grade 11 (Secondary 5) high school. Most are [[CEGEP|public colleges]] and tuition-free; a few are subsidized private institutions. Core courses in English literature, humanities, and French represent about 25% of the curriculum. There are eight English-language Colleges, open to all Quebec residents.

English is also the language of instruction at three Quebec universities ([[McGill University]], [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] and [[Bishop's University]]) that offer 3-year undergraduate programs for Quebec students graduating from college. They also offer standard 4-year programs to students from all over Canada, North America, and the world. For Quebec residents, 85% of tuition is subsidized by the provincial government. Canadian students pay differential tuition fees based on the Canadian average. Foreign students pay the full cost of their tuition, although Quebec has signed reciprocal agreements with some jurisdictions such as France, Belgium, [[Bavaria]], and [[Catalonia]] allowing students to pay local Quebec tuition rates. McGill and Concordia offer some instruction in French, and exams and assignments may be done in French at all universities.

==Health care==
Montreal has several English-language hospitals that offer multilingual services, including service in French:

*[[McGill University Health Centre]] (Downtown Montreal)
**[[Montreal General Hospital]]
**[[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]]
**[[Montreal Children's Hospital]]
**[[Montreal Neurological Institute]]
**[[Montreal Chest Institute]]
*[[Lakeshore General Hospital]] (Pointe-Claire)
*[[Jewish General Hospital]] (Montreal)
*[[St. Mary's Hospital (Montreal)|Saint Mary's Hospital]] (Montreal)
*[[Queen Elizabeth Health Centre]], formerly the Queen Elizabeth hospital
Outside Montreal, some hospitals also provide services in English.

*[[Brome-Missisquoi-Perkins Hospital]] (Eastern Townships)
*[[Pontiac Community Hospital]] (Shawville)
*[[Jeffery Hale Hospital]] (Quebec City)
*[[Barrie Memorial Hospital]] (Ormstown)

==Symbols of English-speaking Quebec==

Jacques Viger, the first mayor of Montreal, created the city’s first coat of arms in 1833. The arms consisted of a red saltire surrounded by heraldic symbols to represent the cultural makeup of the municipality at the time. While a beaver represented the French community, he added a Rose to represent those of English descent, a Shamrock for the Irish and a Thistle for the Scottish. Current and former towns with sizeable Anglophone populations such as Sherbrooke, Lachine, Saint Michel and Sainte-Cunégonde (now called Little Burgundy) also incorporated some or all of these same Anglophone symbols into their own respective arms.

While Viger’s selection of heraldic symbols aptly represented Quebec’s Anglophone population, the charges themselves were not unique Quebec inventions since they were borrowed from British heraldry. Over the years, without a truly unique symbol of their own, Quebec’s Anglophones tended to gravitate towards British icons such as the Union Jack, the Red Ensign and then later on Canada’s Maple Leaf. The [[flag of Montreal]], where many Anglophones live, is also popular, as it resembles both the flags of [[Flag of Quebec|Quebec]] and [[Flag of England|England]].

In Spring 2007, an article was published in Flagscan (Issue 83&amp;nbsp;– {{ISSN|0833-1510}}) suggesting that Quebec’s Anglophone population should adopt its own flag. The article noted that Francophone minority populations outside Quebec in the rest of Canada all had their own unique cultural identity flags and that the English-speaking community of Quebec should do the same. A number of possible designs were also presented. A variant of the same article was also posted over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://montrealflags.tripod.com/AngloQuebec.html Anglo-Quebec Flag]", Flags and Coats of Arms from the Island of Montreal. Retrieved 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than British heraldic charges, Quebec’s Anglophone community still has no unique emblem representing itself that is officially recognized at any government level.

'''Quintus Ennius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|t|ə|s|_|ˈ|ɛ|n|i|ə|s}}; c. 239 – c. 169 BC) was a writer and poet who lived during the [[Roman Republic]]. He is often considered the father of Roman [[poetry]]. He was born in [[Rudiae]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith  (1852)]], p. 359. "Rudiae is celebrated as the birthplace of Ennius."&lt;/ref&gt; formerly a small town located near modern [[Lecce]] in the heel of Italy (ancient [[Calabria#Etymology|Calabria]], today [[Salento]]), and could speak [[Oscan language|Oscan]] as well as Latin and Greek. Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in [[Latin literature]] was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models.

==Biography==
Very little is reliably known about the life of Ennius. His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings.&lt;ref&gt;E. Badian, “Ennius and his Friends” in ''Ennius'', Fondation Hardt, Geneva 1972, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Se1MLtw658C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.149-99]&lt;/ref&gt; Some lines of the ''Annales'', as well as ancient testimonies, for example, suggest that Ennius opened his epic with a recollection of a dream in which the ancient epic-writer [[Homer]] informed him that his spirit had been reborn into Ennius.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aicher|Aicher (1989)]], pp. 227{{en dash}}32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that the doctrine of the [[Metempsychosis#In Greek philosophy|transmigration of souls]] once flourished in the areas of Italy settled by Greeks, but the statement might have been no more than a literary flourish. Ennius seems to have been given to making large claims, as in the report by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] that he claimed descent from Messapus, the legendary king of his native district.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the ''Aeneid'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D7%3Acommline%3D691 vii. 691]&lt;/ref&gt; The partly Hellenised city of [[Rudiae]], his place of  birth, was certainly in the area settled by the [[Messapians]]. And this, he used to say, according to [[Aulus Gellius]], had endowed him with a triple linguistic and cultural heritage, fancifully described as "three hearts… Greek, Oscan and Latin”.&lt;ref&gt;''Noctes Atticae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0072:id=v3.p.263 17.17.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public career of Ennius first really emerges in middle life, when he was serving in the army with the rank of [[centurion]] during the [[Second Punic War]].  While in [[Sardinia]] in the year 204 BC, he is said to have attracted the attention of [[Cato the Elder]] and was taken by him to Rome. There he taught Greek and adapted Greek plays for a livelihood, and by his poetical compositions gained the friendship of some of the greatest men in Rome whose achievements he praised. Amongst these were [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Fulvius Nobilior]], whom he accompanied on his Aetolian campaign (189). Afterwards he made the capture of [[Ambracia]], at which he was present, the subject of a play and of an episode in the ''Annales''. It was through the influence of Nobilior's son [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior|Quintus]] that Ennius subsequently obtained Roman citizenship. But he himself lived plainly and simply in the literary quarter on the [[Aventine Hill]] with the poet [[Caecilius Statius]], a fellow adapter of Greek plays. 

At about the age of 70 Ennius died, immediately after producing his tragedy ''Thyestes''. In the last book of his epic poem, in which he seems to have given various details of his personal history, he mentioned that he was in his 67th year at the date of its composition. He compared himself, in contemplation of the close of the great work of his life, to a gallant horse which, after having often won the prize at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], obtained his rest when weary with age. A similar feeling of pride at the completion of a great career is expressed in the memorial lines which he composed to be placed under his bust after death: “Let no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.”&lt;ref&gt;Most of this section is drawn from the 1911 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

Ennius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing plays in Greek and Roman style ([[praetexta]]e and [[Fabula palliata|palliatae]]), as well as his most famous work, a historic epic in hexameters called the ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]''. Other minor works include the  ''Epicharmus'', ''Epigrammata'', the ''Euhemerus'', the ''Hedyphagetica'', ''Praecepta''/''Protrepticus'', ''Saturae'' (or ''Satires''), ''Scipio'', and ''Sota''.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;[[#La Barbera|La Barbera (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Annales''===

The ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'' was an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of [[Troy]] in 1184 BC down to the censorship of [[Cato the Elder]] in 184 BC.  It was the first Latin poem to adopt the [[dactylic hexameter]] metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FJCL Latin Literature Study Guide|url=http://www.fjcl.org/uploads/4/3/4/0/4340783/latin_lit_study_guide.pdf|publisher=Florida Junior Classical League|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry.  The ''Annals'' became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. About 600 lines survive. A copy of the work is among the Latin rolls of the [[Herculaneum]] library.

===Minor works===

The ''Epicharmus'' was inspired by the philosophical hypotheses developed by the Sicilian poet and philosopher [[Epicharmus of Kos]], after which Ennius's work took its name.&lt;ref name=ebcite&gt;[[#EB|Editors of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2016)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 220{{en dash}}21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Epicharmus'', the poet describes a dream he had in which he died and was transported to some place of heavenly enlightenment. Here, he met Epicharmus, who explained the nature of the gods and taught Ennius the physics of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Merry|Merry (1891)]], p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Euhemerus'' presented a [[theology|theological]] doctrine based on the ideas Greek of [[Euhemerus|Euhemerus of Messene]], who argued that the gods of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]] were not supernatural powers that interference in the lives of humans, but rather heroes of old who [[Apotheosis|after death were eventually regarded as deities]] due to their valor, bravery, or cultural impact (this belief is now known as [[euhemerism]]). Both [[Cicero]] and [[Lactantius]] write that the ''Euhemerus'' was a "translat[ion] and a recount[ing]" of Euhemerus's original work the ''Sacred History'', but it is unclear if this means Ennius simply translated the original from Greek into Latin, or added in his own elements. Most of what is preserved of this work comes to us from Lactantius, and these snippets suggest that the ''Euhemerus'' was a prose text.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 238{{en dash}}40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hedyphagetica'' took much of its substance from the [[gastronomy|gastronomical]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] of [[Archestratus|Archestratus of Gela]]. The extant portions of Ennius's poem discuss where a reader might find the best type of fish. Most of the fragments, replete with unique terms for fish and numerous place names, are corrupt or damaged. The ''Hedyphagetica'' is written in  [[hexameter]]s, but differs from the ''Annales'' in regards to "metrical practices"; this difference is largely due to each works' distinct subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 260{{en dash}}61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The titles ''Praecepta'' and ''Protrepticus'' were likely used to refer to the same (possibly exhortatory) work. However, given this work's almost non-existent nature (only the word ''pannibus''{{em dash}}an "unusual" form of the word ''pannis'', meaning "rags"{{em dash}}is preserved in the work of the [[Latin]] [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Charisius]]), this position is extremely difficult to verify.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 268{{en dash}}69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Saturae'' is a collection of about thirty lines from satirical poems{{em dash}}making it the first extant instance of Roman satire.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; These lines are written in a variety of poetic metres.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 270{{en dash}}71.&lt;/ref&gt; The poems in this collection "were mostly concerned with practical wisdom, often driving home a lesson with the help of a fable."&lt;ref name=ebcite/&gt;

Ennius's ''Scipio'' was a work (possibly a [[panegyric]] poem) that apparently celebrated the life and deeds of [[Scipio Africanus]]. Hardly anything remains of this work, and what is preserved is embedded in the works of others. Unfortunately, "no quotation of [''Scipio''] supplies a context".&lt;ref name=scipioegm/&gt; Some have proposed that the work was written before the ''Annales'', and others have said that the work was written after Scipio's 201 BC triumph that followed the [[Battle of Zama]] (202 BC).&lt;ref name=scipioegm&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 286{{en dash}}87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sota'' was a poem, potentially of some length, named after the Greek poet [[Sotades]]. The work, which followed a metre established by Sotades known as the "Sotadeus", concerned itself with a disparate number of topics and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, &amp; Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 296{{en dash}}97.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Četrta vseslovenska vstaja SAM 2250.JPG|thumb|2013 protests against troika in Slovenia]]
The '''European troika''' is the designation of the [[triumvirate]] representing the [[European Union]] in its foreign relations, in particular concerning its common foreign and security policy (CFSP).  

Currently, while talking about the [[wikt:troika|troika]] (especially in the media) one refers to a decision group formed by the [[European Commission]] (EC), the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

==Common foreign and security policy==
This term was used in the [[European Union]] when referring to a group composed of the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Member State holding the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union]], who also held the post of [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP), and the [[European Commissioner for External Relations]]. The "Troïka" represented the European Union in external relations that fall within the scope of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).

With the 2009 [[Ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon|ratification]] of the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the post of Secretary-General of the Council was separated from the post of High Representative for the CFSP, which then assumed the responsibilities of the European Commissioner for External Relations. Since only two of the original posts making up the troika still exist, it is unclear what the future of the troika arrangement in the EU is.

==Financial crisis bailout creditors==
The term ''troika'' has been widely used in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] ({{lang-el|τρόικα}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ert.gr/index.php/eidiseis/ellada/37-oikonomia/2817-q-q-.html |title = "Τεστ αντοχής" από την τρόικα ("Stress test" by the troika) |author = Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation |date = 6 May 2011 |publisher = www.news.ert.gr |language = Greek |accessdate = 6 May 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110506203146/http://www.ert.gr/index.php/eidiseis/ellada/37-oikonomia/2817-q-q-.html |archivedate = 6 May 2011 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kathimerini.com.cy/index.php?pageaction=kat&amp;modid=1&amp;artid=167299 |title = Διεκδικητική στάση έναντι της Τρόικας ζητά η ΕΔΕΚ (EDEK Asks for Assertiveness Against the Troika) |author = Kathimerini Newspaper Newsroom/Cyprus News Agency |date = 2 April 2014 |publisher = www.kathimerini.com.cy |language = Greek |accessdate = 5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0415/media-2943271.html |title = RTÉ.ie Extra Video: EU/IMF rescue package - troika briefing |author = RTÉ News |date = 15 April 2011 |publisher = www.rte.ie |accessdate = 6 May 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110418143306/http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0415/media-2943271.html |archivedate = 18 April 2011 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecosfera.publico.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1500246|title=Estudo entregue à troika propõe fecho de 800 km de linha férrea|author=Público|date=26 June 2011|publisher=www.publico.pt|language=Portuguese|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/06/11/actualidad/1339398901_234629.html|title=La troika vigilará que se cumplan las reglas pactadas para el rescate|author=El País|date=11 June 2012|publisher=www.elpais.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the presence of the [[European Commission]], [[European Central Bank]], and [[International Monetary Fund]] in these member states since 2010{{Clarify|reason=What is meant by 'presence'?|date=December 2018}} and the financial measures that these institutions have taken.

'''Exmatriculation''' is the removal of a student's name from the list of current students when they leave a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studium.uni-freiburg.de/studium-en/exmatrikulation-en/exmatrikulation-en?set_language=en|title=Exmatriculation — Studierendenportal|website=www.studium.uni-freiburg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[wikt:deregister|deregistering]] or [[wikt:unenroll|unenrolling]] of a student as a result of graduation, expulsion, inability to pay school fees, meet academic progress requirements or their self withdrawal from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ut.ee/en/exmatriculation|title=Exmatriculation|website=www.ut.ee|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/studium/studienorganisation/immatrikulation/exmatrikulation/index.html|title=Withdrawal from University (Exmatriculation)|date=2016-02-10|website=www.fu-berlin.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After exmatriculation==
In cases of voluntary withdrawal, some schools, depending on their various conditions, may reimburse part of the fees if the student applies for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/refund+of+fees+already+paid/544363.html%20https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/studies/exmatriculation.html%20https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/studying/organizing-your-studies/exmatriculation.html|title=Universität Göttingen - Georg-August-Universität Göttingen|last=Öffentlichkeitsarbeit|first=Georg-August-Universität Göttingen -|website=www.uni-goettingen.de|language=de|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/studies/exmatriculation.html|title=Exmatriculation - Osnabrück University|website=www.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/studying/organizing-your-studies/exmatriculation.html|title=De-registration (Exmatrikulation) -  Organizing Your Studies -  Studying -  Studium - University of Potsdam|website=www.uni-potsdam.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike after a leave of absence, continuation of your studies following voluntary exmatriculation may be faced with difficulties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en/exmatriculation|title=Exmatriculation: University of Hohenheim|last=Hohenheim|first=University of|website=www.uni-hohenheim.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expelled students are usually barred from being readmitted into the university where they got exmatriculated. However, in different cases, there are various exceptions and conditions for reapplying into the same university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/edu/edu_03030303.html|title=Withdrawal/ Expulsion /Readmission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hawkeyecollege.edu/students/handbook/suspended-expelled-students-readmission|title=Readmission After Suspension or Expulsion - Hawkeye Community College|website=www.hawkeyecollege.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been cases of students whose expulsion was welcomed by the public's pressure and protests to revert it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/abfsu-nner-demand-re-admission-expelled-student-activist/75879|title=ABFSU, NNER demand re-admission of expelled student activist- DVB Multimedia Group|date=2017-06-05|work=DVB Multimedia Group|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/news/1056-288138-lqbo40z/index.html|title=University to readmit expelled students|work=Daily Nation|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/12/05/three-uon-students-in-riot-case-readmitted-expulsion-quashed_c1679776|title=Three UoN students in riot case readmitted, expulsion quashed|work=The Star, Kenya|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/252979-expelled-student-wins-case-nigerian-university.html|title=Expelled student wins case against Nigerian university - Premium Times Nigeria|date=2017-12-19|work=Premium Times Nigeria|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/11/19/uc-berkeley-refuses-to-readmit-student-expelled-over-rape-allegations/amp/|title=UC Berkeley Refuses To Readmit Student Expelled Over Rape Allegations|date=2015-11-19|work=CBS San Francisco|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who were exmatriculated due to failure to meet payment deadlines or continuous academic progress can also apply to be readmitted within a period of time depending on the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Hounkpati B Christophe Capo''' (born January 1, 1953&lt;ref&gt;[https://lccn.loc.gov/n89630385 Capo, Hounkpati B. C. (Hounkpati Bamikpo Christophe)] at ''lccn.loc.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Beninese [[linguist]], and professor of [[linguistics]] at the [[National University of Benin|Université d'Abomey-Calavi]] in the [[Benin|Republic of Benin]].

== Biography ==
Hounkpati B Christophe Capo has a humanities degree (1974) and a master's degree in linguistics (1977) from the [[National University of Benin]] (UNB), a master of arts (1977) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in linguistics from the [[University of Ghana]] (1981). He taught and collaborated at several universities in West Africa, notably the universities of [[Benin City]] and [[Ilorin]] in Nigeria in 1978.

Hired as an assistant professor in 1986 at the [[National University of Benin]], he was then promoted several times within the [[Conseil africain et malgache de l'enseignement supérieur]] (CAMES). Permanent interim secretary of the scientific council of the National University of Benin from 1994 to 1999, he was decorated as a knight of the national order of Benin in 1995 and became an officer of national order of Benin in 2008.

Married with five children, reputed research professor, scientific director of Labo-Gbe, international laboratory of Gbe languages (Gadomè, Bénin), he has written seven books, thirteen book chapters and more than fifty articles in scientific reviews. He is a member of several learned societies including the Société Linguistique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (SLAO) (Linguistic Society of West Africa) and the Institut International de Recherche et de Formation (INIREF) (International Institute of Research and Training) in [[Cotonou]], Benin and an editor or assistant editor of several international scientific journals. He has guided several doctoral theses in Benin and elsewhere and contributed to the promotions of several colleagues in his department.

Capo is the assistant director of the doctoral multidisciplinairy school of the Faculty of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences of [[Aplahoué]] in [[Couffo|Kouffo]] Department in southwest Benin, an entity of the university of [[Abomey-Calavi]].

Hounkpati B Christophe Capo conducted research and taught in the linguistics departments and centers for [[african studies]] at several universities : [[University of Cologne]] (Germany), [[Cornell University]] (US), University of Gainesville (US), [[Ohio State University]] (US), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (US), [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (Canada), CASAS South Africa, University of Ghana (Lagon), [[University of Hamburg]] (Germany), [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] (Germany), [[University of Bayreuth]] (Germany), University of Bremen (Germany).

He has been associated with  the development association of [[Comé]] since 2002 and is a sitting councillor there as well.

== Works ==
Hounkpati B Christophe Capo has worked on the rehabilitation of the languages of the Gbe dialectal continuum, previously known as the Aja-Eve languages of the Gulf of Benin in West Africa. Beginning in 1930, publications on the [[Gbe language]]s rapidly appeared, the vast majority on individual Gbe languages.

Capo set out a classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the [[phonology]] of proto-Gbe. Much of the comparative research for this classification was carried out by  Capo in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the 1970s and early 1980s as articles on specific [[phonological]] developments in various branches of the Gbe [[dialectal]] continuum, and notably as a standard spelling for Gbe languages.

His first major work, ''Renaissance du Gbe'' (1988), published a classification of the Gbe languages for the first time. In 1991, he published ''Comparative phonology of Gbe''. In this period, he also founded the Labo Gbe (Int.), the ''Laboratoire de recherche sur les langues Gbe'' (Research Laboratory on Gbe Languages) based in Benin, which promotes research and has published several articles and documents on Gbe languages. The Labo Gbe, in [[Gadomè]] on the [[Cotonou]]-[[Lomé]] road 40&amp;nbsp;km from Cotonou, has an impressive collection of documentation and a scientific journal titled Etudes Gbe – Gbe Studies.

'''Jaqaru''' (''Haq'aru'') is a language of the [[Aymaran languages|Aymaran family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jqr&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Jaqi''' and '''Aru'''. It is spoken in the districts of Tupe and Catahuasi in [[Yauyos Province]], [[Lima Region]], [[Peru]]. Most of the 2000 ethnic Jaqaru have migrated to Lima.

'''Kawki''', a divergent dialect, is spoken in the nearby communities of Cachuy, Canchán, Caipán and Chavín by a few elderly individuals (9 surviving in early 2005). Hardman{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} has noted that while Jaqaru and Kawki share a degree of mutual intelligibility, speakers of one were unable to understand tape recordings of the other, and in a few cases of marriage between Kawki and Jaqaru speakers, the home language was Spanish. (However, the home language of most Jaqaru and Kawki is now Spanish.) Historical analysis shows that the two languages were out of contact for a period.

There exist clear differences between Jaqaru and Kawki in regard to morphology. Jaqaru has ten verb persons, whereas Kawki has only nine (due to a case of homophony wherein Kawki maintained the semantic distinction between two different person markers, but lost the form distinction between the two). Additionally, regressive vowel harmony is present throughout the verb person system in Jaqaru, but does not appear in Kawki. Phonologically, Kawki is differentiated from Jaqaru in its vowel system. Jaqaru contains six vowels- three of regular length and three short, whereas Kawki has only the three regular-length vowels.

== Phonology  ==

=== Vowels ===
Jaqaru has three [[phonemic]] [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/a i u/}}, which distinguish two degrees of length. Long vowels are indicated in writing as follows: /a: i: u:/. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon/en/inv/Jaqaru.html|title=Jaqaru|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
Syntax in Jaqaru consists mainly of a system of sentence suffixes. These [[suffix]]es indicate sentence type (interrogative, declarative, etc.) Suffixes can and often do occur more than one per sentence, marking sentence type and creating complex constructions. Simply put, for sentences to be grammatical in Jaqaru, they must be inflected. Morphological words and syntactic phrases which do not contain a sentence suffix are judged by native speakers to be ungrammatical and for some, impossible to say (Hardman, 2000).

=== Sentence suffixes ===
Sentence suffixes occur after all other morphological processes and can occur on any morphological words or syntactic phrases. The nature of sentence suffixes allows for freedom of word order and creativity in sentence construction, useful to storytellers (Hardman, 2000).

There are seven classes of sentence suffixes in Jaqaru, listed below:

Order classes of sentence suffixes (Hardman, 2000: 92)

*I—Temporal: -kasa (completive) and -ra (continuative)
*II—Aggregational: -rk"a (additive) and -sk"a (sequential)
*III—Categorizer: -sa (information), -txi (negative; yes/no), -wa (PK—personal knowledge), -qa (attenuator; topic), and -psa (aggregational)
*IV—KTL (knowledge through language): -mna ('it is said')
*V—Surprisal: -ja (rhetorical)
*VI—Emphatic: -illi ('really!")
*VII—FinalDS: -ashi ('maybe') and -ishi ('remember')

These suffixes can occur in combination on words and most Class I suffixes rarely appear without another suffix on a morphological word. Classes II, III, and IV occur most frequently and are considered the core of syntactic inflection. It is theoretically possible for all sentence suffixes to occur in a sentence, but no case has ever been found. At most three or four sentence suffixes have been found in a text, as of the year 2000. However, because many morphological suffixes can also be stacked, syntactic words frequently carry up to seven or eight suffixes (Hardman, 2000).

=== Phrases ===
Unlike sentence word order, within phrases a fixed word order is either preferred or obligatory. Two main types of phrases occur in Jaqaru: noun phrases and verb phrases.

Noun Phrases. There are three types of noun phrases: modifier phrases, number phrases, and possessive phrases. Modifier phrases consist of a head noun preceded by a one or more modifier noun, which is marked by vowel dropping. Numbers in Jaqaru are on a base ten scale. Number phrases are carefully ordered to build larger numbers using multipliers of 10, 100, and 1000. The number phrase order is: number x multiplier + number. Neutral, unmarked possessive phrases follow a specific order: possessor + -na + possessed + one of the four personal possessive suffixes (Hardman, 2000).
Verb Phrases. Verb phrases in Jaqaru are rare and never consist of more than two parts. There are four fixed order types: the careful phrase, the facultative phrase, the effort phrase, and the OV phrase (vowel-drop modifier + verb root). Verbs can additionally be modified by a quantifier modifier (Hardman, 2000).

=== Particles ===
There are three types of particles in Jaqaru: negatives, greetings, and a few special ones. Three particles are used for negation: imperative negative, principle negative, and subordinate negative. Four greetings are used in Jaqaru for addressing people, which mark the sex of the speaker and the addressee and do not carry any suffixes of any kind. Four special particles take no suffixes and comprise utterances in and of themselves: Jira (“Let’s go”), Jalli (“I don’t know, could be.”), Wala (“Go on, get going, bye.”), and Chiku (“I’m going, I’m off, bye.”) (Hardman, 2000: 115).

== Morphology ==
Jaqaru morphology is extremely complex. Most of the grammatical information in Jaqaru is carried in the morphology. The basic person system consists of four persons. In the verb system, these four persons are expanded into a conjugation of ten grammatical person markers, each marking both subject and object in a single suffix. Also characteristic of the Jaqaru morphology (and all of the Jaqi languages) is the use of extensive vowel dropping for grammatical marking. The rules constraining vowel dropping are extensive, and can be conditioned by such things as morpheme identity, morpheme sequence, syntactic requirements, some phonological requirements and suffix requirements. (Hardman, 2000).

The primary form classes are root and suffix. Root classes are verb, noun, and particle; suffix classes are nominal, verbal, thematic, and sentence.

Data-source marking is reflected in every sentence of the language. The three major grammatical categories of data source are:

1. personal knowledge (PK)--typically referring to sight

2. knowledge-through-language (KTW)--referring to all that is learned by hearing others speak and by reading

3. non-personal-knowledge (NPK)--used for all myths, histories from longer ago than any living memory, stories, and non-involvement of the speaker in the current situation (Hardman, 2000)

=== Nominal morphology ===
Nominal morphology involves suffixes, with two kinds of nominal suffixes: possession and modification. Noun suffixes consist of two types. One set involves the interplay of nouns with the rest of the sentence (there are 10 of these suffixes: 4 possessives, 5 directionals, and 1 object marker). All other nominal suffixes function to create complex nouns (Hardman, 2000).

Nominal morphology is based on a four-person paradigm which marks the relationship of the second person to the utterance. Therefore, the first person excludes the addressee. Second person excludes the speaker. Third person excludes both the speaker and the addressee, and is used for unmarked or null instances. Fourth person marks the inclusion of both the speaker and the addressee (Hardman, 2000).

=== Verbal morphology ===
Verbal morphology in Jaqaru is extremely complex, in both inflections and derivations. A great deal of the grammatical work of the language is done within the verbal morphological system. The standard paradigm is of ten persons, which define the relationships between the four basic persons (Hardman, 2000, 56):

*2›2p: none
*2›1p: -uta, -utumata, and -utusama
*2›4p: -ushta, -ushtumata, and -ushtusama
*2›3p: -ta, -mata, and -sama

----

*1›2p: -imi, -mama and -shtama
*1›1p: none
*1›4p: none
*1›3p: -t"a, -nha, and -sa

----

*4›2p: none
*4›1p: none
*4›4p: none
*4›3p: -tana, -tana, and -sana

----

*3›2p: -tama, -matama, and -masama
*3›1p: -utu, -utuni, and -utusp"a
*3›4p: -ushtu, -ushtuni, and -ushtusp"a
*3›3p: -i, -ni, and -sp"a

In Jaqaru (and all other Jaqi languages), the tie between object and subject is one of union; they are not separable morphologically, and conjugation requires simultaneous specification of both as a unit. Verbs are conjugated in two sets: one for principal clauses with ten tenses and one for subordinate clauses with twelve tenses. Verbs ordinarily consist of a minimum of three morphemes. However, typical verbs consist of many more (Hardman, 2000).

'''José de Sousa Saramago''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of St. James of the Sword|GColSE]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pt|ʒuˈzɛ ðɨ ˈsozɐ sɐɾɐˈmaɣu|lang}}; 16 November 1922 – 18 June 2010), was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer and recipient of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His works, some of which can be seen as [[Allegory|allegories]], commonly present [[Subversion|subversive]] perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the [[Theopoetics|theopoetic]] human factor. In 2003 [[Harold Bloom]] described Saramago as "the most gifted novelist alive in the world today"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |date=2003 |title=Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds |location=New York |publisher=Warner Books |isbn=0-446-52717-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 said he considers Saramago to be "a permanent part of the [[Western canon]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Harold|last=Bloom|authorlink=Harold Bloom|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2036477_2036518,00.html|title=Fond Farewells|work=TIME|date=15 December 2010|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] praises "the distinctive tone to his fiction because he narrates his novels as if he were someone both wise and ignorant."&lt;ref name=militant_magician/&gt;

More than two million copies of Saramago's books have been sold in Portugal alone and his work has been translated into 25 languages.&lt;ref name=eberstadt_dies/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt_defends_work/&gt; A proponent of [[Anarchist communism|libertarian communism]],&lt;ref name=china_post_portugal_mourns/&gt; Saramago criticized institutions such as the [[Catholic Church]], the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. An [[Atheism|atheist]], he defended love as an instrument to improve the human condition. In 1992, the [[Government of Portugal]] under Prime Minister [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]] ordered the removal of ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' from the [[Aristeion Prize]]'s shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive. Disheartened by this political [[censorship]] of his work,&lt;ref name=president_no-show/&gt; Saramago went into exile on the Spanish island of [[Lanzarote]], upon which he resided until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist&gt;Quoted in: {{cite news|first=Fernanda|last=Eberstadt|authorlink=Fernanda Eberstadt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/magazine/26saramago-t.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Unexpected Fantasist|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 August 2007|accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap_dies/&gt;

Saramago was a founding member of the National Front for the Defense of Culture in Lisbon in 1992, and co-founder with [[Orhan Pamuk]], of the European Writers' Parliament (EWP).

==Early and middle life==
Saramago was born in 1922 into a family of landless peasants in [[Azinhaga]], Portugal, a small village in [[Ribatejo Province]], some one hundred kilometers northeast of [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt; His parents were José de Sousa and Maria de Piedade. "Saramago", the Portuguese word for ''[[Raphanus raphanistrum]]'' (wild radish), was his father's family's nickname, and was accidentally incorporated into his name upon registration of his birth.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt;

In 1924, Saramago's family moved to Lisbon, where his father started working as a policeman. A few months after the family moved to the capital, his brother Francisco, older by two years, died. He spent vacations with his grandparents in Azinhaga. When his grandfather suffered a stroke and was to be taken to Lisbon for treatment, Saramago recalled, "He went into the yard of his house, where there were a few trees, fig trees, olive trees. And he went one by one, embracing the trees and crying, saying good-bye to them because he knew he would not return. To see this, to live this, if that doesn't mark you for the rest of your life," Saramago said, "you have no feeling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/lecture-e.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215031334/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/lecture-e.html|date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Saramago was a good pupil, his parents were unable to afford to keep him in grammar school, and instead moved him to a technical school at age 12.

After graduating, he worked as a car mechanic for two years. Later he worked as a translator, then as a journalist. He was assistant editor of the newspaper ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'', a position he had to leave after the [[Carnation Revolution|democratic revolution in 1974]].&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt; After a period of working as a translator he was able to support himself solely as a writer.

Saramago married Ilda Reis in 1944. Their only daughter, Violante, was born in 1947.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt; In 1986 he met Spanish journalist [[Pilar del Río]]. They married in 1988 and remained together until his death in June 2010. Del Río is the official translator of Saramago's books into Spanish.

==Later life and international acclaim==
Saramago did not achieve widespread recognition and acclaim until he was sixty, with the publication of his fourth novel, ''Memorial do Convento''. A [[baroque]] tale set during the Inquisition in 18th-century Lisbon, it tells of the love between a maimed soldier and a young clairvoyant, and of a renegade priest's heretical dream of flight. The novel's translation in 1988 as ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' (by [[Giovanni Pontiero]]) brought Saramago to the attention of an international readership.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt;&lt;ref name=new_ways_of_seeing&gt;{{cite news|first=Maya|last=Jaggi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/22/jose-saramago-blindness-nobel|title=New ways of seeing|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 November 2008|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel won the Portuguese PEN Club Award.

Saramago joined the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] in 1969 and remained a member until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/bio-bibl.html|title=Nobel Prize citation, 1998|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a self-confessed [[Pessimism|pessimist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Langer|url=http://www.bookmagazine.com/issue25/saramago.shtml|title=José Saramago: Prophet of Doom -  Pessimism is our only hope.

Portugal's conservative government, led by then-prime minister [[Cavaco Silva]], did not allow Saramago's work to compete for the [[Aristeion Prize]],&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt; arguing that it offended the Catholic community. As a result, Saramago and his wife moved to [[Lanzarote]], an island in the Canaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/saramago-autobio.html|title=José Saramago: Autobiography|year=1998|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Writers' Parliament (EWP) came about as a result of a joint proposal by Saramago and fellow Nobel laureate [[Orhan Pamuk]]. Saramago was expected to speak as the guest of honour at the EWP, but he died before the opening ceremony in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Wall|authorlink=William Wall (writer)|url=http://www.irishleftreview.org/2010/12/01/complexity-istanbul-declaration-european-writers-conference/|title=The Complexity of Others: The Istanbul Declaration of The European Writers’ Conference|newspaper=Irish Left Review|date=1 December 2010|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 18 June 2010, aged 87, having spent the last few years of his life in [[Lanzarote]], Spain.&lt;ref name=lea_dies&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Lea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/18/jose-saramago-writer-nobel-dies|title=Nobel laureate José Saramago dies, aged 87|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 June 2010|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family said that he had breakfast and chatted with his wife and translator Pilar del Río on Friday morning, after which he started feeling unwell and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article472336.ece|title=Nobel-wiining[sic] novelist Saramago dies aged 87|location=Chennai|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 June 2010|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' described him as "the finest Portuguese writer of his generation",&lt;ref name=lea_dies/&gt; while Fernanda Eberstadt of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he was "known almost as much for his unfaltering [[Communism]] as for his fiction".&lt;ref name=eberstadt_dies&gt;{{cite news|first=Fernanda|last=Eberstadt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/books/19saramago.html?src=mv|title=José Saramago, Nobel Prize-Winning Writer, Dies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 June 2010|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saramago's translator, Margaret Jull Costa, paid tribute to him, describing his "wonderful imagination" and calling him "the greatest contemporary Portuguese writer".&lt;ref name=lea_dies/&gt; Saramago had continued his writing until his death. His most recent publication, ''Claraboia'', was published in 2011, after his death. Saramago had suffered from [[pneumonia]] a year before his death. Having been thought to have made a full recovery, he had been scheduled to attend the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] in August 2010.&lt;ref name=lea_dies/&gt;

Portugal declared two days of mourning.&lt;ref name=china_post_portugal_mourns&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/art/celebrity-news/2010/06/21/261516/Portugal-mourns.htm|title=Portugal mourns as Nobel laureate's body returned|newspaper=[[The China Post]]|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=president_no-show/&gt; There were tributes from senior international politicians: [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] (Brazil), [[Bernard Kouchner]] (France) and [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] (Spain), while Cuba's [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]] and [[Fidel Castro]] sent flowers.&lt;ref name=china_post_portugal_mourns/&gt;

Saramago's funeral was held in Lisbon on 20 June 2010, in the presence of more than 20,000 people, many of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometres, but also notably in the absence of right-wing [[President of Portugal]] [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]], who was holidaying in the Azores as the ceremony took place.&lt;ref name=xinhua_funeral&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-06/21/c_13359797.htm|title=Portuguese Nobel laureate Saramago's funeral held|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=21 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623123203/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-06/21/c_13359797.htm|archivedate=23 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavaco Silva, the Prime Minister who removed Saramago's work from the shortlist of the [[Aristeion Prize]], said he did not attend Saramago's funeral because he "had never had the privilege to know him".&lt;ref name=president_no-show&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10364807.stm|title=President defends Jose Saramago funeral no-show|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourners, who questioned Cavaco Silva's absence in the presence of reporters,&lt;ref name=president_no-show/&gt; held copies of the red carnation, symbolic of [[Carnation Revolution|Portugal's democratic revolution]].&lt;ref name=xinhua_funeral/&gt; Saramago's cremation took place in Lisbon,&lt;ref name=xinhua_funeral/&gt; and his ashes were buried on the anniversary of his death, 18 June 2011, underneath a hundred year old olive tree on the square in front of the José Saramago Foundation (Casa dos Bicos).&lt;ref&gt;Cinzas de Saramago são depositadas aos pés de uma oliveira, em Lisboa UOL (18 de junho de 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost novel==
The [[José Saramago Foundation]] announced in October 2011 the publication of a so-called "lost novel" published as ''Skylight'' (''Claraboia'' in Portuguese). It was written in the 1950s and remained in the archive of a publisher to whom the manuscript had been sent. Saramago remained silent about the work up to his death. The book has been translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Claraboya/novela/inedita/Saramago/vera/luz/elpepucul/20111003elpepucul_4/Tes|title=Claraboya, novela inédita de Saramago, verá la luz|newspaper=El País|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and themes==
[[File:Saramago dos.jpg|thumb|Saramago at Teatro Jorge Eliécer Gaitán in [[Bogotá]] in 2007]]
Saramago's experimental style often features long sentences, at times more than a page long. He used periods sparingly, choosing instead a loose flow of clauses joined by commas.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt; Many of his paragraphs extend for pages without pausing for dialogue, (which Saramago chooses not to delimit by quotation marks); when the speaker changes, Saramago capitalizes the first letter of the new speaker's clause. His works often refer to his other works.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt; In his novel ''Blindness'', Saramago completely abandons the use of proper nouns, instead referring to characters simply by some unique characteristic, an example of his style reflecting the recurring themes of identity and meaning found throughout his work.

Saramago's novels often deal with fantastic scenarios. In his 1986 novel ''[[The Stone Raft]]'', the [[Iberian Peninsula]] breaks off from the rest of Europe and sails around the Atlantic Ocean. In his 1995 novel ''[[Blindness (novel)|Blindness]]'', an entire unnamed country is stricken with a mysterious plague of "white blindness". In his 1984 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' (which won the PEN Award and the ''Independent'' Foreign Fiction Award), [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] survives for a year after the poet himself dies. Additionally, his novel ''[[Death with Interruptions]]'' (also translated as ''Death at Intervals'') takes place in a country in which, suddenly, nobody dies, and concerns, in part, the spiritual and political implications of the event, although the book ultimately moves from a synoptic to a more personal perspective.

Saramago addresses serious matters with empathy for the [[human condition]] and for the isolation of contemporary urban life. His characters struggle with their need to connect with one another, form relations and bond as a community, and also with their need for individuality, and to find meaning and dignity outside of political and economic structures.

When asked to describe his daily writing routine in 2009, Saramago responded, "I write two pages. And then I read and read and read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maloney, Evan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/mar/02/best-advice-writers-read?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=The best advice for writers?

==Personal life==
[[File:Saramago by bottelho.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Saramago by Portuguese painter [[Carlos Botelho]]]]
Saramago was an [[Atheism|atheist]]. The [[Catholic Church]] criticised him on numerous occasions due to the content of some of his novels, mainly ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' and ''[[Cain (novel)|Cain]]'', in which he uses [[satire]] and biblical quotations to present the figure of God in a comical way. The Portuguese government lambasted his 1991 novel ''O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (''The Gospel according to Jesus Christ'') and struck the writer's name from nominees for the European Literature Prize, saying the atheist work offended Portuguese Catholic convictions. The book portrays a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Nash|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/saramago-the-atheist-an-outsider-in-his-own-land-1177040.html|title=Saramago the atheist, an outsider in his own land|location=London|newspaper=The Independent|date=9 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Swedish Academy]]'s decision to present Saramago with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the Vatican questioned the decision on political grounds, though gave no comment on the aesthetic or literary components of Saramago's work. Saramago responded: "The Vatican is easily scandalized, especially by people from outside. They should just focus on their prayers and leave people in peace. I respect those who believe, but I have no respect for the institution."&lt;ref name=nyt_defends_work&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/world/nobel-writer-a-communist-defends-work.html|title=Nobel Writer, A Communist, Defends Work|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 1998|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saramago was a proponent of [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communism]],&lt;ref name=china_post_portugal_mourns/&gt;{{fv|date=October 2018}} and a member of the [[Communist Party of Portugal]].&lt;ref name=ap_dies/&gt; As such he stood for the 1989 Lisbon local election in the list of the Coalition "For Lisbon" and was elected [[alderman]] and presiding officer of the [[Assembleia Municipal|Municipal Assembly]] of Lisbon.&lt;ref name=pcp.pt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcp.pt/node/244347|title=Communist Party of Portugal: Short Biographical note on José Saramago|publisher=Pcp.pt|accessdate=2012-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307161912/http://www.pcp.pt/node/244347|archivedate=2012-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saramago was also a candidate of the [[Democratic Unity Coalition]] in all elections to the [[European Parliament]] from 1989 to 2009, though was often in positions thought to have no possibility of being elected.&lt;ref name=pcp.pt/&gt; He was a critic of [[European Union]] (EU) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) policies.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist/&gt;

Although many of his novels are acknowledged political satire of a subtle kind, it is in ''The Notebook'' that Saramago made his political convictions most clear. The book, written from a Marxist perspective, is a collection of his blog articles for the year September 2008 to August 2009. According to ''[[The Independent]]'', "Saramago aims to cut through the web of 'organized lies' surrounding humanity, and to convince readers by delivering his opinions in a relentless series of unadorned, knock-down prose blows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=Wright|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-notebook-by-jos-saramago-1932464.html|title=The Notebook by José Saramago: The Nobel laureate's blog entries burn with passion|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 April 2010|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political engagement led to comparisons with [[George Orwell]]: "Orwell's hostility to the British Empire runs parallel to Saramago's latter-day crusade against empire in the shape of globalisation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher|last=Rollason|url=http://yatrarollason.info/files/SaramagoandOrwell.pdf|title=How totalitarianism begins at home: Saramago and Orwell|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking to ''The Observer'' in 2006 he said "The painter paints, the musician makes music, the novelist writes novels. But I believe that we all have some influence, not because of the fact that one is an artist, but because we are citizens. As citizens, we all have an obligation to intervene and become involved, it's the citizen who changes things. I can't imagine myself outside any kind of social or political involvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Meritt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/30/fiction.features1|title=Interview: Still a street-fighting man|newspaper=The Observer|date=30 April 2006|accessdate=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Intifada]], while visiting [[Ramallah]] in March 2002, Saramago said: "What is happening in Palestine is a crime we can put on the same plain as what happened at Auschwitz ... A sense of impunity characterises the Israeli people and its army. They have turned into rentiers of the Holocaust."&lt;ref name=militant_magician/&gt; Some critics of these words contended that they were [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=ap_dies&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100618/ap_on_en_ot/eu_obit_saramago "Nobel-winning Portuguese novelist Saramago dies"], Associated Press 18-06-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/presrele/asint_13/4370_13.htm De las piedras de David a los tanques de Goliat] by José Saramago, ''El País'' 21/Abril/2002 (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/bigotry_in_print.htm "Bigotry in Print.

"To have said that Israel's action is to be condemned, that war crimes are being perpetrated - really the Israelis are used to that. It doesn't bother them. But there are certain words they can't stand. And to say 'Auschwitz' there ... note well, I didn't say that Ramallah was the same as Auschwitz, that would be stupid. What I said was that the spirit of Auschwitz was present in Ramallah. We were eight writers. They all made condemning statements, [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Breyten Breytenbach]], [[Vincenzo Consolo]] and others. But the Israelis weren't bothered about those. It was the fact that I put my finger in the Auschwitz wound that made them jump."&lt;ref name=militant_magician&gt;{{cite news|first=Julian|last=Evans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview11?INTCMP=SRCH|title=The militant magician|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 December 2002|accessdate=28 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Saramago joined [[Tariq Ali]], [[John Berger]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and others in condemning what they characterized as "a long-term military, economic and geographic practice whose political aim is nothing less than the liquidation of the Palestinian nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/letters/20060719.htm|title=Israel, Lebanon, and Palestine: Tariq Ali, John Berger, Noam Chomsky, Eduardo Galeano, Naomi Klein, Harold Pinter, Arundhati Roy, José Saramago &amp; Howard Zinn|date=19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a supporter of [[Iberian Federalism]]. In a 2008 press conference for the filming of ''Blindness'' he asked, in reference to the [[Great Recession]], "Where was all that money poured on markets? Very tight and well kept; then suddenly it appears to save what? lives? no, banks." He added, "Marx was never so right as now", and predicted "the worst is still to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2008/10/28/karl-marx-was-never-so-right-says-nobel-laureate-saramago|title=Karl Marx was never so right, says Nobel laureate Saramago|work=[[MercoPress]] (Quote here is based on the source heading; there appears to be a typing error in the source text.)|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khinalug''' (also spelled '''Khinalig''', '''Khinalugi, Xinalug(h), Xinaliq''' or '''Khinalugh''') is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] language spoken by about 1,500 people in the villages of [[Khinalug]] and Gülüstan, [[Quba]] in the mountains of [[Quba Rayon]], northern [[Azerbaijan]]. It forms its own independent branch within the Northeast Caucasian language family.&lt;ref name="EthNCfam"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=215-16 Family tree of Northeast Caucasian languages at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

London &amp; New York: Routledge, 2007. 211–280.]&lt;/ref&gt; and classified as "severely endangered" by [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=2009-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNESCO Endangered Language Criteria: 1. Vulnerable, 2. Definitely Endangered, 3. Severely Endangered, 4. Critically Endangered, 5. Extinct--&gt;

== History ==
Khinalug is the language of the village Khinalug in the Quba district of Azerbaijan. It has been tentatively classified by previous researchers as a member of the Lezgian family of the Dagestani branch of Northeast Caucasian languages&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clifton|first=J.M.|date=2005|title=The sociolinguistic situation of the Khinalug in Azerbaijan|url=http://www-01.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-007.pdf|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Khinalug is the official language of the village, it is mostly spoken by villagers in informal circumstances, while the national language [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] is used formally for educational purposes and to communicate with non-Khinalug speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Khinalug is considered to be a [[Endangered Language|threatened]] language. This is in part due to the breaking down of a road that leads into the village, leaving it mostly isolated.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulze|first=Wolfgang|date=2003|title=[Khinulag]|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=450|issue=4|pages=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English language|English]] is the predominant language and a ''[[de facto]]'' official language of New Zealand. Almost the entire population speak it either as native speakers or proficiently as a second language.&lt;ref name="SpokenLanguage"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity – Languages spoken|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/languages.aspx|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Zealand English|New Zealand English dialect]] is most similar to [[Australian English]] in pronunciation, with some key differences. The [[Māori language]] of the indigenous [[Māori people]] was made the first ''[[de jure]]'' official language in 1987. [[New Zealand Sign Language]] (NZSL) has been an official language since 2006. Many other languages are used by New Zealand's minority ethnic communities.

===New Zealand Sign Language===
[[File:2013 NZ census people who can use New Zealand Sign Language.gif|thumb|People who can use New Zealand Sign Language, 2001, 2006 and 2013 censuses]]
[[New Zealand Sign Language]], the main language of the [[Deaf culture|deaf community]] in New Zealand, has been an official language by statute since 2006, by virtue of the [[New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Sign Language Bill 2006|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0018/latest/whole.html |accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="assent"&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0604/S00186.htm Governor-General gives assent to Sign Language Bill], Press Release: Governor General, 10 April 2006. Retrieved 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is legal to use it and have access to it in legal proceedings and government services. In 2013, 20,235 people reported the ability to use New Zealand Sign Language.&lt;ref name="SpokenLanguage"/&gt;

==Immigrant languages==
{{See also|List of ethnic origins of New Zealanders}}
New Zealand has immigrants from European, Asian and Pacific Island countries who have brought their languages with them. According to [[Ethnologue]] ({{as of|2017|lc=on}}), the largest groups are [[Samoan language|Samoan]] (86,400), [[Hindi]] (66,300), [[Mandarin Chinese]] (52,300), [[French language|French]] (49,100) and [[Yue Chinese]] (44,600).&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=NZ |chapter=Languages of New Zealand |accessdate=2 September 2017 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.) |year=2017 |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, |edition=20th |place=Dallas, Texas |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]], about 87,534 people did not include English as one of their spoken languages.&lt;ref name="SpokenLanguage"/&gt;

The number and proportion of [[multilingual]] (people who can speak two or more languages) has continued to increase since the 2001 census. In 2013, the number of multilingual people was 737,910, or 18.6 percent of the population. The highest numbers of multilingual speakers lived in the [[Auckland Region|Auckland]], [[Wellington Region|Wellington]], and [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] regions.&lt;ref name="SpokenLanguage"/&gt;

==Statistics==
In the 2013 census, the following languages were reportedly spoken by more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/data-tables/totals-by-topic/totals-by-topic-tables.xls |title= 2013 Census totals by topic |publisher= [[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate= 11 December 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213100306/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/data-tables/totals-by-topic/totals-by-topic-tables.xls |archivedate= 13 December 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; People could report more than one language, therefore percentages do not add up to 100. Statistics necessarily exclude unusable responses and those who spoke no language (e.g. too young to talk).

A '''loyalty oath''' is an [[oath]] of [[loyalty]] to an [[organization]], [[institution]], or [[State (polity)|state]] of which an individual is a member. In the United States, such an oath has often indicated that the [[affiant]] has not been a member of a particular organization or organizations mentioned in the oath.

==In the United States==

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
During the [[American Civil War]], political prisoners and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were often released upon taking an "oath of allegiance". Lincoln's [[Ten percent plan]] featured an oath to "faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the union of the States thereunder" as a condition for a Presidential [[pardon]]. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[ironclad oath|retroactive loyalty oaths]] were proposed by [[Radical Republicans]], which would have barred former Confederates and Confederate sympathizers from federal, state, or local  offices.  Beginning in 1862 all U.S. Naval shipyard employees were required to sign a loyalty oath as a condition of employment. Almira V. Brown nee Rudd, first went to work at the Washington Navy Yard in 1864 as a seamstress. Brown continued to work at the navy yard until her retirement in 1922 Brown’s husband Francis Brown was killed in a tragic explosion at the laboratory in March 1861.&lt;ref&gt;John G  Sharp ''Washington Navy Yard Payroll May 1862  with names and wages of Nineteen Female employees  of the Ordnance Department'', Laboratory 2010 Genealogy trails    http://genealogytrails.com/washdc/WNY/1862femalewagelab.html&lt;/ref&gt; The thumbnail image is of Virginia V. Brown's signed 21 March 1864 Loyalty Oath. 

[[File:Almira V. Brown Loyalty oath Washington Navy Yard 21 Mar 1864.jpg|thumb|During the Civil War the United States federal government required all naval shipyard  workers to sign a loyalty oath. This oath was signed by Almira Virginia Brown, a navy yard  seamstress on 21 March 1864.]]

===Roosevelt/Truman era===
[[File:Page one of Executive Order 9835.jpg|thumb|Page one of Executive Order 9835, signed by [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1947]]
In support of Roosevelt's [[National Recovery Administration]], 100,000 school children marched to Boston Common and swore a loyalty oath administered by the mayor, "I promise as a good American citizen to do my part for the NRA. I will buy only where the Blue Eagle flies." 

Loyalty oaths were common during World War II. 

Another use of loyalty oaths in the [[United States]] was during the 1950s and 1960s.  The [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] during the 1950s and the Congressional hearings chaired by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] helped to sustain a national mood of concern about [[communist]] [[espionage|agent]]s and a fear such agents may injure the U.S. government through [[espionage]] or outright violence.

==== Executive Order 9835 "Loyalty Order" (1947)====

On March 21, 1947, concerned with Soviet subversive penetration and infiltration into the United States government by American citizens who held oaths of allegiance to a foreign power during wartime, President [[Harry S Truman]] instituted a Loyalty Program by signing [[Executive Order 9835]], also known as the "Loyalty Order." It required loyalty oaths and background investigations on persons deemed suspect of holding party membership in organizations that advocated violent and anti-democratic programs.

====The University of California loyalty oath (1950)====

The [[Levering Act]] was a law enacted by the U.S. state of [[California]] in 1950. It required state employees to subscribe to a loyalty oath that specifically disavowed radical beliefs. It was aimed in particular at employees of the [[University of California]]. in January, 1950, 750 faculty members had approved a resolution to oppose the University's Regents and create a committee to coordinate legal action against the University should an oath be required. Several teachers resigned in protest or lost their positions when they refused to sign the loyalty oath. Among those who left were the psychologist  [[Erik Erikson]] and the classical scholar [[Ludwig Edelstein]], both of them [[Jewish]] refugees from [[Nazi]] [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz_VDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=professors+who+left+the+University+of+California+over+the+Levering+Act&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7fyLDtgEse&amp;sig=xC7pIS9BJyjTABkiurygLl8x7ZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi18tDGyPDRAhUowFQKHaVJDW0Q6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=professors+who+left+the+University+of+California+over+the+Levering+Act&amp;f=false|title=The International Journal of Indian Psychology, Volume 3, Issue 4, No. 82|first=|last=IJIP.In|date=25 December 2016|publisher=RED'SHINE Publication. Inc|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 1950, The Regents fired 31 faculty members who refused to sign the oath. Those who were terminated sued, and by 1952 had been rehired when the University declined to pursue its case against them in court. One of the fired faculty members, the physics professor [[David Saxon]] went on with his career and was appointed President of the entire University of California system in 1975, a job he held until 1983. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/loyaltyoath/|title=Introduction|website=bancroft.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/timelinesummary.html|title=Timeline: Summary of events of the Loyalty Oath Controversy 1949-54|website=www.lib.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Garner v. Board of Public Works (1951)====

Typically, a loyalty oath has wording similar to that mentioned in the U.S Supreme Court decision of ''[[Garner v. Board of Public Works]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''[[Garner v. Board of Public Works]]'', 341 U.S. 716 (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I further swear (or affirm) that I do not advise, advocate or teach, and have not within the period beginning five (5) years prior to the effective date of the ordinance requiring the making of this oath or affirmation, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means, of the Government of the United States of America or of the State of California and that I am not now and have not, within said period, been or become a member of or affiliated with any group, society, association, organization or party which advises, advocates or teaches, or has, within said period, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means of the Government of the United States of America, or of the State of California. I further swear (or affirm) that I will not, while I am in the service of the City of Los Angeles, advise, advocate or teach, or be or become a member of or affiliated with any group, association, society, organization or party which advises, advocates or teaches, or has within said period, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means, of the Government of the United States of America or of the State of California . . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Speiser v. Randall (1958)====

In ''[[Speiser v. Randall]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Speiser v. Randall]]'', 357 U.S. 513 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the State of California's loyalty oath, as required by a California law enacted in 1954, as a condition of exemption from property tax.  In applying for property tax exemption as a veteran of World War II, ACLU lawyer Lawrence Speiser had refused to sign the loyalty oath.  The court ruled that because the state required the claimant to show they are not advocating state overthrow and hence are not criminals within the applicable laws, the loyalty oath requirement to obtain the tax exemption is unconstitutional. The burden of proof for a criminal action rests on the state and not on the individual private citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=357&amp;invol=513 |title=SPEISER v. RANDALL, 357 U.S. 513 (1958) |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===

The oaths were repeatedly challenged on grounds that they violated the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of association. The [[United States Supreme Court]] avoided addressing these problems during the [[McCarthy Era]]. During the 1960s, it began striking down such oaths on the basis of vagueness and undue breadth. October 16, 1961 [[Tobias Simon]] and [[Howard Dixon]] argued ''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases involving the First Amendment#Speech by public employees|Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction]]'' before the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;This is a link to the argument from Oyes [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1961/1961_72 Cramp v. Bd. Of Public Instruction - Oral Argument]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 the Court struck down the Florida requirement that teachers swear "I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist party". This decision was followed in 1964 by its lack of support for two oaths, one of which required teachers to promote respect for the flag, reverence for law and order, and loyalty to the institutions of the United States and the [[Washington (state)|State of Washington]]. Arizona and New York teacher oaths affirming lack of association with subversive organizations were struck down in 1966 and 1967.

New York Education Law Section 3002 requires that any ‘teacher, instructor or professor in any [state] school or institution in the public school system … or in any school, college, university or other educational institution’ sign an oath pledging support for the federal and state constitutions. The law does not apply to foreign nationals, but only to United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/new-york/education/EDN03002_3002.html |title=New York Education Law Section 3002 |publisher=Law.onecle.com |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was enacted in 1934 in response to a nationwide campaign by the [[American Legion]].&lt;ref name="Halberstam"&gt;David Halberstam, [https://www.nytimes.com/1966/11/30/archives/27-on-adelphi-faculty-file-suit-challenging-state-loyalty-oath.html?sq=new%2520york%2520state%2520loyalty%2520oath&amp;scp=2&amp;st=cse "27 on Adelphi Faculty File Suit Challenging State Loyalty Oath"], ''[[New York Times]]'', November 30, 1966, pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was challenged by a group of 27 faculty members from [[Adelphi University]] in 1966 because the oath constrained free speech, and because it selectively applied to faculty members but not staff. For unknown reasons, Adelphi faculty had never been required to sign the oath until 1966 when a staff member in the New York State Education Department discovered the oversight.&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt; On January 22, 1968, after moving through the judicial system, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] affirmed an earlier District Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the law.&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/23/archives/justices-uphold-a-teachers-oath-back-state-law-requiring-a.html?sq=new%2520york%2520state%2520loyalty%2520oath&amp;scp=10&amp;st=cse "JUSTICES UPHOLD A TEACHERS' OATH; Back State Law Requiring a Constitutional Pledge"], ''[[New York Times]]'', January 23, 1968, pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first occasion on which the Supreme Court evaluated the constitutionality of oaths of this type.
The last major loyalty oath case heard by the court was decided in 1972, when it upheld a requirement that State of Massachusetts employees swear to uphold and defend the Constitution and to "oppose the overthrow of the [government] by force, violence, or by any illegal or unconstitutional method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Practical Companion to the Constitution|author=Jethro Koller Lieberman|year=2005|publisher=[[University of California]] Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmA8a1Q9UekC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22loyalty+oath%22+last&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA291,M1 | isbn=978-0-520-21280-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s–1990s===
{{Empty section|date=December 2009}}

===2000s===

====2004 Bush presidential campaign====
During the 2004 presidential campaign, the campaign of George W. Bush sometimes required all attendants at its rallies to take an oath. Those who refused to take the oath were not allowed to attend the rally. The "loyalty oath" was actually a pledge of endorsement. These endorsements were used during some of the campaign rallies in 2004. The Bush campaign asserted that the oath was valid because the president was conducting a partisan campaign event. Opponents countered that the oath was intrusive to individual conscience and denied general public access to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31019-2004Jul31.html |title=Milbank, Dana |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2004/07/30/news/wyoming/63b4fcb928fe8e6987256ee10054e715.txt|title=Some Democrats seeking Cheney tickets had to sign oath|first=RICHARD BENKE Associated Press|last=Writer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
The [[California]] [[California Constitution|state constitution]] requires all state workers who are US citizens to sign a loyalty oath as a term of employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html California Constitution], [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_20 Article XX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009015911/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_20 |date=2014-10-09 }}, Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 28, 2008, the [[California State University, East Bay]] fired Marianne Kearney-Brown, a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], for refusing to do so without inserting a reservation that her defense of the state and country would be done "[[pacifism|nonviolently]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/29/BAQPVAUVO.DTL Quaker teacher fired for changing loyalty oath], San Francisco Chronicle, February 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  She was reinstated a week later, when she agreed to sign the oath when accompanied by a document prepared by the university that included the clarification "Signing the oath does not carry with it any obligation or requirement that public employees bear arms or otherwise engage in violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/08/BADRVG6CI.DTL Pacifist Cal State teacher gets job back], San Francisco Chronicle, March 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of that oath begins:
"STATE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter."

====Arizona====
[[Arizona]] requires all employees of the state, its counties and localities to sign an oath of loyalty to the country and the state. The oath requirement predates statehood; it was successfully challenged in the 1960s over wording banning Communist Party membership, and was rewritten in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brahm |last=Resnik |url=http://www.12news.com/story/news/local/valley/2015/09/29/phoenix-college-instructor-quits-over-arizona-loyalty-oath/73010254/ |title=Phoenix College instructor quits over loyalty oath |publisher=[[KPNX]] |date=September 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ohio====
In the March 2008 State of Ohio presidential primary, some people might have been required to sign a loyalty oath in order to vote. Voters who wish to switch their party affiliation on Primary Election Day and who are challenged are supposed to sign a statement "stating that the person desires to be affiliated with and supports the principles of the political party whose ballot the person desires to vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3513.19 |title=Ohio Revised Code 3513.19 Challenges at primary elections |publisher=Codes.ohio.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement is signed under penalty of "election falsification." If the challenged person refuses to sign the statement under penalty of election falsification, he is given a provisional ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3513.20 |title=Ohio Revised Code 3513.20 Effect of challenge to voter at primary |publisher=Codes.ohio.gov |date=1981-10-20 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Cleveland Plain Dealer'', among others, thus describes the nature of the statement and effect of "election falsification": Anyone who signs this loyalty oath, but does not intend to honor it, can be prosecuted for "election falsification", a fifth-degree felony.&lt;ref name="The Plain Dealer"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Parties shouldn't require loyalty oaths at the polls

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute, however, describes the offense differently:  "No person, either orally or in writing, on oath lawfully administered or in a statement made under penalty of election falsification, shall knowingly state a falsehood as to a material matter relating to an election in a proceeding before a court, tribunal, or election official, or in a matter in relation to which an oath or statement under penalty of election falsification is authorized by law..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3599.36 |title=Ohio Revised Code 3599.36 Election falsification |publisher=Codes.ohio.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the requirement is, arguably, more a statement of current intent than a loyalty oath's promise of future support.

==Israel==
[[Avigdor Lieberman]] proposed that Israel's citizens should sign a loyalty oath or lose their right to vote. In his ''The Jewish Week'' article, Lieberman tried to explain his party's "no loyalty – no citizenship" campaign by writing: "During [[Operation Cast Lead]] in Gaza, I was appalled by the calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and for renewed suicide bombings that some Israeli Arab leaders called for at pro-Hamas rallies. Although 'responsible citizenship' had always been part of our platform, I realized that this was a burning issue that had to take top priority."&lt;ref name=benhorin&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">'''Manisch''' refers either to a dialect of [[rotwelsch]] (especially in the vicinity of greater [[Gießen]], [[Germany]]) or a speaker thereof (plural: ''Manische'' or ''Manen'').  The term ''Manisch'' however, is also understood primarily throughout much of the German state of [[Hesse]] and parts of the [[Rheinland Pfalz|Rhineland-Palatinate]] ({{lang-de|Rheinland-Pfalz}}) to refer to the Manisch/[[Yeniche language|Jenisch]] (alternatively [[Yeniche people|"gypsy"]]) elements of their [[vernacular]].&lt;ref name="Uni Koblenz"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Mathias E. Mnyampala.jpg|thumb|Mathias E. Mnyampala (1917-1969) was a Tanzanian lawyer, political activist, essayist, writer, historian and famous poet in Kiswahili language.]]'''Mathias E. Mnyampala''' (1917&amp;ndash;1969) was a [[Tanzania]]n writer, lawyer, and poet. Mnyampala was born on 18 November according to a [http://medihal.archives-ouvertes.fr/medihal-00864020 personal record form] of 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Mathieu|title=Mathias E.

He died on 8 June 1969 in Dodoma city, Tanzania. Mnyampala wrote in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the ''lingua franca'' of East Africa, not [[Gogo language|Cigogo]], the native language of his ethnic group.

Mnyampala wrote more than 25 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulokozi|first=Mlinzi|title=History of Kiswahili Poetry|year=1995|publisher=Institute of Kiswahili Research UDSM|location=Tanzania|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was ''Historia, mila, na desturi za Wagogo'', a history of the [[Gogo people]] commissioned by the British colonial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute|volume=67|issue=2|page=326|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.2307/1161450}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was translated into English by Gregory H. Maddox and published in 1995 as ''The Gogo: History, Customs, and Traditions''.

Mathias E. Mnyampala was working as a Tax Clerk for the Native Treasury in Dodoma during the colonial rule. He was intended to travel the whole Ugogo region in order to collect the tax and establish a census of the populations and their belongings. This is why he entered into contact with the ''Watemi'', the gogo traditional Kings and Rainmakers, who allowed him to write this historical book by giving him the oral sources of his ten years long work. The author was pioneering in Kiswahili in the early 1940s the ethno-history trend and in the same time was a faithful messenger for special correspondences between the then Freedom Fighters Movement called Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and the ''Watemi''.

After the Independence of Tanganyika in 1961, Mathias E. Mnyampala continued his administrative career in the Judicial system as a Magistrate. His former pro-TANU sympathies and his literary talent allowed him to become the national chairman of the association of Kiswahili poets called ''Usanifu wa Kiswahili na Ushairi Tanzania'' (UKUTA). This association was in charge to promote the diffusion of Kiswahili, the official language of the new Tanzanian Nation, by teaching to the Tanzanian masses the classical forms of Kiswahili poetry and their conservative transformations.

'''Maynas''' (Mayna, Maina), also known as '''Rimachu''', is an extinct and unclassified language of [[Peru]]. Several sources have listed it as a dialect of [[Omurano language|Omurano]], which also goes by the name ''Mayna'', but Hammarström (2011) showed that they are separate languages. Attempts have been made to link Maynas with the Jivaroan, Cahuapanan, Zaparoan, and Candoshi languages, but they have not yet been conclusive (Campbell &amp; Grondona 2012).

In the [[construction]] industry, '''moling''' is a [[trenchless]] method used to lay [[Pipe (material)|pipes]].  During the moling process, a [[pneumatic|pneumatically-driven]] machine known as a mole forces its way through the [[soil]] along the desired path of the pipe.  Moling avoids the need to dig a [[trench]] and can be used to lay [[water pipes]] and the heating coils of [[heat pump]] systems. 

Recently moles that are steerable have been developed allowing an operator to correct the track of the mole and to achieve curved bores.

[[Image:cable digging tool.jpg|thumb|Mole]]
The standard approach to moling is to dig a hole about 1&amp;nbsp;m square and 2&amp;nbsp;m deep. Such a hole is small enough that it can be dug by hand instead of by machine in inaccessible locations.  The mole is then entered into the earth on the horizontal face at the bottom of this hole.  A destination hole of similar proportions is also dug, and this is where the mole emerges.  The mole itself is a [[steel]] cylinder about 60&amp;nbsp;cm long and 6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  It works as a [[pneumatic cylinder]] with pulsed compressed air causing the head of the mole to repeatedly hammer against the soil in front of the mole.  Once the mole has passed through the earth the pipe can be pulled through the long horizontal hole.

'''Olivier Maulin''' (born 1969 in [[Alsace]]) is a French writer. His works have been characterised by humour and satire. His 2006 novel ''En attendant le roi du monde'' received the [[Ouest-France]] Prize at the Étonnants voyageurs festival. The journalist Jérôme Leroy has described Maulin as an "anar de droite", a right-wing anarchist, and thereby grouped him with writers such as [[François Rabelais]], [[Marcel Aymé]], [[Antoine Blondin]] and the screenwriter [[Michel Audiard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leroy|first=Jérôme|date=2011-12-15|url=http://www.valeursactuelles.com/culture/olivier-maulin-anar-de-droite-30496|title=Olivier Maulin, anar de droite|language=French|work=[[Valeurs Actuelles]]|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing Maulin's novel ''Les Lumières du ciel'' for ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] described Maulin as a "neo-hippie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Beigbeder|first=Frédéric|authorlink=Frédéric Beigbeder|date=2011-09-24|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2011/09/24/01006-20110924ARTFIG00586-maulin-le-neo-hippie.php|title=Maulin le néo-hippie|language=French|work=[[Le Figaro]]|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Natural language processing]]''' &amp;ndash; computer activity in which computers are entailed to [[natural language understanding|analyze, understand]], [[natural language generation|alter, or generate]] [[natural language]].  This includes the [[automation]] of any or all linguistic forms, activities, or methods of communication, such as [[conversation]], correspondence, [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[Composition (language)|written composition]], [[dictation (exercise)|dictation]], [[publishing]], [[translation]], [[lip reading]], and so on.  Natural language processing is also the name of the branch of [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[linguistics]] concerned with enabling computers to engage in communication using natural language(s) in all forms, including but not limited to [[speech]], [[written language|print]], [[writing]], and [[sign language|signing]].

== Natural language processing ==

Natural language processing can be described as all of the following:
* A field of [[science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.&lt;ref&gt;"... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief) ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'' New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-511229-6}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
**** A subfield of [[computer programming]] &amp;ndash; process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages (such as Java, C++, C#, Python, etc.). The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors.
***** A subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] programming &amp;ndash;
* A type of [[system]] &amp;ndash; set of interacting or interdependent components forming an integrated whole or a set of elements (often called 'components' ) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** A system that includes [[software]] &amp;ndash;  software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer. In other words, software is a set of programs, procedures, algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system.
* A type of [[technology]] &amp;ndash; making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments.
** A form of [[computer technology]] &amp;ndash; computers and their application. NLP makes use of computers, image scanners, microphones, and many types of software programs.
*** [[Language technology]] &amp;ndash;  consists of natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL) on the one hand, and speech technology on the other. It also includes many application oriented aspects of these. It is often called human language technology (HLT).

* [[Statistical natural language processing]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Statistical semantics]] &amp;ndash; a subfield of [[computational semantics]] that establishes semantic relations between words to examine their contexts. 
*** [[Distributional semantics]] &amp;ndash; a subfield of [[statistical semantics]] that examines the semantic relationship of words across a corpora or in large samples of data.

== Related fields ==
Natural language processing contributes to, and makes use of (the theories, tools, and methodologies from), the following fields:

* [[Automated reasoning]] &amp;ndash; area of computer science and mathematical logic dedicated to understanding various aspects of reasoning, and producing software which allows computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. A sub-field of artificial intelligence, automatic reasoning is also grounded in theoretical computer science and philosophy of mind.
* [[Linguistics]] &amp;ndash; scientific study of human language. Natural language processing requires understanding of the structure and application of language, and therefore it draws heavily from linguistics.
** [[Applied linguistics]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary field of study that identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied linguistics are education, linguistics, psychology, computer science, anthropology, and sociology. Some of the subfields of applied linguistics relevant to natural language processing are:
*** [[Multilingualism|Bilingualism / Multilingualism]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[Computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) &amp;ndash; any communicative transaction that occurs through the use of two or more networked computers.&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, Denis. (2005). ''Mcquail's Mass Communication Theory''. 5th ed. London: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on CMC focuses largely on the social effects of different computer-supported communication technologies. Many recent studies involve Internet-based [[social networking]] supported by [[social software]].
*** [[Contrastive linguistics]] &amp;ndash; practice-oriented linguistic approach that seeks to describe the differences and similarities between a pair of languages.
*** [[Conversation analysis]] (CA) &amp;ndash; approach to the study of social interaction, embracing both verbal and non-verbal conduct, in situations of everyday life. [[Turn-taking]] is one aspect of language use that is studied by CA.
*** [[Discourse analysis]] &amp;ndash; various approaches to analyzing written, vocal, or sign language use or any significant semiotic event.
*** [[Forensic linguistics]] &amp;ndash; application of linguistic knowledge, methods and insights to the forensic context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure.
*** [[Interlinguistics]] &amp;ndash; study of improving communications between people of different first languages with the use of ethnic and auxiliary languages (lingua franca). For instance by use of intentional international auxiliary languages, such as Esperanto or Interlingua, or spontaneous interlanguages known as pidgin languages.
*** [[Language assessment]] &amp;ndash; assessment of first, second or other language in the school, college, or university context; assessment of language use in the workplace; and assessment of language in the immigration, citizenship, and asylum contexts. The assessment may include analyses of listening, speaking, reading, writing or cultural understanding, with respect to understanding how the language works theoretically and the ability to use the language practically.
*** [[Language pedagogy]] &amp;ndash; science and art of language education, including approaches and methods of language teaching and study. Natural language processing is used in programs designed to teach language, including first and second language training.
*** [[Language planning]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[Language policy]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[Lexicography]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[literacy|Literacies]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[Pragmatics]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[Second language acquisition]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[stylistics (literature)|Stylistics]] &amp;ndash; 
*** [[Translation]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Computational linguistics]] &amp;ndash;  interdisciplinary field dealing with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. The models and tools of computational linguistics are used extensively in the field of natural language processing, and vice versa.
*** [[Computational semantics]] &amp;ndash;
*** [[Corpus linguistics]] &amp;ndash; study of language as expressed in samples ''(corpora)'' of "real world" text.  ''Corpora'' is the plural of ''corpus'', and a corpus is a specifically selected collection of texts (or speech segments) composed of natural language. After it is constructed (gathered or composed), a corpus is analyzed with the methods of computational linguistics to infer the meaning and context of its components (words, phrases, and sentences), and the relationships between them.  Optionally, a corpus can be annotated ("tagged") with data (manually or automatically) to make the corpus easier to understand (e.g., [[part-of-speech tagging]]).  This data is then applied to make sense of user input, for example, to make better (automated) guesses of what people are talking about or saying, perhaps to achieve more narrowly focused web searches, or for speech recognition.
** [[Metalinguistics]] &amp;ndash; 
** [[Sign language#Linguistics of sign|Sign linguistics]] &amp;ndash; scientific study and analysis of natural sign languages, their features, their structure (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics), their acquisition (as a primary or secondary language), how they develop independently of other languages, their application in communication, their relationships to other languages (including spoken languages), and many other aspects.
* [[Human–computer interaction]] &amp;ndash; the intersection of computer science and behavioral sciences, this field involves the study, planning, and design of the interaction between people (users) and computers.  Attention to human-machine interaction is important, because poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example of this is the [[Three Mile Island accident]] where investigations concluded that the design of the human–machine interface was at least partially responsible for the disaster.
* [[Information retrieval]] (IR) &amp;ndash; field concerned with storing, searching and retrieving information. It is a separate field within computer science (closer to databases), but IR relies on some NLP methods (for example, stemming). Some current research and applications seek to bridge the gap between IR and NLP.
* [[Knowledge representation]] (KR) &amp;ndash; area of artificial intelligence research aimed at representing knowledge in symbols to facilitate inferencing from those knowledge elements, creating new elements of knowledge. Knowledge Representation research involves analysis of how to reason accurately and effectively and how best to use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a knowledge domain.
** [[Semantic network]] &amp;ndash; study of semantic relations between concepts. 
*** [[Semantic Web]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Machine learning]] &amp;ndash; subfield of computer science that examines pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. There are three broad approaches to machine learning.  [[Supervised learning]] occurs when the machine is given example inputs and outputs by a teacher so that it can learn a rule that maps inputs to outputs. [[Unsupervised learning]] occurs when the machine determines the inputs structure without being provided example inputs or outputs. [[Reinforcement learning]] occurs when a machine must perform a goal without teacher feedback.   
** [[Pattern recognition]] &amp;ndash; branch of [[machine learning]] that examines how machines recognize regularities in data. As with machine learning, teachers can train machines to recognize patterns by providing them with example inputs and outputs (i.e. [[Supervised learning|Supervised Learning]]), or the machines can recognize patterns without being trained on any example inputs or outputs (i.e. [[Unsupervised learning|Unsupervised Learning]]).
** [[Statistical classification]] &amp;ndash;

== Structures used in natural language processing ==
* [[Anaphora (linguistics)|Anaphora]] &amp;ndash; type of expression whose reference depends upon another referential element. E.g., in the sentence 'Sally preferred the company of herself', 'herself' is an anaphoric expression in that it is coreferential with 'Sally', the sentence's subject.
* [[Context-free language]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Controlled natural language]] &amp;ndash; a natural language with a restriction introduced on its grammar and vocabulary in order to eliminate ambiguity and complexity
* Corpus &amp;ndash; body of data, optionally tagged (for example, through [[part-of-speech tagging]]), providing real world samples for analysis and comparison.
** [[Text corpus]] &amp;ndash; large and structured set of texts, nowadays usually electronically stored and processed. They are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific subject (or ''domain'').
** [[Speech corpus]] &amp;ndash; database of speech audio files and text transcriptions. In Speech technology, speech corpora are used, among other things, to create acoustic models (which can then be used with a speech recognition engine). In Linguistics, spoken corpora are used to do research into phonetic, conversation analysis, dialectology and other fields.
* [[Grammar]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Context-free grammar]] (CFG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Constraint grammar]] (CG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Definite clause grammar]] (DCG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Functional unification grammar]] (FUG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Probabilistic context-free grammar]] (PCFG) &amp;ndash; another name for stochastic context-free grammar.
** [[Stochastic context-free grammar]] (SCFG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Systemic functional grammar]] (SFG) &amp;ndash;
** [[Tree-adjoining grammar]] (TAG) &amp;ndash;
* [[Natural language]] &amp;ndash;
* [[N-gram|''n''-gram]] – sequence of ''n'' number of tokens, where a "token" is a character, syllable, or word. The ''n'' is replaced by a number. Therefore, a 5-gram is an ''n''-gram of 5 letters, syllables, or words. "Eat this" is a 2-gram (also known as a bigram).
** [[Bigram]] &amp;ndash; ''n''-gram of 2 tokens. Every sequence of 2 adjacent elements in a string of tokens is a bigram. Bigrams are used for speech recognition, they can be used to solve cryptograms, and bigram frequency is one approach to statistical language identification.
** [[Trigram]] –  special case of the ''n''-gram, where ''n'' is 3.
* [[Ontology (information science)|Ontology]] &amp;ndash; formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.
** [[Taxonomy (general)|Taxonomy]] &amp;ndash; practice and science of classification, including the principles underlying classification, and the methods of classifying things or concepts.
*** [[Hyponymy and hypernymy]] &amp;ndash; the linguistics of hyponyms and hypernyms.  A hyponym shares a type-of relationship with its hypernym. For example, pigeon, crow, eagle and seagull are all hyponyms of bird (their hypernym); which, in turn, is a hyponym of animal. 
*** [[Taxonomy for search engines]] &amp;ndash; typically called a "taxonomy of entities". It is a [[tree structure|tree]] in which nodes are labelled with entities which are expected to occur in a web search query. These trees are used to match keywords from a search query with the keywords from relevant answers (or snippets).
* [[Textual entailment]] – directional relation between text fragments. The relation holds whenever the truth of one text fragment follows from another text. In the TE framework, the entailing and entailed texts are termed text (t) and hypothesis (h), respectively. The relation is directional because even if "t entails h", the reverse "h entails t" is much less certain.
* [[Triphone]] – sequence of three phonemes. Triphones are useful in models of natural language processing where they are used to establish the various contexts in which a phoneme can occur in a particular natural language.

== Processes of NLP ==

===Applications===
* [[Automated essay scoring]] (AES) &amp;ndash; the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades to essays written in an educational setting. It is a method of educational assessment and an application of natural language processing. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual entities into a small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible grades—for example, the numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of statistical classification.
* [[Automatic image annotation]] &amp;ndash; process by which a computer system automatically assigns textual metadata in the form of captioning or keywords to a digital image. The annotations are used in image retrieval systems to organize and locate images of interest from a database. 
* [[Automatic summarization]] &amp;ndash; process of reducing a text document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper.
** Types
*** Keyphrase extraction &amp;ndash;
*** Document summarization &amp;ndash;
**** [[Multi-document summarization]] &amp;ndash;
** Methods and techniques
*** Extraction-based summarization &amp;ndash;
*** Abstraction-based summarization &amp;ndash;
*** Maximum entropy-based summarization &amp;ndash;
*** [[Sentence extraction]] &amp;ndash;
*** Aided summarization &amp;ndash;
**** Human aided machine summarization (HAMS) &amp;ndash;
**** Machine aided human summarization (MAHS) &amp;ndash;
* [[Automatic taxonomy induction]] &amp;ndash; automated construction of [[tree structure]]s from a corpus. This may be applied to building taxonomical classification systems for reading by end users, such as web directories or subject outlines.
* [[Coreference#Coreference resolution|Coreference resolution]] &amp;ndash; in order to derive the correct interpretation of text, or even to estimate the relative importance of various mentioned subjects, pronouns and other referring expressions need to be connected to the right individuals or objects. Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, coreference resolution determines which words ("mentions") refer to which objects ("entities") included in the text.
** [[Anaphora resolution]] &amp;ndash; concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names that they refer to. For example, in a sentence such as "He entered John's house through the front door", "the front door" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).
* [[Dialog system]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Foreign-language reading aid]] &amp;ndash; computer program that assists a non-native language user to read properly in their target language. The proper reading means that the pronunciation should be correct and stress to different parts of the words should be proper. 
* [[Foreign language writing aid]] &amp;ndash; computer program or any other instrument that assists a non-native language user (also referred to as a foreign language learner) in writing decently in their target language. Assistive operations can be classified into two categories: on-the-fly prompts and post-writing checks. 
* [[Grammar checker|Grammar checking]] &amp;ndash; the act of verifying the grammatical correctness of written text, especially if this act is performed by a [[computer program]].
* [[Information retrieval]] – 
** [[Cross-language information retrieval]] &amp;ndash; 
* [[Machine translation]] (MT) &amp;ndash; aims to automatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly.
** Classical approach of machine translation &amp;ndash; rules-based machine translation.
** [[Computer-assisted translation]] &amp;ndash;
*** [[Interactive machine translation]] &amp;ndash;
*** [[Translation memory]] &amp;ndash; database that stores so-called "segments", which can be sentences, paragraphs or sentence-like units (headings, titles or elements in a list) that have previously been translated, in order to aid human translators.
** [[Example-based machine translation]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Rule-based machine translation]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Natural language programming]] &amp;ndash; interpreting and compiling instructions communicated in natural language into computer instructions (machine code).
* [[Natural language user interface|Natural language search]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) &amp;ndash; given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.
* [[Question answering]] &amp;ndash; given a human-language question, determine its answer.  Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as "What is the capital of Canada?"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as "What is the meaning of life?").
** [[Open domain question answering]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Naive Bayes spam filtering|Spam filtering]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Sentiment analysis]] &amp;ndash; extracts subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine "polarity" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.
* [[Speech recognition]] &amp;ndash; given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of [[text to speech]] and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]" (see above).  In [[natural speech]] there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus [[speech segmentation]] is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below).  Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed [[coarticulation]], so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process.
* [[Speech synthesis]] (Text-to-speech) &amp;ndash;
* [[Text-proofing]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Text simplification]] &amp;ndash; automated editing a document to include fewer words, or use easier words, while retaining its underlying meaning and information.

===Component processes===
* [[Natural language understanding]] &amp;ndash; converts chunks of text into more formal representations such as [[first-order logic]] structures that are easier for [[computer]] programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural languages concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural languages semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as [[closed-world assumption]] (CWA) vs. [[open-world assumption]], or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.&lt;ref&gt;Yucong Duan, Christophe Cruz (2011), ''[http &amp;ndash;//www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm Formalizing Semantic of Natural Language through Conceptualization from Existence]''. International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology(2011) 2 (1), pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Natural language generation]] &amp;ndash; task of converting information from computer databases into readable  human language.

==== Component processes of natural language understanding ====
* [[Automatic document classification]] (text categorization) &amp;ndash;
** [[Automatic language identification]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Compound term processing]] &amp;ndash; category of techniques that identify compound terms and match them to their definitions. Compound terms are built by combining two (or more) simple terms, for example "triple" is a single word term but "triple heart bypass" is a compound term.
* [[Automatic taxonomy induction]] &amp;ndash;
* Corpus processing &amp;ndash;
** [[Automatic acquisition of lexicon]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Text normalization]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Text simplification]] – 
* [[Deep linguistic processing]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Discourse analysis]] &amp;ndash; includes a number of related tasks.  One task is identifying the [[discourse]] structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the [[speech act]]s in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no questions, content questions, statements, assertions, orders, suggestions, etc.).
* [[Information extraction]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Text mining]] &amp;ndash; process of deriving high-quality information from text. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning.
*** [[Biomedical text mining]] &amp;ndash;  (also known as BioNLP), this is text mining applied to texts and literature of the biomedical and molecular biology domain. It is a rather recent research field drawing elements from natural language processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics and computational linguistics. There is an increasing interest in text mining and information extraction strategies applied to the biomedical and molecular biology literature due to the increasing number of electronically available publications stored in databases such as PubMed.
*** [[Decision tree learning]] &amp;ndash;
*** [[Sentence extraction]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Terminology extraction]] – 
* [[Latent semantic indexing]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Lemmatisation]] &amp;ndash; groups together all like terms that share a same lemma such that they are classified as a single item. 
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological segmentation]] &amp;ndash; separates words into individual [[morphemes]] and identifies the class of the morphemes.  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered.  [[English language|English]] has fairly simple morphology, especially [[inflectional morphology]], and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. "open, opens, opened, opening") as separate words.  In languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.
* [[Named entity recognition]] (NER) &amp;ndash; given a stream of text, determines which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization).  Note that, although [[capitalization]] can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first word of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names.  For example, [[German language|German]] capitalizes all [[noun]]s, regardless of whether they refer to names, and [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] do not capitalize names that serve as [[adjective]]s.
* [[Ontology learning]] &amp;ndash;  automatic or semi-automatic creation of [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]], including extracting the corresponding domain's terms and the relationships between those concepts from a corpus of natural language text, and encoding them with an [[ontology language]] for easy retrieval. Also called "ontology extraction", "ontology generation", and "ontology acquisition".
* [[Parsing]] &amp;ndash; determines the [[parse tree]] (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  The [[grammar]] for [[natural language]]s is [[ambiguous]] and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.  In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human).
** [[Shallow parsing]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Part-of-speech tagging]] &amp;ndash; given a sentence, determines the [[part of speech]] for each word.  Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple [[parts of speech]].  For example, "book" can be a [[noun]] ("the book on the table") or [[verb]] ("to book a flight"); "set" can be a [[noun]], [[verb]] or [[adjective]]; and "out" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  Note that some languages have more such ambiguity than others.  Languages with little [[inflectional morphology]], such as [[English language|English]] are particularly prone to such ambiguity. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] is prone to such ambiguity because it is a [[tonal language]] during verbalization. Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.
* [[Query expansion]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Relationship extraction]] &amp;ndash; given a chunk of text, identifies the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is the wife of whom).
* [[Semantic analysis (computational)]] – formal analysis of meaning, and "computational" refers to approaches that in principle support effective implementation.
** [[Explicit semantic analysis]] &amp;ndash; 
** [[Latent semantic analysis]] – 
** [[Semantic analytics]] – 
* [[Sentence breaking]] (also known as [[sentence boundary disambiguation]] and sentence detection) &amp;ndash; given a chunk of text, finds the sentence boundaries.  Sentence boundaries are often marked by [[full stop|period]]s or other [[punctuation mark]]s, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking [[abbreviation]]s).
* [[Speech segmentation]] &amp;ndash; given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separates it into words.  A subtask of [[speech recognition]] and typically grouped with it.
* [[Stemming]] &amp;ndash; reduces an inflected or derived word into its [[word stem]], base, or [[Root (linguistics)|root]] form.
* [[Shallow parsing|Text chunking]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|Tokenization]] &amp;ndash; given a chunk of text, separates it into distinct words, symbols, sentences, or other units
* [[Topic segmentation]] and recognition &amp;ndash; given a chunk of text, separates it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identifies the topic of the segment.
* [[Truecasing]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Word segmentation]] &amp;ndash; separates a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  For a language like [[English language|English]], this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  However, some written languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the [[vocabulary]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words in the language.
* [[Word sense disambiguation]] (WSD) &amp;ndash; because many words have more than one [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], word sense disambiguation is used to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or from an online resource such as [[WordNet]].
** [[Word-sense induction]] – open problem of natural language processing, which concerns the automatic identification of the senses of a word (i.e. meanings). Given that the output of word-sense induction is a set of senses for the target word (sense inventory), this task is strictly related to that of word-sense disambiguation (WSD), which relies on a predefined sense inventory and aims to solve the ambiguity of words in context.
** [[Automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora]] &amp;ndash;
* [[W-shingling]] – set of unique "shingles"—contiguous subsequences of tokens in a document—that can be used to gauge the similarity of two documents. The w denotes the number of tokens in each shingle in the set.

==== Component processes of natural language generation ====
[[Natural language generation]] &amp;ndash; task of converting information from computer databases into readable  human language.
* [[Automatic taxonomy induction]] (ATI) &amp;ndash; automated building of [[tree structure]]s from a corpus. While ATI is used to construct the core of ontologies (and doing so makes it a component process of natural language understanding), when the ontologies being constructed are end user readable (such as a subject outline), and these are used for the construction of further documentation (such as using an outline as the basis to construct a report or treatise) this also becomes a component process of natural language generation.

* [[Turing test]] &amp;ndash; test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior, equivalent to or indistinguishable from, that of an actual human. In the original illustrative example, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which opens with the words: "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"
* [[Universal grammar]] &amp;ndash; theory in [[linguistics]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]], proposing that the ability to learn grammar is hard-wired into the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html McGill University, Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory suggests that linguistic ability manifests itself without being taught (''see'' [[poverty of the stimulus]]), and that there are properties that all natural [[human languages]] share. It is a matter of observation and experimentation to determine precisely what abilities are innate and what properties are shared by all languages. 
* [[ALPAC]] &amp;ndash; was a committee of seven scientists led by John R. Pierce, established in 1964 by the U. S. Government in order to evaluate the progress in computational linguistics in general and machine translation in particular. Its report, issued in 1966, gained notoriety for being very skeptical of research done in machine translation so far, and emphasizing the need for basic research in computational linguistics; this eventually caused the U. S. Government to reduce its funding of the topic dramatically.
* [[Conceptual dependency theory]] &amp;ndash; a model of natural language understanding used in artificial intelligence systems.  [[Roger Schank]] at Stanford University introduced the model in 1969, in the early days of artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Schank]], 1969, ''A conceptual dependency parser for natural language'' Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics, Sång-Säby, Sweden pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; This model was extensively used by Schank's students at Yale University such as Robert Wilensky, Wendy Lehnert, and Janet Kolodner.
* [[Augmented transition network]] &amp;ndash; type of graph theoretic structure used in the operational definition of formal languages, used especially in parsing relatively complex natural languages, and having wide application in artificial intelligence.  Introduced by William A. Woods in 1970.
* [[Distributed Language Translation]] (project) &amp;ndash;

'''Panoan''' (also '''Pánoan''', '''Panoano''', '''Panoana''', '''Páno''') is a family of languages spoken in [[Peru]], western [[Brazil]], and [[Bolivia]]. It is a branch of the larger [[Pano–Tacanan]] family.

==Languages==

There are some 18 extant and 14 extinct Panoan languages.&lt;ref name=Fleck&gt;David Fleck, 2013, ''[http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/handle/2246/6448/AP99.pdf?sequence=1 Panoan Languages and Linguistics]'', Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History #99&lt;/ref&gt; In the list, (†) means extinct, and (*) obsolescent (no longer spoken daily).  Dialects are listed in parentheses.

Boundaries between the Poyanawa, Chama, and Headwaters groups are somewhat blurred. Karipuna and Môa River Nawa may not be distinct languages, and Chiriba may not be Panoan at all.

Hundreds of other Panoan "languages" have been reported in the literature. These are names of groups that may have been ethnically Panoan, but whose language is unattested. They sometimes are assumed to be Panoan on no other evidence than that the name ends in ''-nawa'' or ''-bo''. A few, such as [[Maya language (Brazil)|Maya]] (Pisabo), are unattested but reported to be mutually intelligible with a known Panoan language (in this case Matsés).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The people speaking one of these supposed languages, Kontanawa,&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|kont1246|Kontanawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; was rediscovered in 2002. However, no linguistic information is available, and it is not known if they speak a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homonyms===
Much of the confusion surrounding Panoan languages is the number of homonyms among different languages. The principal ambiguous names are as follows:&lt;ref name=Fleck/&gt;

==Genetic relations==

The Panoan family is generally believed to be related to the [[Tacanan]] family, forming with it [[Pano–Tacanan]], though this has not yet been established (Loos 1999).

==Grammatical features==

===Body-part prefixation===

Exceptional to Panoan languages’ predominantly suffixal morphology are sets of approximately 30 morphemes primarily referring to parts or features of prototypical human and animal bodies (and, by analogical extension, of botanicals, manufactures, landscapes, and abstract space) which have been found to occur in almost all attested languages of the family (Fleck 2006: 59; Ferreira 2007, 2008; Amarante Ribeiro and Cândido 2008; Zariquiey and Fleck 2012: 385–386). 

That these monosyllabic forms are productively affixed to the front of verbal, nominal, or adjectival roots has led many Panoanists to describe them as prefixes (e.g. Prost 1967 and Zingg 1998 [for Chakobo]; Faust 1973, Loriot et al. 1993, and Valenzuela 2003 [for Shipibo-Konibo]; Hyde 1980 [for Amawaka]; Eakin 1991[for Yaminawa]), while the forms’ resemblance and loose semantic correspondence to unbound, polysyllabic ‘body-part terms’ has led others to describe them as incorporated nouns (e.g. Loos 1999). More recent and detailed analyses of this feature in Matses (Fleck 2006) and Kashibo-Kakataibo (Zariquiey and Fleck 2012) have demonstrated that most body-part prefixes in these languages are not readily analyzable as synchronic allomorphs of the nouns they resemble.

Many Panoan body-part prefixes semantically encompass a range of denotata beyond the strictly 'corporeal' by means of analogical extension. In Matses, for example, the prefix ''an-'' corresponds to the nouns ''ana'' ‘mouth, tongue, palm (of hand), sole (of foot), (arm)pit’; ''anmaëşh'' ‘gill slits (of fish)’; and ''anşhantuk'' ‘swampy depression in the ground’; but can itself be glossed also as ‘cavity, concave surface, interior, underside’; and ‘center (of path of stream)’ (Fleck 2006: 64). In the examples below, the prefix ''an-'' with the verb root ''kiad'' ‘learn’ expresses the learning of a specifically ‘oral activity’ while the prefix ''më-'' ‘hand, mortar, forearm, wrist, projecting carpal bones, elbow, finger, knuckles, fingernail, branch’ expresses the learning of a specifically ‘manual’ one:

::{|
|-
| '''''an-'''kiad-o-bi''
|-
| '''mouth-'''learn-PAST-1S
|-
| ‘I learned with respect to (my) mouth’, i.e., ‘I learned an oral activity’ (a language, to speak, a song, to sing, to recite the alphabet, to whistle, to eat a type of food, etc.) (Fleck 2006: 78)
|}

::{|
|-
| '''''më-'''kiad-o-bi''
|-
| '''hand-'''learn-PAST-1S
|-
| ‘I learned to weave, write, do math problems, fire shotgun, fletch arrows, or other manual tasks’ (Fleck 2006: 78)
|}

The following example illustrates how ''an-'' can express locative information in non-corporeal, topographical space:

::{|
|-
| ''nëid-ø'' || '''''an-'''san-aşh'' || ''we-ta'' || ''ø'' || ''ke-pa-ak'' || ''ka-denne-k'' || ''ke-onda-şh''
|-
| this.one-ABS || '''center-'''put:PL.O-after:S/A&gt;S || lie-IMPER || 3ABS || say-TOP.CONT-NARR.PAST || tell-REM.PAST.INDIC || tell-DIST.PAST-3
|}
::'"Put this one in the middle [of the path] and then lie down!" he [the moon] said, they used to tell, I was told' (Fleck 2006: 80).

While body-part prefixes in Kashibo-Kakataibo, as in Matses, are highly productive with verbs, they are used regularly with only a modest array of adjectives and nouns (Fleck 2006: 72; Zariquiey and Fleck 2012: 394–5). Zariquiey and Fleck (2012: 394) note that the Kashibo-Kakataibo "words for 'skin', 'hair', and 'flesh'" are regularly prefixed:

::{|
|-
| ''kapë'' || '''''të-'''şhaka'' || ''mëra-aşh'' ...
|-
| caiman || '''neck-'''skin.ABS || find-S/A&gt;S
|}
:: 'finding the caiman's neck skin ...' (Zariquiey and Fleck 2012: 395).

Due to the paucity of detailed studies of Panoan body-part prefixes, explanations of their grammaticalization remain largely speculative. Fleck has hypothesized that "Panoan (verb) prefixation evolved from past noun incorporation that co-existed with noun-noun and noun-adjective compounding that involved synchronic reduction of body-part roots" (2006: 92). In light of their analysis of Kashibo-Kakataibo prefixation, Zariquiey and Fleck present two diachronic scenarios to orient future comparative work: "(1) prefixation evolved from productive noun incorporation (prefixes have come from longer body-part nouns); or (2) Proto-Panoan body-part terms were monosyllabic forms that became bound, and most of the current body-part terms were later built up from these" (2012: 408).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1234">A '''personal record''' or '''personal best''' (frequently abbreviated to PR or PB) is an individual's best performance in a given [[sport]]ing discipline. It is most commonly found in [[athletic sports]], such as [[track and field]], other forms of [[running]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]].

The term "PR" came from the world of running, referring to a person's best time in a race of a specific distance. So, if someone runs their first 5K race in 28:45, that's their PR for the 5K distance. If they run faster than 28:45 in a subsequent 5K race, then they have a new PR for that distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kuehls | first1 = Dave | title = How to Run a Personal Record: Cover the Ground in Front of You Faster Than Ever Before | publisher = Penguin | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1440661877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, "PR" came to mean any new record in a sport that could be performed by a single person. [[Crossfit]] and [[powerlifting]] have popularized the term because a person's PR is used to measure their current level for a given exercise.

Radhakanta Deb always showed marked interest in promoting [[education]], particularly English education among the Hindus; he also advocated [[female education]].&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt; Radhakanta Deb was actively involved in the establishment and activities of the [[Calcutta School Book Society]] in 1817 and the Calcutta School Society in 1818.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt; Radhakanta was an active member of the [[Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India]] since its establishment in 1818.

Despite his contribution to the cause of education, he was a strong upholder of [[social conservatism]]. Although ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' was not practiced in his own family, he came forward to defend the custom when the Government contemplated its abolition.  When [[Lord William Bentinck]]'s government had finally abolished ''sati'' by a regulation in December, 1829, Radhakanta Deb, along with his conservative Hindu friends, was the leader a society called [[Dharma Sabha]] (founded by his father [[Gopi Mohun Deb]]), protested against this measure by presenting a petition to the Governor General on behalf of the orthodox section of the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Samburu''' is a [[Maa languages|Maa language]] dialect spoken by [[Samburu people|Samburu]] pastoralists in northern [[Kenya]]. The Samburu number about 128,000 (or 147,000 including the Camus/Chamus).{{when|date=April 2012}} The Samburu dialect is closely related to [[Camus dialect]] (88% to 94% lexical similarity) and to the South Maasai dialects (77% to 89% lexical similarity). The word "Samburu" itself may derive from the Maa word ''saamburr'' for a leather bag the Samburu use.

'''Sargam''' refers to singing the [[swara|note]]s instead of the words of a [[bandish|composition]], with use of various ornamentations such as [[meend]], [[gamak]], kan and khatka, as part of a [[khyal]] performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itcsra.org/sra_faq_index.html Sargam] at the [[ITC Sangeet Research Academy]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally done in medium-tempo as a bridge between the [[alap]] and [[taan]] portions. As an example, one could sing PmRSnSRRSRnSPnmPgmnnPmgmRSnS in [[raga]] [[Adana (raga)|Adana]], given that raga's [[Vadi (music)|vadi]]-[[samvadi]] and the rules of the raga (see ''[[swara]]'' for explanation of the notes).

The use of sargam in khyal performances was introduced by [[Abdul Karim Khan]], who was inspired by its use in [[Carnatic music]]. [[Aman Ali Khan]] further refined its use and made it an integral part of the [[Bhendibazaar gharana|Bhendibazaar style]]. Many of the khyal [[gharana|styles]] today use sargam to some extent, with the exception of the [[Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana|Jaipur-Atrauli]] and [[Gwalior Gharana|Gwalior]] styles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24782">'''Sensory deprivation''' or '''perceptual isolation'''&lt;ref&gt;Donald Olding Hebb, Essay on Mind, Psychological Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate reduction or removal of [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from one or more of the senses. Simple devices such as [[blindfold]]s or [[Hood (headgear)|hoods]] and [[earmuff]]s can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and 'gravity'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various [[alternative medicine]]s and in [[psychology|psychological]] experiments (e.g. with an [[isolation tank]]).

Short-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to [[meditation]]; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme [[anxiety]], [[hallucination]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sireteanu | first1 = R | last2 = Oertel | first2 = V | last3 = Mohr | first3 = H | last4 = Linden | first4 = D | last5 = Singer | first5 = W | year = 2008 | title = Graphical illustration and functional neuroimaging of visual hallucinations during prolonged blindfolding: A comparison to visual imagery | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 37 | issue = 12| pages = 1805–1821 | doi = 10.1068/p6034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bizarre [[thought]]s, temporary senselessness, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Grassian [http://www.prisoncommission.org/statements/grassian_stuart_long.pdf  Psychiatric effects of solitary confinement](PDF) This article is a redacted, non-institution- and non-inmate-specific version of a declaration submitted in September 1993 in Madrid v.

A related [[phenomenon]] is perceptual deprivation, also called the [[Ganzfeld effect]]. In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wackermann|first=J|author2=Pütz P |author3=Allefeld C |title=Ganzfeld-induced hallucinatory experience, its phenomenology and cerebral electrophysiology|journal=Cortex|date=Jun 2008|pmid=18621366|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.05.003|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1364–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within [[NATO]], as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jeffery |first=Keith |year=1985 |title=The Divided province: the troubles in Northern Ireland, 1969-1985 |edition=illustrated |publisher=Orbis |isbn=0-85613-799-5 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the use of the five techniques by [[United Kingdom|British]] security forces in [[Northern Ireland]] amounted to a practice of [[inhumane]] and degrading treatment.

==Restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST)==
There are two basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST): chamber REST and flotation REST.

===Chamber REST===
In chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound-reducing (on average, 80&amp;nbsp;dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink, and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester, who can communicate with the participants using an open intercom. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do because they find the chamber so relaxing.&lt;ref name=suedREST&gt;{{cite journal

| journal     = The International Journal of the Addictions
| volume      = 14
| pages       = 861–888
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chamber REST affects psychological functioning (thinking, perception, memory, motivation, and mood) and psychophysiological processes.

===Flotation REST===
{{main|Isolation tank}}
[[Image:Flotation tank SMC.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Flotation tank with flip top lid opened]]
In flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and [[Epsom salts]] at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires "major deliberate effort." Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST.&lt;ref name=suedREST/&gt;

For the first 40 minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]] to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced [[creativity]] and [[problem solving]]. [[Spa]]s sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kjellgren | first1 = A | last2 = Sundequist | first2 = U | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Effects of flotation-REST on muscle tension pain | url = | journal = Pain Research and Management | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 181–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of [[cortisol]], and maximal [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]]. Apart from physiological effects, REST seems to have positive effects on well-being and performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dierendonck &amp; Jan Te Nijenhuis- Flotation restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST) as a stress- management tool: A meta-analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber versus flotation REST===
Several differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on [[hypertonic]] muscles. Since one of the main results of chamber REST is a state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| journal     = Imagination, Cognition and Personality
| volume      = 5
| pages       = 219–230
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages       = 33–39
| pmid        = 1778683
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as substance abuse. On the contrary, flotation REST was seen as more of a recreational tool as it was tested more for its use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction and insomnia.&lt;ref name="suedREST"/&gt;

Numerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process, however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat [[smoking]], [[obesity]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| first2        = Stanley
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Flotation REST has the advantage of a lower duration required (45 minutes as opposed to 24 hours).

==Other uses==
The use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: [[behavior modification]]) resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a [[nicotine patch]] alone has a success rate of 5%.&lt;ref name="smoking"&gt;{{cite journal

| pmid    = 3310529
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholism]] has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].

In addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that four years later, 43% of the patients were still sober and drug-free. Eight months later, no one in the control group remained clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychedelic effects===
Studies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire which measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them in a pitch-black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes, after which they completed another test that measures [[psychosis]]-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five subjects reported seeing [[hallucination]]s of faces; six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there; four noted a heightened sense of smell, and two reported sensing a "presence of evil" in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of hallucinations.
Many studies have been conducted to understand the main causes of the hallucinations, and considerable evidence has been accumulated indicating that long periods of isolation aren't directly related to the level of experienced hallucinations. &lt;ref&gt;Marvin Zuckerman &amp; Nathan Cohen (1964). Sources of Reports of Visual Auditory Sensations in perceptual-isolation experiments.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenics appear to tend to experience fewer  hallucinations while in REST as compared to non-psychotic individuals. A possible explanation for this could be that non-psychotic individuals are normally exposed to a greater degree of sensory stimulation in everyday life, and in REST, the brain attempts to re-create a similar level of stimulation, producing the hallucinatory events.&lt;ref&gt;From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2009 study published in the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]],'' the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called [[faulty source monitoring]].&lt;ref name="negativesense"&gt;{{cite journal
| doi        = 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181b9760b

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study conducted on individuals who underwent REST while under the effects of Phencyclidine (PCP) showed a lower incidence of hallucination in comparison to participants who did not take PCP. The effects of PCP also appeared to be reduced while undergoing REST. The effects PCP has on reducing occurrences of hallucinatory events provides a potential insight into the mechanisms behind these events.&lt;ref&gt;From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The five sensory deprivation techniques===
{{Main|five techniques}}

The five techniques of ''wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink'' were used by the security forces in [[Northern Ireland]] in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the [[interrogation]] of paramilitary suspects.

The Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] (''Ireland v. United Kingdom'', 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it "considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145037/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/prohibits_torture.htm Security Detainees/Enemy Combatants: U.S. Law Prohibits Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment] Footnote 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Weissbrodt ''[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc materials on torture and other ill-treatment: 3. European Court of Human Rights]'' (doc) [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:u7wX9dL11d4J:www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;lr=lang_en html]: Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. European Convention on Human Rights. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) examined the [[United Nations]]' definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques "did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture," however they did amount "to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment," which is a breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]].&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK_167"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506 Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978)], paragraph 167&lt;/ref&gt;

It their judgment&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK_96"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506 Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978)], paragraph 96&lt;/ref&gt; the court states that:
:These methods, sometimes termed "disorientation" or "sensory deprivation" techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above.  It emerges from the [[European Commission of Human Rights|Commission's]] establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of:''
::(a) wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a [[stress position]], described by those who underwent it as being "spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers";
::(b) hooding: putting a black or navy colored bag over the detainees' heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation;
::(c) subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise;
::(d) deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep
::(e) deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the center and pending interrogations.

===José Padilla===
{{Main|José Padilla (prisoner)}}
[[File:Jose Padilla at the Navy Consolidated Brig.jpg|thumb|José Padilla at the Navy Consolidated Brig]]
[[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], a [[United States citizen]] from [[Brooklyn, New York]], was convicted in federal court of aiding [[Terrorism|terrorists]] in 2007 and was sentenced to 17 years and 4 months in prison. While awaiting trial, reports surfaced that, to persuade him to reveal information, he was subjected to sensory deprivation for weeks at a time. For 1,307 days, Padilla was kept in a 9' x 7' cell with no natural light, clock or calendar. When Padilla left his cell, he was shackled and fitted with heavy goggles and headphones. His counsel argues that while he was being interrogated Padilla was subjected to harsh lights and pounding sounds. While meeting with his counsel, they reported Padilla exhibiting facial tics, random eye movements and unusual contortions of his body. According to them, Padilla had become so "shattered" that he became convinced his lawyers were part of a continuing interrogation program and saw his captors as protectors.&lt;ref name="negativesense"/&gt;

==="Total Isolation"===
In January 2008, the [[BBC]] aired a ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' special entitled "Total Isolation". The premise of the show centered on six individuals, four men and two women, agreeing to be shut in a cell inside a nuclear bunker, alone and in complete darkness for 48 hours. Prior to isolation, the volunteers underwent tests of [[visual memory]], [[information processing]], [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] and [[suggestibility]].

After the two days and two nights, the subjects noted that their inability to sense time, as well as hallucinations, made the experience difficult. Of the six volunteers, three experienced auditory and visual hallucinations—snakes, oysters, tiny cars and zebras. One was convinced their sheets were wet. Two seemed to cope well.

When complete, the tests that the subjects took before the experiment were conducted a second time to test its effects. The results indicated all volunteers' ability to complete the simplest tasks had deteriorated. One subject's memory capacity fell 36% and all the subjects had trouble thinking of words beginning with a nominated letter; in this case, the letter "F". All four of the men had markedly increased suggestibility, although this was not the case with the women.&lt;ref name="total"&gt;{{Cite video

'''''Spellbound!''''' is an educational computer game made and distributed by [[The Learning Company]] aimed at teaching spelling, vocabulary, and language development to children ages 7 to 12.&lt;ref name=cso&gt;{{cite web| title=Super solvers: Spellbound!| publisher=Children's Software Online| accessdate=2012-09-27| url=http://www.childrenssoftwareonline.com/super_solvers_spellbound_software.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the game is to play spelling-related games to qualify and compete for successively higher bracket [[spelling bee]]s, concluding with the player competing in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee|national spelling bee]]. The original game, released in 1991, was compatible with computers running DOS 3.3 or higher. A 1993 CD release added spoken dialogue and was compatible with [[Windows 95]] and Macintosh.

==Plot==
Morty Maxwell along with his robots are entering Shady Glen school's Spelling Bee in the hopes of outspelling everyone. The Super Solvers aim to sharpen their skills and beat Morty at his own game in [[Washington D.C.]] with the aid of a Spellbinder computer.

==Gameplay==
Before starting the game, the player can choose which topics and word lists to use. Additionally, the player can create customized lists. Then the player can choose one of three difficulty levels, which affect how many spelling problems need to be solved throughout the game. To qualify for a spelling bee, the player must first earn a set number of points by playing spelling-related activities. These activities include:

*Criss Cross (also called "Work it out!") - A [[crossword]]-type puzzle
*[[Flashcard|Flash Cards]] (also called "Watch it Flash!") - Where the player must recall the word shown
*[[Word search]] (also called "Find them All!") - Finding words hidden in a box of letters

Once in the spelling bee (also called "Take a Trip!"), the player will be contested by two other players and must correctly type words flashed out or vocally spoken to win the game. When the spelling bee is completed, the player moves on to the next level to prepare for another spelling bee. There are five levels of spelling bees in the game. As the levels get higher, the activities become harder.

==Release==
Spellbound! was released along with an Adlib Sound Card in "The Learning Company's Family Sound Value Pack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=June 1992 |title=Micro User, Volume 9 |url=https://archive.org/stream/1992-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_141_1992_Jun#page/n85 |journal= |location= |publisher=[[Compute!]] |issue=141 |pages=84–85 |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">A '''squib''' is a brief satirical or witty piece of writing or speech, like a [[parody|lampoon]], or a short, sometimes humorous piece in a newspaper or magazine, used as a filler. It can be  intended to ignite thinking and discourse by others on topics of theoretical importance—e.g., see [[MIT Press]]'s journal, ''[[Linguistic Inquiry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&amp;tid=6|title=The MIT Press|website=MIT Press|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often less substantial than this and just humorous (see [[The Daily Squib]]).

One of the most famous squibs in English literature is ''The Candidate'' by [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Toynbee, Paget|editorlink=Paget Toynbee|chapter=The Candidate|title=The correspondence of Gray, Walpole, West and Ashton (1734–1771)|volume=vol. 2|year=1915|pages=226–228|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QF0EAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Squib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], squibs may outline anomalous data but not suggest a solution. This usage in the field was popularized by [[John R. Ross|John R. “Haj” Ross]] in the 1960s. A squib may also develop a minor theoretical argument. A particularly interesting variety of squibs are the so-called snippets, which are "the ideal footnote: a side remark that taken on its own is not worth lengthy development but that needs to be said".&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/|title=Led on Line - Snippets|website=www.ledonline.it|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online journal Snippets is dedicated to this type of squib.&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10387">In [[theoretical computer science]], more precisely in the theory of [[formal languages]], the '''star height''' is a measure for the structural complexity 
of [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expressions]] and [[regular language]]s. The star height of a regular ''expression'' equals the maximum nesting depth of stars appearing in that expression. The star height of a regular ''language'' is the least star height of any regular expression for that language.
The concept of star height was first defined and studied by Eggan (1963).

==Formal definition==
More formally, the star height of a [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expression]]
''E'' over a finite [[alphabet]] ''A'' is inductively defined as follows:

* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h\left(\emptyset\right)\,=\,0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h\left(\varepsilon\right)\,=\,0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h\left(a\right)\,=\,0&lt;/math&gt; for all alphabet symbols ''a'' in ''A''.
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h\left(E F\right)\,=\, h\left(E\, \mid\, F\right)\,=\,\max \left(\, h(E), h(F)\,\right)&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h\left(E^*\right)\,=\,h(E)+1.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; is the special regular expression denoting the empty set and &amp;epsilon; the special one denoting the [[empty word]]; 
''E'' and ''F'' are arbitrary regular expressions.

The star height ''h''(''L'') of a regular language ''L'' is defined as the minimum star height among all regular expressions representing ''L''.
The intuition is here that if the language ''L'' has large star height, then it is in some sense inherently complex, since it cannot be described 
by means of an "easy" regular expression, of low star height.

==Examples==
While computing the star height of a regular expression is easy, determining the star height of a language can be sometimes tricky.
For illustration, the regular expression 
&lt;!--:''(b &amp;cup; aa&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;b)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;aa&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left(b\, \mid\, a a^*b\right)^*a a^* &lt;/math&gt; 
over the alphabet ''A = {a,b}''
has star height 2.  However, the described language is just the set of all words ending in an ''a'': thus the language can also be described by the expression 
&lt;!--:''(a&amp;cup;b)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;a'',--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle (a\, \mid\, b)^*a&lt;/math&gt;
which is only of star height 1. To prove that this language indeed has star height 1, one still needs to rule out that it could be described by a regular
expression of lower star height. For our example, this can be done by an indirect proof: One proves that a language of star height 0
contains only finitely many words. Since the language under consideration is infinite, it cannot be of star height&amp;nbsp;0.

The star height of a [[group language]] is computable: for example, the star height of the language over {''a'',''b''} in which the number of occurrences of ''a'' and ''b'' are congruent modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is ''n''.&lt;ref name=Sak342&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eggan's theorem==
[[File:Deterministicfiniteautomaton.svg|thumb|Example automaton of cycle rank 1. [[Kleene's algorithm]] transforms it into the regular expression {{math|size=100%|''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''ba''
 ((''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''b'')''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;ε)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  (''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''b'')''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''b''}}, which has star-height 2. By Eggan's theorem, an equivalent regular expression of star-height ≤1 must exist. In fact, {{math|size=100%|''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''b''(''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''(''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''b''))&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} describes the same language.]]
In his seminal study of the star height of regular languages, {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}} established a relation between the theories of regular expressions, finite automata, and of [[directed graph]]s.  In subsequent years, this relation became known as ''Eggan's theorem'', cf. {{harvtxt|Sakarovitch|2009}}.  We recall a few concepts from [[graph theory]] and [[automata theory]].
  
In graph theory, the [[cycle rank]]  ''r''(''G'') of a [[directed graph]] (digraph) {{math|size=100%|1=''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'')}} is inductively defined as follows:
* If ''G'' is [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]], then {{math|size=100%|1=''r''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}}. This applies in particular if ''G'' is empty.
* If ''G'' is [[strongly connected]] and ''E'' is nonempty, then
::&lt;math&gt;r(G) = 1 + \min_{v\in V} r(G-v),\,&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|4em}}where {{tmath|G - v}} is the digraph resulting from deletion of vertex {{mvar|v}} and all edges beginning or ending at {{mvar|v}}.
* If ''G'' is not strongly connected, then ''r''(''G'') is equal to the maximum cycle rank among all strongly connected components of ''G''.

In automata theory, a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] [[nondeterministic finite automaton#Variations of NFA|with ε-moves]] (ε-NFA) is defined as a [[n-tuple|5-tuple]], (''Q'', Σ, ''δ'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F''), consisting of
* a finite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of states ''Q''
* a finite set of [[input symbol]]s Σ 
* a set of labeled edges ''δ'', referred to as ''transition relation'': ''Q'' &amp;times; (Σ ∪{ε}) &amp;times; ''Q''.  Here ε denotes the [[empty word]].
* an ''initial'' state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''Q''
* a set of states ''F'' distinguished as ''accepting states'' ''F'' ⊆ ''Q''.
A word ''w'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is accepted by the ε-NFA if there exists a [[directed path]] from the initial state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to some final state in ''F'' using edges from ''δ'', such that the [[concatenation]] of all labels visited along the path yields the word ''w''.  The set of all words over Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; accepted by the automaton is the ''language'' accepted by the automaton ''A''.

When speaking of digraph properties of a nondeterministic finite automaton ''A'' with state set ''Q'', we naturally address the digraph with vertex set ''Q'' induced by its transition relation.  Now the theorem is stated as follows.
 
:'''Eggan's Theorem''': The star height of a regular language ''L'' equals the minimum [[cycle rank]] among all [[nondeterministic finite automata]] [[nondeterministic finite automaton#Variations of NFA|with ε-moves]] accepting ''L''.

Proofs of this theorem are given by {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}}, and more recently by {{harvtxt|Sakarovitch|2009}}.

==Generalized star height==
The above definition assumes that regular expressions are built from the elements of the alphabet ''A''
using only the standard operators [[set union]], [[concatenation]], and [[Kleene star]]. ''Generalized regular expressions'' are defined just as regular expressions, but here also the [[set complement]] operator is allowed 
(the complement is always taken with respect to the set of all words over A). If we alter the definition such that taking complements does not increase the star height, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle h\left(E^c\right)\,=\,h(E)&lt;/math&gt;

we can define the '''generalized star height''' of a regular language ''L'' as the minimum star height among all ''generalized'' regular expressions 
representing ''L''.

Note that, whereas it is immediate that a language of (ordinary) star height 0 can contain only finitely many words, there exist infinite 
languages having generalized star height 0. For instance, the regular expression 
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle (a\, \mid\, b)^*a,&lt;/math&gt; 
which we saw in the example above, can be equivalently described by the generalized regular expression
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \emptyset^c a&lt;/math&gt;, 
since the complement of the empty set is precisely the set of all words over ''A''. Thus the set of all words over the alphabet ''A'' ending in the letter ''a'' has star height one, while its 
generalized star height equals zero.

Languages of generalized star height zero are also called [[star-free language]]s. It can be shown that a language ''L'' is star-free if and only if its [[syntactic monoid]] is [[aperiodic monoid|aperiodic]] ({{harvtxt|Schützenberger|1965}}).

'''Talossa''', officially the '''Kingdom of Talossa''' ({{lang-tzl|Regipäts Talossan}} {{IPA-tzl|ˈred͡ʒipæt͡s tɐɫɔˈsan|}}), is one of the earliest [[micronation]]s — founded in 1979 by then 14-year-old Robert Ben Madison of [[Milwaukee]] and at first confined to his bedroom; he adopted the name after discovering that the word means "inside the house" in Finnish. Among the first such projects still maintained, it has kept up a web presence since 1995.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;[http://www.economist.com/diversions/displayStory.cfm?story_id=5323713 "Castles in the air."] ''[[The Economist]]'', 20 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/27/shortcuts.countries/index.html "Shortcuts: Starting your own country"] CNN.com, 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Its internet and media exposure since the late 1990s contributed to the appearance of other subsequent internet micronations.

Talossa claims several places on Earth as its territory, especially a portion of [[Milwaukee]], calling it the "Greater Talossan Area"; no such claim, however, is recognized by the [[United Nations]] or by any other nation. As of June 23, 2016, the number of active citizens is said to be 213.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talossan Database|url=http://www.talossa.ca/files/citizens.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including those who are no longer citizens for various reasons, those who are under the age of 14 and so are not yet citizens, and those from the ESB Affair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talossa Entry|url=http://wiki.talossa.com/Eiric_B%C3%B6rnatfiglheu}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 493 total registered individuals.

==Culture==
Talossan culture has been developed over the years by Robert Madison and other fans. The Talossan language, also created by Madison in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;talossan.com. [http://talossan.com/history/ History]. Retrieved 24 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; claims a vocabulary of 35,000 root words and 121,000 derived words&lt;ref name="history"&gt;"[http://talossan.com/history/modern-history/ The CÚG and Its Mission]," ''El Glheþ Talossan,'' 2012.

==History and growth==
Talossa was supposedly founded as a kingdom on December 26, 1979,&lt;ref name=arpats&gt;R.

Madison maintained Talossa throughout his adolescence, publishing a handwritten newspaper and designing a flag and emblem. During this time its only other members were about a dozen relatives and acquaintances. This changed in the mid-1990s, when a series of stories in the ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;ref name=nytimes2000&gt;Stephen Mimh (2000) ''Utopian rulers and spoofs stake out territory online''. New York Times, May 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2005&gt;Roberta Smith,

[[Wired magazine|Wired]], March 2000, 8.03.&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently republished elsewhere, drew his website to popular attention. Several new "citizens" joined Talossa as a result, and Madison began to claim that he was the inventor of the term "micronation".

Madison disestablished the "kingdom" in late 2005, but Talossa is still active today despite the lack of involvement of the original founder.&lt;ref&gt;

Madison invented Talossan ({{IPA-tzl|tɐɫɔˈsan|}} or {{lang|tzl|el glheþ Talossan}} {{IPA-tzl|ɛɫ ʎeθ tɐɫɔˈsan|}}) as a [[constructed language]] for his [[micronation]]. With its relatively large vocabulary, which is mostly French-based, it is said to be one of the most detailed [[fictional language]]s ever invented.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt; The Association of Talossan Language Organisations (ATLO) maintains a website describing the language for new learners, providing language information, research and online translation to and from English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talossan.com/ El Glheþ Talossan | Information and Resources for the Student and User of the Talossan Language]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ISO 639]] designation is "tzl".&lt;ref name="tzl"&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=tzl Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: tzl], 2013-01-23. Accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is overseen by the ''Comità per l'Útzil del Glheþ'' ("Committee for the Use of the Language," CÚG), a group formed by Madison which periodically issues both ''Arestadas'' (decrees) to describe and document changes in language usage of the language and ''Pienamaintschen'' (supplements), to update the vocabulary list. The CÚG maintains a multi-lingual website providing access to the recent recommendations of the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuglang.com/ Comità per l'Útzil del Glheþ], CÚG&lt;/ref&gt;
