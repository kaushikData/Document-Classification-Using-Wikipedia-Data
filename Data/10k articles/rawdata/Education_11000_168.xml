{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement World History''' (also known as '''AP World History''', '''WHAP''', '''AP World''' or '''APWH''') is a college-level course and examination offered to high school students through the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]] designed to help students develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts as well as interactions between different types of human society. The course advances this understanding through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. Students study all prehistory and history, especially from 8000 [[Common Era|BC]]E to the present day. It was announced in July 2018 that the test would be changed to an AP World History: Modern exam that only contains content since 1200 CE, starting in the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-world-history/course/2019-20-changes|title=SA:WH:2019-20 AP World History Changes|work=AP Central|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP World History exam was first administered in 2002. The course has undergone multiple changes with the latest changes effective Fall 2017. Often times in the United States, students take the course in their sophomore year of high school, but this is not a requirement.

==Course Structure==
This is a high school course designed specifically for sophomores in high school and gives college credit. The course is organized around six eras/periods and nineteen "Key Concepts":
*'''Period 1''' - Technological and Environmental Transformations, to c. 600 BC

&lt;br /&gt;
Key Concept 2.3 Emergence of Transregional Networks of Communication and Exchange
*'''Period 3''' - Regional and Interregional Interactions, c. 600 CE to c. 1450 CE
Key Concept 3.1 Expansion and Intensification of Communication and Exchange Networks
&lt;br /&gt;
Key Concept 3.2 Continuity and Innovation of State Forms and Their Interactions
&lt;br /&gt;

Key Concept 5.1 Industrialization and Global Capitalism
&lt;br /&gt;
Key Concept 5.2 Imperialism and Nation-State Formation
&lt;br /&gt;
Key Concept 5.3 Nationalism, Revolution, and Reform
&lt;br /&gt;
Key Concept 5.4 Global Migration
*'''Period 6''' - Accelerating Global Change and Realignments, c. 1900 AD to the Present
Key Concept 6.1 Science and the Environment

The multiple choice section is weighted as 40% of one's  total score (Section I Part A). It consists of 55 questions to be answered in 55 minutes based on the accompanying sources.

While previously the exam deducted 1/4 of a point for every incorrect answer, starting from 2011 on, the penalty for incorrect answers had been removed. It is to one's advantage to attempt every question possible within the time limit.  Note also that the number of multiple choice options is being reduced from five to four at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP World History Course and Exam Description|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/AP_WorldHistoryCED_Effective_Fall_2011.pdf|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test underwent a major re-haul for the 2017 exam, however, due to the prodigious number of students that struggled with the free response section, the College Board decided to initiate yet another round of sweeping reform, to be put in effect in May 2018. Currently it has the same format as [[Advanced Placement United States History]] and [[Advanced Placement European History]]. The exam features a new section (Section I Part B) that requires three short answer questions, one of which is selected from two options. Each question has three parts, making for a total of 9 parts within the SAQ section. Students have forty minutes to answer these, and they count for twenty percent of the exam score.

Section II lasts for a total of 100 minutes, and it includes a document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question (LEQ). Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15-minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 &amp; 2, another addressing periods 3 &amp; 4, and a third addressing periods 5 &amp; 6.

The DBQ counts for 25% of the total exam score, and the LEQ is 15%. The essays are out of seven points and six points, respectively. Students are required to analyze and synthesize the documents of the DBQ, but some outside information is still needed. The LEQ only provides a prompt and no sort of stimulus, so a large amount of outside information is necessary.

In 2012, the head of AP Grading, Trevor Packer, stated that the reason for the low percentages of 5s is that "AP World History is a college-level course, &amp; many sophomores aren't yet writing at that level." 10.44 percent of all seniors who took the exam in 2012 received a 5, while 6.62 percent of sophomores received a 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Trevor/status/215559243930144770|title=Trevor Packer|work=Twitter|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">'''ARS++''' was developed in 2002 for the book ''Undiluted Programming''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambda-bound.de/book/engl/index.html Description of Undiluted Programming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030731221231/http://www.lambda-bound.de/book/engl/index.html |date=July 31, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate '''ARS based programming''' in a real world context. ARS++ is used in the book to implement an [[A++]] [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] and  an [[XML]] [[Database]] System. Even the implementation of ARS++ in [[C (programming language)|C]] was used to demonstrate [[ARS-based_programming|ARS-based programming]].

Principally the [[programming language]] [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] would have been perfectly all right to be used for these demonstration programs if Scheme would include primitives supporting [[Computer networking|network]] programming, database programming plus a few others required in this context.

The definition of the programming language Scheme does not include those primitives however, leaving this issue up to the implementors of the language. The consequence is that there exist many Scheme implementations, almost none of them covering all areas essential for real application programs. This is the historical background that gave birth to the development of ARS++.&lt;ref&gt;A few weeks ago the author of the referenced book  discovered a Scheme implementation that would have been very well suited to serve as a  language for developing  the case studies for 'Undiluted Programming'.  This ''Scheme implementation'' is called '''Gauche''' and is [http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/gauche/ available for download in the internet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209103246/http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/gauche/ |date=February 9, 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ARS++ explained by its name ==
The name '''ARS++''', being an [[acronym]] for '''ARS + Scheme + Extensions''', indicates that ARS++ has a lot to do with [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] but that it is not equivalent to Scheme.

* The '''first part''' of the name refers to the core of  the language, which is nothing else but [[A plusplus|A++]], i.e. ''Abstraction + Reference + Synthesis''.&lt;ref&gt;The structure of A++ however is different from the structure of Scheme, which can be verified by comparing the definition of Scheme in R5RS with the definition of A++ [http://www.lambda-bound.de/book/lambdacalc/node41.html here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040314070243/http://www.lambda-bound.de/book/lambdacalc/node41.html |date=March 14, 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''second part''' in the name of ARS++ stands for the primitive functions that are imported from Scheme, giving ARS++ almost the same functionality as Scheme. Primitive functions are those, that are not and cannot be defined as lambda abstractions because they are representing a functionality that can only be provided by the underlying [[operating system]] or the hardware.
* The '''third part''' of the name refers to primitive functions that are not defined in [[R5RS]] (the official definition of the programming language Scheme) but are nevertheless important for real world programming like functions allowing to work with [[regular expressions]], with [[TCP/IP]] networks, with embedded databases (e.g. [[Berkeley DB]], [[GNU database manager]]) and a few that provide an interface with the operating system.

From a practical point of view a Scheme implementation that includes support for regular expressions, databases, sockets and also provides an interface to the operating system can be called an ARS++ language.

An '''after action review''' (AAR) is a structured review or de-brief ([[debriefing]]) process for analyzing ''what'' happened, ''why'' it happened, and ''how'' it can be done better by the participants and those responsible for the project or event. After-action reviews in the formal sense were originally developed by the [[U.S. Army]].  Formal AARs are used by all US military services and by many other non-US organizations. Their use has extended to business as a [[knowledge management]] tool and a way to build a culture of accountability.

An AAR occurs within a cycle of establishing the leader's intent, planning, preparation, action and review. An AAR is distinct from a de-brief in that it begins with a clear comparison of intended vs. actual results achieved. An AAR is distinct from a post-mortem in its tight focus on participant's own action; learning from the review is taken forward by the participants. Recommendations for others are not produced. AARs in larger operations can be cascaded in order to keep each level of the organization focused on its own performance within a particular event or project.

Formal AAR meetings are normally run by a facilitator, and can be chronological reviews or tightly focused on a few key issues selected by the team leader. Short cycle informal AARs are typically run by the team leader or assistant and are very quick.

==After action reviews in the military==

There are basically two types of military AARs—formal and informal. Formal AARs require more detailed planning, preparation, and resources. They are normally scheduled and conducted as a part of external and internal evaluations. Informal AARs require less planning and preparation than formal AARs and are often on-the-spot reviews of soldier and collective training performance at crew, squad, or platoon level.

===Formal===

Formal AARs are normally conducted at company level and above. However, when a training event is focused at squad or platoon level, and resources are available, a formal AAR may be conducted to gain maximum training benefit. Externally evaluated lane training, small-unit ARTEPs, and tank and BFV gunnery tables are prime examples. Informal crew, squad, and platoon AARs are held prior to company and higher-echelon AARs.

The AAR facilitator (evaluator or controller) provides a mission and task overview and leads a discussion of events and activities that focuses on the objectives. The discussion with leaders and soldiers should orient on the use of terrain integration of key BOS (&lt;ref name="FM 101-5-1 (Operational Terms and Graphics)" group="Department of the Army Publications"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Troy|title=Operational Terms and Graphics|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/army/docs/fm101-5-1/f545-b.htm|work=FM 101-5-1|publisher=Department of the Army|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battlefield Operating Systems), and leader actions. The discussion should also examine the weapons systems and doctrine used by the enemy during the exercise. At the close, the AAR leader summarizes comments from the observers, covering strengths and weaknesses discussed during the AAR and what the unit needs to do to fix the weaknesses.

===Informal===

Informal AARs are usually conducted for soldier and crew-, squad-, and platoon-level training or when resources are not available to conduct a formal review. They are often held for lower echelons prior to a formal company- or higher-level AAR, though they may be conducted at company level. Informal AARs are extremely important since they involve all soldiers and leaders in the participating unit. The formal company AARs for the training event depend on these thorough, informal reviews. These are sometimes referred to as a [[hotwash]].

Informal AARs are conducted similar to formal AARs and may be done for large or small units. They may be scheduled, or leaders may do on-the-spot reviews during the training. Discussion comments could be recorded to use in follow-on AARs or to apply immediately the lessons learned as the exercise is repeated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">A '''book desert''' is a geographic area (country, state, county, city, neighborhood, home) where printed books and other reading material are allegedly hard to obtain, particularly without access to an automobile or other form of transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neuman|first=Susan B.|last2=Moland|first2=Naomi|date=2016-07-05|title=Book Deserts The Consequences of Income Segregation on Children's Access to Print|url=http://uex.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/05/0042085916654525|journal=Urban Education|language=en|pages=0042085916654525|doi=10.1177/0042085916654525|issn=0042-0859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have defined book deserts by linking them to poverty and low income, while others use a combination of factors that include census data, income, ethnicity, geography, language, and the number of books in a home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greeleytribune.com/news/12397504-113/book-books-literacy-desert#|title=Searching for oases in Weld's so-called book desert|last=Silvy|first=Tyler|date=July 30, 2014|work=Greeley Tribune|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives that increase the availability of books by such measures as [[bookmobiles]] and librarians on bicycles have been offered as possible solutions to book deserts, as have [[Little Free Library|Little Free Libraries]] and offering children's literature available online, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ur9ep9bn4s.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Literacy+initiative+aims+to+eliminate+%27book+deserts%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Dayton+Daily+News&amp;rft.au=ByJeff+Gilbert&amp;rft.date=2016-06-26&amp;rft.pub=CMG+Corporate+Services%2C+Inc.+on+behalf+of+itself+and+the+Newspapers&amp;rft.issn=0897-0920&amp;rft.externalDocID=4100425741&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Literacy initiative aims to eliminate 'book deserts'|last=Gilbert|first=Jeff|date=June 26, 2016|work=Dayton Daily News|subscription=yes|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and research ==
In the past, researchers have studied how the absence or scarcity of books impact how a child's early [[literacy]] and language skills develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=M. D. R.|last2=Kelley|first2=Jonathan|last3=Sikora|first3=Joanna|last4=Treiman|first4=Donald J.|date=2010-06-01|title=Family scholarly culture and educational success: Books and schooling in 27 nations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562410000090|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–197|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2010.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/blog/2196_a_book_of_their_own_how_owning_books_affects_childrens_literacy|title=A book of their own: how owning books affects children's literacy|last=Poulton|first=Lizzie|date=July 7, 2010|website=Literacy Trust|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "book desert" came into regular use in the mid-2010s and the [[social enterprise]] [http://www.uniteforliteracy.com Unite for Literacy] is credited as having coined the term.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unite for Literacy created an operational definition of a book desert when they published the U.S. Book Desert Map: A geographic area (country, state, county, census tract) where it is predicted that a majority of homes have less than 100 printed books. In March 2014, James LaRue, director of the [[American Library Association]]'s Office for [[Intellectual Freedom]] and the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]], used the term in an issue of ''[[American Libraries]]'', where he described the term as applying to houses with 25 or fewer books in them and discussed ways to lessen or eradicate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/e-content/the-price-is-right-at-unite-for-literacy/|title=The Price Is Right at Unite for Literacy|last=LaRue|first=James|date=March 4, 2014|website=American Libraries Magazine|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, professors [[Susan B. Neuman]] and Naomi Moland published a study in ''[[Urban Education]]'', where they examined how the lack of printed reading material among low-income and poverty stricken neighborhoods impacts early childhood development and used the term to describe areas and homes with little access to written materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study built upon other research Neuman had conducted in 2001 on the same topic and the researchers found few stores in [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the focus areas of their research had print resources for children ages 0 through 18.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/where-books-are-nonexistent/491282/|title=The Children Who Grow Up in 'Book Deserts'|last=Wong|first=Alia|date=July 14, 2016|website=The Atlantic|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those stores, many were [[dollar stores]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''The Atlantic'' reported that in 2015 Neuman and [[JetBlue|JetBlue Airways]] held an experiment to foster literacy by providing book vending machines in a low-income Washington D.C. neighborhood. Over 20,000 books were given away, prompting Neuman to conclude that the neighborhood's parents did care about their children's education but lacked "the resources to enable their children to be successful."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Contributing factors ===
Multiple factors are credited as contributing to the formation of book deserts, the most frequently highlighted of which tends to be poverty and low income. Other factors tend to include language and geography, as some areas lack access to bookstores or public or community school libraries that would provide books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wkbn.com/2016/07/29/warren-group-works-to-fight-book-desert-phenomenon/|title=Warren group works to fight 'book desert' phenomenon|last=Santelli|first=James|date=July 30, 2016|website=WKBN|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bookselling|Book store]] closures due to [[bankruptcy]] or other financial difficulties are also occasionally cited as a contributing factor, when the closure leaves the area without a bookseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=drexel_main&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A286307818&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=drexel_main&amp;authCount=1|title=Store closures create US 'book deserts'|last=Gelles|first=David|date=April 14, 2012|work=The Financial Times|subscription=yes|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unite Book Desert Map.jpg|thumb|US Book Desert map from Unite for Literacy]]

Unite for Literacy has developed a book desert map of the [[United States]] powered by [[Esri]]'s ArcGIS platform, which provides a visual presentation of the lack of books in the nation, states, counties and [[census tract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniteforliteracy.com/corp/esri&lt;/ref&gt; To create the map, Unite for Literacy performed a statistical analyses of data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the American Community Survey. Data used in the map includes the number of books in 4th graders' homes, average community income, ethnic diversity, geographic location and home language. Unite for Literacy unveiled the map during the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] America (CGI America) meeting held in Denver, Colorado, in June 2014.

'''''Buntús Cainte''''' ({{lang-en|Basic Speaking}}) - first steps in spoken Irish - was written by Tomás Ó Domhnalláin in the mid-1960s. It was an Irish-language learning programme, illustrated by William Bolger, and first published in a three volume series by the Stationery Office, [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], in 1967.  It was re-printed eight times between 1974 and 1999 by the Stationery Office and since 2002, it has been re-printed seven times by [[An Gúm]]. The more recent re-prints are accompanied by a CD. Copyright is now held by [[Foras na Gaeilge]].

The programme was broadcast on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], beginning in 1967. The show was designed to appeal to young viewers, and was lively and humorous. The programme was presented by Máire O’Neill and Aileen Geoghegan.&lt;ref name="sciolnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoilnet.ie/lookathistory/Video2.aspx?FolderId=2&amp;Id=545&amp;ref=2 |title=Buntús Cainte: Learning the Irish Language: 1967 |publisher=Scoilnet: Portal for Irish Education |accessdate=2009-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234634/http://www.scoilnet.ie/lookathistory/Video2.aspx?FolderId=2&amp;Id=545&amp;ref=2 |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1967, 218,000 copies of the ''Buntús Cainte'' lessons booklet had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0230/D.0230.196711080041.html |title=Buntús Cainte Lessons: Dáil Éireann - Volume 230 - 08 November, 1967, Questions. Oral Answers |publisher=Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas: [[Dáil Éireann]] |accessdate=2009-08-03 |date=1967-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607134216/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0230/D.0230.196711080041.html |archivedate= 7 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catered to people with little or no Irish.&lt;ref name="sciolnet"/&gt; Phrases were spoken by the presenters in both Irish and English, and were also overlaid (in Irish) on a simple static cartoon relating to the phrase.

It is also the title of a series of 3 books which contain the programme material, including the cartoons, the spoken Irish words and the English and Irish text.

== Current Publication ==
Buntús Cainte is currently available in book form, published by [[Foras na Gaeilge]] with editions in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2008. The current editions include remastered versions of the original recordings on [[Compact Disc]].

Buntús Cainte is also available as an MP3 course for iPod, iPhone and iPad. The English and Irish text can be viewed by the learner using the lyrics function on the device.

== Format ==
The course consists of a series of short lessons in which the presenters speak in Irish. The lessons are accompanied by English and Irish written versions of the spoken words.

Each lesson contains new words, basic sentences for each of the new words, revisionary sentences, a second section of new material and a situational conversation.
The book's lessons are intended to be used with recorded versions of the Irish words and sentences they contain. The current publications, unlike earlier ones, come with the recordings.

It is available as three books, Part One, Part Two and Part Three.

== Methodology ==
* The lessons are each intended to be a day's work.
* The student listens to the first part of the recording, dealing with new material, two or three times.
* On the second and subsequent times, the student repeats the Irish words aloud while reading the English equivalents.
* The student should then be able to understand the six basic sentences when heard for the first time.
* After listening to and repeating aloud the basic sentences the student should be able to reproduce them using only the stimulus provided by the cartoons.
* The revisionary sentences are then treated in a similar manner.
* The same approach is then taken with the second section of new material, and after that the situational conversation.
* Once the student can reproduce the Irish version of the conversation while glancing only at the English version for assistance they have mastered the lesson.
* Each day's work begins with an attempt to reproduce the previous day's situational conversation in the same way. If needed the recording can be played once or twice to aid recollection.

[[File:Carolina Ferni.jpg|thumb|Carolina Ferni]]

'''Carolina Ferni''' (20 August 1846 &amp;ndash; 4 June 1926) was an Italian [[violin]]ist and operatic [[soprano]].

Ferni was born in [[Como]]. She began her career as a violinist in [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]], and later studied voice with famed soprano [[Giuditta Pasta]]. She made her stage debut in [[Turin]] in 1862 as Leonora in [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[La favorite]]''. She sang at [[La Scala]] in Milan (1866–68) as [[Norma (opera)|Norma]], [[L'Africaine|Selika]] and [[Saffo (opera)|Saffo]], among other roles. In [[Agostino Mercuri]]'s opera ''Il Violino del Diavolo'', she both sang and played the violin.

She was married to the prominent [[Verdi]] baritone [[Leone Giraldoni]] (1824–1897). They had a son, [[Eugenio Giraldoni]], whom she taught. Like his father, Eugenio became an operatic baritone, creating the role of Scarpia in [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Tosca]]'' in 1900.

Ferni retired from the stage in 1883, and opened a singing school in Milan, and later in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia. Among her students was the soprano [[Eugenia Burzio]]. She died in [[Milan]] in 1926, two years after her son.

The '''Center for Open Science''' is a [[non-profit]] technology organization based in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] with a mission to "increase the openness, integrity, and [[reproducibility]] of scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Open Science|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWJxPkyuMo49uzhEsvK5HxhyrSFR3Ys625NqHY3zmsk|work=Business Plan|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Nosek]] and  Jeffrey Spies founded the organization in January 2013, funded mainly by the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]] and others, after implementation and use of the [[Open Science Framework]] (OSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cos.io/about/our-sponsors/|title=Our Sponsors|website=cos.io|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Science Framework==
The Open Science Framework (OSF) is an [[Open-source software|open source]] software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research. This framework was used to work on a project in the reproducibility of psychology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Estes|first=Sarah|title=The Myth of Self-Correcting Science|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/the-myth-of-self-correcting-science/266228/|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=20 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634|publisher=Nature|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current reproducibility project is a crowdsourced empirical investigation of the reproducibility of a variety of studies from psychological literature. The reproducibility project samples from three major journals: ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Psychological Science]]'', and ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do normative scientific practices and incentive structures produce a biased body of research evidence?|url=https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists from all over the world volunteer to replicate a study of their choosing from these journals, and follow a structured protocol for designing and conducting a high-powered replication of the key effect. The results were published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Open Science Collaboration | title = Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science | doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716 | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6251 | pages = aac4716 | year = 2015 | pmid=26315443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst OSF initially focused on psychology, it has since broadened into any research field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/|title=OSF {{!}} Home|website=osf.io|language=en|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the group released three new open source [[preprint]] services covering the fields of engineering, [[engrXiv]], one that covers social sciences, [[SocArxiv]], and one for psychology, [[psyArXiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Jane |title=Psychology Professor Releases Free, Open-Source, Preprint Software |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/psychology-professor-releases-free-open-source-preprint-software |website=UVA Today |accessdate=16 July 2018 |language=en |date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently partner repositories include: AgriXiv, arabixiv, BITSS, Earth ArXiv, engrXiv, FocUS Archive, Frenxiv, INA-Rxiv, LawArXiv, LIS Scholarship Archive (LISSA), MarXiv, MindRxiv, NutriXiv, Paleorxiv, PsyArXiv, SocArxiv, SportRxiv, and Thesis Commons (theses and dissertations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cos.io/about/news/six-new-preprint-services-join-growing-community-across-disciplines-accelerate-scholarly-communication/|title=Six New Preprint Services Join a Growing Community Across Disciplines|website=cos.io|language=en|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/preprints/|title=OSF Preprints |website=cos.io|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''China Academy of Art''' ({{zh|s=中国美术学院}}), also translated as '''China National Academy of Fine Arts''', is a fine arts college under the direct charge of the [[Ministry of Culture of China|Ministry of Culture]] of China. It was founded in [[Hangzhou]] in 1928 by the government of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] and the renowned educator [[Cai Yuanpei]]. It was the first art university and first graduate school in Chinese history. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, China Academy of Art's goal was to promote fine arts education as a replacement for religion in the then war-torn China. Fine arts has been held as equal to a religion at the institution for almost eight decades. The academy has many renowned artists in its alumni and is considered one of the most prestigious art institutions in the country. It is colloquially called '''Guomei''' (國美).

==Introduction==
China Academy of Art is the most influential academy of fine arts with the most complete range of degree offerings and programs of study in China. It houses a diverse pool of artistic talent, has a distinctive structure integrating theory and practice, focuses on human care and social needs, and combines modern technical and cultural disciplines with traditional artistic ones. The academy features the study of theories and offering Ph.D., Master’s and bachelor's degrees of fine arts, design,architecture, film and new media, which constitute the humanities and reflect the Chinese national spirit and creative theories of the era.

There are 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students in three campuses with a faculty and staff of 800. The administration is headquartered in the Nanshan Campus, which is on the West Lake in Hangzhou. Students in the Master's program live on the alternate campus 40 minutes away, on the outskirts of [[Hangzhou]]. A free bus is offered to transport students to and from the campus from the dorms at designated times.

Undergraduate students typically spend one year in general education courses in the Department of Foundation and then three years in the core courses of their particular majors. Graduate courses are typically three years long and include experience in the studio and research with mentoring faculty.

==History==
In 1928, the National Academy of Art (國立藝術院) was founded in China on the bank of the [[West Lake]] in [[Hangzhou]] by the educator [[Cai Yuanpei]] with [[Lin Fengmian]]. It was administrated by Yi Tingbai and Zhuang ziman during the 1940s. Over the decades, the location of the academy has changed ten times; its name changed six times, as follows:

*1928 - National Academy of Art (國立藝術院)
**National Academy of Art was the first Chinese art university and graduate school
*1929 - National Hangzhou School of Art (國立杭州藝術專科學校)
**The Western painting department was divided into several studios, most of which practiced modern, semiabstract styles. The atmosphere was very similar to an American art college in its freedom of expression. After the second year of their five-year program, students chose a studio in which to continue their studies. [[Lin Fengmian]] advocated a synthesis of Chinese and modern Western art, and insisted that students not emulate his work but develop their own styles. Among the other professors, Wu Dayu taught late [[Impressionism|impressionist]] and cubist styles;  [[Fang Ganmin]] was influenced by [[Cubism]]; and Guan Liang taught a style derived from the [[The Fauves|Fauves]]. Although the students were strictly trained in academic drawing, they were encouraged to be free and creative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1979|last=Andrews|first=Julia F.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1938 - National School of Art (國立藝術專科學校)
**The War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, National Peping School of Art merged into National Hangzhou School of Art, a new national school formed. 
* 1945 - After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Academy had been reestablished in Hangzhou with the Chinese painter [[Pan Tianshou]] as director.
**The establishment of the People's Republic of China saw a shift in the government's attitude to and policy on art and artistic education. Many of the senior faculty of the then National Academy of Art, particularly practitioners of modern Western art, failed to understand or refused to accept the revolutionary ideologies and principles. Many, including [[Lin Fengmian]], [[Fang Ganmin]], Wu Dayu and Guan Liang, gradually drifted back to Shanghai. Others, including the traditionalist [[Pan Tianshou]], were reassigned to minor administrative positions, no longer permitted to teach. Lin Fengmian applied for permission to leave China but was refused. The vacant teaching positions were soon filled with fresh graduates who had successfully mastered revolutionary styles and principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1979|last=Julia F. Andrews|first=|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1950 - East China Campus of Central Academy of Fine Arts (中央美術學院華東分院)
**after Chinese Civil War, CPC (中國共產黨) controlled mainland China and founded a new art academy CAFA in Beijing to cement Beijing's new capital position. As a national academy founded by the KMT (中國國民黨) government, CAA was ordered change its name to East China Campus of CAFA. CAA changed its name, but did not merge with CAFA; the two academies possess independent personalities and are not be subordinate to one another.
**similar circumstances were Shanghai Conservatory of Music (上海音樂學院), whose first name was National Conservatory of Music (國立音樂院), Shanghai Theater Academy（上海戲劇學院）were ordered change their names into East China Campus of central academies.
*1958 - Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (浙江美術學院)
*1993 - China Academy of Art (中國美術學院)
**China National Academy of Fine Arts, called China Academy of Art for short on November 16, with the endorsement of the Ministry of Culture, PRC. Finally, CAA rehabilitated its national appellation.

'''Douglas Bernard Kirby, Ph.D.''' (October 9, 1943 − December 22, 2012) was senior research scientist for ETR Associates in [[Scotts Valley, California]], and one of the world’s leading experts on the effectiveness of school and community programs in the reduction of [[adolescent sexuality|adolescent sexual risk-taking behaviors]]. In recent years he had also undertaken research and analysis on the impact of HIV/AIDS prevention programs in Uganda under the auspices of the [[World Health Organization]], [[USAID]], and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Douglas Kirby, Ph.D. - Senior Research Scientist | work = Staff Bio | publisher = ETR Associates | date =  | url = http://programservices.etr.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=about.StaffSummary&amp;StaffID=22 | accessdate = 2010-11-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726041014/http://programservices.etr.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=about.StaffSummary&amp;StaffID=22 | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby authored over 100 articles, chapters and monographs on these programs including the widely acclaimed ''Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases'' which he produced for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. It is a comprehensive review of 115 program evaluations to help determine the most effective approaches to preventing [[teen pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease|STDs]].

'''Education in Ghana''' was mainly informal, and based on [[apprenticeship]] before the arrival of [[Scramble for Africa|European settlers,]] who introduced  a formal education system addressed to the elites. Pre-Independent [[Ghana]] was known as the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The economy of Pre-Colonial Gold Coast was mainly dependent on [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] where farm produces were shared within households and members of each household specialized in providing their household with other necessities such as cooking utilities, shelter, home, clothing and furnitures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hymer|first=Stephen|date=Spring 2018|title=Economic Forms in Pre-Colonial Ghana|jstor=2116722|journal=Economic History Association|volume=30|issue=1|pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with other households was therefore practiced in a very small scale.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has made [[Economics|economic]] activities in pre-colonial Gold Coast a family [[institution]]/[[customs]]; family owned and family controlled.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As such, there was no need for employment outside the household which would have otherwise called for discipline(s), value(s) and skill(s) through a formal [[education]] system.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akurang|first=Kwabena-Parry|date=2002|title="The Loads Are Heavier than Usual": Forced Labor by Women and Children in the central province, Gold Coast (Colonial Ghana), CA. 1900-1940|jstor=3601601|journal=African Economic History|volume=30|issue=30|pages=31–35|doi=10.2307/3601601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Colonial Gold Cost therefore practiced an informal education([[apprenticeship]]) until it was colonized and its economy became a hybrid of subsistence and formal economy.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

After Ghana's Independence in 1957, Ghana's first prime minister [[Kwame Nkrumah|Dr. Kwame Nkrumah]] led Ghana into rapid [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] which led to lesser emphasis on agriculture and other subsistence economic activities in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=William|date=July 1972|title=Import Substitution and Excess Capacity in Ghana|jstor=2662450|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=24|issue=2|pages=212–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid industrialization in Ghana were however centered in the Southern part of Ghana ( Accra, Takoradi, Tema) therefore making most of the manufacturing and service activities centered around the southern part of Ghana.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Keith|date=1973|title=Informal Income Opportunities and Urban Employment in Ghana|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsjsr&amp;AN=edsjsr.159873&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=11|pages=61–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  rapid industrialization in Ghana saw high waves of migrations of people from rural areas that used to be actively engaged in agriculture to cities in the Southern part of Ghana in search for service and manufacturing industrial employments.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Ghana's urban population increased by 23% between 1960 to 2005 and the rate of urbanization in Ghana between 2005 to 2010 was 3.6%, making Ghana's urban population(51.5%), 3% more than Ghana's rural population(48.5%).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Obeng-Odoom|first=Franklin|date=2010|title='Abnormal' Urbanization in Africa: A Dissenting View|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3da9h%26AN%3d57270801%26site%3deds-live|journal=African Geographical Review|volume=29|pages=13–40|via=Oskicat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1974 and 1982, agriculture dropped drastically; maize production dropped by 54%, rice by 80%, yam by 55% and cassava by 50%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Ghana's rapid shift from an [[informal economy]] to formal economy made education an important political objective in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse-jhu-edu.libproxy.berkeley.edu/article/418642/pdf|title=Child Labor in the Gold Coast: The Economics of Work, Education, and the Family in Late-Colonial African Childhoods, c. 1940-57|last=Lord|first=Jack|date=2011|website=Project Muse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of the task, as well as economic difficulties and political instabilities, have slowed down attempted reforms. The Education Act of 1987, followed by the Constitution of 1992, gave a new impulse to educational policies in the country. In 2011, the primary school net enrollment rate was 84%, described by [[UNICEF]] as "far ahead" of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] average. In its 2013-14 report, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranked Ghana 46th out of 148 countries for education system quality. In 2010, Ghana's literacy rate was 71.5%, with a notable gap between men (78.3%) and women (65.3%). The Guardian newspaper disclosed in April 2015 that 90% of children in Ghana were enrolled in school, ahead of countries like [[Pakistan]] and [[Nigeria]] at 72% and 64% respectively.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/07/ghana-global-education-campaign-young-ambassadors-visit-ghanaian-school | title=Almost 90% of Ghana’s children are now in school | work=Theguardian.com | date=7 April 2015 | accessdate=April 7, 2015 | author=Rustin, Susanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uis.unesco.org/country/GH|title=Ghana|website=uis.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ghana reflect a gender gap and disparities between rural and urban areas, as well as between southern and northern parts of the country. Those disparities drive public action against illiteracy and inequities in access to education. Eliminating illiteracy has been a constant objective of Ghanaian education policies for the last 40 years; the difficulties around ensuring equitable access to education is likewise acknowledged by the authorities. Public action in both domains has yielded results judged significant but not sufficient by national experts and international organizations. Increasing the place of vocational education and training and of ICT ([[information and communications technology]]) within the education system are other clear objectives of Ghanaian policies in education. The impact of public action remains hard to assess in these fields due to recent implementation or lack of data. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}
Efforts to reconstruct vocational and technical education in Ghana are being made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_4_Special_Issue_February_2012/15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration and the coordination of public action regarding Education. Its multiple agencies handle the concrete implementation of policies, in cooperation with the local authorities (10 regional and 138 district offices). The State also manages the training of teachers. Many private and public colleges prepare applicants to pass the teacher certification exam to teach at the primary level. Two universities offer special curricula leading to secondary education teacher certification. Education represented 23% of the state expenditure in 2010; international donor support to the sector has steadily declined as the State has taken on the bulk of education funding.

Education in Ghana is divided into three phases: basic education (kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary school), secondary education (upper secondary school, technical and vocational education) and tertiary education (universities, polytechnics and colleges). Education is compulsory between the ages of four and 15 (basic education). The language of instruction is mainly English. The academic year usually runs from August to May inclusive.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|pages=4–5}}{{Infobox Education|

==History==
In precolonial times, education in Ghana was informal.

Cass | date=1971 | author=C.K. Graham | pages=181–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wesleyan mission stayed on the coasts with English as main language. The Basel mission expanded deeper inland and used vernacular languages as the medium of proselytizing.&lt;ref name="colonial"/&gt;  With the support of the British government, missions flourished in a heavily decentralized system that left considerable room for pedagogical freedom. Missions remained the main provider of formal education until independence.&lt;ref name="AEHN"/&gt; Under colonial rule, formal education remained the privilege of the few.&lt;ref name="colonial"/&gt;

Ghana obtained its independence in 1957. The new government of Nkrumah described education as the key to the future and announced a high-level university providing an "African point of view", backed by a free universal basic education.&lt;ref name="kwame"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.create-rpc.org/pdf_documents/50%20Years%20of%20Educational_Progress_%20in_Ghana.pdf | title=Educational Expansion and Access in Ghana: A Review of 50 Years of Challenge and Progress | publisher=Centre for International Education, University of Sussex | accessdate=25 September 2014 | author=Kwame Akyeampong}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the Education Act introduced the principle of free and compulsory primary education and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology was established.&lt;ref name="IBE2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2004/ghana.pdf | title=The development of Education, National report of Ghana | publisher=UNESCO-IBE | date=2004 | accessdate=13 June 2014 | author=Ghana Education Service (GES) | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~univghana/ghanahed.htm | title=The universities in Ghana | publisher=The Commonwealth Universities Year Book | date=1997–1998 | accessdate=25 September 2014 | author=Daniel, G.

==Statistics==
Ghana's spending on education has been around 25%&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt; of its annual budget in the past decade.

The Ghanaian education system from Kindergarten up to an undergraduate degree level takes 20 years.&lt;ref name="Education in Ghana"&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/education/ "Education in Ghana"] ghanaweb.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nab.gov.gh"&gt;[http://www.nab.gov.gh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=182 "What to know about the National Accreditation Board (NAB)"].

==Structure of formal education==

===Overview===
[[File:Ghana Education Structure.gif|thumb|right|550px|&lt;center&gt;[[Education]] structure of Ghana&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Ghanaian education system is divided in three parts: "Basic Education", secondary cycle and tertiary Education. "Basic Education" lasts 11 years(Age 4-15), is free and compulsory.&lt;ref name="GEScurr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content/basic-education-curriculum-1 | title=Basic Education curriculum | publisher=Ghana Education Service (GES) | accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into Kindergarten(2 years), primary school(2 modules of 3 years) and Junior High school(3 years). The junior high school(JHS) ends on the Basic Education Certificate Examination ([[BECE]]).&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEScurr2"/&gt; Once the BECE achieved, the pupil can pursue into secondary cycle.&lt;ref name="BECE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx | title=BECE | accessdate=28 May 2014 | author=West African Examinations Council(corporate site: Ghana)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary cycle can be either general (assumed by Senior High School) or vocational(assumed by technical Senior High School, Technical and vocational Institutes and a massive private and informal offer). Senior High school lasts three years and ends on the West African Secondary School Certificate Examination ([[WASSCE]]). Other secondary institutions leads to various certifications and diplomas. Tertiary education is basically divided into university (academic education) and Polytechnics(vocational education). The WASSCE is needed to join a university bachelor's degree program.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=7}}A bachelor's degree lasts 4 years and can be followed by a 1 or 2 year Master. The student is then free to start a Phd, usually completed in 3 years.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=9}} Polytechnics are opened to vocational students, from SHS or from TVI.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=GHA | title=Vocational Education in Ghana | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=July 2012 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Polytechnic curriculum lasts 2 to 3  years.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt; Ghana also possesses numerous colleges of education.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}} New tertiary education graduates have to serve one year within the National Service Scheme.&lt;ref name="ICICP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dev.icicp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Ghana-Country-Profile-.pdf | title=Country profile: Ghana | publisher=International Association for National Youth Service | date=2012 | accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://196.201.43.251/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=103 | title=Mandate of the NSS | publisher=National Service Scheme (NSS) | accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghanaian education system from Kindergarten up to an undergraduate degree level takes 20 years.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of the Ghanaian Educational System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobeworldwide.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809071841/http://www.tobeworldwide.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=4 |archivedate=2011-08-09 |title=A Brief History of the Ghanaian Educational System|website=TobeWorldwide.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic year usually goes from August to May inclusive.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|pages=4–5}} The school year lasts 40 weeks in Primary school and SHS, and 45 weeks in JHS.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|p=5}}

===Basic Education===
{{further|List of schools in Ghana}}

Basic Education lasts 11 years.&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt; The curriculum is free and compulsory (Age 4-15) and is defined as "the minimum period of schooling needed to ensure that children acquire basic literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills as well as skills for creativity and healthy living".&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt; It is divided into Kindergarten, Primary school and Junior High School (JHS), which ends on the Basic Education Certificate Examination ([[BECE]]).&lt;ref name="BECE"/&gt;

'''Kindergarten''' lasts 2 years (Age 4-6).&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt; The program is divided into 6 core areas:&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt; Language and Literacy (Language Development), Creative Activities (Drawing and Writing), Mathematics (Number Work), Environmental Studies, Movement and Drama (Music  and Dance), and Physical Development (Physical Education)

'''Primary school''' lasts 6 years (Age 6-11).&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt; The courses taught at the primary or basic school level include English, Ghanaian languages and Ghanaian culture, ICT, mathematics, environmental studies, social studies, Mandarin and French as an [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] associated-member; integrated or general science, pre-[[Vocational education|vocational]] skills and pre-[[Technical education|technical]] skills, religious and moral education, and physical activities such as Ghanaian music and dance, and physical education. There is no certificate of completion at the end of primary school.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|pages=4–5}}

'''Junior Secondary School''' lasts 3 years(Age 12-15).&lt;ref name="GEScurr2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content/basic-education-curriculum | title=Basic curriculum Education: The Junior High Education | publisher=Ghana Education Service | accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Junior High School ends on the Basic Education Certificate([[BECE]]), which covers the following subjects:English Language, Ghanaian Language and Culture, Social Studies, Integrated Science, Mathematics, Basic, Design and Technology, Information and Communication Technology, French (optional), Religious and Moral Education.&lt;ref name="BECE"/&gt;

Students who pass the [[Basic Education Certificate Examination|BECE]] can proceed into secondary education, general or vocational.

'''The secondary general education is assumed by the Senior High School(SHS)'''. The SHS [[curriculum]] is composed of core subjects, completed by elective subjects(chosen by the students). The core subjects are English language, mathematics, integrated science (including science, ICT and environmental studies) and social studies (economics, geography, history and government).&lt;ref name="A Brief History of the Ghanaian Educational System"/&gt; The students then choose 3 or 4 elective subjects from 5 available programmes: agriculture programme, general programme (divided in 2 options: arts or science), business programme, [[Vocational education|vocational]] programme and [[Technical education|technical]] programme.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of the Ghanaian Educational System"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/WASSCE.aspx | title=WASSCE - subjects for examination | date=2012 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=West African Examinations Council (WAEC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior high school's curriculum lasts  3 years, as a result of numerous reforms: Originally a three-year curriculum, it was extended to 4 years in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/475340/1/the-2007-educational-reform-and-its-callenges.html | title=The 2007 education Reform and its challenges | accessdate=28 May 2014 | author=Modern Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in early 2009 this reform returned SHS to a 3-year curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=167932 | title=3-year SHS programme starts next year | date=2 September 2009 | accessdate=28 May 2014 | author=Ghanaweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the SHS is still a disputed question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tv3network.com/Education/bring-back-4-year-shs-system-catholic-bishops.html | title= Bring back the 4 year SHS system | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=TV3 Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/artikel.php?ID=275876 | title=The fate of Ghana's Education system | date=5 June 2013 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Ghana Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SHS ends on a final exam called the [[West African Senior School Certificate Examination]] (WASSCE), formerly called Senior Secondary School Certificate (SSSC) before 2007.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=11}} A SHS ranking is established every year by the Statistics, Research, Information, Management and Public Relations (SRIMPR) division of the ministry of Education, based on the WASSCE results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exposeghana.com/2014/03/2013-wassce-shs-rankings-full-list/ | title=2013 WASSCE SHS Rankings- Full List | date=March 2014 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Expose Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vocational and technical Education''' (also called “TVET”) take different forms. After obtaining the BECE, students who wish to pursue in vocational Education have two main possibilities: Following the vocational and technical programs as elective courses in a SHS, or joining a technical and vocational institute(TVI).&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;
SHS students follow the usual SHS 3 year curriculum. They can then – provided sufficient results at the WASSCE – join a university or polytechnic program.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COTVET"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gesci.org/assets/files/COTVET%20report.pdf | title=From prejudice to prestige: Vocational education and training in Ghana | publisher=Council for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (COTVET) | date=2011 | accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVI students usually follow a 4-year curriculum, divided into two cycles of two years, leading to “awards from City &amp; Guilds, the Royal Society of Arts or the West African Examinations Council".&lt;ref name="COTVET"/&gt; They can then pursue a polytechnic program.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt; The state of vocational education sector remains however obscure in Ghana: 90% of the vocational education is still informal, taking the form of apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="COTVET"/&gt; The offer of formal vocational education within the private sector is also hard to define{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2013|page=65}} and the [[Ministry of Education]] recognizes its incapacity to give a clear overview of the public vocational education, many ministries having their own programs.{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2013|page=65}}

International schools also exist in Ghana: the [[Takoradi International School]], Tema International School, [[Galaxy International School, Accra|Galaxy International School]], The Roman Ridge School, [[Ghana International School]], [[Lincoln Community School]], Faith Montessori School, American International School, Association International School, New Nation School, SOS Hermann Gmeiner International College and International Community School, which offer the [[International Baccalaureat]], [[Advanced Level General Certificate of Education]] and the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (IGCSE).&lt;ref name="Education in Ghana"/&gt;

Tertiary education in Ghana has been notably growing during the last twenty years, both in terms of enrollment and infrastructures.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}} A substantial part of this development come from the private sector.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/International/ICE47/English/Natreps/reports/ghana.pdf | title=The development of Education: National report of Ghana | publisher=IBE | date=2004 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nab.gov.gh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=185&amp;limitstart=30 "Ghana private tertiary institutions offering degree program"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002212350/http://www.nab.gov.gh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=185&amp;limitstart=30 |date=2013-10-02 }} Retrieved 2 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nab.gov.gh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=193 | title=Private Colleges of Education | publisher=National Accreditation Board (NAB) | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities(6 public and 49 private institutions){{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}} offer an academic education, from bachelor to Phd. Students are admitted based on their performance at the W.A.S.S.C.E ([[West African Senior School Certificate Examination]]"): A maximum of 24 points is generally required in order to apply to a Bachelor degree program(see [[Education in Ghana#Grading System|Grading system in Ghana]]). A bachelor degree is usually completed after four years of majoring in a specific field of interest.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|pages=9–10}} Master degrees are of two sorts: A one year program, concluded with a final paper based on a literature study, or a two-year program, concluded with a final paper based on one year of independent research.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|pages=9–10}} Both can lead to a Ph.D., usually achieved in 3 years within a doctoral programme.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|pages=9–10}}

Polytechnics (10 institutions){{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}} offer a vocational education. They propose 3-year curricula, leading to a Higher National Diploma(HND). The students have then the possibility to follow a special 18-month program to achieve a Bachelor of Technology degree.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;

Ghana also possesses many "colleges of education", public or private.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}} They are usually specialized in one field (colleges of agriculture p.e) or in one work-training (Nursing training colleges, teacher training colleges, p.e).{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=2}}

New tertiary education graduates have to serve one year within the National Service. Participants can serve in one of the eight following sectors: Agriculture, Health, Education, Local Government, Rural Development, Military and Youth Programmes&lt;ref name="ICICP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NSS"/&gt;

===Grading system===
Ghana’s grading system is different at every point in education. Through the kindergarten to the junior high, every grade a student gains is written in terms of numbers instead of alphabets. There is no system of pluses and minuses (no "1+"’s or "6+"’s as grades).

'''Senior high school'''

Until 2007, Senior secondary High school ended with the Senior Secondary School Certificate(SSSC).{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=5}} Its grading system went from A to E.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=11}} In 2007, the SSSC was replaced by the West African Secondary School Certificate Examination ([[WASSCE]]).{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=5}}  The WASSCE grading system adds numbers to the letters, offering a larger scale of evaluation. In both systems, each grade refers to a certain number of points. In order to join a Bachelor degree program, applicants are usually asked not to exceed 24 points at their WASSCE/SSSC.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=11}}

'''Tertiary education'''

The grading system varies from institution to institution.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=11}} Almost all the tertiary institutions are based on the Grade Point Average (G.P.A) as a way of assessing whether a student is failing or passing. But individual schools have their own way of calculating GPA's, because of their individualized marking schemes. For example, a mark of 80 may be an A in a school but may be an A+ in another school.

== Private Education and Private-Public Partnership In Ghana ==
The Ghanaian government cannot bear the costs in Education alone, thus private institutions and individuals build and operate private institutions to help the government deal with costs in education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nsiah-Peprah|first=Y.|date=2004-01-01|title=Assessment of the role of private schools in the development of education in Ghana.

==Governance==

===Administration===
Education in Ghana is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. Implementation of policies is assumed by its numerous agencies: The Ghana Education Service (GES) is responsible for the coordination of national education policy on pre-tertiary education.&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt; It shares this task with three autonomous bodies, the National Inspectorate Board (NIB), the  National Teaching Council (NTC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).&lt;ref name="GEDP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnadz599.pdf | title=Ghana Education Decentralization Project (GEDP): Operational Framework for National Teaching  Council (NTC) | publisher=Ministry of Education | date=February 2012 | accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal examinations of the pre-tertiary education are conducted by the West African Examination Council (National Office, Ghana): it includes the BECE and the WASCCE but also foreign professional examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/Others.aspx | title=About the WASSCE | publisher=WASSCE | accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council for Technical and vocational education and Training is dedicated to the management of [[Vocational Education|TVET]].&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt; The collection and analysis of educational data is handled by the Education Management Information System (EMIS).&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt;

Policies are implemented in cooperation with the local offices: Ghana is divided into 10 regional and 138 local offices.&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt; The Ghana Education Decentralization Project (GEDP), launched in 2010 and ended in 2012, has increased the influence of local authorities over management, finance, and operational issues when it comes to educational matters.&lt;ref name="GEDP"/&gt;

===Financing===
The Ghanaian State has dedicated 23% of its expenditure to education in 2010.&lt;ref name="Finance"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/StatisticalCapacityBuilding/Workshop%20Documents/Education%20workshop%20dox/2012%20Addis%20Ababa/Country%20presentations/Ghana_EFB_Presentation_21Nov2011.pptx | title=Education Finance Brief, Ghana | publisher=Ministry of Education | date=November 2012 | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 90% of this budget is spent by the Ministry of Education and its agencies: Primary education (31% of the expenditure) and tertiary education(21,6%) are the most provided.&lt;ref name="Finance"/&gt;
The expenditures are partly funded by donors. Among them can be found the [[World Bank]], the United States (through the [[USAID]]), the United Kingdom(through the [[DfID]])  and the European Union.&lt;ref name="cambridge-finance"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ceid.educ.cam.ac.uk/publications/WP16.pdf | title=The financing and outcomes of Education in Ghana | publisher=University of Cambridge | accessdate=13 June 2014 |author1=Nii Moi Thompson |author2=Leslie Casely-Hayford | pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their participation is usually project-focused and granted under certain condition, giving them a certain influence.&lt;ref name="cambridge-finance"/&gt; This influence can provoke debates when it comes to key-reforms:&lt;ref name="cambridge-finance"/&gt; For the FCUBE project, the World Bank imposed book charges in primary schools and reduced feeding and boarding costs in secondary schools. Facing criticisms, the Bank insisted on the “strong domestic ownership” of the reform and the necessity to ensure “cost recovery”.&lt;ref name="cambridge-finance"/&gt;
Between 2005 and 2012, the part of donors in the Ghanaian budget has fallen from 8.5 to 2.5% of the total education expenditure.&lt;ref name="Finance"/&gt;

===Teacher training===
Colleges of Education are the main teacher training institutions: There are 38 public and 3 private "CoE" split in then 10 Ghanaian regions.&lt;ref name="Teacher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/4/2/2158244014529781.full-text.pdf+html | title=Teacher Education in Ghana: A contemporary synopsis and matters arising | publisher=SageOpen | date=April 2014 | accessdate=25 July 2014 |author1=Kwame Bediako Asare |author2=Seth Kofi Nti }}&lt;/ref&gt; They offer a three-year curriculum that leads to the Diploma in Basic Education(DBE).&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt; The education is described as “uniform” and with a “national focus” even if CoE are present in every Ghanaian regions.&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt; The final examinations granting the DBE are conducted by the public University of Cape Coast’s Institute of Education.&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt; The holders of the DBE are allowed to teach at every level of the Basic education(Kindergarten, Primary school, Junior Secondary School).&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt;

Apart from the Colleges of education, two universities (Cape Coast and Winneba) train teachers. A specific four-year bachelor's degree allows to teach in any pre-tertiary education (most graduates choosing secondary education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cie/projects/completed/tpa/ghana | title=Research overview: Teacher preparation and continuing professional development in Africa (TPA) | publisher=University of Sussex | date=2008 | accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific master's degree is needed for teaching in CoE.&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt; Universities also offer to DBE graduate a two-curriculum granting the right to teach in secondary education.&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt;

Distance education is also possible: the programme lasts four years and leads to the Untrained Teacher’s Diploma in Basic Education (UTDBE).&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt; It was introduced to increase the number of basic education teachers in the rural area. Serving teacher can also benefit of continuing education (in-service training, cluster).&lt;ref name="Teacher"/&gt;

==Public action and Policies==

===Adult literacy, non-formal education===
'''''Public action against illiteracy''''' started more than 50 years ago in Ghana. Initiated in the 1940s by the British rulers, its eradication was raised to top-priority at the independence in 1957.&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/4070.pdf | title=National Functional Literacy Programme (NFLP) | publisher=Overseas Development Institute | date=2005 | accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political unrests however limited political actions to sporadic short-term programmes, until 1987 and the creation of the Non-Formal Education Division (NFED), whose goal was to eliminate illiteracy by 2000.&lt;ref name="ODI"/&gt; After a convincing try in 2 regions, the Functional Literacy Skills Project (FLSP) was expanded to the whole country in 1992. In 2000, the programme was taken over by the National Functional Literacy Programme (FNLP), which is still active nowadays.&lt;ref name="ODI"/&gt; Those programmes focus on gender and geographical inequalities. Women and people living in rural area are their main targets.&lt;ref name="NFE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://datatopics.worldbank.org/hnp/files/edstats/GHAgmrpro07.pdf | title=Ghana non-formal Education | publisher=World Bank | date=2008 | accessdate=23 July 2014 | author=Francis Owusu-Mensah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, there were 1238 “Literacy centers”, situated mostly in non-urban area.&lt;ref name="NFE"/&gt;

The successive projects led to statistical progress.&lt;ref name="NFE"/&gt;  In 1997, 64% of women were illiterate for 38% of men, for a global literacy rate of 54%.&lt;ref name="ODI"/&gt; In 2010, women literacy was 65% and the global literacy rate had increased to 71.5%.&lt;ref name="Field listing: Literacy"/&gt; Academics, however, pointed out the insufficient progress of women literacy and the difficulty for graduated to upkeep their new skills.&lt;ref name="NFE"/&gt;

'''''Other forms of non-formal education''''' are also conducted by the NFED:  "Life-skills training" (Family planning, hygiene, prevention on AIDS) targeting adolescent and young mother, "Occupational skills training" for unemployed adults or "civil awareness" seminars (on civil rights and duties) addressed to illiterate adults.&lt;ref name="NFE"/&gt;

===Development of technical and vocational education===
There is an informal education sector in Ghana, which is usually made up of which is usually made up of training, vocational, and technical institutions. These training, technical, and vocational institutions are informal because they do not take place in a classroom setting; these trainings usually take the form of apprenticeship, direct learning, practice, and supervision from trainers. There is usually no official or recognized certification or qualifications given to trainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherry K. Amedorme, Yesuenyeagbe A.K. Fiagbe|date=June 2013|title=Challenges Facing Technical And Vocational Education in Ghana|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.5235&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=International Journal of Scientific &amp; Technology Research|volume= 2|pages=256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing technical and vocational education and training(TVET) is considered  a priority by central authorities in order to tackle poverty and unemployment.&lt;ref name="COTVET2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gesci.org/assets/files/COTVET%20report.pdf | title=From prejudice to prestige: Vocational education and training in Ghana | publisher=Council for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (COTVET)| date=2011 | pages=19–35 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/dev/emea/40577770.pdf | title=Ghana country profile | publisher=OECD | date=2008 | accessdate=25 July 2014 | pages=341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TVET in Ghana face numerous problems: low completion rate (in 2011, 1.6% of the population got a TVET degree whereas 11%  of the population followed a TVET programme),&lt;ref name="COTVET2"/&gt; « poorly trained instructor » and lack of infrastructure.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; The Ghanaian industry also criticizes the lack of practical experience of the formal graduates and the lack of basic skills(reading, writing) of informal apprentices.&lt;ref name="COTVET2"/&gt; In 2008, the OECD reproached the opacity of the qualifications framework and the multiplication of worthless TVET certificates.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; The official council for TVET observed that informal or graduated TVET students struggle to find a job, and then have to deal with income volatility or low wages.&lt;ref name="COTVET2"/&gt; TVET, therefore, suffer from a poor reputation among students, parents and employers.&lt;ref name="COTVET2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apjce.org/files/APJCE_12_2_67_77.pdf | title=Challenges facing technical institute graduates in practical skills acquisition in the upper East region of Ghana | publisher=Asia-Pacific Journal of Cooperative Education (APJCE) | accessdate=25 July 2014 | author=Adam Dasmani | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a micro-credit system in favor of low-skilled unemployed youth was implemented(STEP programme).&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; In 2006, the Council for Technical and Vocational Education and Training(COTVET) was created and entrusted with the mission of coordination "TVET policies" in Ghana.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;  The council introduced a National Youth Found in 2006, and proposed a TVET qualifications framework in 2010.&lt;ref name="COTVET2"/&gt;  It tries besides to frame the informal sector through a National Apprenticeship Programme(NAP)&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt; and to strengthen guidance and counselling at basic education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cotvet.org/new/downloads/Skills%20Advocate%20newsletter2013_Q.pdf | title=Skills advocate: Quarterly COTVET newsletter | publisher=COTVET | date=March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809024837/http://www.cotvet.org/new/downloads/Skills%20Advocate%20newsletter2013_Q.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2014|deadurl=y|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impacts are, however, difficult to assess :{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2013|page=65}} TVET in Ghana is still hard to grasp. 90% is informal&lt;ref name="COTVET2"/&gt; and both the public and private sectors are highly segmented.{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2013|page=65}}&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; The ministry of Education itself admits its incapacity to provide a global statistic view of the TVET sector in Ghana.{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2013|page=65}}

===Equity in access to tertiary education===
With the rise of enrollment in secondary education, competition for joining higher education institution has globally increased: In 2001, the university of Ghana had admitted 96% of the relevant applications it had received. In 2011, this acceptance rate had fallen to 52%.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|loc=fig. 1 (p. 3)}}
This increasing selectivity highlights inequalities in Ghana regarding Education: Being a woman{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=fig. 3(p. 4)}} or living in a rural area&lt;ref name="Sulley"&gt;{{cite book | title=Change and transformation in Ghana's publicly funded universities.

Socioeconomic status is also a factor of exclusion, as studying at the highest level is expensive: Public universities have no tuition fee but usually demand payment for other charges: registration fee, technology fee, examination fee, academic facility user fee, medical services fee.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=9}} These charges can lead to [[self-censorship]] behaviors, some students choosing, for instance, Teacher Training Colleges (where students can receive stipends) instead of joining a university.{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|p=9}}

Policies has been developed to limit those inequalities: Some universities have, for instance, lowered their minimum entry requirement or created scholarship for students from the "less-endowed secondary school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=53790 | title=University of Ghana to admit students from less endowed SSS | publisher=Ghana Web | date=March 2004 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/38696/1/knust-implements-scheme-for-admitting-students-fro.html | title=KNUST implements scheme for admitting students from less endowed schools | date=August 2003 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Girls Education unit" has been created by the government within the Ghana Education Service, in order to reduce gender-biased disparities: The unit tries to tackle the problem at its source, focusing on the "basic Education" to avoid high female school drop-out from {{abbr|JHS|Junior High School}} to {{abbr|SHS|Senior High School}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=node/13 | title=Girl's Education | publisher=Ghana Education Service | accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progresses have been made: The proportion of girls in Higher Education has increased from 25%(1999) to 32%(2005).{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|pp=5-6}}Yet gender still generates inequality, for numerous reasons: Hostile school environment, priority given to the boys in poor families, perpetuation of "gender roles" ("a woman belongs to the household"), early customary marriages, teenage pregnancy...{{sfn |Atuahene, Ansah|2013|pp=5-6}}

Higher education is more heavily male than female and more wealthy than poor:
{{quotation|HE in Ghana is disproportionately ‘consumed’ by the richest 20% of the population. Male students from the highest income quintile (Q5) are more than seven times more likely to enter and successfully complete HE than those from the poorest quintile (Q1).

===ICT in education===
[[File:Wikimedia Outreach in Ghana 6.jpeg|thumb|right|Some [[University of Ghana]] students engaged in a Wikipedia outreach]]

Computer technology used for teaching and learning began to receive governments’ attention in the past decade. The ICT in Education Policy of Ghana requires the use of ICT for teaching and learning at all levels of the education system. Attempts have been made by the [[Ministry of Education (Ghana)|Ministry of Education]] to support institutions in the teaching of ICT literacy. Most secondary, and some basic, schools have computer laboratories.&lt;ref name="Pedagogical integration of ICT: Ghana report"/&gt; Despite the interest in ICT, computers are very limited and are often carried around to ensure that they do not get stolen.&lt;ref name="Ghana's School Systems: Around the World L"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Lillie|title=Fun Facts about Ghana's School Systems|url=http://www.aroundtheworldl.com/2010/02/23/fun-facts-about-ghanas-school-system/|website=Around the World L|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study on the Pedagogical integration of ICTs from 2009-2011 in 10 Ghanaian schools indicates that there is a gap between the policy directives and actual practices in schools. The emphasis of the official curricula is on the development of students’ skills in operating ICTs but not necessarily using the technology as a means of learning subjects other than ICTs. The study also found that the Ministry of Education is currently at the stage of deployment of ICT resources for developing the needed ICT literacy required for integration into teaching/learning.&lt;ref name="Pedagogical integration of ICT: Ghana report"&gt;K.

==  Architecture career ==
Mr. Pesce studied architecture at the [[University of Venice]], with such notable teachers as [[Carlo Scarpa]] and Ernesto Rogers. Between 1958 and 1963, Mr. Pesce participated in Gruppo N, an early collective concerned with programmed art patterned after the [[Bauhaus]].  Since the 1960s, Gaetano Pesce has been known to relate art to the design of interiors, products, and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Amy|title=The Legendary Gaetano Pesce on Work and Life|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/gaetano-pesce-some-works-from-1969-1990/oclc/48816683&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Gaetano Pesce: some works from 1969-1990.|last=Pesce|first=Gaetano|last2=Kuramata|first2=Shirō|date=1991|publisher=Gallery·Ma|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Times]] critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] described Mr. Pesce as ''"the architectural equivalent of a brainstorm."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muschamp|first1=Herbert|title=It's A Mad Mad Mad Ad World|url=https://www.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 16, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesce's well known work includes ''Organic Building'' in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]], a Landmark vertical garden building designed to concealing a complex, computer-controlled hydration system to sustain plant growth, and the interior architecture of the Chiat/Day offices, an early workplace ''village'' modeled after urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Gavin|last2=Myerson|first2=Jeremy|title=New Workspace, New Culture: Office Design as a Catalyst for Change|date=1998|publisher=Gower Publishing Company|isbn=0566080281|pages=144 pages|url=http://www.gowerpublishing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among Mr. Pesce's architecture achievements are [[Les Halles]] ACIH (1979) and [[Parc de la Villette]] (1985), [[Paris, France]], a complex of forms shaped like a running child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vanlaethem|first1=France|title=Gaetano Pesce : architecture, design, art|date=1989|publisher=Rizzoli|location=New York|isbn=0847810860|pages=126 pages : illustrations (some color) ; 30 cm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial Design ==
Since the 1960s, Mr. Pesce has researched the function and form of utilitarian and decorative objects, including furniture, jewelry, and shoes, from the perspective of human emotion, environment, and production. Mr. Pesce is known for innovative high-minded modern design with wit and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/creativitalia-the-joy-of-italian-design/oclc/26402623&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Creativitalia: the joy of Italian design|last=Pesce|first=Gaetano|last2=Celant|first2=Germano|date=1990|publisher=Electa ; Hatsubaimoto Kureativitaria Jikkō Iinkai|location=Milano; Tōkyō|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Pesce has challenged accepted standards of abstraction, uniformity, and homogeneity.  On the architect designer, critic Susan Slesin wrote, "For Gaetano Pesce, to be modern is to face the world squarely and use design as a means to comment on it.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slesin|first1=Suzanne|title=Modern Notions Of Design: The Furniture of Gaetano Pesce|url=https://www.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 10, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Pesce has expanded the established notions of [[Modernism]] through the creation functional, imperfect, and warm [[product design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Jim|title=Gaetano Pesce: the provocative Italian architect and designer on his history of doing things 'badly'-on purpose, of course|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He connects art and society to design through organic form, for production by [[B&amp;B Italia]] (formerly C &amp; B Italia),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/long-life-of-design-in-italy-b-b-italia-50-years-and-beyond/oclc/990773592&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The long life of design in Italy: B &amp; B Italia 50 years and beyond|last=Casciani|first=Stefano|date=2016|publisher=Skira Editore|isbn=9788857231808|location=Milano|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitra (furniture)|Vitra]], [[Cassina S.p.A.|Cassina]], and fabric design, such as ''People'' (1987), composed of 570 different figures, all of which incorporate ideas about variation and diversity in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/process-50-product-designs-from-concept-to-manufacture/oclc/191856123&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Process: 50 product designs from concept to manufacture|last=Hudson|first=Jennifer|date=2008|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=9781856695411|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/textiles-and-new-technology-2010/oclc/929911867&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Textiles and new Technology 2010|last=Braddock|first=Sarah|last2=O'Mahony|first2=Marie|date=1994|publisher=Artemis|isbn=1874056080|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesce's iconic feminist armchair - a fulsome bulbous form and attached ball-shaped ottoman - alternately referred to as La Mamma, Big Mama, Donna, and Up chair - continues to inspire interpretation nearly 50 years after its creation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-story-behind-gaetano-pesces-iconic-armchair&lt;/ref&gt; According to curator and author of SuperDesign, Maria Cristina Didero, "Pesce wanted to produce something about the condition of women in the world. The chair can be read as the mother, and the stool her child. But it could also be a ball and chain [suggesting] woman and the prison she was obliged to live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/melbourne-design-week-celebrates-a-feverish-period-for-italys-radicals-20180223-h0wjfz.html|title=Melbourne Design Week celebrates a feverish period for Italy's radicals|last=Edgar|first=Ray|date=2018-02-26|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Pesce is perhaps best known for his work with resin, molds, and casting techniques used to create objects, including vases, chairs, lamps and the two-dimensional reliefs that the designer calls “industrial skins.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/furniture-machine-furniture-since-1990/oclc/70672622&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The furniture machine: furniture since 1990|last=Williams|first=Gareth|date=2006|publisher=V &amp; A|isbn=9781851774944|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1987, he has infused ordinary materials with experimental additives, such as liquid plant resin, and worked with foam and urethane, simplify the manufacturing processes and adapt limited industrial capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/the-legendary-designer-gaetano-pesce-wrings-feminism-out-of-furniture|title=The Legendary Designer Gaetano Pesce Wrings Feminism Out of Furniture|last=Viladas|first=Pilar|work=W Magazine|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesce credits the early influence of his student work with three venerable Murano glassmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/yalos-why-glass/oclc/226976604&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Yalos: why glass?|last=Barbero|first=Luca Massimo|last2=Claudia Gian Ferrari studio di consulenza per il '900 italiano (Milan|first2=Italy)|last3=Caterina Tognon Arte Contemporanea (Venice|first3=Italy)|date=2008|publisher=Charta|isbn=9788881586691|location=Milan; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Moretti, Vistosi, and Venini — whose casting techniques for informing his label-defying works of sculpture, furniture, vessels and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moca-pacific-design-center-honors-926785|title=MOCA Pacific Design Center Honors "Disruptor" Artist Gaetano Pesce|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Pesce's own experimentation in glassmaking has led to inventive techniques and highly original results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/gaetano-pesce-five-glassmaking-techniques-murano-glass-museum-06-02-2017/|title=gaetano pesce's five glassmaking techniques at murano glass museum|date=2017-06-02|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Pesce has even used urethane resin to create necklaces, bracelets, brooches, and rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/gaetano-pesce-jewelry-collection|title=Gaetano Pesce unveils a new line of jewelry {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mr. Pesce, the design and development of portable goods have always incorporated craft-specialization, history, humor, and the human need for connection. Mr. Pesce's [[industrial design]] techniques such as ''diversified series production'' is a process by which he experiments with materials using a craft manufacturing sensibility applied to mass production methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Viladas|first1=Pilar|title=What's the Big Idea?|url=https://www.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the production line, for example, factory workers vary proportions to produce a series of objects with a "one of a kind" quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovannini|first1=Joseph|title=Gaetano Pesce: ‘One-of-a-Kind Iconic Works, 1967-2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com|publisher=NY Times Art &amp; Design|date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socio-political messaging is found in Mr. Pesce's collections, such as "Nobody’s Perfect" (2002) by Zerodisegno, and the 2010 series of irregularly shaped tables for [[Cassina S.p.A.|Cassina]], which together form the recognizable shape of a boot shape, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Unification of [[Italy]],&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensantunna|url=http://sessantuna.cassina.com|publisher=Cassina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrate human diversity and connection,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/object-lessons-a-psychedelic-cabinet-from-gaetano-pesce-and-more&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one-of-a-kind pieces like “America Table” (2012), with a red-white-and-blue resin tabletop American flag supported on letters that spell “independence,” and “Verbal Abuse” (1994), a tall, grided lamp that bends forward with attachable weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/millers-20th-century-design-the-definitive-illustrated-sourcebook/oclc/812809113&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Miller's 20th century design: the definitive illustrated sourcebook.|last=Miller|first=Judith|date=2012|publisher=Mitchell beazley|isbn=9781845337230|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Pesce's unconventional mixed-media industrial design and organic forms collected in major museums across the world ascribe the work to the realm of art. A 2014 retrospective exhibition ''The Time of Diversity'' at the [[MAXXI]], National Museum of the 21st Century Arts, [[Rome]], charted the artfulness of Pesce's product design from the 1960s to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manuelli|first1=Sara|title=Design maverick Gaetano Pesce explores diversity in a retrospective at the Maxxi Museum, Rome|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/|date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent exhibitions such as “What it is to be Human,” at The Peninsula Chicago, Art Basel in Hong Kong, and an artist-in-resident program at Peninsula Beijing, all featuring works by Gaetano Pesce that expand the renown artist and architect's history of public commitment to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://michiganavemag.com/sponsored-the-peninsula-showcases-gaetano-pesce|title=Sponsored: The Peninsula Chicago Showcases Gaetano Pesce|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Pesce unveiled a site-specific sculpture "Majesty Betrayed" in [[Piazza Santa Maria Novella]]. The monumental female figure wrapped in a long cloak by Pesce was inspired by the Christian Maestà iconography of the Madonna on the Throne - the highly venerated Madonna Rucellai by Duccio di Boninsegna (1285), in [[Santa Maria Novella]] and later moved in the twentieth century the [[Uffizi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflorentine.net/art-culture/2016/11/majesty-betrayed-gaetano-pesce/&lt;/ref&gt; Pesce's sculpture entitled "Porta Ritratti" (2018) for the Milan Fuorisalone was exhibited at the entrance of the [[Brera Academy]] of Fine Arts, and later, the 13th edition of Design Miami / Basel. The ambitious installation - a chair measuring over 13-feet (4-meters) high representing 20 human faces - according to Pesce, " is a Trojan horse that penetrates the Rocca dell'Arte making victims among the old mentality."  The work is another compelling tribute to cultural diversity within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://design.pambianconews.com/gaetano-pesce-ad-art-basel-con-la-sedia-porta-ritratti/|title=Gaetano Pesce ad Art Basel con la ‘Sedia Porta Ritratti’  {{!}}   Pambianco Design|website=design.pambianconews.com|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gakushuin Logo.gif|thumb|Gakushuin Crest and Logo]]

The {{nihongo|'''Gakushūin'''|学習院}} or '''Peers School''' ('''Gakushūin School Corporation'''), also known as '''Gakushūjo''', is a [[Japan]]ese educational institution in [[Tokyo]], originally established to educate the children of Japan's nobility.&lt;ref name="nussbaum230"&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Gakushū-in"] in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gakushuin is composed of the Kindergarten, Elementary School, Middle School, High School, and University. 

==History==
The Peers' School was founded in 1847 by [[Emperor Ninkō]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="gwc"&gt;[http://www.gwc.gakushuin.ac.jp/english/history.html "History of Gakushuin" at Gakushuin Women's College]; retrieved 2013-2-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose was to educate the children of the Imperial aristocracy (''[[kuge]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ponsonby-Fane|Ponsonby-Fane, Richard]]. (1915). ''The Imperial Family of Japan,'' p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the disestablishment of the Peerage in 1947, commoners had restricted access to Gakushuin, with limited slots only to the Elementary School and Middle School. In 1947, with the US mandated disestablishment of the Kazoku system, enrollment in Gakushuin was fully opened up to the general public. The Administration of the School was transferred to the [[Ministry_of_Education,_Culture,_Sports,_Science_and_Technology|Ministry of Education]] at this time.  Previous to 1947, Gakushuin was administered by the [[Imperial Household Agency]]. 

===Precepts===
Emperor Ninko had four [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]s inscribed on the walls of the ''Gakushūin'' building,&lt;ref name="brinkley664"&gt;Brinkley, Frank. (1915). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NnsEAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq= ''A History of the Japanese People,'' p. 664].&lt;/ref&gt; including
# Walk in the paths trodden by the feet of the great sages.&lt;ref name="brinkley664"/&gt; 
# Revere the righteous canons of the empire.&lt;ref name="brinkley664"/&gt;  
# He that has not learned the sacred doctrines, how can he govern himself?&lt;ref name="brinkley664"/&gt;  
# He that is ignorant of the classics, how can he regulate his own conduct?&lt;ref name="brinkley664"/&gt;

The school was moved to Tokyo in 1877.&lt;ref name="nussbaum230"/&gt;   Its new purpose was to educate the children of the  [[kazoku|modern aristocracy]].  Members of the Imperial Family continue to study at Gakushūin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">The '''Higher School Certificate''' is an academic qualification in [[Mauritius]] awarded upon the completion of Upper 6 Form, the final stage of [[Secondary education|secondary school]]. The qualification is awarded upon earning passing marks on the [[A-level]] exams administered by the [[Mauritius Examinations Syndicate]], in conjunction with the [[University of Cambridge]] Local Examinations Syndicate of the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] board. 

==Editions==

===Higher School Certificate (HSC)===
The traditional Higher School Certificate (HSC) is the main school-leaving qualification awarded by Mauritian [[Secondary education in Mauritius|secondary schools]]. Requirements include A Levels and AS Levels in subjects chosen by the student. 

Successful students may receive academic recognition and are eligible to compete for laureateship, a scholarship scheme offered by the Mauritian [[Government of Mauritius|government]] for students pursuing [[Higher education in Mauritius|higher education]]. 

===Higher School Certificate Professional Qualification (HSC Pro)===
The Higher School Certificate Professional Qualification (HSC Pro) is an alternative school-leaving qualification with a modified curriculum and structure, which allows students to pursue both an academic curriculum and [[Vocational education in Mauritius|vocational]] training, to be prepared for [[Higher education in Mauritius|tertiary studies]] as well as employment.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/sites/mesweb/sc_hsc_Section/2013/hsc_professional/2013_hsc_professional_inf_booklet.pdf |title=HSC Professional}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification will be introduced as a pilot in 2015.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt;

There are certain unique features of this qualification that distinguish it from the traditional Higher School Certificate.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt; One is the inclusion of the [[Cambridge Technicals|Cambridge International Technical]] in [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], adapted to the local context, in place of an A Level.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt; Another is replacement of the AS General Paper with a mandatory alternative, the AS Global Perspectives, which is designed to develop communication, analytical and research skills. &lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt; Another is the Work Placement Component (WPC), a structured and supervised placement that provides practical work experience in the industry.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt; 

The structure for the qualification includes:&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt;
*2 or 3 A Levels, including the Cambridge International Technical in ICT
*2 or 3 AS Levels, including the AS Alternative to the General Paper
*The Work Placement Component (WPC)

The alternative qualification is recognised by local and overseas universities, enabling students who successfully complete the qualification to seek admission in universities.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt; HSC Pro students may not compete for laureateship, as can traditional HSC students, but may participate in alternative schemes provided by the Mauritian [[Government of Mauritius|government]] for further studies as well as employment.&lt;ref name="HSCProInf" /&gt;

==Subjects== 
Typically 3 to 5 primary subjects are chosen to study at AS-level, and at least 3 subjects are further studied to A2-level. Both the AS (Advanced Subsidiary) and A2 years must be completed for the full A-level qualification to be completed; an AS-level qualification may also be awarded after the first year.

===AS-level=== 
Cambridge Higher School Certificate candidates may take the following subjects at AS-level:&lt;ref name="MruHSCStats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/sites/mesweb/hsc_stats.htm |title=STATISTICS: HIGHER SCHOOL CERTIFICATE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression==
Students who successfully earn the Higher School Certificate may then progress onto [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] study. Students who are unsuccessful in obtaining the qualification may then transition from the academic stream to the vocational stream and progress onto [[Vocational_education_in_Mauritius#Vocational_qualifications|vocational]] programmes of study. Students may also choose to obtain [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] qualifications at a later time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3511">The '''Independent Education System''' of Israel ({{lang-he| החינוך העצמאי}} - which is translated "independent education" and could be transliterated as ''Khinukh Atsmai'' or ''Chinuch Atzmai'') is an alternate school system run by and serving the needs of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (ultra-Orthodox Jewish) community of [[Israel]]. It was established in 1953 by a decision of the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] ([[Council of Torah Sages]] of [[Agudath Yisrael]] in [[Israel]]) and implemented through the ''State Education law''. It was initially led by Rabbi [[Zalman Sorotzkin]] and is run by an umbrella center that operates numerous schools throughout the country.

The diverse nature of Israel’s society is accommodated within the framework of the [[Education in Israel|Israeli education systems]]. Different sectors of the population attend different schools. Although parents are comforted by the fact that their children’s school may more or less reflect their basic worldview, this separation results in very little contact among the various segments of Israeli society. Schools are divided into five groups: State schools (''mamlachti''), attended by the majority of the pupils; State religious schools (''[[mamlachti dati]]''), which emphasize Jewish studies, tradition and observance; Independent religious schools (''Chinuch Atzmai'') which focus almost entirely on Talmud Torah and offer very little in terms of secular subjects; Private schools which reflect the philosophies of specific groups of parents (Democratic Schools) or are based on a curriculum of a foreign country (e.g. The American School); and lastly, Arab schools, with instruction in Arabic and a focus on Arab history, religions and culture.

There are approximately 80,000 students currently enrolled in Chinuch Atzmai schools, which include [[Beis Yaakov]] schools for girls, [[Talmud Torah]], [[Cheder]] and [[Yeshiva Ketana]] for boys. There is a strong emphasis on Jewish studies in these programs.

The schools are partially supported by the State; however, the Ministry of Education is not responsible for the hiring and firing of teachers or for the registration of pupils.  Schools in the Chinuch Atzmai system are allocated 55% of the budget that regular state schools receive and are required to teach 55% of the Ministry of Education's curriculum.  Chinuch Atzmai's funding has traditionally been supplemented by donations from outside Israel, particularly the United States. Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]], one of the movement's founders, was extremely instrumental in fundraising for the organization. Due to sharp cuts in state funding over recent years, the movement has had to redouble its efforts in order to keep schools from closing.

The center was a main focus of the controversial [[Immanuel Beit Yaakov controversy|Court ruling]] against the [[Beit Yaakov]] school in [[Immanuel (town)#Controversy|Immanuel]] in summer 2010, when it was fined for not complying with the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3655796,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intern Aware''' is the United Kingdom national campaign for fair [[internship]]s, founded in 2010. Working closely in cooperation with businesses, trade bodies and trade unions, they aim to help employers develop high quality internship schemes with recruitment based on merit, and payment that complies with [[employment law]]. They also work with interns to ensure they receive the pay they are potentially entitled to by law.

They believe that unpaid internships are exploitative, exclusive and unfair. By asking people to work without pay, employers exclude those with talent, ambition and drive who cannot afford to work for free. They campaign that employers and young people alike benefit from the best graduates getting the best jobs. They argue that paying interns a fair wage can ensure that this happens.

== Policies ==

Much of Intern Aware’s argument focuses on how interns fit into the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]].

'''Main proposal'''

•	(Excluding existing exemptions) the [[UK Government]] should designate anyone who has undertaken a period of work experience for over four weeks to be a “[[worker]]” under the meaning of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) Act.

'''Other proposals'''

*“Naming and shaming” of persistent, high profile offenders who break the NMW Act;
*Third parties should be able to complain about non-enforcement of the NMW;
*Advertisements for illegal work should be monitored;
*Better support and guidance to vulnerable workers;
*Raise penalties for non-payment of the NMW
*A new paid internship scheme for the [[Voluntary sector|third sector]].

== History ==

The organisation started as a [[Facebook]] group named "Interns Must Be Paid The Minimum Wage".&lt;ref&gt;

'''''John Deere: American Farmer''''' is a [[farm]] [[construction and management simulation games|construction and management simulation]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] featuring the [[John Deere]] license, developed by [[Gabriel Entertainment]], published by [[Take 2 Interactive]] and [[Destineer|Destineer Studios]].

The goal of the game is to make a living by raising livestock such as beef cattle, dairy cows, and pigs, or by growing crops such as sunflowers, soybeans, wheat and corn. Players must contend with factors such as weather, market demand, employee skill.

There is a variety of John Deere equipment to choose from such as the 7820, 9520 and 5303 tractors with numerous attachments, and the 9660 combine with a hydraflex and corn headers. There are also smaller vehicles such as the John Deere Gator and ATVs. There is a built-in [[map editor]] that enables players to create their own map.

In 2006 a sequel, ''John Deere: American Farmer Deluxe'' was released and received positive reviews.

'''Carl Johan Jacob Forsell''' (6 November 1868 &amp;ndash; 30 May 1941), known as '''John Forsell''', was a prominent Swedish [[baritone]], opera administrator and teacher of voice. He was the leading baritone of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] (RSO) from 1896–1918, and thereafter sang roles periodically with the company until his last stage performance in 1938. From 1923-1939 he served as the director of the RSO. He also sang leading roles as a guest artist with opera companies internationally, drawing particular acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

In 1899, Forsell was awarded the [[Litteris et Artibus]] and, a decade later, he was named a [[Hovsångare]]. The [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] awarded him membership in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, H. and Warrack, J. (1979), "Forsell, John", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Stockholm]], Forsell was the son of Carl August Forsell, a sea captain, and Axeline Forsell (née Åberg). Before his singing career, he served in the [[Swedish Army]]; becoming a second lieutenant in 1890 and lieutenant in 1896. In 1897 he requested and was granted an honorable dismissal from the army, but continue to serve as a member of the [[Upplands regemente (infantry)|Uppland Regiment]] reserves through 1901.

While serving in the army, he pursued voice studies with [[Julius Günther]] at the [[Royal College of Music, Stockholm]] from 1892-1894. After graduating from college he studied singing further in Paris in 1895-1896 and later in Stockholm with [[Hedvig Willman]] and [[Signe Hebbe]].&lt;ref name="oper"&gt;[http://hosting.triboni.com/triboni/exec?method=com.operissimo.artist.webDisplay&amp;id=ffcyoieagxaaaaabatji&amp;xsl=webDisplay&amp;searchStr=John Forsell at operissimo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singing career==
Forsell made his operatic debut at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]], Stockholm, in 1896 as Figaro in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. He would remain that [[opera house]]'s premier baritone through 1918, and thereafter appeared only periodically at that theatre up until his retirement from the stage in 1938. He sang in several world premieres with the company, including [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]]'s ''Tirfing'' (1898) and [[Andreas Hallén]]'s ''[[Valdemarskatten]]'' (1899, the title role of [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]). He also appeared in the Swedish premieres of ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (1903, title role), ''[[Tosca]]'' (1904, Scarpia), and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1909, Jochanaan).&lt;ref name="oper"/&gt;

Forsell also established an international career. From 1902-1906 he sang regularly at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] in Copenhagen. In 1909-1910 he appeared at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, performing such parts as Tonio in ''[[Pagliacci]]'', Amfortas in ''[[Parsifal]]'', Figaro in ''The Barber of Seville'', Telramund in ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', Germont in ''[[La traviata]]'' and Yeletsky in the United States premiere of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''.

The title role in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' was probably his most famous interpretation. He sang the part numerous times, including during the 1909 season at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], London, and at the 1930 [[Salzburg Festival]]. Other major opera houses in which Forsell sang the Don and various leading parts were the [[Berlin State Opera]], the [[Dutch National Opera]], and the [[Vienna State Opera]]. In 1915 he portrayed the role of the Foreigner/Francesco del Giocondo in the world premiere of [[Max von Schillings]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa (opera)|Mona Lisa]]'' at the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="oper"/&gt;

== Opera director, teacher, and later life==
Forsell become the Director (Intendant) of the Royal Swedish Opera at the start of the 1923-1924 season, and performed less frequently on stage as a consequence. His voice, however, remained in fine condition. His final opera performance was on his 70th birthday when he sang the role of Count Almaviva in Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' at the RSO. He retired from his director's position in May 1939 and died in Stockholm two years later. His wife, soprano Gurli Carlström (married 1901), pre-deceased him in 1935. Their son, [[Björn Forsell]], was also a successful opera singer.&lt;ref name="oper"/&gt;

In addition to his administrative duties at Stockholm's opera house during the 1920s and '30s, Forsell taught voice as a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. His pupils included [[Joel Berglund]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[Magna Lykseth-Scherfven]], [[Aksel Schiøtz]], [[Hjördis Schymberg]], [[Set Svanholm]], and [[Inez Wassner]].&lt;ref name="oper"/&gt;

== Recordings==
Forsell's [[phonograph|gramophone]] legacy consists of several batches of acoustic 78-rpm discs of arias and songs (made initially by the [[Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company]] prior to [[World War I]]) and some subsequent electrical recordings of live stage performances. Many of these recordings are available on modern CD reissues, most notably a four-disc anthology produced in 1994 by Caprice Records (CAP 21586). When discussing Forsell's impressive legacy on disc, the British audio restoration engineer Keith Hardwick has this to say: "His voice was a dark, warm, expressive baritone, very well produced and equalized."&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Notes" for ''A Record of Singers Supplement 1902-1912'', OCLC 9078336, published London, 1982, by EMI Records Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John W. Berry''' is a Professor Emeritus of Psychology at [[Queen's University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/psychology/People/Emeritus-Retired/JohnBerry.html |title=Department of Psychology - John Berry |publisher=Queensu.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121005605/http://www.queensu.ca/psychology/People/Emeritus-Retired/JohnBerry.html |archivedate=2012-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He can be seen as one of the main establishers of the field of [[acculturation]] psychology. Berry has been described as a person that "has led, if not defined, contemporary approaches to acculturation."&lt;ref&gt;Ward, C.(2008) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2007.11.002 Thinking outside the Berry boxes: New perspectives on identity, acculturation and intercultural relations.] "International Journal of Intercultural Relations", 32(2), 105-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He attended [[Sir George Williams University]] in [[Montreal]] from which he obtained a B.A. in 1963.  He then undertook graduate work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from which he obtained a PhD in 1966. He was a faculty member for most of his career at [[Queen's University]] from which he is now an emeritus professor.  He has held visiting appointments at many institutions including the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]] and the National Research University Higher School of Economics, in Russia.

==Work==
One of his well-known theories is the four-fold model of acculturation strategies, involving the strategies of [[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Racial separation|Separation]], [[Racial integration|Integration]] and [[Marginalization]].

According to Google Scholar, his work has been cited over 70,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Scholar John Berry|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=1Yrc0moAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;authuser=1&amp;sortby=pubdate|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mitra was born to Shibnarayan Mitra in [[Kolkata]], [[British India]]. He passed from [[Hare School]] and entered into the [[Presidency College Calcutta|Presidency College]] but due to poor economic condition he had to left study and started living in his maternal house at [[Barasat]] (presently [[North 24 Parganas district]]). His elder brother was a notable doctor, Nabinkrishna Mitra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Isvar_Chandra_Vidyasagar,_a_story_of_his_life_and_work/Chapter_15|title=Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar, a story of his life and work|last=Chapter 15|first=Subal Chandra Mitra|date=|website=en.wikisource.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==Contribution==
Mitra involved with progressive education movement and several social reformative actions in [[Bengal]]. In 1847 he established a private girls school in Barasat with the help of his brother Nabinkrishna and educationist [[Peary Charan Sarkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgc.org.in/history.php|title=Barasat Government College|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first school for the girls of aristocratic [[Hindu]] families established by any Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchfoundation.com/upoadreserchpapers/5/190/1802061145301st%20chiranjit%20roy.pdf|title=Madanmohan Tarkalankar and Women Education in the First Half of 19th Century Bengal|last=Chiranjit Roy|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was started with only two girls. ''Kuntibala'', daughter of Nabinkrishna is one of them. Although such activities was strongly opposed by Hindu [[Zamindar|Zaminders]] and the then conservative society but [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune]] supported Mitra's enormous effort for women education in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=91xAzuqbha0C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=kalikrishna+mitra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PcZwg13RuJ&amp;sig=i_OGCt78h9Ke0-JXkRIhNeLRY90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAi_CM8sraAhXKPY8KHT9gBTA4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=kalikrishna%20mitra&amp;f=false|title=Hindu Widow Marriage|last=Ishvarchandra Vidyasagar|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latter the school was renamed as [[Kalikrishna Girls' High School]]. Even Bethune got inspiration for establishment Bethune School in 1949, when he went there for inspection as President of the Council of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Bagal, Jogesh C., ''History of The Bethune School and College'' in the ''Bethune School and College Centenary Volume, 1849–1949. ''&lt;/ref&gt; Mitra organised an agricultural firm of 150 ''Bighas'' for scientific farming, plantation and research in Barasat. He brought modern equipment from [[England]] for this purpose. He also contributed to spread out for [[Homeopathy]] medication.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan|last=Vol II|first=Anjali Basu|publisher=Sahitya Sansad|year=2004|isbn=81-86806-99-7|location=Kolkata|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=q4k9ILvAcE4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=kalikrishna+mitra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BDynOWxBNt&amp;sig=j_VDn2z4dtk8Jdun76ZposK3QZk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAi_CM8sraAhXKPY8KHT9gBTA4ChDoAQgsMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=kalikrishna%20mitra&amp;f=false|title=Nationalizing the Body: The Medical Market, Print and Daktari Medicine|last=Projit Bihari Mukharji|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
&lt;!--(I'm commenting this out because I have never before seen a wiki page with a prominent photo of someone's daddy, especially when said daddy does not have his own wiki article. If there is a good reason to put this back, please do. In the meantime, I don't think we need it.) [[File:William Knox Martin aviator 1891 1927.jpg|thumb|left|175px|William Knox Martin (1891&amp;ndash;1927), aviator father of Knox Martin]]--&gt;
Knox Martin is the oldest son of Lieutenant William Knox Martin, a Virginia-born early aviation pioneer and flyer, and his wife Isabel Vieco, who were married in the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] in [[Panama]] in 1921. Knox Martin Sr., painter, poet, early test pilot, was the first man to fly over the [[Andes]] mountains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxmartin.com/about-knox-martin.html |title=About Knox Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after his marriage, Martin Sr. was fatally injured in an automobile accident in [[Watertown, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlyaviators.com/emartin.htm William Knox Martin- earlyaviators.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His widow Isabel relocated with her three young sons from [[Salem, Virginia]] to [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janosgatgallery.com/JANOS_GAT_GALLERY/Knox_Martin_1.html |title=Knox Martin |publisher=Janosgatgallery.com |date=2003-09-12 |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After serving in the [[United States Coast Guard]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://aintmarching.net/2009/06/08/for-d-day-anniversary-the-voice-of-one-who-knows/ For D-Day anniversary: the voice of one who knows]&lt;/ref&gt; during World War II, Knox Martin attended the Art Students League of New York on the G.I. Bill from 1946 to 1950, where he studied with [[Harry Sternberg]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpda.org/content/node/2142 Harry Sternberg-IFPDA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424053323/http://www.ifpda.org/content/node/2142 |date=2013-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaclav Vytlacil,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160314185435/http://theartstudentsleague.org/Residency/AboutVaclavVytlacil.aspx The Art Students League: About Vaclav Vytlacil]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Barnet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://frenchculture.org/visual-and-performing-arts/news/france-honors-will-barnet-chevalier-order-arts-letters France Honors Will Barnet with the Order of Arts and Letters]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morris Kantor]]. &lt;br /&gt;In 1954, Martin's friend [[Franz Kline]] placed a painting of his in the [[Stable Gallery]] Annual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&amp;tab=holdings |title='&amp;#39;New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists,'&amp;#39; |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Egan of the [[Charles Egan Gallery]] saw Martin's painting at the Stable Gallery and asked him to show his work in a one-man show for the tenth anniversary of the Egan Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/09/16/archives/about-art-and-artists-knox-martin-impresses-in-first-oneman-show.html | work=The New York Times | title=About Art and Artists; Knox Martin Impresses in First One-Man Show  | date=September 16, 1954 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Knox Martin is best known for his repertory of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and [[symbols]] that allude to nature and, in particular, to the female form. Flatly and freely painted in brilliant colors, his works have often been executed on a grand scale, as in the outdoor [[Mural|wall painting]], ''[[Woman with bicycle]]'', at West Houston and MacDougal Streets in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DF1039F933A05755C0A967948260 | work=The New York Times | first=Vivien | last=Raynor | title=Art; Knox Martin: Angry But More Human | date=June 30, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mostly creates painting, sculpture and wall paintings using media such as [[acrylic paint|acrylic]], [[collage]], [[fresco]], [[ink]] drawing (pen and ink), mixed media/multimedia, and [[oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/ArtistKeywords.aspx?artist=32742 |title=Knox Martin - Artist, Art - Knox Martin |publisher=Askart.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:"Woman with bicycle" by Knox Martin.jpg|thumb|Woman with bicycle]] --&gt;
One of his wall paintings in New York City is the twelve-story mural ''[[Venus (mural)|Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/nyregion/thecity/11venu.html?ex=1328850000&amp;en=8f4515c95db4a18e&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work=The New York Times | first=Alex | last=Mindlin | title=After a 37-Year Run, a Roadside Venus to Be Veiled | date=February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted in 1970, it is located on the south side of [[Bayview Correctional Facility]] at 19th Street and the West Side Highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkartworld.com/commentary/KnoxMartin-RoadsideVenus.html |title=Knox Martin and his Roadside Venus |publisher=Newyorkartworld.com |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822211418/http://www.newyorkartworld.com/commentary/KnoxMartin-RoadsideVenus.html |archivedate=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Traditionally the goddess of love and fertility, Venus represents woman, erotic and supple, but it also conveys Knox Martin's love affair with New York. Venus is his love poem to the city where he has always lived, a place that is part of his being. The feminine, curvilinear shapes of the image are in direct contrast with the straight forms that intersect the composition. The overwhelming size of this enormous mural only intensifies the experience of female shapes, the linear aspects of the painted composition, and of the surrounding architecture. In an era when art was reaching out to the masses with pop culture, this huge mural was Knox Martin's way of touching a public that would never venture into an art gallery." &lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Kushner, Knox Martin: Early Work, exh. cat. (New York: Janos Gat Gallery, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Learey Technical College''' (formally '''Fred D. Learey Technical College''') is a public vocational school in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]].  It is part of the [[Hillsborough County Public Schools]] system. It offers education in Emergency Medical Technician and Fire Fighter programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learey.mysdhc.org/School_Information |title=About our School |publisher=[[Hillsborough County Public Schools]] |date=2018 |accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learey is located in a highly urbanized area, at 5410 North 20th Street, Tampa, Florida 33610, across the street from the much larger [[Erwin Technical Center]]. Learey has existed since June 1993.&lt;ref&gt;''2011-2012 Workforce &amp; Continuing Education Guide'' (Tampa: Hillsborough County Public Schools: 2011), pp. 2, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Learey website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The Learey building houses classes and the administrative offices. This is a two-story building, which measures {{convert|125|ft|m}} by {{convert|100|ft|m}}. The entrance area, on the northeast corner, is designed to be an [[octagon]]. Learey only has about twelve parking spaces, so most students must park on nearby streets or in the Erwin Technical Center lots. Learey conducts some classes at Tampa's  [[MacDill Air Force Base]]'s New Education Center.&lt;ref&gt;Learey website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lest We Forget Project''' is a project by Canadian Schools in cooperation with [[Library and Archives Canada]] and the [[Canadian War Museum]]. In this project, students attend Library &amp; Archives to study files of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] soldiers. This helps students understand the contributions made for them, by the military.

The program began in 2001 after Blake Seward, a history teacher from [[Smiths Falls]], [[Ontario]] decided to teach his class about World War I through researching soldiers, nurses and other participants in the war.

In January 2010, Library and Archives Canada announced cutbacks to the program. Through a joint effort with the [[Royal Canadian Legion]] and the War Museum, the program still exists for the use of students. Much of the information was made available online for the ease of research for students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60654">This page contains a representative list of major databases and search engines useful in an academic setting for finding and accessing articles in [[academic journal]]s, [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]], archives, or other collections of [[scientific journal|scientific]] and [[academic journal|other]] articles.
As the distinction between a [[database]] and a [[search engine]] is unclear for these complex [[document retrieval system]]s, see:

* the general [[list of search engines]] for all-purpose search engines that can be used for academic purposes
* the article about [[bibliographic database]]s for information about databases giving bibliographic information about finding books and journal articles.

Note that "free" or "subscription" can refer both to the availability of the
database or of the journal articles included.  This has been indicated as precisely as possible in the lists below.

==History==
The term "manager" emerged in the 1970s owing to the influence of the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Match of the Day]]''. A portion of the east coast of Ireland, including [[Dublin]], was able to receive the channel and programme, which showed coverage of [[association football]], where "manager" was the common term used for the coach or supervisor of the team.&lt;ref name="MOTD"&gt;{{cite news |title=Martin Breheny: Dubs train sights on Heffo's heroes - Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/martin-breheny-dubs-train-sights-on-heffos-heroes-35055764.html |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=Independent.ie |archiveurl=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/martin-breheny-dubs-train-sights-on-heffos-heroes-35055764.html |archivedate=17 September 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later played a role in changing the management structure of [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] teams as the [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] [[Gaelic football|football]] revival of the 1970s evolved.&lt;ref name="MOTD"/&gt; Throughout the history of the GAA clubs and teams and were often influenced by selection panels. By the early 1970s, the GAA began to take note of the merits of having an individual [[soccer]]-style manager accompanied by assistants. In 1973 the Dublin County Board appointed [[Kevin Heffernan (Gaelic footballer)|Kevin Heffernan]] to lead their football team.&lt;ref name="Game changer"&gt;{{cite news |title=The man who changed the face of Gaelic football - Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/the-man-who-changed-the-face-of-gaelic-football-29023049.html |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=Independent.ie |archiveurl=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/the-man-who-changed-the-face-of-gaelic-football-29023049.html|archivedate=26 January 2013 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time in the GAA's history that a manager with substantial powers was appointed.&lt;ref name="Game changer"/&gt; Other counties later followed suit by having a single manager supported by a smaller selection panel.{{fact|date=September 2018}} While the GAA's current management and coaching model was influenced by other sports (like soccer), several differences with those sports do remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.sportsjoe.ie/gaa/stevie-mcdonnell-superbly-explains-differences-gaa-coaches-managers-124909 | title = Stevie McDonnell superbly explains differences between GAA coaches and managers | accessdate = 21 September 2018 | date = 27 May 2017 | publisher = Joe.ie }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Appointment ==
The Gaelic Athletic Association publishes and maintains a set of guidelines for the appointment of managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/the-gaas-ninestep-guide-for-appointing-a-manager-26575842.html | publisher = Independent News &amp; Media | title = The GAA's nine-step guide for appointing a manager | date = 23 October 2009 | accessdate = 21 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers of [[Gaelic Athletic Association county|county teams]] can be appointed from within that county - though it is not uncommon for managers to be "brought in" from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/the-import-and-export-business-28905488.html | publisher = Independent News &amp; Media | title = The import and export business | accessdate = 30 September 2018 | date = 24 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GAA rules also allow for a manager (in Irish ''bainisteoir'') to be supported by a single assistant manager (in Irish ''maor foirne'') during games.&lt;ref name="part2rules"&gt;{{cite report|url = https://learning.gaa.ie/sites/default/files/2016%20Official%20Guide%20-%20Part%202.pdf | publisher = GAA | title = GAA Rule Book - Official Guide - Part 2 | date = 2016 | page = 22 | quote = one team official (Maor Foirne, who is an assistant to the Bainisteoir), may [..] make changes and/or to give instructions to players. [..] A Selector is permitted to act as Maor Foirne | accessdate = 21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under GAA rules, an assistant manager to a [[Gaelic football]] or [[hurling]] team may also be a member of the team's panel of [[selector (sports)|selectors]], but may not be one of the team's panel of players.&lt;ref name="part2rules"/&gt;

==Noted managers==
{{see|List of All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winning managers|List of All-Ireland Senior Football Championship winning managers}}
In inter-county hurling, the manager with the most championship wins is [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny's]] [[Brian Cody]], with 15 [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Provincial Championship]] and 11 [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Championship]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/brian-cody-oversees-the-20th-national-title-of-his-reign-1.3454922 | title = Brian Cody oversees the 20th national title of his reign | date = 9 April 2018 | publisher = Irish Times | accessdate = 30 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.the42.ie/brian-cody-kilkenny-5-2860327-Jul2016/| title = Brian Cody has now won more provincial senior titles than any other GAA manager | date = 4 July 2016 | publisher = The42.ie | accessdate = 30 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Maher]], also of Kilkenny, has the second-most All-Ireland hurling championship wins, with 7 titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.sportsjoe.ie/gaa/godfather-of-kilkenny-hurling-fr-tommy-maher-dies-aged-92-19007 | publisher = Joe.ie | title = Godfather of Kilkenny hurling Fr Tommy Maher dies aged 92 | date = 26 March 2015 | accessdate = 30 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marshall Scholarship''' is a [[Postgraduate student|postgraduate]] [[scholarship]] for 
"intellectually distinguished young Americans [and] their country's future leaders" to study at any university in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marshall Scholarships 2012 Competition Statistical Report|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/Stats2012forpublication.pdf|publisher=Marshall Scholarships|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427023523/http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/Stats2012forpublication.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1953 as a living gift to the [[United States]] in recognition of the generosity of [[Secretary of State]] [[George C.

With nearly 1,000 applicants in recent years, it is among the most selective graduate scholarship for Americans, with an acceptance rate around 4%, and as low as 3.2% in 2015.&lt;ref name="marshallscholarship2015"&gt;http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/stats2015&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered one of the most prestigious scholarships for U.S. citizens,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/education/other-roads.html|title=Other Roads|date=12 January 2003|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505145_162-37244301/10-most-prestigious-scholarships-in-america/|title=10 Most Prestigious Scholarships In America|date=26 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/15/nyregion/ambassador-names-marshall-scholars.html|title=Ambassador Names Marshall Scholars|date=15 December 1996|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and along with the [[Fulbright Scholarship]] it is the only broadly available scholarship available to Americans to study at any University in the [[United Kingdom]]. The program was also the first major co-educational British graduate scholarship; one-third of the inaugural cohort in 1954 were women.

Currently, there are over 1,900 [[#Notable Marshall Scholars|Marshall Scholar alumni]].&lt;ref name="marshallscholarshipstats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/statistics|title=Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, two of the nine current  Associate Justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are alumni of the program ([[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Stephen Breyer]]), while others have been prominent [[CEO]]s ([[LinkedIn]], [[Dolby Labs]]), members of the [[United States Congress]]; members of the Presidential [[Cabinet of the United States]]; state [[Governor (United States)|Governors]]; the Deans of [[Yale Law School]],  [[Stanford Law School]], the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School]] and [[Harvard College]]; presidents of seven universities or colleges, including [[Duke University]], [[Wellesley College]], the [[Cooper Union]], and [[Caltech]]. They have also been leaders in many academic and professional disciplines, including one [[Nobel Laureate]], four [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning authors, two winners of the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] for the best American economist under the age of 40, twelve [[MacArthur Genius Grant]] awardees, and the President of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the [[Managing Editor]]s of [[TIME]] and [[CNN]] and the International News Editor of [[The New York Times]], [[Anne McClain|NASA's youngest Astronaut]], two [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominees, one winner of the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]], and one awardee of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for service during the [[Iraq War]].

==Objectives==
In a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/history/|title=Message from General George Marshall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the first class of Marshall Scholars, [[George Marshall]] echoed his own words in initially presenting his ideas for European recovery by saying,&lt;blockquote&gt;A close accord between our two countries is essential to the good of mankind in this turbulent world of today, and that is not possible without an intimate understanding of each other. These scholarships point the way to the continuation and growth of the understanding which found its necessity in the terrible struggle of the war years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The published objectives of the Marshall Scholarships are outlined as follows:
# To enable intellectually distinguished young Americans, their country's future leaders, to study in the UK.
# To help scholars gain an understanding and appreciation of contemporary Britain.
# To contribute to the advancement of knowledge in science, technology, the humanities and social sciences and the creative arts at Britain's centres of academic excellence. 
# To motivate scholars to act as ambassadors from the USA to the UK and vice versa throughout their lives thus strengthening British American understanding.
# To promote the personal and academic fulfilment of each scholar.

==History==
Plans to establish "Marshall Scholarships" as a living memorial to [[Secretary of State]] George Marshall were announced by British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] on July 31, 1952,&lt;ref&gt;''Britain to Set Up 12 Scholarships for U.S. Students''. The Washington Post, August 1, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and were enacted by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] when the Marshall Aid Commemoration Act was passed in 1953. The act's passage was backed by "leaders of all political hues," with British Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] describing the scholarship's establishment as "a great opportunity for Europe."

While the authors of the proposal initially considered partnering with the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], and even considered using the same selection committees, this idea was eventually disregarded because its proponents strongly believed the scholarships should be available to women, and to married men under the age of 28 (at the time, the Rhodes Scholarship was limited to single men under the age of 25). The creation of a separate scholarship was a cause of great concern to Lord [[Godfrey Elton]], the head of the Rhodes Trust at the time, who worried that the ability to study at other universities would draw potential applicants. He urged the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to create a ‘reverse exchange’ for British students in the United States instead.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherji, Aroop. Diplomas and Diplomacy: The History of the Marshall Scholarship. pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhodes Scholarship became open to women beginning in 1977 following the passage of the British Sex Discrimination Act in 1975.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In 1959, when Parliament doubled the number of scholars from 12 to 24, British politician [[Philip Noel-Baker]] argued that "Marshall, more than perhaps any other man, destroyed isolation in the United States and built up the conception that only collective security through international institutions can save the world...I think the world has never seen an act of greater national generosity than Marshall aid and the other aid which the United States has given to other continents throughout the last 15 years." By 1960, six years after their establishment, the scholarship was "on its way to becoming as well-known and respected as the fellow phrase, "Rhodes [Scholarship]," and both scholarships attracted roughly 500 to 600 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Neal. ''Marshall Scholars: Terms Compared''. The Christian Science Monitor, January 18, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the celebrations for the 50th Anniversary of the Marshall Scholarships in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/hrh-presents-marshall-medals-senate-house-london|title=HRH presents Marshall Medals at Senate House, London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Medals were awarded to a group of distinguished Americans in recognition of their contributions to US-UK relations, including Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] (1959 Marshall Scholar), Dr. [[Ray Dolby]] (1957 Marshall Scholar), [[Thomas L. Friedman]] (1975 Marshall Scholar), and former President of [[Duke University]] [[Nannerl Keohane]] (1961 Marshall Scholar).

The number of scholars was increased to 30 in 1973, 40 in 1991, and between 2004-2007 "up to 44". In 2010, the Commission decided to offer a limited number of one year awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/corporateplan2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Foreign Office announced that 40 scholars had been selected, a 25% increase over the originally planned 32, with Foreign Office Minister [[Alok Sharma]] calling it a demonstration of how "resolute Britain is in its commitment to the special relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-more-scholarships-for-us-students-to-strengthen-links-with-usa|title=UK announces more scholarships for US students to strengthen links with USA|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Marshall Scholarship, it was common for new Scholars to travel together to the UK on an [[ocean liner]], but now Scholars are usually flown together to London from Washington, D.C. following a welcome program with top US and UK government and diplomatic officials.

==Selection, selectivity, and academic destinations==
Prospective applicants must first be endorsed by their universities to apply. The selection process is then coordinated through the eight major British embassy/consulate regions in the United States (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.). Selection committees in each region, consisting of former Scholars and other distinguished individuals, receive university-endorsed applications (including personal statements and essays) which are used to select a short list of candidates for interviews. Each committee then interviews each of the regional finalists prior to making the final decisions on the year's awards. In 2014, 16% of university-endorsed applicants received an interview.&lt;ref name="marshallscholarship2014"&gt;http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/2014_statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the responsibility for selecting the recipients is in the hands of the committees, a few formal guidelines have been outlined in the official selection criteria, most notably:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/fellowships/eligible|title=Who is eligible|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As future leaders, with a lasting understanding of British society, Marshall Scholars will strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American peoples, their governments and their institutions. Marshall Scholars are talented, independent and wide-ranging in their interests, and their time as Scholars will enhance their intellectual and personal growth. Their direct engagement with Britain through its best academic programmes will contribute to their ultimate personal success. In appointing Scholars the selectors will look for distinction of intellect and character as evidenced both by their scholastic attainments and by their other activities and achievements. Preference will be given to candidates who display a potential to make a significant contribution to their own society. Selectors will also look for strong motivation and seriousness of purpose, including the presentation of a specific and realistic academic programme.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Selectivity ===
Between 900 and 1000 students are typically endorsed to apply for the Marshall Scholarship annually, with 979 applying in 2014&lt;ref name="marshallscholarship2014" /&gt; (compared to 857 for the U.S. [[Rhodes Scholarship]],&lt;ref name="jennajohnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/meet-the-2014-rhodes-scholars/2013/11/26/ea276b1a-5600-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc_story.html|title=Meet the 2014 Rhodes Scholars|author=Jenna Johnson|date=26 November 2013|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 924 for the UK [[Fulbright Program]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/united-kingdom|title=Countries|author=|date=|website=us.fulbrightonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;), of whom 3.4% were ultimately selected. In 2015 and 2016, 3.2% and 3.5% of university-endorsed applicants to the Marshall Scholarship were elected.&lt;ref name="marshallscholarship2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/statistics|title=Statistics|website=www.marshallscholarship.org|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marshall selection committees place a strong emphasis on academic achievement and potential, and as such the application requires a minimum GPA of 3.7. Successful applicants, however, typically have much higher GPAs: more than half of applicants have perfect academic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Marshall Scholarship {{!}} Writing Personal Statements Online|url = https://www.e-education.psu.edu/writingpersonalstatementsonline/p5_p7.html|website = www.e-education.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners from [[Harvard University]] have had average GPAs of 3.92,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://cabot.harvard.edu/content/Post-Graduate.docx|title =Harvard Post-Graduate|date =|accessdate =|publisher =Harvard|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141224142940/http://cabot.harvard.edu/content/Post-Graduate.docx|archivedate =2014-12-24|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stanford University]] recommends that applicants have a GPA of 3.8 or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icenter.stanford.edu/orc/Handouts/RM_1_Should_I_Apply.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305184144/https://icenter.stanford.edu/orc/Handouts/RM_1_Should_I_Apply.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, winners of the Rhodes Scholarship from Harvard have had an average GPA of 3.8.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1954 and 2013, 239 of 1818 scholars received their undergraduate degrees from Harvard University (13%), 126 from Princeton, 108 from Yale, 83 from Stanford, and 60 from MIT. The most successful public university is the US Military Academy at West Point, with 34 scholars, followed by the University of California at Berkeley, with 28 scholars. Of the 548 scholars elected between 2000 and 2013, 30 were from Harvard and Stanford (5%), 26 from Princeton, 21 from Yale, and 17 from MIT, the US Military Academy at West Point, and the US Naval Academy.&lt;ref name="marshallscholarshipstats" /&gt;

=== Academic destinations ===
[[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[London School of Economics|LSE]], [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[King's College London|KCL]] and [[Imperial College London|Imperial]] always dominate the list of preferred university selected by both the endorsed and actually interviewed Marshall Scholarship applicants throughout the years 2005 to 2016. With [[The School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] and [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine|LSHTM]] sometimes also being highly preferred.

These 9 institutions almost always tend to form the dominant block of the destination of eventually selected Scholars.&lt;ref name="Marshall Scholarship"&gt;[http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/statistics Statistics 2005 - 2016]. Retrieved on 2016-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Scholars have attended a wide range of universities throughout the UK, many of which are ranked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university_rankings/results/2008/overall_rankings/top_100_universities/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072709/http://www.topuniversities.com/university_rankings/results/2008/overall_rankings/top_100_universities/ |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822124509/http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A%28EN%29.htm |date=2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; among the best in the world.

In 2015, there were 69 Marshall Scholars in residence at British universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/annualreports|title=Annual Reports|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including those who were selected for the classes of 2012, 2013, and 2014. During this time, there were 27 Scholars at [[University of Oxford]], 17 at the [[University of London]] (including 5 each at the [[London School of Economics]] and [[King's College London]], and 1 at [[University College London]]), 13 at the [[University of Cambridge]], and 4 at [[Imperial College London]]. Of these scholars, 46 were studying Arts and Social Sciences while 23 were studying Science, Engineering or Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/62ndannualreportfinal&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other post-graduate scholarships==

The Marshall Scholarship is more selective than the [[Churchill Scholarship]], [[Harry S. Truman Scholarship]], [[Gates Cambridge Scholarship]], UK [[Fulbright Program]] and is approximately as selective as the American [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and the [[Mitchell Scholarship]].

In structure and selection criteria, the Scholarship is most similar to the American [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and [[Fulbright Program]]. Like the Fulbright available for study in the United Kingdom, Marshall Scholars can study at any university in the UK. However, under the Fulbright, applicants compete in separate pools for 43 specified universities of varying selectivity, except for two awards tenable at any university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Countries|url = http://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/united-kingdom|website = us.fulbrightonline.org|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In structure, the Marshall Scholarship is more flexible than the Rhodes Scholarship, in that Marshall Scholars can study at any British university,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; and can also attend a different university each year during a Scholar's tenure. In addition, a limited number of one-year Marshall scholarships are available. Unlike Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars must be American citizens (in comparison, approximately 80 Rhodes Scholarships are given annually to citizens of over a dozen countries). In process, the Marshall Scholarship is approximately as selective as the Rhodes and Mitchell Scholarships; the Marshall is awarded to 3.4% of university-endorsed applicants in 2014,&lt;ref name="marshallscholarship2014" /&gt; compared to 3.7% for the Rhodes in 2014&lt;ref name="jennajohnson" /&gt; and 3.2% for the Mitchell Scholarship in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.us-irelandalliance.org/mitchellscholarship/announcements|title=Annoucements {{!}} The Mitchell Scholarship {{!}} US-Ireland Alliance|website=www.us-irelandalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the selection processes differ in the difficulty with which it is to secure a final round interview: in 2014, 15.9% of university-endorsed applicants for the Marshall Scholarship received a finalist interview,&lt;ref name="marshallscholarship2014" /&gt; compared to 24% of Rhodes applicants&lt;ref name="jennajohnson" /&gt; and 5.4% of Mitchell applicants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.us-irelandalliance.org/mitchellscholarship/announcements|title=Annoucements {{!}} The Mitchell Scholarship {{!}} US-Ireland Alliance|website=www.us-irelandalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

While the selection committees continues to emphasize academic potential, over time "the Marshall program has become more Rhodes-like, stating that it is seeking persons who also demonstrate leadership potential." In general, "nearly all Rhodes Scholars are willing to admit that, by and large, the Marshalls are superior if one looks just at grade point averages and other signs of academic achievement," but this is a point of both "admiration" and "disdain."&lt;ref name="Schaeper"&gt;Schaeper, Thomas and Kathleen Schaeper. "Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite," 2010. Berghahn Books: New York&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|293}} [[Walter Isaacson]], describing Rhodes Scholars as "fairly intelligent, well-rounded, honest people who could be counted on to be upstanding citizens," has said that "the real geniuses...were the Marshall Scholars," perhaps because of the expectation that Rhodes Scholars be "all-rounders." In practice, the Marshall and Rhodes have engaged an "informal rivalry," but in career trajectory after the completion of their fellowships, "the line between [the fellowships] is not so evident," with scholars pursuing similar fields with similar success. In general, a higher percentage of Marshall Scholars "go on to careers in academe and research, whereas Rhodes Scholars are more evenly scattered through the full range of professional occupations."&lt;ref name="Schaeper"/&gt;{{rp|357}}

==Association of Marshall Scholars==
The Association of Marshall Scholars (AMS) was formed in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marshallscholars.org/about/history/|title=History and Mission of the Association of Marshall Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[charitable organization]] to

* publicize the Marshall Scholarship Program in the United States and to provide information on British educational institutions in general
* aid in the selection of future Marshall Scholars
* maintain contact among Marshall Scholars and Marshall Scholar Alumni
* sponsor programs that would further the charitable and educational aims of the Marshall Scholarship Program.

The organization has been led by several notable board and advisory members, including [[Kathleen Sullivan]], [[Andrew Klaber]], [[Tianhui Michael Li]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Nannerl Keohane]], [[Peter Orszag]], and [[Harold Koh]], [[Roger Tsien]], [[Daniel Yergin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marshallscholars.org/about/leadership/|title=Board of Directors for the Association of Marshall Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Wigman''' (born '''Karoline Sophie Marie Wiegmann'''; 13 November 1886&amp;nbsp;– 18 September 1973) was a German [[dancer]], [[choreography|choreographer]], notable as the pioneer of [[expressionist dance]], [[dance therapy]], and movement training without [[pointe shoes]]. She is considered one of the most important figures in the history of [[modern dance]].&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Metzger (2007), ''Berlin in the Twenties: Art and Culture 1918-33'', London, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; She became one of the most iconic figures of [[Weimar culture|Weimar German culture]] and her work was hailed for bringing the deepest of [[existential]] experiences to the stage.

==Life==
[[File:Ernst Ludwig Kirchner - Die Tanzende Mary Wigman - 1933.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Mary Wigman dancing by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]]]
Karoline Sophie Marie Wiegmann was born in [[Hanover]], Germany. She came to dance comparatively late after seeing three students of [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze|Émile Jaques-Dalcroze,]] who aimed to approach music through movement using three equally-important elements: [[solfège]], [[improvisation]] and his own system of movements, [[eurhythmics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mead, V. H. (1996). "More than Mere Movement – Dalcroze Eurhythmics." ''Music Educators Journal'', 82(4), 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Wigman enrolled in the Jaques-Dalcroze's school in Dresden in 1911. Another key early experience was a solo concert by [[Grete Wiesenthal]].&lt;ref name="Kirstein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirstein|first=Lincoln|authorlink=Lincoln Kirstein|title=Dance|edition=Paperback|year= 1977|publisher=Dance Horizons|location=New York|isbn=0-87127-019-6|chapter=The Contemporary Classical Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jaques-Dalcroze school was far too academically minded, and it overly confined her expression. The school's practice made dance secondary to music, so Wigman decided to take her interests elsewhere. In 1913, she was introduced to [[Rudolf von Laban]] and Courtney Neilson in Ascona, Switzerland. She enrolled in one of Rudolf von Laban's summer courses and was instructed in his technique. &lt;ref&gt; Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman &lt;/ref&gt; Following their lead, she worked upon a technique based in contrasts of movement; expansion and contraction, pulling and pushing. She continued with the Laban school through the Switzerland summer sessions and the Munich winter sessions until 1919 &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman.&lt;/ref&gt; During these years and through the [[First World War]], she worked as Laban's assistant in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Kirstein"/&gt; 

After her departure from the Laban school, she retreated to the mountains of Switzerland to develop her expressionist style. She named her new dance style "New German Dance," using the word new to express the break from traditional classical ballet. She wanted her dance to be an expression of human's desires, passions, and inspirations. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman&lt;/ref&gt; She was deeply interested in the relationship between humans and the cosmos, and she wanted to give life to the individual forces surrounding humans. She wanted to create a technique that did not need codification, but rather, it arose out of visual interpretations of the desires of human being. In her mind, any movement could be considered dance if it is expressing a true feeling. Her technique and choreography often consisted of "sliding, bouncing, vibrating, falling/dropping, and tensions." &lt;ref&gt; Mary Wigman. German Expressionist Dancer and Choreographer. https://www.contemporary-dance.org/mary-wigman.html &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, she suffered a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall, Mary Anne Santos (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oR9-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 Mary Wigman]''. London; New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|9780203098981}}. pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1920, she was offered the post of ballet mistress at the [[Semperoper|Dresden State Opera]], but, after taking up residence in a hotel in Dresden and beginning to teach dance classes while awaiting her appointment, she learned that the position had been awarded to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR9-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Wigman performed her first solo concert in a professional setting in Berlin, Hanover, and Bremen. These concerts were not well received by the public, but she continued to perform. Later that year, she received high praise from audiences in Hamburg, Zurich, and Dresden, and her name became known. By the mid-1920s, her name was associated in Germany with "Ausdruckstanz," which translates to Expressionist Dance. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1920-21,&lt;ref name="TanzArhiv1"&gt;[http://wwwstud.uni-leipzig.de/~jur97hbz/wigman/Describing.htm Prof. Dr. Karl Toepfer, Prof. Dr. Peter Reichel, Dr. Gabriele Postuwka, Frank-Manuel Peter, Dr. Yvonne Hardt, Dr. Thomas Kupsch, Cathleen Bürgelt, Muriel Favre, Heide Lazarus (2003) ''Selection of documents about The Wigman School, Dresden, from the period of 1924 to 1937''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163907/http://wwwstud.uni-leipzig.de/~jur97hbz/wigman/Describing.htm|date=2015-04-02 }}, Deutsches Tanzarchiv, Köln ([[German Dance Archives]], [[Cologne]]), SK Stiftung Kultur (SK Culture Foundation)&lt;/ref&gt; Wigman started her own dance school, which became known as "Dresden Central School" or simply "Mary Wigman-Schule", a centre of new, [[expressionist dance]]. This school became the center of German modern dance. The rivalry and competition between her new school and the old schools of dance in Dresden emerged, especially with the [[Palucca School of Dance]].&lt;ref name="TanzArhiv1"/&gt;  
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P047334, Berlin, Mary Wigman-Studio.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Wigman, dance studio, [[West Berlin]] 1959]] 
Her students and collaborators from Europe included [[Yvonne Georgi]], [[Hanya Holm]], [[Harald Kreutzberg]], [[Gret Palucca]], [[Margarethe Wallmann]], [[Inge Weiss]], and [[Meta Vidmar]] who, in 1930, established the first school of modern dance in [[Slovenia]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} She formed a dance troupe as well, which toured the world beginning in 1923.

Mary Wigman toured the United States in 1930 with her company of dancers, as well as 1931 and 1933. A school was founded by her disciples in [[New York City]] in 1931. Her choreography inspired [[communist]] dance troupes in the 1930s in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;John Martain, "Workers League in Group Dances", ''The New York Times'', 24 December 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work in the United States is credited to her protegee [[Hanya Holm]], and then to Hanya's students [[Alwin Nikolais]] and [[Joanne Woodbury]]. Another student and protegee of Wigman's, Margret Dietz, taught in America from 1953-72. During this time, her style was characterized by critics as "tense, introspective, and somber," yet there was always an element of "radiance found even in her darkest compositions." Other Dresden schools were founded in other areas of Germany, and Hanya Holm even set up one in the United States. Her style of movement and training was even utilized in German public schools. She was officially honored for her accomplishments in the early 1930s by the German government. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman&lt;/ref&gt; 

The "Mary Wigman-Schule" existed from 1920 until 1942. However, when World War II began, the Nazis in Germany viewed her as a leftist, and they considered her dances to be degenerate. The Nazis put an end to her school, but allowed her to teach in Leipzig during the war. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman&lt;/ref&gt; The "Mary Wigman-Schule" continued to operate under Nazi rule in [[World War II]], following that she obey the rule of government and fire all the Jewish dancers from her schools in Germany.

What had been the Mary Wigman-Schule was started again after the war by [[Dore Hoyer]]. Hoyer and the school created a ''Dances for [[Käthe Kollwitz]]'' which they performed in Dresden in 1946.&lt;ref name=partsch&gt;{{cite book|last=Partsch-Bergsohn|first=Isa|title=Modern Dance in Germany and the United States: Crosscurrents and Influences|year=1994|publisher=Harwood Acad. Publ.|location=Chur|isbn=3718655578|page=122|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=3718655578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wigman continued to teach in [[Leipzig]] until 1949. From 1950 until her death in 1973, she taught at her newly opened school in West Berlin, which became a place where modern dancers from all over the world could unite and share ideas. Her last public performance took place in 1953. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Death==
Wigman died on 18 September 1973 in [[Berlin]], aged 86.

Wigman gave her first public performance in [[Munich]] in February 1914, performing two of her own dances, including one called ''Lento'' and the first version of ''Hexentanz'' (Witch Dance),&lt;ref&gt;Newhall (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR9-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 p. 22.]&lt;/ref&gt; which later became one of her most important works.&lt;ref&gt; Levin, Gaby (8 March 2016)[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-1.707303 "The German Choreographer Who Danced Too Close to the Nazis"],  haaretz.com; retrieved 22 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

While recovering from her nervous breakdown, in 1918, Wigman wrote the choreography for her first group composition, ''Die sieben Tänze des Lebens'' (The Seven Dances of Life), which premiered several year later, in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR9-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115–116.]&lt;/ref&gt; After that her career and influence began in earnest.

In 1925 the Italian financier [[Riccardo Gualino]] invited Wigman to [[Turin]] to perform in his private theater and in his newly opened ''Teatro di Torino''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last1=Grau|first1=Andree|last2=Jordan|first2=Stephanie|title=Europe Dancing: Perspectives on Theatre, Dance, and Cultural Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv9GBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=26 July 2015|page=107 |date=1 June 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-69653-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She had several years' success on the concert stage.

Wigman's dances were often accompanied by [[world music]] and non-Western instrumentation, such as [[Fife (musical instrument)|fifes]] and primarily percussion, [[bell (instrument)|bells]], including the [[gongs]] and [[drum]]s from [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Africa]], and [[China]], contrasted with silence. In later years, she used composers' talents to create music to accompany her choreography, and many choreographers began to use this tactic. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman&lt;/ref&gt; 

She would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal dance. She did not use typical costumes associated with ballet. The subject matters included in her pieces were heavy, such as the death and desperation that was surrounding the war. However, she did not choreograph to represent the happenings of the war; she danced to outwardly convey the feelings that people were experiencing in this hard time. &lt;ref&gt; Mary Wigman. German Expressionist Dancer and Choreographer. https://www.contemporary-dance.org/mary-wigman.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NSW Education Standards Authority''' (NESA) is the state government education board in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It was formed on 1&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;2017 replacing the [[Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/new-education-authority-in-nsw-with-power-to-close-schools-and-run-inspections-20160819-gqwk2d.html|title=A new, beefed-up authority will have power to close schools in NSW|first=Kelsey|last=Munro|date=19 August 2016|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW EDUCATION STANDARDS AUTHORITY FOR NSW|url=http://news.bostes.nsw.edu.au/blog/2016/12/20/new-education-standards-authority-for-nsw|website=bostes.nsw.edu.au|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NESA sets and monitors quality teaching, learning, assessment and school standards. This includes responsibility, across NSW public, Catholic and independent schools, for:
*kindergarten to Year 12 curriculum
*accreditation of teachers and teaching degrees
*the internationally recognised HSC
*school registration and home schooling.

NESA is also the NSW test administration authority for [[NAPLAN]].

NESA is responsible for awarding the secondary school credentials [[Record of School Achievement]] and [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/hsc/about-HSC|title=ABOUT THE HSC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21027">The '''New World Information and Communication Order''' ('''NWICO''' or '''NWIO'''), also known as the '''MacBride Commission''', is a term that was coined in a debate over [[mass media|media]] representations of the [[developing country|developing world]] in [[UNESCO]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term was widely used by the [[MacBride Commission]], a UNESCO panel chaired by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Sean MacBride]], which was charged with creation of a set of recommendations to make global media representation more equitable. The MacBride Commission produced a report titled [[MacBride report|"Many Voices, One World"]], which outlined the main philosophical points of the New World Information Communication Order.

==History==
The fundamental issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time. The American media scholar [[Wilbur Schramm]] noted in 1964 that the flow of news among nations is thin, that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less-developed ones, that important events are ignored and reality is distorted.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur L. Schramm, ''Mass Media and National Development: The Role of Information in the Developing Countries'', [[Stanford University Press]], 1964, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; From a more radical perspective, [[Herbert Schiller]] observed in 1969 that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about radio frequency allocations for [[satellites]] at a key meeting in Geneva in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I Schiller, ''Mass Communications and American Empire'', [[Beacon Press]], 1969, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications. [[Intelsat]] which was set up for international co-operation in satellite communication, was also dominated by the United States. In the 1970s these and other issues were taken up by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and debated within the [[United Nations]] and UNESCO.

&lt;blockquote&gt;NWICO grew out of the [[New International Economic Order]] of 1974. From 1976-1978, the New World Information and Communication Order was generally called the shorter '''New World Information Order''' or the '''New International Information Order'''.

The start of this discussion is the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) as associated with the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) starting from the early 1970s.

Mass media concerns began with the meeting of non-aligned nations in [[Algiers]], 1973; again in [[Tunis]] 1976, and later in 1976 at the [[New Delhi]] Ministerial Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]].

The 'new order' plan was textually formulated by Tunisia's Information Minister [[Mustapha Masmoudi]]. Masmoudi submitted working paper No. 31 to the MacBride Commission. These proposals of 1978 were titled the 'Mass Media Declaration.' The MacBride Commission at the time was a 16-member body created by UNESCO to study communication issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/nwico.html The Grenada Revolution Online: NWICO - New World Information and Communication Order]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among those involved in the movement were the Latin American [[Institute for the Study of Transnationals]] (ILET). One of its co-founders, [[Juan Somavia]] was a member of the MacBride Commission. Another important voice was [[Mustapha Masmoudi]], the Information Minister for [[Tunisia]]. In a Canadian radio program in 1983, Tom McPhail describes how the issues were pressed within UNESCO in the mid-1970s when the United States withheld funding to punish the organization for excluding Israel from a regional group of UNESCO. Some [[OPEC]] countries and a few socialist countries made up the amount of money and were able to get senior positions within UNESCO. NWICO issues were then advanced at an important meeting in 1976 held in [[Costa Rica]].

The only woman member of the Commission was [[Betty Zimmerman]], representing Canada because of the illness of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who died in 1980. The movement was kept alive through the 1980s by meetings of the MacBride Round Table on Communication, even though by then the leadership of UNESCO distanced itself from its ideas.

The UNESCO [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|Convention on Cultural Diversity]] of 2005 puts into effect some of the goals of NWICO, especially with regard to the unbalanced global flow of mass media. However, this convention was not supported by the United States, and it does not appear to be as robust as [[World Trade Organization]] agreements that support global trade in mass media and information.

==Issues==
A wide range of issues were raised as part of NWICO discussions. Some of these involved long-standing issues of media coverage of the developing world and unbalanced flows of media influence. But other issues involved new technologies with important military and commercial uses. The developing world was likely to be marginalized by [[satellite]] and [[computer]] technologies. The issues included:

* News reporting on the developing world that reflects the priorities of [[news agencies]] in [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]]. Reporting of natural disasters and military coups rather than the fundamental realities. At the time four major news agencies controlled over 80% of [[global news flow]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* An unbalanced flow of mass media from the developed world (especially the United States) to the underdeveloped countries. Everyone watches American movies and television shows.
* [[Advertising agencies]] in the developed world have indirect but significant effects on mass media in the developing countries. Some observers also judged the messages of these ads to be inappropriate for the Third World.
* An unfair division of the [[radio spectrum]]. A small number of developed countries controlled almost 90% of the radio spectrum. Much of this was for military use.
* There were similar concerns about the allocation of the [[geostationary orbit]] (parking spots in space) for satellites. At the time only a small number of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later. This might mean eventually getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate.
* Satellite broadcasting of television signals into [[Third World]] countries without prior permission was widely perceived as a threat to national sovereignty. The UN voted in the early 1970s against such broadcasts.
* Use of satellites to collect information on crops and natural resources in the Third World at a time when most developing countries lacked the capacity to analyze this data.
* At the time most mainframe computers were located in the United States and there were concerns about the location of databases (such as airline reservations) and the difficulty of developing countries catching up with the US lead in computers.
* The protection of journalists from violence was raised as an issue for discussion. For example, journalists were targeted by various military dictatorships in Latin America in the 1970s. As part of NWICO debates there were suggestions for study on how to protect journalists and even to discipline journalists who broke "generally recognized ethical standards". However, the MacBride Commission specifically came out against the idea of licensing journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dV-oviiw7dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Many Voices, One World''], Paris 1984, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of the United States==
The United States was hostile to NWICO. According to some analysts, the United States saw these issues simply as barriers to the free flow of communication and to the interests of American media corporations. It disagreed with the MacBride report at points where it questioned the role of the private sector in communications. It viewed the NWICO as dangerous to freedom of the press by ultimately putting an organization run by governments at the head of controlling global media, potentially allowing for censorship on a large scale. From another perspective, the MacBride Commission recommendations requiring the licensing of journalists amounted to prior censorship and ran directly counter to basic US law on the freedom of expression.

There were also accusations of corruption at the highest level of [[UNESCO]] leadership in Paris.  The US eventually withdrew its membership in UNESCO (as did the United Kingdom and Singapore) at the end of 1984. The matter was complicated by debates within UNESCO about [[Israel]]'s archaeological work in the city of [[Jerusalem]], and about the [[Apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The United States rejoined in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2003/01/01/unesco-welcomes-back-usa/ |title=UNESCO welcomes back U.S.A. |author=Henrikas Yushkiavitshus |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124062617/http://globaljournalist.org/stories/2003/01/01/unesco-welcomes-back-usa/ |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The debate on the NWICO that started in the 1970s reflected criticism about non-equitable [[access to information]] and [[media imperialism]]. The NWICO saw the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] back out of UNESCO until 1997 for the UK and 2003 for the US. In 1990-2000, a switch occurred globally, carried by the Internet that contributed to bring more equity to the available content. This was supported by the extension of media powers to [[Developing country|developing countries]] such as [[Mexico]], [[Korea]], [[Kenya]] and [[Nigeria]]; by the adoption of protectionist measures in regards to the free market by western countries like [[Canada]] and [[France]]; and with the rise of satellite broadcasting as a transnational means for non-western countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Expressing the changes.

=== Windhoek Declaration ===
{{Main|Windhoek Declaration}}
This tendency has reached its peak in the 1991 [[Windhoek Declaration]]. The Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press is a statement of [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] principles by African newspaper journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Why the World Became concerned with Journalistic Safety", The Assault on Journalism|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Assault-on-Journalism.pdf|pages=33-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; African diplomats in [[Paris]] (UNESCO), [[Geneva]] ([[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]]) and [[New York City|New York]]’s (UN General Assembly) commitment has been crucial to the success of the Windhoek process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media in Africa: 20 years after the Windhoek Declaration on Press Freedom|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=Windhoek: Media Institute of Southern Africa|year=2011|isbn=|location=http://genderlinks.org.za/wp-content/uploads/imported/articles/attachments/14393_mia.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO endorsed the Windhoek Declaration and United Nations General Assembly recognized the 3 May, date of the Declaration, as “[[World Press Freedom Day]]”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Windhoek Declaration has had other significant impacts in the media field. UNESCO adopted the Windhoek framework concerning [[media development]], characterizing it by freedom, [[Media pluralism|pluralism]] and [[Media Independence|independence]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B3254AA_0_403&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Windhoek Declaration is implemented through the Media Development Indicators (MDIs) framework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Development Indicators: Framework for Assessing Media Development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2008|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001631/163102e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] Intergovernmental Council in 2006&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining Indicators of Media Development.

Resonating with the NWICO, the MDIs help assessing the priority areas for media development that are the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism, the development of [[community media]] and of human resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) ===
{{Main|International Programme for the Development of Communication}}
As a result of the “[[MacBride report|Many Voices, One World]]” 1980 report UNESCO’s General Conference launched the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) the same year in [[Belgrade]]. The Programme was adopted by 39 Member States and aimed at strengthening the development of [[mass media]] in developing countries. Its mandate since 2003 is “... to contribute to [[sustainable development]], democracy and [[good governance]] by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.”&lt;ref&gt;Amendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32, adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Safety of journalists ===
{{Main|Safety of journalists}}
Threats on [[Journalist|journalists]] are one of the major issues blocking media development. Since 2008, UNESCO Member States submit information on the status of the judicial inquiries conducted on each of the journalists killings condemned by the Organization. This information is included in a public report submitted every two years to the IPDC Council by the Director-General and is basis to the Programme's follow-up to killings of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;The IPDC web page: https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives

The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issues of Impunity: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Technological developments ===
{{Main|Access to information}}
Technological developments have direct effects on access to information and on [[privacy]]. Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. According to [[Guy Berger]], “access to digital means of communication, even within the limits established by platform owners, is unprecedented”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There has been a signiﬁcant increase in access to the Internet, which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, issues remain such as the [[digital divide]], the gender divide and the security argument. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;FALLING THROUGH THE NET:   A Survey of the "Have Nots" in Rural and Urban America: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html

National Telecommunications and Information Administration: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities between men and women in navigating the tools used for access to information: it’s the gender divide.&lt;ref&gt;Anja Kovac (2017), ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India, Available at: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/

Website: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/&lt;/ref&gt; With the evolution of the digital age, application of [[freedom of speech]] and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Schultz|first=Wolfgang|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The increasing access to and reliance on [[digital media]] to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to [[Tracking system|track]] individuals’ behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of [[Europe]], new [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] have enabled a greater degree of [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens’ data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of [[human rights]], the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An '''open-source curriculum''' ('''OSC''') is an online instructional resource that can be freely used, distributed and modified. OSC is based on the [[open-source]] practice of creating products or [[software]] that opens up access to source materials or codes.  Applied to education, this process invites feedback and participation from developers, educators, government officials, students and parents and empowers them to exchange ideas, improve best practices and create world-class curricula.  These "development" communities can form ad-hoc, within the same subject area or around a common student need, and allow for a variety of editing and workflow structures.

==Examples==

Learning objectives are clearly identified, and learning activities and instructional sequences and assessments are developed and offered to support the attainment of the objectives. However, all users (from students to educators) are empowered to add, delete, and modify the learning activities, resources and generally contribute to the learning environment. In short, each user contributes to the repository and is able to select curricula based on individual interests.&lt;ref name="wikiversity"/&gt;

The [http://wiki.bssd.org Open Content Curriculum Project] was initiated with MediaWiki software in 2005, and offers a standards-based K-12 curriculum that is collaboratively edited, contains teacher- and student-created resources, assessment rubrics, lesson plans, and instructional resources. All 10,500 pages of content, and 4,240 file uploads are Creative Commons licensed, and the system is used daily by the [[Bering Strait School District]], an Alaska school district. The project welcomes use and active contributions by outside teachers, students and other interested parties. There are currently 2,500 registered users in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sara Bernard|title=Teachers and Students Create Their Own Curriculum in Alaska|publisher= Mind Shift|url=http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2010/11/teachers-and-students-create-their-own-curriculum-in-alaska/|accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pamela Harrison''' (28 November 1915 &amp;ndash; 28 August 1990) was an English pianist, music teacher and composer.

==Biography==
Pamela Harrison was born in [[Orpington, England]], and studied with [[Gordon Jacob]] and [[Arthur Benjamin]] at the [[Royal College of Music]] in London. During [[World War II]], she worked as a school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=pamela+harrison+composer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zIfxUK3-Dovc8ASIqoHYAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pamela%20harrison%20composer&amp;f=false|title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|page=210|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison's work was influenced by composers including [[E.J. Moeran]], [[Arnold Bax]] and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]], and French music. She made her debut as a composer with ''String Quartet'' in 1944 at the [[National Gallery]] concerts. She went on to produce a variety of music, including chamber, orchestral and vocal music, with settings including [[Baudelaire]], [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]], [[Ernest Dowson|Dowson]] and [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]]. Her work for small orchestra, ''A Suite for Timothy'', was composed for the first birthday of her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pamela Harrison|url=http://www.naxos.com/person/Pamela_Harrison/18736.htm|publisher=Naxos|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Harrison died in a car accident in [[Firle]], [[East Sussex]].

'''Project MKUltra''', also called the '''CIA mind control program''', is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]—and which were, at times, illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/09/one-shocking-cia-programs-time-project-mkultra/|title=One of the Most Shocking CIA Programs of All Time: Project MKUltra|date=2013-09-23|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}} Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through [[mind control]]. The project was organized through the [[Office of Scientific Intelligence]] of the CIA and coordinated with the [[U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet4/trnsct04.txt Advisory on Human Radiation Experiments, July 5, 1994, National Security Archives, retrieved January 16, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713145805/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet4/trnsct04.txt |date=July 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967, and recorded to be halted in 1973.

Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the [[Church Committee]] of the [[United States Congress]] and [[Gerald Ford]]'s [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States]]. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] ordered all MKUltra files to be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms's destruction order.&lt;ref name="Cia"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=An Interview with Richard Helms | date= 2007-05-08 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol44no4/html/v44i4a07p_0021.htm | publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra which led to Senate hearings later that year.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mk1977&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Private Institutions Used In C.I.A Effort To Control Behavior. 25-Year, $25 Million Program.

==Background==
[[File:Mkultra-lsd-doc.jpg|thumb|[[Sidney Gottlieb]] approved of an MKUltra sub-project on LSD in this June 9, 1953 letter.]]

The project's intentionally obscure [[CIA cryptonym]] is made up of the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''MK'', meaning that the project was sponsored by the agency's [[Technical Services Staff]], followed by the word [[Ultra]] which had previously been used to designate the most secret classification of [[World War II]] intelligence. Other related cryptonyms include [[Project MKNAOMI]] and Project MKDELTA.

The project was headed by [[Sidney Gottlieb]] but began on the order of CIA director [[Allen Welsh Dulles]] on April 13, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Church Committee; [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book1/html/ChurchB1_0199b.htm p. 390] "MKUltra was approved by the DCI &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Director of Central Intelligence] on April 13, 1953"&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]], and [[North Korea]]n use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html |title=Chapter 3, part 4: Supreme Court Dissents Invoke the Nuremberg Code: CIA and DOD Human Subjects Research Scandals |work=Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments Final Report |accessdate=August 24, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109061412/http://www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html |archivedate=November 9, 2004 |df= }} "MKUltra, began in 1950 and was motivated largely in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean uses of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea."&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives, and they were interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders with such techniques&lt;ref&gt;Church Committee; [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book1/html/ChurchB1_0200a.htm p. 391] "A special procedure, designated MKDELTA, was established to govern the use of MKUltra materials abroad. Such materials were used on a number of occasions."&lt;/ref&gt; and invented several schemes to drug [[Fidel Castro]]. They often conducted experiments without the subjects' knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;Church Committee; "The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]], concluded that '[p]rior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations but were unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;

The project attempted to produce a perfect [[truth drug]] for interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the [[Cold War]], and to explore other possibilities of mind control. Subproject 54 was another MKUltra effort and was the Navy's top secret "Perfect Concussion" program, which was supposed to use sub-aural frequency blasts to erase memory. However, the program was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/e1950/mkultra/Hearing05.htm |title=Retrieved 25 April 2008 |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620105003/http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing05.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most MKUltra records were destroyed in 1973 by order of CIA director [[Richard Helms]], so it has been difficult for investigators to gain a complete understanding of more than 150 funded research sub-projects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs.&lt;ref name=Supremecourt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html |title=Chapter 3, part 4: Supreme Court Dissents Invoke the Nuremberg Code: CIA and DOD Human Subjects Research Scandals |work=Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments Final Report |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331150116/http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html |archivedate=March 31, 2013 }} (identical sentence) "Because most of the MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 ... MK-ULTRA and the related CIA programs."&lt;/ref&gt;

The project began during a period of what Rupert Cornwell described as "paranoia" at the CIA, when the U.S. had lost its nuclear monopoly and fear of Communism was at its height.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Sidney Gottlieb |author=Rupert Cornwell |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sidney-gottlieb-1080920.html |newspaper=The Independent (London) |date=March 16, 1999 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA counter-intelligence chief [[James Jesus Angleton]] believed that a mole had penetrated the organization at the highest levels.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; The agency poured millions of dollars into studies examining methods of influencing and controlling the mind and of enhancing their ability to extract information from resistant subjects during interrogation.&lt;ref name="question-torture"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCoy|first=Alfred|title=A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation from the Cold War to the War on Terror|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|year=2006|pages=8, 22, 30 |isbn=0-8050-8041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shock-doctrine"&gt;{{cite book| last=Klein| first=Naomi | title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism | publisher = Picador | location = New York | year = 2007 | pages=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_h0PSD2wiQC&amp;pg=PA47| isbn = 0-312-42799-9| authorlink = Naomi Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians assert that one goal of MKUltra and related CIA projects was to create a "[[The Manchurian Candidate|Manchurian Candidate]]" subject through mind control techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Ranelagh  | first = John  | title = The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA  | publisher = Sceptre  |date=March 1988  | pages = 208–10    | isbn = 0-340-41230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alfred McCoy has claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of "ridiculous" programs so that the public would not look at the primary goal of the research, which was developing effective methods of interrogation.&lt;ref name="question-torture"/&gt;

One 1955 MKUltra document gives an indication of the size and range of the effort.

In 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program. The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN/CHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971.&lt;ref name= 1977Senate /&gt;  The project was a joint project between The U.S. Army Chemical Corps and the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents with a focus on [[incapacitating agent]]s.

===LSD===
Early CIA efforts focused on [[LSD-25]], which later came to dominate many of MKUltra's programs.&lt;ref name=auto4&gt;[http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html Hss.doe.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331150116/http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html |date=2013-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA wanted to know if they could make Soviet spies defect against their will and whether the Soviets could do the same to the CIA's own operatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks4.htm|title=The Search for the Manchurian Candidate - Chapter 4|first=John|last=Marks|website=www.druglibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Project MKUltra got underway in April 1953, experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts, and sex workers&amp;mdash;"people who could not fight back," as one agency officer put it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite news |title=Sidney Gottlieb, 80, Dies; Took LSD to C.I.A. |author=Tim Weiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/10/us/sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-to-cia.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=10 Mar 1999 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, they administered LSD to a mental patient in Kentucky for 174 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; They also administered LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and members of the general public to study their reactions. LSD and other drugs were often administered without the subject's knowledge or [[informed consent]], a violation of the [[Nuremberg Code]] the U.S. had agreed to follow after World War II. The aim of this was to find drugs which would bring out deep confessions or wipe a subject's mind clean and program him or her as "a robot agent."&lt;ref name="rappoport"&gt;Rappoport, J. (1995). "CIA Experiments With Mind Control on Children". ''Perceptions Magazine'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Operation Midnight Climax]], the CIA set up several [[brothel]]s within agency safehouses in San Francisco, California, to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with [[one-way mirror]]s, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate  | publisher = Times Books  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6 | pages = 106–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. They told subjects they would extend their "trips" if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people under this interrogation were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this.&lt;ref name="rappoport"/&gt; [[Heroin]] addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the invitation of Stanford psychology graduate student Vik Lovell, an acquaintance of [[Richard Alpert]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Ken Kesey]] volunteered to take part in what turned out to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-financed study under the aegis of MKULTRA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/23/the-legacy-of-the-cias-secret-lsd-experiments-on-america/|title=The Legacy of the CIA's Secret LSD Experiments on America|first=Maia|last=Szalavitz|publisher=|via=healthland.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] Veterans' Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloalto.va.gov/locations/menlopark.asp|title=Menlo Park Division |author=VA Palo Alto Health Care System|work=va.gov|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefix.com/cloak-and-dropper-twisted-history-cia-and-lsd?page=all|title=Cloak and Dropper—The Twisted History of the CIA and LSD - The Fix|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked as a night aide.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edward C. "Ken Kesey." Critical Survey of Long Fiction, Second Revised Edition (2000): EBSCO. Web. Nov 10. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The project studied the effects of [[Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants|psychoactive drugs]], particularly [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], [[mescaline]], [[cocaine]], [[alpha-methyltryptamine|aMT]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] on people.&lt;ref name="oregonianobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=All times a great artist, Ken Kesey is dead at age 66|last=Baker|first=Jeff|date=November 11, 2001|work=The Oregonian|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of Security used LSD in interrogations but Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who directed MKUltra, had other ideas; he thought it could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed one could give it to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in "normal" settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, such as an operative who received the drug in his morning coffee, became psychotic and ran across Washington, seeing a monster in every car passing him. The experiments continued even after [[Frank Olson|Dr. Frank Olson]], an Army scientist who had not taken LSD before, went into deep depression after a surprise trip and later fell from a thirteenth story window.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee, M. A., Shlain, B. (1985). ''Acid Dreams, the Complete Social History of LSD: the CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond''. Grove Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subjects' participation was consensual, and in these cases they appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case, seven volunteers in [[Kentucky]] were given LSD for seventy-seven consecutive days.&lt;ref&gt;NPR Fresh Air. June 28, 2007 and Tim Weiner, ''The Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA''.&lt;/ref&gt;

MKUltra's researchers later dismissed LSD as too unpredictable in its results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c011.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020131081305/http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c011.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-01-31 |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave up on the notion LSD was "the secret that was going to unlock the universe," but it still had a place in the cloak-and-dagger arsenal. However, by 1962 the CIA and the army developed a series of [[superhallucinogen]]s such as the highly touted [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]], which was thought to hold greater promise as a mind control weapon. This resulted in the withdrawal of support by many academics and private researchers, and LSD research became less of a priority altogether.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

===Other drugs===
Another technique investigated was the [[intravenous]] administration of a [[barbiturate]] into one arm and an [[amphetamine]] into the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate  | publisher = Times Books  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6 | pages = 40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released. The person would begin babbling incoherently, and it was sometimes possible to ask questions and get useful answers.

Other experiments involved [[heroin]], [[morphine]], [[temazepam]] (used under code name MKSEARCH), [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], and [[Sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate | publisher = Times Books. chapters 3 and 7  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypnosis===
Declassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied [[hypnosis]] in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included: the creation of "hypnotically induced [[anxiety|anxieties]]," "hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter," studying hypnosis and [[polygraph]] examinations, "hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects," and studying "relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c078.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020428104652/http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c078.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-04-28 |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted experiments with drug induced hypnosis and with [[anterograde amnesia|anterograde]] and [[retrograde amnesia]] while under the influence of such drugs.

==Experiments on Canadians==
[[File:Donald Ewen Cameron canmedaj01237-0046-a.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Donald Ewen Cameron c.1967]]
They exported experiments to Canada when the CIA recruited British psychiatrist [[Donald Ewen Cameron]], creator of the "[[psychic driving]]" concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from [[Albany, New York]], to [[Montreal]] every week to work at the [[Allan Memorial Institute]] of [[McGill University]] and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (which would be $603,580 in today's currency, adjusting for inflation) to carry MKUltra experiments there, the [[Montreal experiments]]. These research funds were sent to Dr. Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate  | publisher = Times Books  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6 | pages = 141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as [[electroconvulsive therapy]] at thirty to forty times the normal power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing [[tape loop]]s of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were often carried on patients who entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate  | publisher = Times Books  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6 | pages = 140–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatments resulted in victims' [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[amnesia]], forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ect.org/dr-camerons-casualties/ |title=Dr. Cameron's Casualties |accessdate=2007-09-09 |last=Turbide |first=Diane |date=1997-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|sexually abused]], in at least one case by several men.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} One of the children claimed that she was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme she said was set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Goliszek, Andrew (2003).

His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist [[William Sargant]] at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Collins  | first = Anne   | title = In the Sleep Room: The Story of CIA Brainwashing Experiments in Canada  | publisher = Key Porter Books  | origyear = 1988| year = 1998  | location = Toronto | pages = 39, 42–43, 133  | isbn = 1-55013-932-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, several of Cameron's former patients sued the CIA for damages, which the Canadian news program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV series)|The Fifth Estate]]'' documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/40-years-of-the-fifth-estate/mk-ultra|title=MK Ultra - Episodes - The Fifth Estate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiences and lawsuit was made into a 1998 television miniseries called ''[[The Sleep Room (1998 film)|The Sleep Room]]''.&lt;ref name="The Sleep Room at IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138104/|title=The Sleep Room|date=31 March 1998|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] as well as president of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American]] and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron was also a member of the [[Nuremberg medical tribunal]] in 1946–47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate  | publisher = Times Books  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6 | page = 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naomi Klein]] argues in her book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing "a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources.' In other words, torture."&lt;ref name = Shock&gt;{{cite book | last = Klein | first = N | authorlink = Naomi Klein | title = The Shock Doctrine | isbn = 0-676-97801-0 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=C0KIy92V58wC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 39–41] | publisher = Metropolitan Books | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. McCoy]] writes "Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron's experiments, building upon [[Donald O. Hebb]]'s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method," which refers to first creating a state of disorientation in the subject, and then second creating a situation of "self-inflicted" discomfort in which the disoriented subject can alleviate their pain by capitulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McCoy | first = Alfred | authorlink = Alfred W.

==Revelation==
[[File:FrankChurch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Frank Church]] headed the Church Committee, an investigation into the practices of the US intelligence agencies.]]
In 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by [[Watergate]], CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] ordered all MKUltra files destroyed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news |title=Mind Control: My Mother, the CIA and LSD |author=Elizabeth Nickson |newspaper=The Observer |date=October 16, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms' purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' alleged that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. That report prompted investigations by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], in the form of the [[Church Committee]], and by a commission known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] that looked into the illegal domestic activities of the CIA, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and intelligence-related agencies of the military.

In the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as LSD and [[mescaline]] and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, [[Frank Olson]] had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973.&lt;ref name="parascope.com"&gt;[http://www.parascope.com/ds/documentslibrary/documents/mkultrahearing/mkultraHearing02.htm Prepared Statement of Admiral Stansfield Turner, Director of Central Intelligence]. ParaScope. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526151923/http://www.parascope.com/ds/documentslibrary/documents/mkultrahearing/mkultraHearing02.htm |date=May 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt;

The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]], concluded that "[p]rior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects". The committee noted that the "experiments sponsored by these researchers [...] call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments."

Following the recommendations of the Church Committee, President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited "experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

[[File:ProjectMKULTRA Senate Report.pdf|thumb|1977 United States Senate report on MKUltra]]
In 1977, during a hearing held by the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], to look further into MKUltra, Admiral [[Stansfield Turner]], then Director of Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set of records, consisting of about 20,000 pages,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that had survived the 1973 destruction orders because they had been incorrectly stored at a records center not usually used for such documents.&lt;ref name="parascope.com"/&gt;  These files dealt with the financing of MKUltra projects and contained few project details, but much more was learned from them than from the Inspector General's 1963 report.

On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an "extensive testing and experimentation" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens "at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign." Several of these tests involved the administration of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to "unwitting subjects in social situations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least one death, the result of the [[defenestration]] of Dr. [[Frank Olson]], was attributed to Olson's being subjected, unaware, to such experimentation, nine days before his death. The CIA itself subsequently acknowledged that these tests had little scientific rationale. The agents conducting the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing01.htm | title = Opening Remarks by Senator Ted Kennedy | date = 1977-08-03 | work = U.S. Senate Select Committee On Intelligence, and Subcommittee On Health And Scientific Research of the Committee On Human Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What did the C.I.A. do to Eric Olson's father?|date=April 1, 2001|author=[[Michael Ignatieff|Ignatieff, Michael]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/01/magazine/01OLSON.html|work=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] news show, ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''. It was learned that not only had the CIA funded [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Dr. Cameron]]'s efforts, but also that the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. Dr. Cameron died on September 8, 1967 after suffering a heart attack while he and his son were mountain climbing. None of Cameron's personal records of his involvement with MKUltra survived, since his family destroyed them after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyonair.com/?s=mkultra |title=HistoryOnAir Podcast 98 - MKUltra |publisher=Historyonair.com |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/stunning-tale-of-brainwashing-the-cia-and-an-unsuspecting-scots-researcher-1-466144 Stunning tale of brainwashing, the CIA and an unsuspecting Scots researcher], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', January 5, 2006.

===1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report===
The U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.

The quote from the study:&lt;ref name="many other unofficial sites"&gt;Quote from [http://www.gulfweb.org/bigdoc/rockrep.cfm#hallucinogens "Is Military Research Hazardous to Veterans Health? Lessons Spanning Half A Century", part F. Hallucinogens] 103rd Congress, 2nd Session-S. Prt. 103-97; Staff Report prepared for the committee on veterans' affairs December 8, 1994 John D. Rockefeller IV, West Virginia, Chairman. Online copy provided by gulfweb.org, which describes itself as "Serving the Gulf War Veteran Community Worldwide Since 1994". (The same document is available from [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22installing+several+telephone+hotlines.+As+of+September+1994%2C+86%22 many other (unofficial) sites], which may or may not be independent.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugs to thousands of "volunteer" soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to LSD, the Army also tested [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|quinuclidinyl benzilate]], a hallucinogen code-named [[3-quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]]. (Note 37) Many of these tests were conducted under the so-called MKULTRA program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Deaths==
Given the CIA's purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, may never be known.&lt;ref name="Supremecourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arts.rpi.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="many other unofficial sites"/&gt;&lt;ref name=albarelli&gt;{{cite book |author=H.

Several known deaths have been associated with Project MKUltra, most notably that of [[Frank Olson]]. Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt;

The Olson family disputes the official version of events.  They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |title=The Olson File |publisher=Frankolsonproject.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010804055955/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |archivedate=2001-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research. Among Olson's concerns were the development of assassination materials used by the CIA, the CIA's use of biological warfare materials in covert operations, experimentation with biological weapons in populated areas, collaboration with former Nazi scientists under [[Operation Paperclip]], LSD mind-control research, and the use of psychoactive drugs during "terminal" interrogations under a program code-named [[Project ARTICHOKE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Statements/FamilyStatement2002.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030211052410/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Statements/FamilyStatement2002.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2003-02-11 | last = Olson | first = E | title = Family Statement on the Murder of Frank Olson | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | date = 2002-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later forensic evidence conflicted with the official version of events; when Olson's body was exhumed in 1994, cranial injuries indicated that Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;Marks 1979: chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The medical examiner termed Olson's death a "homicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Ronson  | first = Jon  | title = The Men Who Stare at Goats  | publisher = [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]  | year = 2004  | location = New York | isbn = 0-330-37548-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, Olson's family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President [[Gerald Ford]] and CIA Director [[William Colby]], though their apologies were limited to informed consent issues concerning Olson's ingestion of LSD.&lt;ref name=albarelli/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/olson_documents.pdf | title = Documents on Cheney Coverup of Olson Assassination | publisher = [[Voltaire Network]] | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 November 2012, the Olson family filed suit against the U.S. federal government for the wrongful death of Frank Olson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCIENTISTS_DEATH_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-11-28-16-47-42|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201232401/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCIENTISTS_DEATH_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-11-28-16-47-42|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-01|title=News from The Associated Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues involving informed consent==
The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.

Previously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of Army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an Army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine—known as the [[Feres doctrine]], after a 1950 Supreme Court case, ''[[Feres v. United States]]''—that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted "incident to service."

In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5–4 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority argued that "a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters." In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects... . [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former [[United States Marshal]], after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ritchie v.

==Classical test theory==
[[Classical test theory]] is an approach to psychometric analysis that has weaker assumptions than item response theory and is more applicable to smaller sample sizes.

=== CITAS ===
CITAS (Classical Item and Test Analysis Spreadsheet) is a free Excel workbook designed to provide scoring and statistical analysis of classroom tests. Item responses (ABCD) and keys are typed or pasted into the workbook, and the output automatically populates; unlike some other programs, CITAS does not require any "running" or experience in psychometric analysis, making it accessible to school teachers and professors.

=== jMetrik ===
jMetrik is free and open source software for conducting a comprehensive psychometric analysis. It was developed by J. Patrick Meyer at the [[University of Virginia]]. Current methods include classical item analysis, differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory, IRT equating, and nonparametric item response theory. The item analysis includes proportion, point biserial, and biserial statistics for all response options. Reliability coefficients include Cronbach's alpha, Guttman's lambda, the Feldt-Gilmer Coefficient, the Feldt-Brennan coefficient, decision consistency indices, the conditional standard error of measurement, and reliability if item deleted. The DIF analysis is based on nonparametric item characteristic curves and the Mantel-Haenszel procedure. DIF effect sizes and ETS DIF classifications are included in the output. Confirmatory factor analysis is limited to the common factor model for congeneric, tau-equivalent, and parallel measures. Fit statistics are reported along with factor loadings and error variances. IRT methods include the Rasch, partial credit, and rating scale models. IRT equating methods include mean/mean, mean/sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord procedures.

jMetrik also include basic descriptive statistics and a graphics facility that produces bar charts, pie chart, histograms, kernel density estimates, and line plots.

jMetrik is a pure Java application that runs on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. jMetrik requires Java 1.6 on the host computer.

=== Iteman ===
Iteman is a commercial program specifically designed for classical test analysis, producing rich text (RTF) reports with graphics, narratives, and embedded tables. It calculates the proportion and point biserial of each item, as well as high/low subgroup proportions, and detailed graphics of item performance. It also calculates typical descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, reliability, and standard error of measurement, for each domain and the overall tests. It is only available from [[Assessment Systems Corporation]].

=== Lertap ===
Lertap (Laboratory of Educational Research Test Analysis Program) is a comprehensive software package for classical test analysis developed for use with [[Microsoft Excel]]. It includes test, item, and option statistics, classification consistency and mastery test analysis, procedures for cheating detection, and extensive graphics (e.g., trace lines for item options, conditional standard errors of measurement, scree plots, boxplots of group differences, histograms, scatterplots).

DIF, differential item functioning, is supported in the Excel 2007, Excel 2010, Excel 2013, and Excel 2016 versions of Lertap. Mantel-Haenszel methods are used; graphs of results are provided.

Users of IRT, item response theory, may make use of four special options: one will produce the data and item control files required by Xcalibre; another sets up an ASCII file for Bilog MG; a third prepares data for processing with SAS, and will write suitable lines of SAS code for use with SAS IRT modules; a fourth interfaces with the Excel version of an R package called "RIRT", allowing users to calibrate items without leaving Excel.

Several sample datasets for use with Lertap and/or other item and test analysis programs are available; these involve both cognitive tests, and affective (or rating) scales. Technical papers related to the application of Lertap are also available.

Lertap was developed by Larry Nelson at [[Curtin University]]. A free one-year license is available for students. More information is available at [http://www.lertap.com www.lertap.com].

Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometrics as well as publications in personality research. For more information, see the personality-project.org/r webpage.

== Item response theory calibration==
[[Item response theory]] (IRT) is a psychometric approach which assumes that the [[probability]] of a certain response is a direct function of an underlying trait or traits. Various functions have been proposed to model this relationship, and the different calibration packages reflect this. Several software packages have been developed for additional analysis such as [[equating]]; they are listed in the next section.

The user can select from five different MCAT item selection procedures (Volume, Kullback-Leibler information, Minimize the error variance of the linear combination, Minimum Angle, and Minimize the error variance of the composite score with the optimized weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Lihua|date=2012-05-17|title=Multidimensional CAT Item Selection Methods for Domain Scores and Composite Scores: Theory and Applications|journal=Psychometrika|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=495–523|doi=10.1007/s11336-012-9265-5|pmid=27519778|issn=0033-3123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two exposure control approaches are possible: the traditional Sympson-Hetter approach and a maximum exposure control approach. It is also possible to implement content constraints using the Priority Index method. Different stopping rules are implemented with fixed-length test and varying-length test. The user specifies true examinee ability, item pools, and item selection procedures, and the program outputs selected items with item responses and ability estimates. Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods can be specified by the user. The examinees’ ability and item pools can also be created from the program by the user specified distributions.

=== IRTEQ ===
IRTEQ is a freeware Windows [[GUI]] application that implements IRT scaling and equating developed by Kyung (Chris) T. Han. It implements IRT scaling/equating methods that are widely used with the “Non-Equivalent Groups Anchor Test” design: Mean/Mean, Mean/Sigma, Robust Mean/Sigma, and TCC methods.&lt;ref&gt;Loyd &amp; Hoover, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marco, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linn, Levine, Hastings, &amp; Wardrop, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haebara, T.

'''Sami Frashëri High School''' (Albanian: "Gjimnazi Sami Frashëri") is a selective entry gymnasium with two campuses located on the same street in the Qendër neighborhood of [[Pristina|Prishtinë]], [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]]. The school is highly regarded for academics. The school is among the oldest in Prishtina and Kosovo, and it holds the name of the writer, philosopher, playwright and prominent figure of the Albanian Renaissance Movement, [[Sami Frashëri]].

==Organization==
The "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium works under the frameworks and curriculum of the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|MEST]] of the Republic of Kosovo, and it is one of the most successful gymnasiums in the Balkan Peninsula. Teaching is offered in Albanian and Turkish, with Albanian being the main teaching language. It is one of the most competitive high schools in Kosovo, with annual applications far exceeding the available spots. The alumni of the gymnasium hold important roles in government offices, teaching roles at Universities, and in the public scene, making the school one of the most successful of its kind.

The gymnasium  has 2 pathways, Social Sciences (Albanian: "Shkenca Shoqerore") located in the former technical school and Natural Sciences (Albanian: "Shkenca Natyrore") located in the original building. The subjects taught are mathematics (Analysis &amp; Algebra), the native language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, informatics (computers), the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education and the social sciences (sociology, ethics or religious education, psychology, politics and economy).

==History==
Founded in the early 1900s as Kosovo's first Albanian language high school.

===Pre 1913: As a Turkish Gymnasium===
"Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium is the first gymnasium teaching in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The school was established at the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, during the Ottoman Empire. Although the majority of students and teachers were Albanian, classes were taught in the Turkish language, because the Ottoman power did not allow Albanian language to be taught.

===1913–1941: Prishtina Gymnasium under Serb rule===
In 1912, after the First Balkan War, Kosovo was brought under Serbian rule, and the first Gymnasium of Prishtina was opened in 1913, although this time, in the Serbian language. The Serbian Gymnasium in Prishtina was functioning with a few interruptions until 1941. During this period, most of the faculty were Serbs, whereas there was a mixture in ethnic groups among the students, but mostly Serb students. Classes were taught in Serbian. During these hard times, a number of Albanian students were able to finish the Gymnasium and were able to finish university in Belgrade, Zagreb and other countries.

===1941–1945: "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium, General School===
In 1941, after Germany and Italy took power over Yugoslavia, Albanians who lived under the Serbian rule, new and better conditions were made for their education. A large part of Kosovo and other Albanian lands, who were under Serbian rule until 1941, joined Albania in an Italian Occupied zone. These places were brought into the jurisdiction of the Albanian government in Tirana. the Ministry of Education, led by Professor Ernest Koliqi, in the Summer of 1941, created a project which sought the expansion of Albanian elementary schools through all Albanian lands, whereas in capital cities, the opening of Albanian high schools.

With this framework, Prishtina opened 1 high school with 2 branches:
1. General (Normal) Branch, similar to the General (Normal) School of Elbasan.
2. Liceale (High School) Branch or Gymnasium.

This mixed school opened with the name "Sami Frashëri" and began functioning in 1941 in the Albanian language and was the first school of its kind in Prishtina and Kosovo

===1945–1955: Real Albanian Gymnasium &amp; Real Serbian Gymnasium===
From 1945 to 1955, the gymnasium functioned in 2 languages, Albanian, with the name Real Albanian Gymnasium and Serbian, with the name Real Serbian Gymnasium

===1955–1990: "Ivo Lola Ribar" Mixed Gymnasium===
From 1955, the Gymnasium was established as a mixed gymnasium with the name "Ivo Lola Ribar" Gymnasium. During this period, there was a lot of discrimination against the Albanians, where they were forced to take many classes in the Serbian language. From 1960, the school began giving classes in the Turkish language, whereas from 1978, the school included the reform, Oriented Learning. After the failure of this reform, the school continued as a classical gymnasium, with 2 pathways lasting 4 years.

===1989–1999: "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium===
From 1990, Albanian students and teachers were forced removal from the school. The gymnasium was continued in the home-school of Mehmet Aliu, where they established the school as "Sami Frashëri"

===1999–2007: After the Kosovo War, "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium===
After the Kosovo War in 1999, the school continued to operate in the original school building, where classes were taught either in the Albanian language or the Turkish language. "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium can be seen as a very old school with many traditions, that has made a huge contribution to the education of Albanians in Kosovo.

===2007 to present: "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium===
The "Sami Frashëri" Gymnasium continues its tradition in many different conditions, but nevertheless the school manages to overcome many different situations as a growing school and among the best gymnasiums in the Balkans.

Today, there are around 107 employees at the school among them, 2 speakers, 1 librarian, 1 secretary, 92 teachers in the Albanian language and 9 teachers in the Turkish language. The school has around 11 maintenance workers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3967">A '''teaching kit''' is a teaching resource developed by a [[museum education]] department with the intention of creating cross-curricular learning.  Such kits often include many resources, such as an educators' guide, a [[CD-ROM]] with works of art and primary sources (letters, maps, period photographs), overhead transparencies, posters, curricula, and step-by-step lesson plans. The projects are founded on the belief that art and material culture can be a valuable lens through which to study a historical moment. 

As N. Elizabeth Schlatter, the author of ''Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices'', explains, the role of museums is to make “a unique contribution to the public by collecting, preserving, and interpreting the things of this world."&lt;ref name="Schlatter"&gt;Schlatter, N. Elizabeth. Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} She goes on to note how the scholar Stephen Weil has said that museums have changed their mission to educating the visitor rather than having a primary mission of object care.&lt;ref name="Schlatter"/&gt;{{rp|33}} Out of this growing trend, Education Departments have become one of the most vital parts of the museum organization.  They seek to bring the knowledge of the museum to the community by more public programs and through programs designed to be used in traditional classroom curricula.  

The [[Phillips Collection]] in [[Washington, DC]], USA, is an example of a museum with a strong program of creating teaching kits.  Their teaching kits focus on works of art and exhibitions at The Phillips Collection.  The education department works with mentor teachers and advisors from schools. As they explain on their website, “arts education is a valuable window on subjects such as history, math, English, English as a second language, and geography.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/education/teaching_kits/index.aspx Teaching kits] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822204134/http://www.phillipscollection.org/education/teaching_kits/index.aspx |date=2009-08-22 }}, [[Phillips Collection]], Washington DC, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]’s Education Department has also created programs, workshops and printed and electronic resources for teachers to integrate art into their daily curricula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/education/er_teacher.asp Teacher information], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in [[New York City, NY]], USA, has an extensive family education program as well. For their recent Georgia O'Keeffe: Abstraction show, family kits with flowers, colored pencils and a gallery guide were given at the coat check desk. Similarly for the 2010 Biennial a family guide is offered .&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitney.org/Education/Families/PlanningFamilyVisit], [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has also contributed to this trend with a program called Picturing America, a set of forty, carefully selected works of art spanning several centuries—all by American painters, sculptors, photographers, and architects. NEH Chairman Bruce Cole said, “Picturing America helps us understand our democracy by bringing us face to face with the people, places, and events that have shaped our country. It provides an innovative way to experience America's history through our nation's art.”  The NEH program includes a resource book, lesson plans, and large, high quality reproductions of these images.  It can be used to enhance the study of American history, social studies, language arts, literature, and civics according to their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20080227.html Archive information], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Tom Lowrie''' (born 15 December 1964) was appointed a Centenary Professor at the [[University of Canberra]], Australia, in 2014. He has an established international research profile in the discipline area of [[mathematics education]].

== Career ==
Lowrie began his teaching career in 1986. He has taught in a number of primary school and university settings (including Australia, Canada, and the United States) over the past twenty years. His positions have included working as a primary school classroom teacher, teaching mathematics education and research method courses to undergraduate and postgraduate students at [[Charles Sturt University]] (CSU), and working with classroom teachers on curriculum frameworks. He received his PhD in 1996 from the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]].

From 2007 to early 2014, Lowrie was Director of the Research Institute for Professional Practice, Learning and Education (RIPPLE),  a strategic research institute at CSU which investigates the nature of professional practice and its impact and influence on industry and other professional stakeholders and communities. As Director, Lowrie coordinated and supported the research activity of key researchers and doctoral students. He also managed the international collaborations of a network of researchers contributing to the understanding and application of knowledge about professional practice.

In 2014, Lowrie was appointed as one of the University of Canberra's Centenary Professors. He works in the Faculty of Education, Science, Technology and Mathematics.

== Research focus ==
Lowrie has an international research profile in the discipline area of [[mathematics education]]. His concentrated and sustained (over almost 20 years) body of work has focused on the extent to which primary-aged students use spatial reasoning and visual imagery to solve mathematics problems and the role and nature of graphics in mathematics assessment. More recently, his research has expanded to include students use of digital tools and dynamic imagery to solve problems. Lowrie received a number of grants from the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC), amongst others.

Lowrie's research has been disseminated in national and international periodicals and conference proceedings. His work has been communicated at conferences in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Korea, China, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Greece, Indonesia, and The Netherlands. He has also been a keynote speaker at several national and international education conferences.

=== Graphical languages in mathematics ===
Two of Lowrie's most well known studies are the ARC-funded projects: Graphical Languages in Mathematics (GLIM) [2008–11]; and Early Primary Graphical Languages in Mathematics (EPGLIM) [2009–11]—undertaken with Professor Carmel Diezmann ([[Queensland University of Technology]], Australia). Together, the research focused on children's understanding of graphics in mathematics, specifically primary students aged 8 to 12 years. The aim of the research was to understand how children learn about general purpose graphical languages that are important in mathematics (such as graphs, diagrams, charts, tables, and maps). In this day and age, it is essential that all children have the skills to interpret the graphical languages that are such a large part of the mathematics curriculum. By monitoring the development of students' knowledge of information graphics, an understanding was formed of how children 'code-break' the different types of graphics that they encounter in their everyday mathematics lessons.

=== Processing mathematics tasks ===
From 2013 to 2015, Lowrie is undertaking a research project funded by the ARC on the processing of mathematics tasks. The project aims to better understand how students process mathematics tasks so the move toward digital assessment can be managed effectively within classrooms to promote assessment for learning.

=== Social and geographic location and its impact on mathematics teaching and learning ===
Lowrie holds an ARC grant (2012–14) with Professor Robyn Jorgensen ([[Griffith University]], Australia), for a large-scale mathematics research project that aims to better understand the factors that impact on student learning in mathematics, specifically teachers' practices in creating strong learning environments. The results of the study will help in understanding how social and geographic location may impact on mathematics teaching and learning.

=== Promoting mathematics engagement and learning opportunities for disadvantaged communities in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia ===
A $3,400,000 research project that aims to advance innovative practices that will build teachers' capacity in mathematics teaching and engage Grade 7-9 students, particularly girls, in mathematics learning in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), Indonesia (the Country's second most disadvantaged province). The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade funded the project, from their Government Partnership for Foreign Development (GPFD) scheme. Other partners include: IKIP Mataram (The Institute of Teacher Training and Education); The Provincial Office of the Ministry of Education Sports and Youth in West Nusa Tenggara (DIKPORA); Institute for Education Quality Assurance (LPMP); and the Provincial Office of Ministry of Religion (DEPAG).

== Significant publications ==
Lowrie has published over 140 scholarly books and book chapters, refereed journal articles, and refereed conference proceedings. His recent publications include:

The '''UC Berkeley College of Chemistry''' is one of 14 schools and colleges at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It houses the departments of [[Chemistry]], [[Chemical engineering|Chemical Engineering]], and [[Chemical Biology]] and occupies six buildings flanking a central plaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley, Department of Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheme.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley, Dept of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[US News and World Report]] has ranked its chemistry and chemical engineering programs first and second in the U.S., respectively, while the 2014 QS World University Rankings has ranked both its chemistry and chemical engineering programs second best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2014/engineering-chemical#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search= QS World University Rankings by Subject 2014 - Engineering - Chemical | Top Universities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its faculty and graduates have won numerous awards, including the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[National Medal of Technology]], the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], as well as thirteen [[Nobel Prizes]].&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; {{As of|2012}}-13, it has 815 undergraduates, 526 graduate students, and 187 postdoctoral fellows.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; 

The Department of Chemistry is one of the largest and most productive in the world, graduating about 80 doctoral students per year&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; while maintaining the world's highest citation-per-faculty score.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It hosts 6 of the top 100 chemists worldwide by citation impact for 2000–2010, tied with [[MIT]] for the most of any institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/misc/Top100Chemists2000-10/ Top 100 Chemists, 2000-2010 - ScienceWatch.com - Thomson Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists affiliated with the department and the nearby [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] are responsible for the discovery of sixteen elements, including [[berkelium]], named after the city, and [[seaborgium]], named after Nobel laureate and former department chair [[Glenn Seaborg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/new-elements-here.html Chemical Elements Discovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

First established in 1872, the college awarded its first Ph.D. in 1885 to [[John Maxson Stillman|John Stillman]], who later founded the chemistry department at [[Stanford University]]. A Division of Chemical Engineering was established in 1946, becoming a department in 1957. The Department of Chemical Engineering changed its name to Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in 2010 to reflect the research focus of its faculty in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheme.berkeley.edu/grad_info/note_from_the_chair.php UC Berkeley, Dept of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering - Graduate Program Info - Note from Chair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
The College offers three undergraduate degrees: chemical engineering, chemistry, and chemical biology.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; Chemistry undergrads in the College of Chemistry also have the option to earn a B.A. in chemistry from the [[UC Berkeley College of Letters and Science|College of Letters and Science]], or to specialize in a materials chemistry concentration. Two double major programs with the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] exist: chemical engineering and materials science and engineering, and chemical engineering and nuclear engineering.

Popular undergraduate courses such as Chem 4A (general chemistry) and Chem 12A (organic chemistry) are taught by College of Chemistry faculty.

Graduate programs include the M.S. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering and Ph.D. in chemistry.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

==Faculty==
As of 2015, the faculty at the College includes 10 members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]], 28 members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and 33 members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. 3 members of the faculty have been awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

==Campus==
The College of Chemistry is located on the east side of the UC Berkeley campus. It includes [[Gilman Hall]], a National Historic Landmark, where plutonium was first identified in 1941. Pimentel Hall is one of the largest lecture halls on campus, and features a revolving stage to allow for setup of chemistry demos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/map/googlemap/|title=Google map - UC Berkeley|last=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the College are linked by a network of underground hallways and laboratories.

'''Vasyl Kyrylovych Avramenko''' ({{lang-uk|Василь Кирилович Авраменко}}; sometimes transcribed as '''Vasile''') (1895&amp;ndash;1981) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] actor, dancer, [[Choreography|choreographer]], [[balletmaster]], [[Theatre director|director]], and [[film producer]], credited with spreading [[Ukrainian dance|Ukrainian folk dance]] across the world. Colourful, energetic, imaginative, and, quite often exasperating, he was an impresario greatly reminiscent of [[The Music Man]].&lt;ref name="Subtelny, Orest. page 65"&gt;Subtelny, Orest. Ukrainians  in North America, An Illustrated History. University of Toronto Press, Toronto 1991, page 172.&lt;/ref&gt; For his unparalleled [[Missionary#Non-religious missionaries|missionary]] zeal and his love of Ukrainian culture, he is considered by many to be the "Father of Ukrainian Dance".&lt;ref name="Martynowych."&gt;Martynowych, Orest T.  The showman and the Ukrainian cause. University of Manitoba Press, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}}

==Early days==
Vasyl Avramenko was born on March 22, 1895 in [[Stebliv]],&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; a [[townlet]] located on the [[Ros' River]] approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kiev]]. Orphaned at a young age, he was forced to wander [[Homelessness|homeless]] as an [[Adolescence|adolescent]], until he eventually headed east, crossing the vast expanse of Imperial Russia towards [[Siberia]], and reunited with his older brothers in [[Vladivostok]], on the coast of the [[Sea of Japan]]. There, Vasyl's eldest brother taught him how to read and write, which enabled Vasyl to gain employment at the [[naval base]]. This position allowed Avramenko to visit several major Asian ports as a crewman aboard [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian naval]] [[Naval ship|vessels]]; such worldly exposure encouraged in him a greater love of learning, and he returned to study with his brother whenever possible, eventually earning the qualifications to become a [[Primary education|primary school]] teacher. It was during this time that Vasyl Avramenko saw a production of [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky|Ivan Kotliarevsky's]] [[operetta]] ''[[Natalka Poltavka]]'' in Vladivostok in 1912, which Avramenko later recounted as having been the first experience of viewing his fellow Ukrainians on stage.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|7}}

After passing his teacher's exams at [[Vladivostok]] men's gymnasium in 1915, [[Russia]] entered [[World War I]] and Avramenko was drafted into the [[Russian Imperial Army]] and assigned to the 4th Heavy Artillery Regiment.  After two months basic training, he was reassigned to the [[Irkutsk]] military school for ensigns, then onto the [[35th Infantry Division (Russian Empire)|35th Siberian Infantry Regiment]] in [[Tyumen]] which advanced from [[Irkutsk]] to [[Bryansk]] and to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]].  Here he was wounded and hospitalized, first in [[Minsk]], then [[Petrograd]], where he visited some of its theaters and became active in a troupe of military actors led by Yasha Vavrak who grasped that Avramenko had a flair for the stage.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Formative Years==
In [[Kiev]], in the summer of 1917, Avramenko attended three of [[Vasyl Verkhovynets]]' rare and irregularly scheduled lectures on [[Ukrainian dance|Ukrainian folk dance]], its choreography and stage performance, including theory and practical demonstrations.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|11}}   
Verkhovynets' theories of Ukrainian dance, which he based on his theatrical training and his extensive research of the village dances of Central Ukraine, would inspire Avramenko to live the life of an artist. During this time, Avramenko took copious notes compiling a vocabulary of Ukrainian dances and dance steps, which he would later develop into his life's work.  In his book, ''Ukrainian National Dances, Music, and Costumes'', Avramenko acknowledged the work of Verkhovynets' and the Ukrainian theater in preserving and elevating the legacy of dance in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5Cf%5Co%5Cfolkdance.htm|title= Folk dance – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avramenko with Mykola Sadowsky.jpg |thumb|left|400 px|Avramenko with dancing school with the great Ukrainian artist Mykola Sadovsky.]]

By spring of 1919, Avramenko was for a short time in [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanyslaviv]], a member of Yosyf Standnyk's theatre before joining Mykola Sadovsky's troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5Cs%5Ca%5Csadovskymykola.htm |title= Mykola Sadovsky – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he was able to apply some of the lessons he had learned in the [[Lysenko music school|Lysenko School of Music and Drama]] in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5Cl%5Cy%5Clysenkomusicanddramaschool.htm|title= Lysenko Music and Drama School– Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fight between the [[Red Army|Bolshevik]] and [[White movement|White Russian Armies]], Avramenko served in the Central Telegraph Administration of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].  When UNR forces retreated west in 1919-20, he remained in Soviet occupied territory and worked with Ukrainian itinerant troupes of actors that continued to tour the region.  He was arrested at this time and interned in [[Kalisz]].&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|13}}

In February 1921, Avramenko established a school of Ukrainian folk dancing in the Kalisz camp, the first of more than 100 schools over the next 20 years across Europe and North America.  He impressed on his pupils that Ukrainian folk dancing could be an art form.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|14}}   
He began with 100 students (everyone from the guards to small children), teaching them the basic steps of Ukrainian dance, eventually teaching whole dances, and finally putting on a celebrated performance May 24.

In the fall of that year he met [[Alexander Koshetz]].  Koshetz remarked: "I was invited to attend a ballet performance by Avramenko's school.  The ballet was marvellous: it was simply impossible to believe that such an exacting and artistic work could be created out of our dance!" &lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|16}} 
Avramenko soon became so successful and popular that he set out on tour with a group of his students through present-day western Ukraine, often presenting demonstrations and workshops in the towns he visited, encouraging others to perform his dances and pass them on to still others. The tour passed through [[Lviv]] several times between 1922 and 1924, while also visiting [[Rivne]], [[Lutsk]], [[Kremenets]], [[Oleksandriia]], [[Mezhirich]], [[Chelm]], [[Brest-Litovsk]], [[Stryi]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanyslaviv]], [[Kolomyia]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Deliatyn]], [[Ternopil]], and [[Drohobych]].

==North America==
December 1925, Avramenko arrived in [[Canada]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], a man with a mission, it being his determination to tour [[North America]] with dancers, singers, and instrumentalists to bring attention to the Ukrainian people and their fight for independence.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|24}}

Eighty-five percent of Ukrainians in Canada at the time lived on the prairies.&lt;ref name="Swyripa."&gt;Makuch, Andrij, ''Ukrainian Canadians and the Wartime Economy'',  in ''Loyalties in Conflict, Ukrainians in Canada During The Great War'', Swyripa, Frances and Thompson, John Herd, editors. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1983, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Avramenko decided to stay in [[Toronto]], and opened his first dance school in North America in St. Mary's Roman Catholic hall, today the [[Factory Theatre]] building.  For fees from five to thirty dollars, he offered a set of lessons for pre-schoolers to grown-ups.  The school inculcated its pupils with Ukrainian pride and identity.  His troupe first performed, the year after his arrival, at the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE) August 30 through September 11 to grandstands filled with up to twenty-five thousand spectators.  When the dancers gave a special performance at the women's pavilion, [[Florence Randal Livesay]] spoke glowingly about Ukrainian folk dancing.  Avaramenko's name now became coupled with that of Koshetz in the Ukrainian-Canadian press.   Articles about him appeared in every major Ukrainian-Canadian newspaper, as well as the English ones.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|29}}

Avramenko arrived in [[Winnipeg]] in January 1927.  His troupe gave their first performance at the Canadian-Ukrainian Institute [[Prosvita]] hall at the corner of Pritchard and Arlington in [[North End, Winnipeg|Winnipeg's North-End]].&lt;ref name="Orest "&gt;Martynowych, Orest T., [https://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/ukrainian_canadian_studies/media/15_The_Canadian_Ukrainian_Institute_Prosvita.pdf The Canadian Ukrainian Institute 'Prosvita']&lt;/ref&gt;  This publicized his arrival, and he opened a school shortly thereafter.  By April 30, Avramenko and 275 of his pupils performed at [[Shea's Amphitheatre|Winnipeg's amphitheatre]], a venue usually reserved for hockey and politics.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name="mhs"&gt;[http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/winnipegamphitheatre.shtml Winnipeg Amphitheatre, Manitoba Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Avramenko and his disciples began to set up schools quickly across the prairies, in [[Saskatoon]], [[Yorkton]], and [[Edmonton]].  Their base of support was a strong Ukrainian-Canadian community.  For example, some 20 Ukrainian public school teachers attended his Edmonton classes, and Avramenko gave them instructions on how to teach dance when they returned to their schools.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|40}}  Avramenko traveled from town to town, teaching the same dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brama.com/news/press/2003/12/031203ukrainiandance_projectgrant.html |title= The Avramenko Fund for the Promotion of Ukrainian Dance in Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was finished teaching in a town, he would assign a leader to continue teaching to the residents. One of these leaders was [[Chester Kuc]], who founded the [[Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheremosh.ca/company/history/|title= The Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company of Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 1928, Avramenko married one of his star dance pupils, Pauline Garbolinsky, from Winnipeg, and soon the couple was living in [[New York City]].  With a network of dance schools across Canada, Avramenko now turned his sites to the United States.   Lacking business acumen, he had debts in excess of three thousand dollars upon leaving Canada.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|51}}

New York at this time was a creative center for drama, song, and dance.  [[Eugene O'Neill]] was having his plays produced.   [[George Gershwin]] was writing musicals here.  [[Martha Graham]] had just opened a school of contemporary dance.  Vasile and Pauline Avramenko lived in rented rooms on 8th Avenue in [[Brooklyn]].  Avramenko set up his school in [[Ukrainian Americans in New York City|Little Ukraine]] in Manhattan, [[Greenwich Village]] to the west of it, and the [[Lower East Side]] with a Ukrainian enclave to the east.  Able to dispense with live music with the arrival of the phonograph and vinyl records, it became easier for him in the 1930s to offer these lessons.  Within a few months he had over 500 pupils attending.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|55}}

Paying dance instructors over widely dispersed areas across [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], as well as for rental spaces for his schools, perpetuated his financial woes.  To clear up these troubles, Avramenko turned to the idea of staging his work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  His successes up to now had been solely in the Ukrainian community.  His first attempt to reach beyond it was at the Star Casino, and was disrupted by a summer storm that hit the city.  His second attempt was at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], with 500 dancers, a chorus of 100 singers, and a folk orchestra, all dressed in Ukrainian costume.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|59}}  The [[New York Post|New York Evening Post]] gave it a rave review, "…excited over the kaleidoscopic ardors of the dance, the richness of the chorus, the congeniality of the audience and the fairly inspiring naturalness of what really amounted to a brilliant Ukrainian folk festival." &lt;ref name="Subtelny, Orest. page 65"/&gt;   The Ukrainian newspapers, like [[Svoboda (newspaper)|''Svoboda'']], saw the performance as a well-attended artistic failure.  In a venue like the Met, where the great operas of the world were performed by the finest singers, the Ukrainian press had expected those values to be reflected in the premiere of a comparable Ukrainian operetta or musical.  Instead, they found themselves seeing more of what they, unlike the larger English community, were already familiar with from Avramenko. His debts increased, and in order to address his finances, he turned to film.

==Movie Producer==
By October 1933, Avramenko was in [[Hollywood]].  Along the way to the west coast, he obtained loans and donations from Ukrainian immigrants in these far-flung communities, only aware of who he was through what they had read, unaware as yet of his inability to handle finances.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|71}}   Avramenko always claimed to have been offered a lucrative contract to dance in the film ''Catherine the Great'' starring [[Marlene Dietrich]], but had refused on the grounds that the dances would be billed as 'Russian' dances.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|72}}

He staged performances at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] of 1933, and borrowed a thousand dollars from his father-in-law to do so.  In 1935, his [[Baltimore]] pupils participated in the [[White House]] [[Egg rolling|Easter Egg Roll]] and he claimed a victory for the Ukrainian cause and published postcards with photos of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] at the event.&lt;ref name="ihrc"/&gt;

===[[Natalka Poltavka]]===

On the road most of the time, leaving behind his wife with their newly born daughter, with little if anything to live on, so that his wife depended on friends to survive, by 1934, his marriage began to fall apart.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|77}}  The [[Great Depression]] made it hard to earn a living running dance schools.  Avramenko made plans to produce a feature film based on the oldest and most popular Ukrainian operetta, [[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|''Natalka Poltavka'']], convinced that it would bring fame and glory to the Ukrainian cause.  He rallied wealthy widows and convinced them that people in their community needed a place to apprentice in film.  The ''Avramenko Film Company'' was established in New York City in 1936.  Having raised enough money, twenty-five thousand dollars, to begin production, fortuitously [[Edgar G. Ulmer]], a real Hollywood film director appeared on the scene.  Ulmer had lost favour in Hollywood after running off with the wife of the nephew of Carl Laemmle Sr., who owned [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]].

Ulmer put together a film crew and rewrote the screenplay.  The musical score was recorded ahead of time at [[Hazard E. Reeves|Reeves Sound Studio]] in New York City.  The set was located on a farm northwest of [[Trenton, New Jersey]].   Ulmer said of Avramenko: "Nothing was impossible for Avramenko… The man was so enthusiastic.  I couldn't say no to him….  He was the spark of everything." &lt;ref name="Ulmer"&gt;Bogdanovich, Peter. "Edgar G. Ulmer: An Interview." Film Culture p. 58-60, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  Without a Hollywood distributor, the film company rented theatres at high cost to show the film.  In the end, though an artistic success, the film left Avramenko in further debt.  Koshetz was particularly critical of the film, finding it offensive and tasteless.  Not surprisingly, his review appeared in ''Svoboda''.  It sounded very much like a personal attack.  No doubt Avramenko's personality had got under Koshetz' skin when they had toured together. Koshetz' criticism was not without merit.  Avramenko, despite his rhetoric to develop a Ukrainian film industry, had brought in people and resources from outside the community in order to make the film.  In fairness though to Avramenko, these resources did not exist in the Ukrainian community at that time.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|92}}  This was the first Ukrainian language film produced in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ukrainians in the United States|last=Halich|first=Wasyl|year=1970|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-405-00552-0|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem|Cossacks in Exile]]===

Unable to raise money in New York due to the financial setback of his last film, he turned to Canada to raise the funds for his next feature film ''Cossacks in Exile''.  In September 22, 1937, Avramenko returned to Winnipeg, and announced the creation of the ''Ukrainian Film Corporation''.   At this distance from New York, audiences had seen and loved his film ''Natalka Poltavka'', but knew nothing about the questionable financial state in which it had left its shareholders, and Avramenko.  Appealing unabashedly to patriotic Ukrainian sentiment, Avramenko sold rights to screen the new film province by province.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|92}}   Rumours circulated that he was using these funds to pay off old debts. Dr. Mykyta Mandryka, the secretary-treasurer of the new company seemed to be the only one to fully appreciate the situation, and wrote a letter to Avramenko. "We really do not understand each other, and this is why: you think it is necessary, above all, to start producing the film with or without money, and you believe things will somehow turn out well.  You live on high hopes and faith in an imminent miracle.  But that is not enough to handle people's money wisely."  Avramenko ignored all advice and continued to ask for donations, borrow money, and sell rights, fundraising the way he had always done.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|103}}

Filming began the first week of May 1938.  It ended November 27 and the director Ulmer was pleased with the final product.  His cheerful mood though turned when he saw advertising for the movie, identifying Avramenko as the "director" or "general production director".  He stormed into the film company's office, clearly having failed to appreciate the size of Avramenko's ego.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|110}}

Again, with Ulmer having directed it, the film received great reviews.  In Winnipeg, filled with civic pride, the critics were unashamedly enthusiastic.  The [[New York Times]] did not even notice that it was a Canadian production, stating that it was "highly agreeable both to the eye and the ear." &lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|113}}   Koshetz did not publish any review of it, but privately was very critical.  With no American or international distributor the film fell victim, like the previous, to being shown city by city at a high cost for theatre rental wherever theatres could be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYa3sUA-qZ0|title= Cossacks in Exile/Запорожець за Дунаєм, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
The remaining years of his life, Avramenko spent hauling around film canisters, showing his films or outright selling them wherever he disembarked. In 1954 he released the documentary film "The Triumph of Ukrainian Dance", consisting primarily of excerpts from documentaries and feature films produced by him during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

In postwar Canada between 1945 and 1947, Avramenko offered Ukrainian folk dancing courses.  One of his students in Winnipeg at this time was [[William Kurelek]], nineteen at the time.  By the mid-1960s folk dance ensembles were reinventing themselves: Rusalka in Winnipeg, Yevshan in Saskatoon, Shumka in Edmonton, as well as the touring ensembles from the Soviet Union, [[P. Virsky Ukrainian National Folk Dance Ensemble|the State Folk Dance Ensemble of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] under [[Pavlo Virsky]].  They were interested in preserving the spirit of the folk dance rather than preserving traditional dance steps.&lt;ref name= Martynowych./&gt;{{rp|132}}  Avramenko's concerts juxtaposed against these dances were simply a bit of nostalgia.

Towards the very end of his life, Avramenko created tribute events, for example "Ukrainian Tribute to Australia", and celebrations of some of his personal triumphs and milestones, and rallied the Ukrainian community around them.  He had many of his former pupils across North America, and around the world, help him with these events, pupils who had been children when first encountering dance lessons with him.  In the end, even the Ukrainian language newspaper ''Svoboda'' and he reconciled, as he lived out his old age in New York City, and whenever he entered their offices on his birthday, everyone would sing [[Mnohaya lita|Многая літа]].

Avramenko died on May 6, 1981 in New York.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

The '''Volta Conference''' was the name given to each of the [[Academic conference|international conference]]s held in [[Italy]] by the [[Accademia dei Lincei|Royal Academy of Science]] in [[Rome]], and funded by the [[Alessandro Volta Foundation]]. In the [[interwar period]], they covered a number of topics in science and humanities, alternating between the two.

The first conference, held at [[Lake Como]] in 1927, led to the public introduction of the [[uncertainty principle]] by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. The second conference did not take place until 1932; its topic was "Europe", and it was notable for the participation of a number of mainly [[fascism|fascist]] theorizers, along with non-fascists such as the British historian [[Christopher Dawson]]. In 1933 the third conference was on the subject of [[immunology]], and "The Dramatic Theater" in 1934. During this period, the influence of Italian aeronautics was gaining momentum, led by General [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]], an [[aeronautical engineer]] who had become interested in [[ramjet]] engines in 1931, and influenced the selection of "High Velocities in Aviation" for the 1935 meeting. This meeting is notable historically as it introduced a number of topics in [[compressibility]] and also included the first presentation on [[swept wing]]s by [[Adolf Busemann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2114">The core objective of the '''Wilderness Risk Management Conference''' (WRMC) is to offer an outstanding educational experience to help [[adventure travel]] and [[ecotourism]] companies, clubs, and organizations mitigate the risks inherent in exploring, working, teaching, and recreating in wild places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WRMC website|url=http://www.nols.edu/wrmc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WRMC was founded in 1994 by a collaboration of organizations that had a stake in how risk is managed in [[outdoor recreation]] and [[outdoor education]]. The founding group consisted of representatives from [[National Outdoor Leadership School|NOLS]], [[Outward Bound USA]], [[Wilderness Medical Society]], [[Exum Mountain Guides]], [[Association for Experiential Education]], [[National Park Service]], National Safety Network, [[American Alpine Club]], and Outdoor Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 WRMC Proceedings |url=http://www.nols.edu/wrmc/pdf_files/WRMC20thHistory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of WRMC |url=http://www.nols.edu/wrmc/about.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference Topics==

The WRMC covers a variety of topics that fall into a few major categories including: emergency planning and crisis response, field practices, legal considerations, program administration, and staff training and decision making. Additionally, the conference provides structured networking time to meet with other professionals working and managing field programs in the United States, Canada, and internationally.
