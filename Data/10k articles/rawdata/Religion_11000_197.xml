'''''Aconitum ferox''''' (syn. ''A. virorum'') is a member of the monkshood genus [[Aconitum]] of the [[Ranunculaceae]]. The common name by which it is most often known in English is ''Indian Aconite''. The plant grows abundantly  at [[Sandakphu]], which is the highest point of the [[Darjeeling|Darjeeling Hills]] in the [[India]]n State of [[West Bengal]].

A tuberous-rooted, herbaceous [[perennial]] reaching 1.0 metre tall by 0.5 metres wide and tolerant of many [[soil]] types, ''Aconitum ferox'' forms the principal source of the Indian [[poison]] known variously  as ''bikh'', ''bish'', and ''nabee''. It contains large quantities of the extremely toxic [[alkaloid]] [[pseudaconitine]] (also known as nepaline, after [[Nepal]]) and is considered to be the most poisonous plant found in the [[Himalaya]] and one of the most poisonous in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.herbcyclopedia.com/item/aconitum-ferox-the-strongest-poisonous-plant-2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604061053/http://www.herbcyclopedia.com/item/aconitum-ferox-the-strongest-poisonous-plant-2 |archive-date=2016-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of poisoning usually appear 45 minutes to an hour after the consumption of a toxic dose and consist of numbness of the mouth and throat and vomiting. Respiration slows and blood pressure synchronously falls to within 30-40 beats per minute and consciousness characteristically remains unclouded until the end, which consists usually of  death by [[asphyxiation]], although occasionally of death due to [[cardiac arrest]].

==Use as a (potentially lethal) Aghori Entheogen==
[[Aghori]], [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand path]], [[Tantra|tantric]], [[Shaivites]] (devotees of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]]) smoke the dried roots of ''Aconitum ferox'', combined in a mixture with cannabis flowers, in a practice that is part consciousness-expansion by [[entheogen]], part ordeal by poison. Aghoris, no strangers to the use of all manner of dangerous drugs (such as [[Datura metel]]), warn of the extreme danger posed by smoking mixtures containing  aconite, and restrict their use to the most experienced [[adept]]s of their particular school of Shaivism, as being potentially lethal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants : Ethnopharmacology and its Applications'', Rätsch, Christian, pub.

==Lakhvir Singh murder case==

The use of ''A. ferox'' as a criminal poison recently gained notoriety in the U.K. as a result of the murder trial of a Ms. Lakhvir Singh, a [[Sikh]] woman from [[Southall]] (a suburban district of the [[London Borough of Ealing]]). Ms.Singh was found guilty of the [[murder]] of her ex-lover, 'Lucky' [[Murder of Lakhvinder Cheema|Lakhvinder Cheema]] and the [[attempted murder]] of his fiancée, Gurjeet Choongh with a curry spiked with ''bikh'' poison acquired from India. After consuming the poisoned curry, the unfortunate Mr. Cheema began to vomit and over the course of the next hour suffered total [[paralysis]] of all four limbs, [[blindness]], a drastic fall in blood pressure and heart failure, leading to his death within an hour of his admission to hospital. Ms. Choongh was more fortunate, having consumed less of the lethal dish, and later recovered, after having been placed in an [[induced coma]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8444245.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], ''The Golden Age''|300px|right]]
The '''Ages of Man''' are the stages of human existence on the Earth according to [[Greek mythology]] and its subsequent [[Roman mythology|Roman]] interpretation.

Both [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] offered accounts of the successive ages of humanity, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age in which humans enjoyed a nearly divine existence to the current age of the writer, in which humans are beset by innumerable pains and evils. In the two accounts that survive from ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation of the [[human condition]] over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value.

==Hesiod's Five Ages==
[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - The Close of the Silver Age (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|Lucas Cranach the Elder, ''The Silver Age''|thumb|250px|right]]
[[File:Virgil Solis - Iron Age.jpg|[[Virgil Solis]], ''The Iron Age''|thumb|250px|right]]

The first extant account of the successive ages of humanity comes from the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC), in his poem ''[[Works and Days]]'' (lines 109–201). His list is:
* '''Golden Age''' – The [[Golden Age]] is the only age that falls within the rule of [[Cronus]]. Created by the immortals who live on Olympus, these humans were said to live among the gods, and freely mingled with them. Peace and harmony prevailed during this age. Humans did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age but with a youthful appearance and eventually died peacefully. Their spirits live on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in [[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]] (397e) recounts the golden race of men who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean men literally made of gold, but good and noble. He describes these men as [[Daemon (mythology)|daemons]] upon the earth. Since δαίμονες (''daimones'') is derived from δαήμονες (''daēmones'', meaning knowing or wise), they are beneficent, preventing ills, and guardians of mortals.
* '''Silver Age''' – The [[Silver Age]] and every age that follows fall within the rule of Cronus's successor and son, [[Zeus]]. Men in the Silver age lived for one hundred years under the dominion of their mothers. They lived only a short time as grown adults, and spent that time in strife with one another. During this Age men refused to worship the gods and Zeus destroyed them for their [[impiety]]. After death, humans of this age became "blessed spirits" of the underworld.
* '''Bronze Age''' – Men of the Bronze Age were hardened and tough, as war was their purpose and passion. Zeus created these humans out of the ash tree. Their armor was forged of [[bronze]], as were their homes, and tools. The men of this Age were undone by their own violent ways and left no named spirits; instead, they dwell in the "dank house of [[Hades]]". This Age came to an end with the flood of [[Deucalion]].
* '''Heroic Age''' – The [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]] is the one age that does not correspond with any metal. It is also the only age that improves upon the age it follows. It was the heroes of this Age who fought at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Troy]]. This race of humans died and went to [[Elysium]].
* '''Iron Age''' – Hesiod finds himself in the Iron Age. During this age humans live an existence of toil and misery. Children dishonor their parents, brother fights with brother and the social contract between guest and host ([[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]) is forgotten. During this age [[might makes right]], and bad men use lies to be thought good. At the height of this age, humans no longer feel shame or indignation at wrongdoing; babies will be born with gray hair and the gods will have completely forsaken humanity: "there will be no help against evil."

==Ovid's Four Ages==
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Ovid]] (1st century BC&amp;nbsp;– 1st century AD) tells a similar myth of Four Ages in Book 1.89–150 of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. His account is similar to Hesiod's, with the exception that he omits the Heroic Age. Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the '''Golden Age'''. He adds that in this age, men did not yet know the art of navigation and therefore did not explore the larger world, no man had knowledge of any arts but pre agriculture. In the '''Silver Age''', Jupiter introduces the seasons and men consequentially learn the art of agriculture and architecture. In the '''Bronze Age''', Ovid writes, men were prone to warfare, but not impiety. Finally, in the '''Iron Age''', men demarcate nations with boundaries; they learn the arts of navigation and mining; they are warlike, greedy and impious. Truth, modesty and loyalty are nowhere to be found.

==Related usage==
These mythological ages are sometimes associated with historical timelines. In the chronology of [[Saint Jerome]], the Golden Age lasts c. 1710 to 1674 BC, the Silver Age 1674 to 1628 BC, the Bronze Age 1628 to 1472 BC, the Heroic Age 1460 to 1103 BC, while Hesiod's Iron Age was considered as still ongoing by [[Saint Jerome]] in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Jerome |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_01_prefaces.htm |title=St. Jerome, Chronicle (2004-5). Preface of Jerome; Preface of Eusebius |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aristides the Athenian''' (also '''Saint Aristides''' or '''Marcianus Aristides'''; {{lang-el|Ἀριστείδης Μαρκιανός}}) was a 2nd-century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Greeks|Greek]] author who is primarily known as the author of the ''[[Apology of Aristides]]''. His feast day is August 31 in [[Roman Catholicism]] and September 13 in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Theodropolous|first1=Aristides|title=Dr.|url=http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2012/09/the-holy-martyr-aristides-philosopher.html|website=Mystagogy Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
Very little is known of Aristides, except for the introductory information given by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] and [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]. According to their account, Aristides practiced philosophy in Athens, where he lived, prior to and after his conversion to Christianity.  Eusebius writes in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' "Aristides also, a faithful disciple of our religion, has left an Apology of the faith dedicated to [[Hadrian]]."&lt;ref name=Cayre111&gt;{{harvnb|Cayré|1936|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius and Jerome both state that the ''Apology'' was given to Hadrian at the same time that [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]] delivered his own apology. This suggests that Aristides gave his apology during Hadrian's reign (r. 117–138) as emperor of Rome, which supports the theory of Aristides died between the years 133–134 AD. It is also supported by the express language of the ''Apology'' in the Armenian version. It is contradicted only by the second superscription to the Syriac version, which says that the ''Apology'' was given to Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] in the year 140. If this is taken to mean that it was delivered in person by Aristides, it would rule out the dating of Aristides's death in 133-134 AD. It has been suggested that Eusebius was confused by the fact that Antoninus Pius had adopted the name "Hadrianus" (Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius) and believed it was Hadrian to whom the ''Apology'' was given, and further that Jerome had never read the ''Apology'' and copied Eusebius's mistake accidentally.&lt;ref name=Jurgens48&gt;{{harvnb|Jurgens|1970|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But Jerome tells us that the ''Apology'' was extant in his day, and he gives an account of its contents. The testimony of Eusebius and Jerome and the text of the Armenian version are all in favor of its being delivered to Hadrian, probably in circa 124–125 AD.

==Writings==

===The ''Apology of Aristides''===
In 1878, an Armenian fragment of an apology titled ''To Emperor Hadrian Caesar from the Athenian Philosopher Aristides'' was published by the [[Mechitarite|Mechitarists]] of San Lazzaro in Venice from a 10th-century manuscript. The Armenian translation was accepted by most scholars as the long lost ''Apology of Aristides''; however, a few did dispute its authenticity, most notably [[Ernest Renan]]. In 1889, the authenticity of the fragment was confirmed with the discovery of a complete [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the ''Apology'' by British scholar Rendel Harris in the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. With this new discovery, J.A. Robinson was able to show Aristides's work had been in fact extant and edited in the religious book [[Barlaam and Josaphat (book)|''The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat'']] since the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quasten|1950|pp=191–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another fragment of the ''Apology'' containing two portions of original text in Greek was published in 1922 by the [[British Museum]] on papyri.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|1923|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Apology'' of Aristides is the oldest extant Christian apology since only a fragment of the older apology of Quadratus exists.&lt;ref name=Jurgens48/&gt;

In the 1889 Syriac translation, Aristides begins his apology by stating his name, where he is from and that he is delivering it to Antoninus Pius. In the first chapter, he proclaims God exists because the world exists and that God is "eternal, impassible and perfect."&lt;ref name=Cayre111/&gt; In the second chapter, he writes that there are four races of the world; (1) Barbarians, (2) Greeks (includes Egyptians and Chaldeans), (3) Jews, and (4) Christians. He then devotes chapters 3-16 to describing the different groups of people and how they practice religion. The Barbarians (chapters 3-7) worship dead warriors and the elements of the Earth, which he claims are the works of God, therefore they do not know who the true God is.&lt;ref name=Cayre112&gt;{{harvnb|Cayré|1936|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks (chapters 8–13) are next because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...they are wiser than the Barbarians but have erred even more than the Barbarians, in that they have introduced many gods that are made; and some of them they have represented as male and some of them as female; and in such a way that some of their gods were found to be adulterers and murderers, and jealous and envious, and angry and passionate, and murderers of fathers, and thieves and plunderers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1891|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Aristides is calling the Greek gods corrupt, immoral and guilty of being human. He concludes his chapters on the Greeks by commenting on the religious beliefs of the Egyptians, who he claims are the most ignorant people on earth since they did not accept the beliefs of the Greeks or Chaldeans and instead worshiped gods modeled after plants and animals. The Jews (chapter 14) are only commented on in a concise manner. Aristides commends them for their worship of God as the Creator and almighty but claims they have gone "astray" because "their service is to angels and not to God, in that they observe sabbaths and new moons and the passover and the great fast, and the fast, and circumcision, and cleanness of meats: which things not even thus have they perfectly observed." In chapters 15 and 16, Aristides describes the commandments of God and claims Christians "walk in all humility and kindness, and falsehood is not found among them, and they love one another." He explains "they ask from Him petitions which are proper for Him to give and for them to receive: and thus they accomplish the course of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1891|pp=41–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes the ''Apology'' in chapter 17 by requesting the emperor to stop persecuting the Christians and convert to their faith; where he ends with a nice description of the Christian life.&lt;ref name=Cayre112/&gt;

===Other works===
It has been suggested that Aristides is the author of the ''[[Epistle to Diognetus]]''. This theory is supported by similar writing styles, descriptions of Christians, the treatment of Jews, as well as other similarities. Abbé H. Doulcet was primarily the leading voice of this theory in the late 19th century. The ''Epistle to Diognetus'' has been credited to [[Justin Martyr]] but without any sufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cayré|1936|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristides is also credited with a sermon on Luke 23:43.

==Contribution to other authors==

===Relation to contemporaries===
Aristides is the second [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologetic]] of the 2nd century. His writing style and thesis are very similar to the likes of Quadratus, [[Aristo of Pella]], Justin Martyr and the author of the ''Epistle to Diognetus''. [[Jerome]] suggests Aristides's apology was the combined opinions of philosophers at the time and imitated by Justin Martyr afterwards. Negatively, [[Celsus]] used the ''Apology'' for his arguments against the Jews and "also certain features which he used in order to scoff at Providence."  However, he was easily countered by [[Origen]].&lt;ref name=Cayre112/&gt;

===Influence on later writing===
The ''Apology'' of Aristides was later adapted into the work ''The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat'' during the 7th century. In the book, the ''Apology'' is told by a pagan philosopher by the name of Nachor, a character in the legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]]. The unknown use of the ''Apology'' in the book, allowed for the text to remain extant the entire time and influence Christian perception of [[Buddhism]]. Only with the rediscovery of the ''Apology'' in 1878 and 1889, did it reappear in history books. Rendel Harris,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Harris|1891}} for a complete study of the ''Apology''.&lt;/ref&gt; J.A. Robinson and few European scholars provided some commentary and studies of the text in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There has been little revisionist history on the ''Apology'' of late, except for an article by G.C. O'Ceallaigh in 1958. He suggested the ''Apology'' was a Jewish work of the 2nd century and was then edited by a Christian writer in the 4th century to be a Christian apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Ceallaigh|1958|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; W. Fairweather, D.W. Palmer and Massey Hamilton Shepherd Jr. have used the ''Apology'' of Aristides, and other apologists' works, in order to support their theories on early Christian thought and Greek apologists of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to {{harvnb|Fairweather|1905|pp=132–143}}, {{harvnb|Palmer|1983|pp=234–259}} and {{harvnb|Shepherd|1938|pp=60–79}} for more information on early Christian thought and second century Greek apologists.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Awareness Foundation''' is a Christian charity that was established in 2003. HRH The [[Countess of Wessex]] GCVO is their Royal Patron.  Their Founding Patron was [[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; they now have a College of Patrons, including Williams, [[Charles Cadogan, 8th Earl Cadogan]], [[Anba Angaelos]], [[Leslie Griffiths]], [[Paul Kwong]] and [[Kevin McDonald (bishop)|Kevin McDonald]]. The Awareness Foundation is based in London, UK, with supporters in [[North America]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Hong Kong]].

==History==
The Foundation was launched in September 2003 by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury at a service at [[Holy Trinity Sloane Square]] church, where Bishop Michael Marshall was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] from 1997 to 2007.

==Purpose and composition==
The Foundation says that "Our mission is to equip Christians everywhere to form an effective counter force to the intolerance and mistrust that now prevail in so many communities. We want to enable Christians to live a generous and hospitable faith; emphasise the role their faith has in healing broken societies; facilitate positive interactions with neighbours and colleagues from other faiths; build up understanding between the East and the West; strengthen and sustain Christians in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awareness-foundation.co.uk/index.php/work-vision-and-mission|title=Work, Vision and Mission|first=Huda|last=Nassar|website=Awareness-foundation.co.uk|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Middle East:'''
Awareness Foundation Middle East is headed by Huda Nassar. It has two main missions: it "builds up understanding between the East and the West" and "strengthens and sustains Christians in the Middle East".
Core projects include:
* '''Ambassadors for Peace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.give4peace.org/index.php/ambassadors|title=Ambassadors for Peace|first=Huda|last=Nassar|website=Give4peace.org|accessdate=25 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025022331/http://www.give4peace.org/index.php/ambassadors#|archive-date=2017-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''': the Awareness Foundation trains young people in Syria and Iraq to become 'Ambassadors for Peace' in their community. So far, hundreds of young men and women have taken part in this programme.
* '''Little Heroes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.give4peace.org/index.php/little-heroes|title=Little Heroes|first=Huda|last=Nassar|website=Give4peace.org|accessdate=25 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025073418/http://www.give4peace.org/index.php/little-heroes#|archive-date=2017-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''': The Awareness Foundation states on its website, "In 2015, we decided to invite 200 (displaced children) to a special three-day Summer School to plant the seeds of love, trust, hope and joy in their hearts so that they could overcome all they have faced and play an active role in their new homes, schools and communities. The results were astonishing! Our Summer School inspired the children through group activities, celebrations, Bible Study and prayer. Those six days proved to be a real blessing. Over the course of the Summer School, the children talked, perhaps for the first time, about their sense of loss - of home, of family members, their school friends, even toys and other possessions. They started to trust again, to smile and laugh, and to make new friends." In 2016, the Awareness Foundation ran Little Heroes programmes in Western, North and South Syria for more than 1,000 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.give4peace.org/index.php/little-heroes-today|title=Little Heroes - Today|first=Huda|last=Nassar|website=Give4peace.org|accessdate=25 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025073421/http://www.give4peace.org/index.php/little-heroes-today#|archive-date=2017-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Rest of the World:'''
* '''Facing Faith''', another new programme. This programme is described by the Foundation as "A community-based initiative to promote peace and understanding across barriers of faith &amp; culture"; it works by "bringing together community and faith leaders from different religions and cultures to discuss ideas and share their thoughts on how to promote better understanding and respect among the diverse communities that live alongside each other in cities and towns around Great Britain. Each event helps faith and community leaders to enable local communities to decide upon effective joint activities and programmes for the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awareness-foundation.co.uk/index.php/facingfaith|title=Facing Faith|first=Huda|last=Nassar|website=Awareness-foundation.co.uk|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''PAX''', a new programme, is "a free-to-view, web-based channel commenting on life from a faith perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pax.education|title=PAX|website=pax-website|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Awareness Forum''', which consists of special events such as dinners, conferences, roundtable exchanges and lectures, focusing on religious and cultural issues of the day. For example, in 2009, a delegation of business and religious leaders travelled to Syria to meet with their counterparts from the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aleppochamber.org/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=504]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awareness Foundation is [[ecumenical]], with board members from the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of England]], the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the US and the Middle East, the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] Churches, plus several charismatic evangelical churches.

==Personnel==
[[Nadim Nassar]] is Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theworldofgingerbreadgirl.blogspot.com/2009/06/summary-of-interview-with-father-nadim.html|title=The World of Gingerbreadgirl: Summary of the interview with Father Nadim Nassar|date=17 June 2009|website=Theworldofgingerbreadgirl.blogspot.com|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is co-founder of the Awareness Foundation along with [[Michael Marshall (bishop)|Michael Marshall]] (President Emeritus of the Awareness Foundation), and author of the Awareness Course.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">[[File:Pyramidion-satellite-khéops.jpg|thumb|250px|Reconstructed capstone from one of the pyramids of the [[Giza Plateau]], symbolizing Benben.]]
'''Benben''' was the mound that arose from the primordial waters [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]] upon which the [[creator deity]] [[Atum]] settled in the [[creation myth]] of the [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolitan]] form of [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. The Benben stone (also known as a [[pyramidion]]) is the top stone of the pyramid. It is also related to the [[Obelisk]].

==Primeval mound==
[[File:Pyramidion of the Pyramid of Amenemhet III at Dahshur.jpg|thumb|280px|Benben stone from the [[Pyramid of Amenemhat III (Dahshur)|Pyramid of Amenemhat III]], [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]]. [[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]]
In the [[Pyramid Texts]], e.g. Utterances 587 and 600, Atum himself is at times referred to as "mound". It was said to have turned into a small pyramid, located in Heliopolis ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Annu'' or ''Iunu''), within which Atum was said to dwell. Other cities developed their own myths of the primeval mound. At [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] the god [[Tatenen]], an earth god and the origin of "all things in the shape of food and viands, divine offers, all good things" was the personification of the primeval mound.

==Benben stone==
[[File:Fenix bennu.jpg|thumb|right|Bennu bird from an Egyptian papyrus.]]
The Benben stone, named after the mound, was a sacred stone in the [[egyptian temple|temple]] of [[Ra]] at Heliopolis ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Annu'' or ''Iunu''). It was the location on which the first rays of the sun fell. It is thought to have been the prototype for later [[obelisk]]s, and the [[coping (architecture)|capstones]] of the great pyramids were based on its design. The capstone or the tip of the pyramid is also called a ''pyramidion''. In ancient Egypt, these were probably gilded, so they shone in sunlight.

The pyramidion is also called 'Benben stone'. Many such Benben stones, often carved with images and inscriptions, are found in museums around the world.

The bird deity [[Bennu]], which was probably the inspiration for the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], was venerated at Heliopolis, where it was said to be living on the Benben stone or on the holy willow tree.

According to [[Barry Kemp (Egyptologist)|Barry Kemp]], the connection between the benben, the phoenix, and the sun may well have been based on alliteration: the rising, ''weben'', of the sun sending its rays towards the benben, on which the benu bird lives. Utterance 600, § 1652 of the [[Pyramid Texts]] speaks of Atum as ''you rose up, as the benben, in the Mansion of the Benu in Heliopolis''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical development===
From the earliest times, the portrayal of Benben was stylised in two ways; the first was as a pointed, pyramidal form, which was probably the model for pyramids and obelisks. The other form was round-topped; this was probably the origin of Benben as a free standing votive object, and an object of veneration.&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Rossi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc-gwWcWUmgC&amp;pg=PA182 ''Architecture and Mathematics in Ancient Egypt.''] Cambridge University Press, 2004. p 182 {{ISBN|1107320518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], the portrayal of benben was formalized as a squat obelisk. Later, during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], this became a long, thin obelisk.

In the [[Amarna Period]] tomb of [[Panehesy]], the benben is seen as a large, round-topped stela standing on a raised platform.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Tyldesley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nToN74v9rMC&amp;pg=PT91 ''The Penguin Book of Myths and Legends of Ancient Egypt.''] Penguin UK, 2010 {{ISBN|014196376X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1710">'''Burkut''' ('''Bürküt''' or '''Merküt''') is the eagle god in [[Turkic mythology]].

The eagle god Burkut symbolizes the sun and power. The eagle is considered to be the icons of the [[Khagan|khagans]] and [[Khan (title)|khans]] or the symbols of the guardian spirit and justice. In [[Sakha language|Sakha (Yakut)]] culture, the eagle is portrayed on top of the Ulukayın (Tree of Earth). It is either as the symbol of [[Tengri|Tengri (sky god)]]. In the ceremony of sacrifice, a kam ([[Shamanism|shaman]]) chants verses of prayer and summons all the spirits he knowns.&lt;ref&gt;Türklerde İslamiyet Öncesi İnanç Sistemleri - Öğretiler ve Dinler, Erman Artun [http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/HALKBILIM/erman_artun_inanc_sistemleri.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The eagle is referred to as the "bird with copper talons, its right wing covers the sun, the left covers the moon" and son of [[Kayra]].

==In Anatolia==
Among a kind of Turkish folk dances (Turkish: ''[[Yalli|Halay]]'', [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Yallı'') are the [[Anatolia]]n "Kartal Halayı" (eagles dance), "Karakuş" (the black bird) and "Karakustana" figures with bravery as the main theme are the figures known as the eagle position.

'''Chakdara''' ([[Urdu]] and {{lang-ps|چکدره}}) is a town in [[Lower Dir District]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] in [[Pakistan]]. It is located north of [[Malakand District|Malakand]] near the confluence of the [[Swat River]] with the [[Panjkora River]], in a commanding position near the entrance to [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] District and at the entrance to Lower Dir. It is about {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Peshawar]] and {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Mingora]]. 

== History ==
[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|An early stupa, 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side. Chakpat, near Chakdara. Probably [[Maurya empire]], 3rd century BCE.]]
Chakdara has been an important center for the last 3500 years and is littered with remains of the [[Gandhara grave culture]], Buddhist sites, and Hindu [[Shahi]] forts.  The ancient route from [[Afghanistan]] via Nawa Pass and [[Panjkora Valley|Katkala Pass/Zwalm pul(Bridge)]] Swat River crosses at Chakdara.

The [[Mughals]] built a fort here in 1586, occupied in 1895 by the British, who built the present fort in 1896 and were forced to defend it during the [[Siege of Malakand]] in 1897.

==Archaeological sites==
Buddhist sculpture of the 1st to 7th centuries from nearby sites and Hindu Shahi artefacts are now displayed at Chakdara Museum. 
 
===Damkot Hill===
The most important site in Chakdara is Damkot Hill. The top of Damkot Hill has been excavated and houses with pottery and jewellery have been discovered. These items are now displayed in the Saidu Sharif Museum.

At the foot of Damkot Hill at '''Salami''' there is an early graveyard. Early settlers buried partially cremated bodies surrounded by everyday utensils. The graves were sealed by large stone slabs.

A Buddhist stupa and monastery of the first century AD were excavated by [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]] in 1962-65. There are some Buddhist carvings at the foot of the hill. During the Hindu Shahi period a fort was built here which was destroyed in the 11th century. In the 19th century the British occupied this hill. Behind Damkot Hill at Chat pat is the site of a monastery of the late 4th century.  The sculpture from this monastery is displayed in Chakdara Museum.

===Andannd Dherai===
Andannd Dherai, an important Buddhist site, is located 7&amp;nbsp;km north of Chakdara Bridge opposite to Gul Abad Degree College for Boys near the village of Uchh. According to the Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] this site was connected with a legend about Buddha. According to the legend, Buddha changed himself into a great serpent lying dead in the valley in order to save the people from famine. The starving people cut pieces from the body and fed themselves.

According to another tradition, [[Gandhara]] is also thought to be the location of the mystical Lake Dhanakosha, birthplace of [[Padmasambhava]], founder of Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Kagyu]] sect of Tibetan Buddhism identifies the lake with the Andannd Dherai stupa. A spring was said to flow from the base of the stupa to form the lake. Archaeologists have found the stupa but no spring or lake can be identified. Andannd Dehrai Stupa was excavated by Dani. Over 500 pieces of Gandhara sculpture were recovered.

===Other sites===
{{convert|3|km|spell=In}} from Andannd Dherai Stupa, there is the Hindu Shahi fort of Kamal Khan Chena (spring, {{lang-ur|چشمہ}}), which is now in ruins. From this fort a track leads to Nimogram Buddhist Monastery and Stupa. It has three main stupas, which identify three principles of Buddhism; [[Buddha]] the teacher, [[Dharma]], [[Sangha]] (the Buddhist order). Near Chakdara Bridge there are ruins of the Hindu Shahi Period and stupas at Haibatgram, Top Dara and Landakai.

[[Image:Dearinth Goddess.png|thumb|right|Dearinth – The official sigil of the Church of All Worlds, Inc.]]
The '''Church of All Worlds''' (CAW) is an [[Neopaganism in the United States|American Neopagan]] religious group whose stated mission is to evolve a network of information, mythology, and experience that provides a context and stimulus for reawakening [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and reuniting her children through [[Tribalism|tribal community]] dedicated to responsible stewardship and evolving [[consciousness]]. It is based in  [[Cotati, California]].
 
The key founder of CAW is [[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]], who serves the Church as "[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]]", later along with his wife, [[Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart]] (d. 2014), designated High Priestess.  CAW was formed in 1962, evolving from a group of friends and lovers who were in part inspired by a fictional religion of the same name in the [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961) by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]; the church's mythology includes science fiction to this day.  
 
CAW's members, called ''Waterkin'', espouse [[Paganism]], but the Church is not a belief-based religion. Members experience [[Divinity]] and honor these experiences while also respecting the views of others. They recognize "Gaea," the [[Mother goddess|Earth Mother Goddess]] and the [[Father God]], as well as the realm of [[Fairy|Faeries]] and the [[deity|deities]] of many other pantheons. Many of their ritual celebrations are centered on the gods and goddesses of [[ancient Greece]].

==Formation==
CAW began in 1961 with a group of [[high school]] friends. One of these was Richard Lance Christie from [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Christie was fascinated by the "[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs#Self-actualization|self-actualization]]" concepts of [[Abraham Maslow]], a renowned American [[psychology|psychologist]], and after meeting then-Timothy Zell at [[Westminster College (Missouri)|Westminster College]] in Fulton, Missouri, he began experiments in [[extra-sensory perception|extrasensory perception]].  It was during this time that the group they read Heinlein's science fiction novel, ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961), which became the inspiration for CAW.
 
Heinlein's book, combined with Maslow's self-actualization concepts, led to the formation of a waterbrotherhood that Zell and Christie called '''Atl''', the [[Nahuatl language|Aztec]] word for "water", and also meaning "home of our ancestors".  Atl became dedicated to political and social change and the group grew to about 100 members.
 
Zell formed CAW from Atl, and filed for incorporation as a church in 1967.  It was formally chartered on March 4, 1968, making it the first [[Earth religion]] to obtain full United States recognition as a church.

==Early organization and beliefs==

CAW modeled its organization after the group in Heinlein's novel, as a series of 9 nests in circles of advancement that were each named after a planet. The basic [[dogma]] of the CAW was that there was no dogma – the basic "belief" was a stated "lack of belief".  Within their religion, the only sin was [[hypocrisy]] and the only crime in the eyes of the church was interfering with another person.

==Evolution==

Moving toward an emphasis on nature eventually led to a breaking of the relationship between CAW and Atl.  By 1974, CAW had nests in more than a dozen states around the United States. That year, Zell married Morning Glory (''née'' Diana Moore) and in 1976 he and Morning Glory settled in [[Eugene, Oregon]] and then at the Coeden Brith land in northern [[California]]. 
 
When Zell stepped away from central leadership, the Church of All Worlds suffered internal strife that led to most of the church dissolving.  By 1978 the focus and headquarters shifted to California with the Zells and the nine-circle nest structure was revamped.  CAW then served for several years as an [[umbrella organization]] for its subsidiaries.

==Subsidiaries==
Morning Glory Zell founded the [[Ecosophical Research Association]] (ERA) in 1977 to research arcane lore and legends. Its first project of note was the creation of living [[Unicorn#A single-horned goat|unicorns]] in 1980, after noting that early art depicts the creatures as being more goat-like than horse-like.  The Zells reconstructed what they claimed was an ancient unicorning procedure, a process involving surgically manipulating the horn buds of [[Goat#Reproduction|kids]] during their first week of life, and created several unicorns, some of which toured with the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]] for a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lair2000.net/Unicorn_Dreams/Unicorns_Man_Made/unicorns_man_made.html Man Made Unicorns]&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA sponsored a Mermaid expedition to Papua, New Guinea in 1985 &lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Williams. "Identification of the Ri: Through Further Fieldwork in New Ireland, Papua New Guinea," /Cryptozoology/ 4 (1985), 61-68, cited in Clark, /Unexplained!/. pp. 468. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; and a later ERA project involved the May 1996 worldwide ritual to draw upon and re-activate the Oracle at Delphi. This rite involved a relatively early attempt at utilizing [[online community]] and internet-facilitated [[virtual community]] rituals conducted simultaneously across different time zones, led by [[Maerian Morris]], another former High Priestess of CAW, working from Delphi. The reactivation of Delphi was the subject of a series of six editorials in ''[[Green Egg]]'' (issues 125 through 130) from November/December 1998 through September/October 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sidhevair.org/Editorials.html provides links to Green Egg articles 125 to 130.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1978 CAW merged with Nemeton, a Pagan organization founded by [[Gwydion Pendderwen]] and Alison Harlow.  In 1987 CAW also absorbed Forever Forests, another one of Pendderwen's organizations.  An outgrowth of Forever Forests was founded in 1983 by [[Anodea Judith]], past president and High Priestess of CAW, called Lifeways. 
 
The Holy Order of Mother Earth (HOME), founded in 1978 by the Zells, is another subsidiary, dedicated to magical living and working with the land.

Oberon and Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart have appeared at over 20 [[Starwood Festival]]s (and a few WinterStar Symposiums) over the past 25 years; because of this, there has been a Church of All Worlds presence at Starwood, called the CAWmunity, for over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberonzell.com/OZAbout.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124090333/http://www.oberonzell.com/OZAbout.html |archivedate=2007-11-24 |df= }} Bio on Oberon Zell-Ravenheart's Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Renaissance==

By the mid-1980s, CAW had practically ceased operation outside of [[Ukiah, California]] where the Zells relocated in 1985.  Anodea Judith assumed presidency until 1991, and the structure of the organization was revamped with plans for more nest meetings, training courses, new rituals, and publications.  By the late 1980s CAW had increased membership internationally, becoming particularly strong in Australia, where it was legally incorporated in 1992.
 
In 1998 Oberon Zell-Ravenheart took a year-and-a-day [[sabbatical]] from his role as Primate, and the church headquarters were moved to [[Toledo, Ohio]].

==Attempted termination &amp; Second Renaissance==
On August, 2004, the Board of Directors decided to terminate CAW due to financial and legal struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.caw.org/bod/CAWterminationByBoD.html |title=CAW Board of Directors, "A Resolution for Implementing the Dormancy of Church of All Worlds, Inc." |publisher=www.caw.org
|accessdate=2008-04-19 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 2006, due to the effort of Jack Crispin Cain to help save the organization, CAW was reestablished with Zells again assuming a leadership role.  In 2007, ''[[Green Egg]]'', CAW's influential journal, returned to publication in an online format.  The "3rd Phoenix Resurrection of the Church" continues to the present.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Colin Edward Quinn''' (born June 6, 1959)&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; is an [[United States|American]] stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. On television, he is best known for his work on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he anchored [[Weekend Update]], on [[MTV]]'s 1980s game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', where he served as the announcer/sidekick, and as host of [[Comedy Central]]'s late-night panel show ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]''. Notable film work includes his role as Dooey in ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', Dickey Bailey in the ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' films and playing [[Amy Schumer]]'s father in the film ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''. Comedians such as [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Dave Attell]] cite him as the quintessential New York comedian.

Quinn has also become known for his comedic [[one-man show]]s that offer his unique takes on history and growing up in [[New York City]]. As of 2015, he has written and starred in five shows: ''Irish Wake'', ''My Two Cents'', ''Long Story Short'', ''Unconstitutional'', and ''The New York Story'', two of which he collaborated on with Seinfeld as director. ''Long Story Short'' was filmed as an [[HBO]] special that aired on April 9, 2011 and ''Unconstitutional'' and ''The New York Story'' were released as [[Netflix]] specials.

==Early life==
Quinn was born and raised in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], the son of teachers.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Colin-Quinn.html | title=Colin Quinn Biography (1959-)| publisher=FilmReference.com | accessdate= June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_60/99b_colin_quinn_interview.html | title= Colin Quinn...Irish Comic Standing| publisher= (interview) AskMen.com| date= n.d.|page=2 | accessdate= June 11, 2015| quote=I grew up in Brooklyn, mixed area...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--He graduated from [[John Dewey High School]].--&gt; He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.

==Career==

===Early career===
Quinn began performing stand-up comedy in 1984, and first achieved fame in 1987 as the sidekick announcer of the [[MTV]] game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', which lasted five seasons.  In 1989, he hosted the [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] stand-up showcase ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]'', and wrote and acted in the comedic short/music video "Going Back to Brooklyn" (a parody of [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[Going Back to Cali (LL Cool J song)|Going Back to Cali]]") with [[Ben Stiller]]. He wrote for ''[[In Living Color]]'', and co-wrote and produced the movie ''[[Celtic Pride]]'', which starred [[Damon Wayans]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]].

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Quinn was hired as a writer and featured player on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') in [[Saturday Night Live (season 21)|1996]] and became a full cast member during the [[Saturday Night Live (season 23)|1997–1998 season]]. He established himself on the show with recurring characters and segments such as "Lenny the Lion", "Joe Blow", "Colin Quinn Explains ''The New York Times''", and "[[Weekend Update (sketch)|Weekend Update]]".&lt;ref name="top-100-2011" /&gt;

Quinn began hosting "Weekend Update" in January 1998 after [[Norm Macdonald]] was fired, and anchored the segment until his departure from ''SNL'' in 2000. He commented on a number of highly publicized [[media circus]]es, including the [[Lewinsky scandal|Clinton–Lewinsky scandal]] and the [[United States v. Microsoft|Microsoft anti-trust trial]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

During his tenure on ''SNL'', Quinn turned down an offer for the role of Scott Evil in fellow cast member [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]'s film ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]''. Quinn has called the role,  which was ultimately played by [[Seth Green]], the only project he has regretted turning down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colin Quinn |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/colin-quinn-13816 |work=The Onion A.V. Club |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |date=June 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and film work and stand-up===
After leaving ''SNL'', Quinn hosted the short-lived ''The Colin Quinn Show'' on [[NBC]] in the spring of 2002. The show combined sketch comedy and stand-up in a live-to-tape format. Despite mostly positive reviews from critics, it was cancelled after three episodes.

Quinn had greater success with his subsequent show, ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'', which ran on weekdays on [[Comedy Central]] from 2002 to 2004. The show featured a panel of four comedians, with Quinn as host, discussing the social and political issues of the day. The show ran for over 200 episodes.

His stand-up was also used in the animated series ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''.

[[File:USMC-13540.jpg|thumb|right|Quinn performing during a [[USO]] tour in 2005]]
In 2005, Quinn participated in a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour of American military bases around the world, performing stand-up to entertain the troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Garamone | first=Jim | date=August 25, 2005 | title=Around the World in 10 Days, Chairman-Style | url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=16810 | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | access-date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the "unofficial co-host" on the [[Nick DiPaolo]] show on the now-defunct 92.3 [[Free FM]] in New York City, airing Monday–Friday from noon to three. Quinn and DiPaolo were originally slated to host the show together on [[WJFK-FM]], but the station decided not to pick up the show.  Quinn was also a regular guest on ''[[The Opie &amp; Anthony Show]]'' until its run ended in 2014.

Quinn played Dickie Bailey, the childhood rival to Lenny Feder ([[Adam Sandler]]'s character) in both ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' films. He also currently recurs as Hermie on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''.

Quinn wrote and starred in the [[L/Studio]] [[web series]] ''Cop Show'', which premiered in February 2015. The series stars Quinn as a satirical, pompous version of himself, starring in a New York City-based crime drama. The show's guest stars have included [[Jerry Seinfield]], [[Dave Attell]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Michael Che]], [[Tom Papa]], [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Pat Cooper]], [[Irina Shayk]] and [[Amy Schumer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holcomb-Holland|first1=Lori|title=Colin Quinn's Streaming 'Cop Show' to Satirize Police Dramas|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/colin-quinns-streaming-cop-show-to-satirize-police-dramas/?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Television&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;pgtype=article|accessdate=3 February 2015|agency=New York Times|publisher=Arts Beat|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn had a supporting role in Amy Schumer's film debut, ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]'', as her character's father. He was critically praised for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colin Quinn is legit good in Trainwreck |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/23/colin-quinn-trainwreck |first=Christopher |last=Rosen |date=July 23, 2015 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One-man shows===
Quinn made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1998 in a one-man show, ''Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake'', co-written with Lou DiMaggio. The show reflected Quinn's upbringing within the Irish-American community of Brooklyn; it was set at a [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] in 1976, with Quinn portraying family members and acquaintances who show up for the event.

In 2009, Quinn premiered his second one-man show ''My Two Cents'', which covers the economic crumbling of the American empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/iamcolinquinn/status/1713463866]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Quinn premiered his third one-man show ''Colin Quinn Long Story Short'' on Broadway, directed by Jerry Seinfeld. The show covered world history from prehistoric times to the present, offering satirical takes on the rise and fall of various world empires. Quinn recorded a special performance of the show that aired on [[HBO]] on April 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Colin_Quinn_Stars_In_Colin_Quinn_Long_Story_Short_At_Bleecker_Street_Theater_Thru_815_20100702 Broadway World]&lt;/ref&gt; A Brazilian version of the show featuring comedian [[Bruno Motta]] has the title ''1 Milhao de Anos em 1 Hora'' ("1 Million Years in 1 Hour").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ummilhaodeanos.com.br&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Quinn premiered another one-man show on historical themes, ''Unconstitutional'', which covers the [[United States Constitution]], its creation, and its impact on the American psyche.&lt;ref name="framers reframed"&gt;{{cite web |title=Framers Reframed |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/03/big-weather |work=The New Yorker |first=Rivka |last=Galchen |date=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn starred in his fifth one-man show, ''The New York Story'', in July and August 2015 at the Cherry Lane Theatre.  The show was based upon the experiences chronicled in his book, ''The Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America''. It delves into his growing up in the ethnically diverse Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn and how it has changed over the years into its current state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thenew-yorkstory.squarespace.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618072809/https://thenew-yorkstory.squarespace.com/ |archive-date=June 18, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seinfeld, who directed ''Long Story Short'', returned as director.

===Social media===
Quinn has gained attention for his account on the social network [[Twitter]], where he usually posts deliberately vacuous statements, often in the form of either inspirational statements or boasts about his celebrity status, that are intended to provoke his readers.&lt;ref name="framers reframed" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In conversation with [[Judd Apatow]] in 2015 for the [[David Lynch Foundation]] Trainwreck tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trainwreck Comedy Tour|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/emailing/2015_05_trainwreck.html|website=David Lynch Foundation|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn said he had been practicing [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour Talk with Judd Apatow and Colin Quinn|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/a0c4945e13/trainwreck-2?_cc=__d___&amp;_ccid=94d9927f-c1e8-4f2c-9feb-1db26e3c6ed2|website=Funny or Die|accessdate=25 January 2017|date=18 June 2015|quote=I do TM every day, twice a day, five years. [2' 5"]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2018, Quinn suffered a heart attack in New York. On Twitter several days later, he said he was doing well but if he dropped dead "you would see a funeral like [[Al Capone]]!"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mail.com/entertainment/celebrity/8292872-snl-alum-quinn-recovering-heart-attack-with-humor.html#.7518-stage-set4-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 2004, Quinn was named No. 56 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all-time.

He was named one of the Top 100 Irish Americans of the year in 2004 and 2011 by the magazine ''[[Irish America (magazine)|Irish America]]''.&lt;ref name="top-100-2011"&gt;[http://irishamerica.com/2011/12/colin-quinn/ Top 100 - 2011: Colin Quinn], ''Irish America''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishabroad.com/irishworld/irishamericamag/aprilmay04/features/ www.irishabroad.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704063634/http://irishabroad.com/irishworld/irishamericamag/aprilmay04/features/ |date=July 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crypto-Islam''' is the secret adherence to [[Islam]] while publicly professing to be of another faith; people who practice crypto-Islam are referred to as "crypto-Muslims". The word has mainly been used in reference to [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Muslims]] during the [[Inquisition]] (i.e., the [[Moriscos]] and their usage of [[Aljamiado]]). 

==Historic examples==
Some historic examples include [[Ahmad ibn Qasim Al-Hajarī]], 16th-century crypto-Muslim from Spain who authored a book recounting how he organized his escape from Spain to Morocco, and also including a refutation of the Catholic opinions about Jesus. The books also included details about how crypto-Muslims lived in Spain. He later became Ambassador of Morocco to Spain. 

There are claims that [[Armah]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and gave refuge to early Muslim converts, was also a crypto-Muslim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">'''Daochuo''' ({{zh | t=道綽| s=道綽| p=Dàochuò| w=Tao-ch'o| first=p}}, 562–645), was a Chinese Buddhist scholar of the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' who later became an eminent scholar of [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. In Chinese Buddhist tradition, he is considered the [[lineage (Buddhism)|second patriarch]] of [[Pure Land Buddhism]]{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=213}} while In [[Jōdo Shinshū]], he is considered the Fourth Patriarch.

[[Image:Amitabha Sutra book.jpg|thumb|Book open to the traditional Chinese version (with Japanese annotations) of ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]''.]]
==Life and teachings==
Daochuo was born and raised in [[Bingzhou]], Shanxi. According to legend, Daochuo visited the temple of [[Tan-luan]] in 609 and read an epitaph on the wall that venerated Tanluan.  Daochuo was so impressed by this inscription that he took up the pursuit of Pure Land Buddhism over his previous studies, including [[nianfo]] and daily recitation of the ''[[Infinite Life Sutra]]'' ({{zh|c=''無量壽經''}}).&lt;ref name="jodo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and teachers, Jodo Shu homepage Homepage| language=English| url=http://www.jodo.org/about_plb/buddhas.html| accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=213}}

Among Daochuo's contributions to Pure Land Buddhism was his distinction that there existed two Paths in Buddhism: the holy path (monastic practices leading to the purification of the mind) and the pure land path (relying on [[Amitābha]]'s grace).  He also linked the Buddhist concept of the [[Three Ages of Buddhism]] with the salvation of Amitābha by teaching that Amitābha's compassion was particularly suited on those living in the current degenerate age.&lt;ref name="jodo" /&gt;

Some believe that Daochuo's habit of counting his recitations with beans is the origin of [[Buddhist prayer beads]].{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=213}}

==Early life==
Pakman was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]],&lt;ref name=JewishLedger&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishledger.com/2010/04/q-a-with-david-pakman |title=Q &amp; A with David Pakman: Radio host becomes host of midweek politics |author=Judy Polan |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1989, when he was 5 years old. He grew up in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Northampton High School (Massachusetts)|Northampton High School]]. Pakman attended the [[University of Massachusetts]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], where he majored in economics and communications. He earned an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree from [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. Pakman worked several jobs as a high school and university student,&lt;ref name="youtube3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4dzITIpE_Q|title=Question: What Were Your First Jobs? – YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has described his employment at now-defunct electronics retailer [[Circuit City]].&lt;ref name="youtube4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71O50g9MDwo|title=Have You Worked in Retail?

With the move of ''The David Pakman Show'' to [[New York City]], Pakman also moved there in August 2013. In November 2015, the show relocated to Boston.&lt;ref name="Twitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/davidpakmanshow/status/666405966599057409|title=Bonus Show: First show at the Boston studio, Louis' Greece trip, much more|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The David Pakman Show''==
{{Main|The David Pakman Show}}

Pakman hosts ''The David Pakman Show'', which is a television, radio, and Internet political program. Begun in 2005 on a local radio station as a "hobby," according to Pakman, by 2011 the show aired on 100 stations,&lt;ref name="OBrien40"/&gt; and on more than 160 television and radio outlets in 2014,&lt;ref name="davidpakman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidpakman.com/stations|title=Stations &amp;#124; The David Pakman Show|publisher=davidpakman.com|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[DirecTV]] and [[DISH Network]] through [[Free Speech TV]], on YouTube, and via podcasts. The program first aired in August 2005 on [[WXOJ-LP]] ("Valley Free Radio"), located in Northampton, Massachusetts, as ''Midweek Politics with David Pakman'', and has since been nationally syndicated.

==Personal life==
Pakman has never been married.  While his sexuality has been a topic of ''The David Pakman Show'',&lt;ref name="youtube8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7WmHgCFBFs|title=YouTube – Hatriot Mail: David&amp;#39;s Boyfriend|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakman has said he is [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and that he considers himself a [[straight ally]] of the LGBT rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7-EYtjwjb4|title = Gay Teen Writes to Straight Ally for Help|date = May 29, 2013|accessdate = August 7, 2014|website = YouTube|publisher = David Pakman Show|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakman says that he received "a relatively [[secular Jew]]ish upbringing, but I've always been highly involved with my Jewish background, socially and culturally; I'm part of a local Jewish group and I attend their events. It's just generally how I identify."&lt;ref name="JewishLedger" /&gt;

In the fall of 2017, Pakman started teaching as an adjunct professor at [[Boston College]] in Boston, Massachusetts&lt;ref name="courses.bc.edu"/&gt;

'''Marcus Tyrone Gray''' (born September 16, 1981), known as '''Flame''' (often stylized as '''FLAME'''), is an American [[Christian hip hop]] recording artist with Clear Sight Music. He has released nine albums including: the self-titled ''Flame'', ''Rewind'', ''Our World: Fallen'', ''Our World: Redeemed'', ''Captured'', ''The 6th'', ''Royal Flush'', ''Forward'', and ''God Knows''. Flame has been nominated for several Dove and Stellar Awards throughout his music career and ''Our World: Redeemed'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

==Biography==

During his personal time, Flame initially wrote raps as devotionals to God. After converting his devotionals to songs, [[Cross Movement Records]] took an interest in supporting Flame in publishing his gospel work through rap music. In 2004, Flame released his debut album with Cross Movement Records. Since then, Flame released 3 more albums and launched his own record label, Clear Sight Music.

His self-titled debut album, ''Flame'', was released in October 2004. In December 2005, Flame released his second album titled, ''Rewind''. On April 17, 2007, Flame released his third album entitled ''Our World: Fallen'', which is the first part of a two part series. On August 7, 2007, the sequel, ''Our World: Redeemed'' was scheduled to release, but the date was pushed back to March 4, 2008.

Flame has been featured on radio shows in the United States such as ''[[Way of the Master]]'', and in local newspapers such as ''The Pathway'' (the [[Missouri Baptist Convention]] statewide newspaper), and [[World (magazine)|World]].

Flame has sold over 350,000 albums, and one of his interludes from his first album is played on [[Busch Stadium]]'s loudspeakers every other time [[Albert Pujols]] comes to bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Westhoff |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2005-09-14/news/rap-vs-rapture/ |title=St. Louis - News - Rap vs. Rapture |publisher=Riverfronttimes.com |date=2005-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2007, it was announced that Flame's track, "Gotta Notice", from the album ''Rewind'' was nominated for the 38th Annual [[GMA Dove Awards]] in the category Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doveawards.com/categories/ 38th Annual GMA Dove Awards - Recipients] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404171623/http://www.doveawards.com/categories/ |date=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2007, Flame joined the rest of [[Cross Movement]] for their final tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossmovementrecords.com/articles.asp?columnid=3821 |title=HIStory Summer Tour Details - Cross Movement Records (CMR) .:: A Trusted Name In Christian Hip-Hop :: |publisher=Cross Movement Records |date=1997-04-11 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Our World Redeemed'' was nominated for a Stellar Award, Dove Award, and Grammy Award. In 2009, Flame was a special guest on [[Reach Records]] [[116 Clique|116 Clique's]] tour Don't Waste Your Life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/content/view/1330/103/ Don't Waste Your Life Tour Commercial + Dates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302104910/http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/content/view/1330/103/ |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government generally respected this right in practice. [[Buddhism]] is the state religion. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the period covered by this report, and government [[policy]] continued to contribute to the generally free practice of religion. There were limited reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice.

==Religious demography==
{{main article|Religion in Cambodia}}

[[Cambodia|The country]] has an area of {{convert|181035|km2|sqmi}}, and a population of approximately 14.1 million. An estimated 93 percent of the population is [[Theravada Buddhist]]. The Theravada Buddhist tradition is widespread and strong in all provinces, with an estimated 4,100 [[pagoda]]s throughout the country. Since the vast majority of ethnic [[Khmer people|Khmer]] Cambodians are Buddhist, there is a close association between Buddhism, Khmer cultural traditions, and daily life. Adherence to Buddhism generally is considered intrinsic to the country's ethnic and cultural identity. The Mahayana branch of Buddhism is practiced by approximately 150,000 followers and has 63 temples throughout the country.

There are approximately 500,000 to 700,000 [[Muslims]] (between 3.5 and 5 percent of the population), predominantly ethnic [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], who generally are found in towns and rural fishing villages on the banks of the [[Tonle Sap]] and [[Mekong]] rivers and in Kampot Province. Some organizations that work with or have contacts in the Cham Muslim population cite lower estimates for the number of Cham Muslims in the country. A nationwide [[census]] scheduled for 2008 should provide a more accurate estimate. There are four branches of Islam represented: the Malay-influenced Shafi'i branch, practiced by 88 percent of Cham Muslims; the Saudi-Kuwaiti-influenced Salafi (sometimes called "Wahhabi") branch, which claims six percent of the Muslim population although this number is increasing; the indigenous Iman-San branch, practiced by three percent; and the Kadiani branch, which also contributes three percent. There are 200 to 300 mosques of the four main branches and 200 to 300 small Surav mosques, which have congregations of up to 40 persons and do not have a min-bar from which Friday sermons are given. The small, but growing, Christian community constitutes approximately two percent of the population. There are an estimated 100 Christian organizations or denominations that operate freely throughout the country and include approximately 2,400 churches; however, only 900 of these churches are officially registered. Other religious organizations with small followings include the Vietnamese Cao Dai religion and the Baha'i Faith, each with an estimated 2,000 practicing members.

Foreign missionary groups operate freely. A June 26, 2007, announcement by the Ministry of Cults and Religions restated a 2003 ban on door-to-door proselytizing and similar proselytizing activities such as using a loudspeaker or directing assistance only to denomination members. However, open-ended assistance activities by missionary groups are encouraged.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government generally respected this right in practice. The government does not tolerate abuse of religious freedom, either by governmental or private actors. However, Buddhism is the state religion. The Government promotes national Buddhist [[holiday]]s, provides Buddhist training and education to [[monk]]s and others in pagodas, and modestly supports an institute that performs research and publishes materials on [[Khmer people|Khmer]] culture and Buddhist traditions. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on religion.

The law requires all religious groups, including Buddhist groups, to submit applications to the Ministry of Cults and Religious Affairs if they wish to construct places of worship and conduct religious activities. In their applications, groups must state clearly their religious purposes and activities, which must comply with provisions forbidding religious groups from insulting other religious groups, creating disputes, or undermining [[national security]]. However, there is no penalty for failing to register, and in practice some groups do not.

During the period covered by this report, there were no reports that any religious groups encountered significant difficulties in obtaining approval for construction of places of worship. The Directive on Controlling External Religions requires registration of places of worship and religious schools, in addition to government approval prior to constructing new places of worship. Places of worship must be located at least 2 kilometers from each other and may not be used for political purposes or to house [[criminal]]s or [[fugitive]]s from the law. The distance limitation has begun to be enforced but applies only to new construction of places of worship and not to offices of religious organizations. The order requires that religious teachings respect other religious groups.

Government officials continued to organize annual meetings for representatives of all religious groups to discuss religious developments and to address problems of concern.

The Constitution designates Buddhism as the state religion. The government permits Buddhist religious instruction in public schools as an extension of this constitutional designation.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion. Despite re-issuance in June 2007 of a ban on door-to-door [[proselytizing]], foreign [[missionary]] groups generally operated freely throughout the country and did not encounter significant difficulties in performing their work. Government officials expressed appreciation for the work of many foreign religious groups in providing much needed assistance in [[education]], rural development, and training; however, officials also expressed some concern that foreign groups used the guise of religion to become involved in illegal or political affairs. During the reporting period, the Government did not close any Islamic schools ([[madrassahs]]) as it had in the past.

There were no reports of religious [[wikt:prisoner|prisoner]]s or [[detainee]]s in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor [[U.S. citizen]]s who had been [[Kidnapping|abducted]] or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were limited reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.

On the morning of April 26, 2006, a Buddhist [[Ochlocracy|mob]] knocked down and burned an unfinished Christian [[Church (building)|church]] in Kandal Province. Reportedly, provincial authorities had denied the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Church]] permission to build a church, so the group built a house for religious teachers to be converted to a church at a later date. The district governor of the area reportedly negotiated a reconciliation agreement between the Buddhists and Christians in the area, whereby the house could be rebuilt and no charges pressed against those who participated in the riot. The local church leader confirmed that the house had not been rebuilt but he planned to turn the property into a school.

[[minority group|Minority]] religious groups experienced little or no societal discrimination during the period covered by this report; however, Muslims and Christians reported minor conflicts.

Occasional tensions were reported among the branches of [[Islam]] that receive monetary support from groups in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], or [[Indonesia]], depending on the tenets of the branch. Some Buddhists also expressed concern about the Cham Muslim community receiving financial assistance from foreign countries. However, in general, Cham Muslims were well integrated into society, enjoyed positions of prominence in business and the government, and faced no reported acts of [[discrimination]] or abuse during the period covered by this report.

There are ecumenical and interfaith organizations, which are often supported by funding from foreign public or private groups.

Overseas Operations]. Global Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: A Case Study on the Aum Shinrikyo. Retrieved 24 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At its foundation, the group had 57 live-in followers and nine other executives with 106 lay members. Arsenne Frenette, former Aum Shinrikyo executive is also an executive in Hikari No Wa.

Many of the remaining followers of Aum Shinrikyo founder and convicted terrorist [[Shoko Asahara]]&lt;ref name=chrono&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Chronology: Events involving Aum Shinrikyo | url = | work =The Nikkei Weekly | publisher = The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Incorporated| location = New York | id = | pages = | page =Issues &amp; People, page 3  | date =22 May 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed Aleph in 2000. Despite Hikari no Wa publicizing the intention of "completely discarding the influence of Aum founder Shoko Asahara", the Japanese [[Public Security Intelligence Agency]] said the group will remain subject to surveillance under the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/406326 Cult group of former Aum official inspected by public safety agency.]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on May 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's Public Security Examination Commission considers Aleph and Hikari no Wa to be branches of a "dangerous religion"&lt;ref name="NPA-whitepaper-2009"&gt;[[National Police Agency (Japan)]] (2009), {{nihongo|[http://www.npa.go.jp/english/kokusai9/WHITE_PAPER_on_POLICE2009.htm "The White Paper on Police 2009]|平成21年警察白書|Heisei Nijūichi nen Keisatsu Hakusyo}}), GYOSEI Corporation, English p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in January 2015 that they would remain under surveillance for three more years.&lt;ref name=jiji&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kyodo|first1=Jiji|title=Surveillance of Aum successor cults extended three more years|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/24/national/crime-legal/aum-successor-groups-remain-surveillance-three-years|work=Japan Times|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is said to organize gatherings and pilgrimages, visiting places deemed holy by different religions and distributing sermons on various aspects of Buddhism. The group's leader Joyu positions himself as an authority in the field of spirituality, who gained 'spiritual experience' which he is sharing with members of the group.

The Japanese government ended surveillance of Hikari no Wa in 2017, but continued to keep Aleph under watch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/09/25/national/crime-legal/court-lets-aum-splinter-group-hikari-no-wa-off-surveillance-keeps-aleph-check/#.WckunYprzv0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Ron Hubbard]] used the term '''Incident''' in a specific context for [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] in [[Scientology]] and [[Dianetics]]: the description of [[Space opera in Scientology|space operatic]] events in the Universe's distant past, involving alien interventions in [[Reincarnation#Scientology|past lives]]. It is a basic belief of Scientology that a [[human being]] is an immortal spiritual being, termed a [[thetan]], trapped on planet Earth in a "[[Scientology and sex#MEST and meat|meat body]]".

Although Incidents can be any incident anywhere, Hubbard's writings described some in particular, set in Earth's prehistory. Many of them first appeared in Hubbard's book ''What to Audit'' (later retitled ''[[A History of Man]]'').

In his writings and lectures, Hubbard describes Incidents said to have occurred to thetans during the past few [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]]&lt;ref name=tril&gt;Billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]].&lt;/ref&gt; years. Most of these followed a consistent pattern, wherein a hostile alien civilization captured and brainwashed free thetans. Often, instances of implantation are termed ''Incidents'', while the subject of the implants are often termed ''Goals''. Some Incidents are simply unusual and traumatic events, whereof the memory is said to linger for trillions&lt;ref name=tril/&gt; of years. According to Hubbard, only Scientology's methods can remove the resulting [[neuroses]].

==''A History of Man'' Incidents==
{{Main|Scientology: A History of Man}}

===Before Earth and Before MEST===
"There is a Before Earth and a Before [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] Universe in all banks. The incidents are not dissimilar. They consist of the preclear being summoned before a council, being frowned down, being sent elsewhere than where he was... the council's intent is to reduce the person downscale in order to get a more obedient colonist."&lt;ref&gt;''[[A History of Man]]'', 1988 edition, pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body Builder Incident===
The Body Builder Incident took place around fifty million years ago and variants of it are said by Hubbard to have recurred often, wherein the thetan was forced to fight with his own "attention units" and build a MEST body from them.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Man'', 1988 edition, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodies in pawn===
"Bodies in pawn result" from a "very gruesome experience" in which:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a fellow is grabbed, hypnotized, shoved into an electronic field, and then told he is somewhere else. And so he departs—most of him—and goes to the new location while still being under control of the implanters. He picks up a MEST [physical] body in the new location and starts living a life there, ''while still having a living body somewhere else''. The implanters can keep his original body alive indefinitely, and control the thetan through it. If the thetan tries to flee, the hypnotizers simply cause pain to the original body, still alive in a vat of fluid, and he is immediately recalled. That's a BODY IN PAWN. It's a second body you may have, living somewhere else, right in present time. But the second body is not under YOUR direct control.
&lt;br /&gt;(''Source'' magazine #105, pg.39, 1997; see also Hubbard, ''Research and Discovery Series'' vol. 10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They can apparently cause major problems for people undergoing medical operations, as "pain, an anaesthetic or a serious accident cause him to change to the other area with a shocking impact on the other body. The other body quite commonly dies or is deranged by the sudden impact". This gives the patient a repressed feeling of having died and leaves him "very, very badly disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;''Scientology: A History of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fly Trap (Bubble Gum Incident)===
The Bubble Gum Incident was an important early incident "where you are hit with a motion and finally develop an obsession about motion". It was the first incident on the "whole track" which included words.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Technique 88 and the Whole Track Part I"&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard openly acknowledged the absurdity of the name, ironically noting: "I wish you to carefully note these very technical terms like ''bubble gum''", to which the audience laughs heartily.&lt;ref&gt;''Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary, first edition, 1975, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[A History of Man]]'', Hubbard referred to the Bubble Gum Incident as "The Fly Trap": "Very, very early on the track, a long time before the present populace came into being, there was a theta trap called the Fly Trap. It was of a gummy material... also called the 'Bubble Gum' incident, because every time a thetan pushes against it, it pushes back and it finally gives him an obsession about motion".&lt;ref&gt;1988 edition, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coffee Grinder===
Hubbard gave the name "The Coffee Grinder" to the MEST aspect of the Fourth Invader Force's Fac One, which he termed "an outright control mechanism, invented to cut down rebel raids on invader installations". It was "originally laid down in this galaxy about one million years ago", says Hubbard, and consists of "a two-handled, portable machine which, when turned, emits a heavy push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering 'baps'".

"The invader gratuitously left these machines around for the yokels. Believing that the treatment was vital to get to heaven or some such thing, the yokels practiced on each other, found new victims and generally spread the implant around."&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Man'', 1988 edition, pg. 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice Cube Incident===
A Xenu-like story in which alien invaders in [[flying saucer]]s "plant" living entities. Says Hubbard in ''A History of Man'': "Here is an intriguing incident which, if your preclear demands, should be audited. This is evidently a method of transportation of beings to a new area. The being is packed in ice, is taken to the new area and is usually dumped in the ocean. Your preclear, if he has this one in restimulation, has very cold hands and feet chronically".

Hubbard also notes: "The new crew in the area is later quite surprised to find that their planted beings, so carefully dumped in the sea from a saucer, are being picked up between lives and given "treatment" by an old, established invader whose methods of political control are long since established".&lt;ref&gt;1988 edition, pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack-in-the-Box===
According to Hubbard, "here we have an invader trick, a method of trapping thetans", wherein the alien invaders trick the thetans into gathering an endless loop of facsimile pictures and confusing themselves, ultimately ending in an explosion. Hubbard warns auditors, "You will find a preclear with this in restimulation to be very curious about cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes".&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Man'', 1988 edition, pg. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==OT III Incidents==
{{Main|Xenu}}
These incidents are described in the material for [[Operating Thetan]] level III and are audited on that level.

===Incident I===
Incident I is set four [[1000000000000000 (number)|quadrillion]]&lt;ref name=thbill&gt;Thousand billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]].&lt;/ref&gt; years ago, wherein an unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise, followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a [[chariot]] followed by a trumpeting [[cherub]]. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant opening the gateway to the present universe, separating thetans from their ''static'' (natural/godlike) state. The incident is described in [[Operating Thetan]] level III (OT III), written in 1967.{{citation needed|reason=no directly related citation for major detail|date=April 2016}}

===R6 Implants (Incident II)===
The R6 Implants were the work of the Galactic Confederacy's tyrannical leader, [[Xenu]], 75 million years ago. According to Hubbard, Xenu destroyed billions&lt;ref name=thmill&gt;Thousand million in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]&lt;/ref&gt; of captured subjects during Incident II by dropping them into volcanoes and attacking them with [[nuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= Jamie Doward |title= Lure of the celebrity sect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/16/religion.world  |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-05-16 |accessdate=2008-02-12  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subjects, once disembodied, were forced to watch a "three-D, super colossal motion picture" for thirty-six days. This implanted pictures "contain[ing] [[God]], [[the Devil]], Angels, [[space opera]], theaters, helicopters, a constant spinning, a spinning dancer, trains and various scenes very like modern England."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Assists, Class VIII Course, October 3, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routine 3N Incidents==

===Aircraft Door Goals===
The Aircraft Door Goals were implanted between 315 trillion&lt;ref name=tril/&gt; years ago and 216 trillion&lt;ref name=tril/&gt; years ago aboard the fuselage of an aircraft, with the subject thetan held motionless in front of the aircraft door. Hubbard writes that "the goal items were laid in with explosions". The specific goals given in this implant were variants of the command "to create".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Routine 3N: Line Plots", HCOB 14 July 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gorilla Goals===
[[File:Flachlandgorilla.jpg|right|frame|A black [[gorilla]] was said by [[L. Ron Hubbard|Hubbard]] to have been used by the Hoipolloi to implant the Gorilla Goals.]]&lt;!-- frame because it's a 202px-wide original image - don't try to thumbnail --&gt;
According to Scientology, the Gorilla Goals were a series of implants created by invaders from Helatrobus "between about 319 trillion&lt;ref name=tril/&gt; years ago to about 256 trillion trillion&lt;ref name=quad/&gt; years ago". They were
&lt;blockquote&gt;given in an amusement park with a single tunnel, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel.... The symbol of a Gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given. Sometimes a large gorilla, black, was seen elsewhere than the park. A mechanical or a live gorilla was always seen in the park. This activity was conducted by the Hoipolloi, a group of operators in [[Scientology and sex#Scientology's views on the body|meat body]] societies. They were typical carnival people. They let out concessions for these implant "Amusement Parks." A pink-striped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the Hoipolloi. Such a figure often rode on the roller coaster cars. Monkeys were also used on the cars. Elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;("Routine 3N: Line Plots", HCOB 14 July 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Hoipolloi used "fantastic motion" as well as "blasts of raw electricity and explosions" to brainwash the thetans into accepting the Gorilla Goals, with the goals including "To End", "To be Dead", "To be Asleep", "To be Solid", "To be Sexual" and so on.

===Bear Goals===
The Bear Goals were very similar to the Gorilla Goals, except that "instead of a mechanical gorilla a mechanical or live bear was used, and the motion was even more violent". They were implanted by "a group called "The Brothers of the Bear" and were the ancestors of the Hoipolloi".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Invisible Picture Goals===
The Invisible Picture Goals were implanted by an early race of alien implanters some time between "110,000 trillion trillion&lt;ref name=quad/&gt; years ago or earlier to 390 trillion trillion&lt;ref name=quad/&gt; years ago". They comprised brainwashing of captive thetans by showing them pictures of diametrically opposed goals such as "Wake, Never Wake, Sleep, Never Sleep", as well as invisible pictures to confuse the thetan. The other pictures would "consist usually of a scene of a cave, a railway, an airplane, a view of a sun and planets".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, HCOB July 14, 1963, ''Routine 3N, Line Plots''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train Goals===
Devised by the [[Marcab Confederacy|Marcabians]] and implemented between "hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago", the Train Goals were a series of implants given in a huge train station. The thetan was put into "a railway carriage quite like a British railway coach with compartments" and subjected to a barrage of "white energy". During the implant sequence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a face may come up and say "You still here? Get out. Get off this train. We hate you." And from the speakers "This happened to you yesterday, tomorrow, now. This is your departure point, keep coming back. You'll be meeting all your friends here. When you're killed and dead keep coming back. You haven't a chance to get away. You've got to report in. This happened to you days ago, weeks ago, years ago. You don't know when this happened to you. We hate you. Get out. Don't ever come back."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, HCOB 24 August 1963, ''Routine 3N - The Train GPMs - The Marcab Between Lives Implants''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black Thetan Goals===
The Black Thetan Goals, also known as the Glade Implants, were implanted between "390 trillion trillion&lt;ref name=quad&gt;Quadrillion (billion billion) in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]].&lt;/ref&gt; years to 370 trillion trillion&lt;ref name=quad/&gt; years ago". According to Hubbard, they were "in a glade surrounded by the stone heads of "black thetans" who spat white energy at the trapped thetan". The goals included such things as "To End, To be Dead, To be Asleep" and so on.

===Heaven Implants===
The Heaven Implants were given "43,891,832,611,177&amp;nbsp;years, 344&amp;nbsp;days, 10&amp;nbsp;hours, 20&amp;nbsp;minutes and 40&amp;nbsp;seconds from 10:{{frac|02|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;P.M. Daylight [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich Time]] May 9, 1963." They comprised two series of views of Heaven, the first of which was quite positive: Hubbard compares Heaven to "[[Busch Gardens]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]". In the second series, Heaven had become a lot shabbier:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The place is shabby. The vegetation is gone. The pillars are scruffy. The saints have vanished. So have the Angels. A sign on one (the left as you "enter") says "This is Heaven". The right has a sign "Hell" with an arrow and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archaeological diggings with raw terraces, that lead to "Hell".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hubbard reported that he had encountered no "devils or satans". Heaven was, however, not quite as conventionally depicted, and took the form of a town which "consisted of a trolley bus, some building fronts, sidewalks, train tracks, a boarding house, a bistro in a basement where there is a 'bulletin board' well lighted, and a BANK BUILDING." Hubbard described how the second series of Heaven implants depicts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a passenger getting on the trolley bus, a "workman" halfway down the first stairs of To Forget "eating lunch" and in To Be in Heaven a gardener or electrician adjusting an implant box behind a hedge and periodically leaping up and screaming.&lt;br /&gt;("Heaven", HCOB May 11, 1963)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After being ridiculed in the [[Anderson Report]] (an Australian public inquiry into Scientology), this bulletin was withdrawn from circulation.

===Helatrobus Implants===
These were implanted by the inhabitants of the planet [[Helatrobus]], some "382 trillion&lt;ref name=tril/&gt; years ago to 52 trillion&lt;ref name=tril/&gt; years ago". The Helatrobans were motivated by a fear of free thetans and sought to restrain them by capturing and brainwashing thetans in order to weaken them. In a series of lectures, Hubbard goes into some detail about how this was done:

[[File:Large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Planets were surrounded suddenly by radioactive cloud masses. And very often a long time before the planet came under attack from these implant people, waves of radioactive clouds, Magellanic clouds, black and gray, would sweep over and engulf the planet, and it would be living in an atmosphere of radioactivity, which was highly antipathetic to the living beings, bodies, plants, anything else that was on this planet.
And so planetary systems would become engulfed in radioactive masses, gray and black. And the earmarks of such a planetary action was gray and black &amp;ndash; gray towering masses of clouds. These Magellanic clouds would not otherwise have come anywhere near a planetary system.&lt;br /&gt;("State of OT")&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When a planet had been engulfed, the Helatrobans would attack it with "little orange-colored bombs that would talk" and the clouds themselves would talk: "And here you'd have a gray cloud going by and it'd be saying, 'Hark! Hark! Hark!' you see? 'Watch out! Look out! Who's there? Who's that?'"

Hapless people on the planet's surface would be kidnapped using a small capsule "placed at will in space. It shot out a large bubble, the being would grab at the bubble or strike at it and be sucked at once into the capsule. Then the capsule would be retracted into an aircraft." A victim would then be implanted for up to six months and the Helatrobans would "fix him on a post in a big bunch of stuff ... put him on a post and wobbled him around and ran him through this implant of goals on a little monowheel. Little monowheel pole trap. And it had the effigy of a body on it." ("State of OT")

===Obscene Dog Incident===
In the "Assists" lecture of October 3, 1968, Hubbard described a surreal cosmological event said to take place shortly after Incident I (the creation of the universe): "There's the incident called "The Obscene Dog" with its just a little bit later than Incident One. And sometimes actually by running it, why you can get the PC into Incident One. The Obscene Dog was a sort of a brass dog in a sitting position and anybody who got around to the front of the dog got caught in some electronic current and passed through the dog to the dog's rear end and spat out. Thetans didn't like this."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/multimedia.html#obscdog Operation Clambake present: Hubbard Audio Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Islamic Party of Azerbaijan''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan İslam Partiyası}} or ''AİP'') was an [[Islamic party]] in [[Azerbaijan]].
The Islamic Party of Azerbaijan was founded in 1991 in the town of [[Nardaran]], which lies northeast of the capital [[Baku]] on the [[Absheron Peninsula]], and is a lone stronghold of conservative [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]] in staunchly secular and religiously progressive Azerbaijan,{{cn|date=December 2017}} and was officially registered in 1992. Its registration, however, was cancelled in 1995, and has not been reinstated since.

It advocated stronger ties with [[Iran]] and even proclaiming the state of Azerbaijan into an [[Islamic Republic]] as it rejected the ideas of [[pan-Turkism]], regarding them as dangerous and utopian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=7&amp;issue_id=436&amp;article_id=3753 Jamestown.org Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it was also an [[Azerbaijani nationalism|Azerbaijani nationalist]] party and was known for its fiery nationalist and [[Anti-Armenianism|anti-Armenian]] rhetoric and frequently advocated a military solution to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] which is currently under Armenian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?14188-Islamic-Party-of-Azerbaijan-for-military-solution-of-Karabakh ISLAMIC PARTY OF AZERBAIJAN FOR MILITARY SOLUTION OF KARABAKH PROBLEM]&lt;/ref&gt; It was fiercely opposed and advocated a ban of [[proselytism]] and Christian [[missionary]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58732534.html Article: AZERBAIJAN: AZERBAIJAN'S ISLAMIC PARTY WANTS CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES BANNED.(Brief Article)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was also [[Anti-Americanism|anti-US]], [[anti-Zionist]] and [[anti-EU]] and supported [[Hezbollah]] and its leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]. The leader of the party was [[Movsum Samadov]].

In 1995, the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan and the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] were respectively accused by the [[government of Azerbaijan]] of being covertly financed by some people in Iran, and Iran of covertly financing it, which Azerbaijan regarded as an interference in its domestic affairs, and which is illegal under [[Law of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani law]]. Therefore, the leaders of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan were arrested and the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan was officially banned. Subsequently under the updated secular [[Law of Azerbaijan|laws of Azerbaijan]], Islamic parties and the formation of Islamic parties are now banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/64_folder/64_articles/64_socar_ilham.html Article: Where We Stand Now by Ilham Aliyev]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 7 October 2011, Haci Movsum Samadov, one of the leaders of the defunct Islamic Party of Azerbaijan was sentenced to 12 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azernews.az/en/Nation/37201-Azeri_Islamic_party_leader_sentenced_to_12_years_in_jail Azeri Islamic party leader sentenced to 12 years in jail] AzerNews.az&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Jacob's Ladder'''" is a 1986 song written by [[Bruce Hornsby]] and his brother [[John Hornsby]] and recorded by [[Huey Lewis and the News]]. It became a number-one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1987,&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24879441.html?dids=24879441:24879441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Mar+13%2C+1987&amp;author=Jan+DeKnock&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=HUEY+LEWIS+%26+NEWS+CLIMB+'JACOB'S+LADDER'+TO+THE+TOP&amp;pqatl=google|title=Huey Lewis &amp; News Climb 'Jacob's Ladder' to the Top|date=1987-03-13|author=DeKnock, Jan|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the band's third.

==Composition and recording==
Set in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], the song marries the [[Bible|Biblical]] image of [[Jacob's Ladder]] to someone who rejects [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s and is instead struggling to get through life one day at a time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung, climbing Jacob's ladder.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The song was given by Hornsby to his friend Lewis, and it appeared on the group's September 1986 album ''[[Fore!]]''. The song was originally meant for an album for Hornsby that Lewis was producing.&lt;ref name=Horns&gt;http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&amp;A: October 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby didn't like the version that the arrangement his band played but suggested that Lewis play it that way for his upcoming album.&lt;ref name=Horns/&gt; It was the third single released from the album, and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for a week in March 1987.&lt;ref name=Trib /&gt;

A music video was filmed of the band performing the song in a live concert.

Bruce Hornsby later recorded his own rendition of the song for his 1988 album, ''[[Scenes from the Southside]]''.  It became part of his concert repertoire as well; a live bluegrass-influenced version (very different from the version on ''Scenes from the Southside'') appears on the 2006 album ''[[Intersections (1985–2005)]]'', which Hornsby performed with his brother [[John Hornsby|John]].

The location, on the outside of [[Rajagriha]] just below the [[Gijjhakuta hill]], was originally a [[mango]] orchard which was donated to the [[samgha]] by the famous royal doctor [[Jivaka]], who was in the service of king [[Bimbisara]].&lt;ref name=BA48/&gt; Jivaka built a monastery on the location and also donated it to the samgha.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Survey of India [[:File:Jivakarama ASI notice.jpg|on-site notice]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddha]] is said to have been treated once in the monastery, after having been injured by [[Devadatta]].&lt;ref name=BA48/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Monuments of Bihar |date=2011 |publisher=Department of Art, Culture &amp; Youth, Government of Bihar |pages=Jivakarama vihara entry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1cdp3hsUXgC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial monastery was formed of two long parallel and oblong halls, large dormitories where the monks could eat and sleep, in conformity with the original regulations of the [[samgha]], without any private cells.&lt;ref name=BA48/&gt; Other halls were then constructed, mostly long, oblong building as well, which remind of the oblong construction of several of the [[Barabar caves]].&lt;ref name=BA48/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Handa |first1=O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">'''Junrei''' (巡礼) is the word most commonly used for either of two major types of [[pilgrimage]]s in [[Japan]], in accordance with [[Buddhism]] or [[Shinto]]. These pilgrimages can be made as a visit to a group of [[temple]]s, [[Jinja (Shinto)|shrines]], or other holy sites, in a particular order, often in a circuit of 33 or 88 sites. Other pilgrimages may center on a pilgrimage to a single site. One of the most popular pilgrimages for Buddhists in Japan is visiting the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage|88 temples]] on [[Shikoku]].

Pilgrimages can be organized by [[tour bus]] companies, taking only a couple of weeks to complete, although many pilgrims prefer to take the two- or three-month-long journeys on foot in the traditional manner.  Pilgrims on the Shikoku ''junrei'' are referred to as ''henro'' (遍路) and traditionally wear [[straw hat]]s and white clothing.

==Traditional observances==
There are a number of rules traditionally observed while on a ''junrei''.

*Say the name of Kōbō-Daishi following one's devotion it is preceded every thing. (Kōbō-Daishi is [[Kūkai]]'s [[posthumous name]])
*Pilgrimage as the ascetic.
*Must not kill any living things.
*Must not say immoral things to women.
*Have some medicines for your unexpected bad condition.
*Must not drink any alcohol.
*Do not quarrel with your partner.
*Do not have a lot of money.
*Do not have unnecessary baggage.
*Pay attention to your food hygiene.
*Go to an inn before it gets dark.
*Must not go out of an inn during the night.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Kaumaram''' focuses on the deity Kumara, also known as Murugan, Skanda, Subramaniyam or [[Kartikeya]]. However, most devotees of Kumara also revere members of his family: Parvati, Shiva and Ganesha. The important theological texts relating to Kumara are a part of the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Shaiva agama]] canon. This sub-tradition is found in South India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and among the [[Tamil diaspora]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA417|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=417–418, 137, 198–199, 241, 425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Kaumaram'' also means "childhood, youth" in Hindu texts, as in verse 2.13 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Winthrop Sargeant|author2=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Revised Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHTmRSnoGp4C|year=1984|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-831-8|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes a substitute for [[Brahmacharya]] stage of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Suresh Chandra|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfTE6kpz6XEC&amp;pg=PA63|year=1998|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-039-9|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Authority Seventies===
Those listed in this section are members of the First or Second Quorum of the Seventy. While each is assigned to a specific quorum, that affiliation is no longer being made public, with all General Authority Seventies being referred to with that generic designation.&lt;ref&gt;Shortly after the April 2016 General Conference, the biographies of all General Authorities were changed to reflect this alteration in Church policy. See [https://www.lds.org/church/leaders/list?lang=eng this link] for verification.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emeritus===
[[Emeritus]] General Authorities are General Authorities who have been released from their positions in the hierarchy. They remain General Authorities until their deaths. All current emeritus General Authorities are former members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventies or of the Presiding Bishopric.

When the first General Authorities were given emeritus status, [[N. Eldon Tanner]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] provided the following explanation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The very rapid growth of the Church across the world, with the attendant increase in travel and responsibility, has made it necessary to consider a change in the status for some of the Brethren of the General Authorities. Some of our associates have served for many years with complete and unselfish dedication, and they deserve every honor and recognition for such devoted service. It is felt advisable at this time to reduce somewhat the load of responsibility that they carry.&lt;br /&gt;
"After a long period of prayerful consideration and counsel, extending, indeed, over several years, we announce a new and specific status to be given from time to time to Brethren of our associates in the General Authorities. We announce that some Brethren have been designated as emeritus members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. These Brethren are not being released but will be excused from active service. It is out of consideration for the personal well-being of the individuals, and with deep appreciation for their devoted service, that this designation will be given from time to time to designated members of the General Authorities." &lt;ref&gt;N. Eldon Tanner, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/11/revelation-on-priesthood-accepted-church-officers-sustained "Revelation on Priesthood Accepted, Church Officers Sustained"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]], November 1978, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47358">{{Joseph Smith, Jr.}}
[[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], is viewed by adherents of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] as a [[prophet]] in the tradition of the ancient prophets recorded in the [[Bible]]. During his life, Smith made several prophecies, many documented in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], a book of scripture in several [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement]].

There is much dispute surrounding the known and alleged prophecies of Smith. Some critics contend that Smith could not be a genuine prophet because they claim that some of his prophecies did not come true.&lt;ref name="Abanes 2003 461-467"&gt;{{Cite book|

|url=http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/falseprophecies.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latter Day Saint adherents have responded to these claims by putting forth the following six arguments:

#some prophecies that critics claim have failed have actually been fulfilled;
#some of Smith's statements have been mischaracterized as "prophecies";
#some prophetic statements ascribed to Smith have not been verified as legitimate by either Latter Day Saint or non–Latter Day Saint historians;
#some prophecies should be interpreted metaphorically, not literally;
#some legitimate prophecies were conditional and did not happen because the conditions precedent to those prophesies were not satisfied; and
#some legitimate prophecies remain unfulfilled but are expected to be fulfilled in the future.

| '''Smith spoken of for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues''': Smith wrote that in 1823, [[angel Moroni|an angel]] visited him and made prophetic statements regarding Smith's future. "He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people." Smith recorded the incident in 1838.

|| September 21, 1823 (reported in 1838)
|| Latter Day Saints claim that this prophecy has been fulfilled. As evidence, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has cited discussions of Smith by American, German and Finnish scholars, as well as the LDS Church's extensive [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] program, which leads many people around the world to speak of Smith for both good and ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haroldsen|first=Edwin O.|title='Good and Evil Spoken Of'|journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|date=August 1995|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/08/good-and-evil-spoken-of|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''Three witnesses to testify of the Book of Mormon''': At the request of [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], who desired to witness the golden plates containing the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith received the revelation that "the testimony of three witnesses would be sent forth of God's word." By the time the revelation was given, neither [[Oliver Cowdery]] nor [[David Whitmer]] (the two remaining witnesses and later supporters) had met Smith.

|-
|| '''Zion in this generation''': Zion and its temple will be built at Independence, Missouri, "in this generation".
| {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 84|verse=2}}
|| September 22 or 23, 1832
|| The precise site dedicated by Smith for the construction of the temple at Independence is the [[Temple Lot]]; it is currently vacant and owned by the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]]. Members of the LDS Church believe that a temple will be built at this location in the future.

One oft repeated explanation of the supposed non-fulfillment of this prophecy is that the phrase "in this generation" is used figuratively to designate those of this "gospel dispensation" (those who have received or will receive divine revelation during the "dispensation" of revelation and inspiration from God (or "heaven") since the time that Joseph Smith began receiving such revelation, and afterwards, (as it is used in a similar fashion in some instances in the Bible).

Another plausible explanation that this prophecy was fulfilled can be taken at face value from this revelation (D&amp;C 84), in that it was received in Kirtland, Ohio. And though verse 3 indicates that the place of the temple (in Independence, MO) was indicated "by the finger of the Lord" (previously), the phrase in verse 4 "beginning at this place" is rather a transition of reference to Kirtland, Ohio, where Joseph Smith was at when this revelation was received by him&lt;ref&gt;Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, September 22 and 23, 1832.  HC 1:286–295. (Doctrine and Covenants | Section 84:Heading)&lt;/ref&gt; And, indeed, the Kirtland Temple was built and finished and dedicated by the spring of 1836.

The reference to building "New Jerusalem" in this context then is not one of physical edifices (though the 'temple' being reared "in this generation" was, but occurred in Kirtland, OH, and not in Independence, or Jackson County, MO)—but, rather indicated that 'building' or developing the future inhabitants of that city (yet to be built physically) began in earnest, spiritually, by the reception of priesthood keys,&lt;ref&gt;spiritual keys given by Moses, "Elias", [all either 'translated' beings] and Elijah on April 6, 1836 in the Kirtland Temple by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery - see D&amp;C 110)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as priesthood organization of quorums, and temple practices and ordinances revealed by Joseph Smith to holders of both the Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood among duly ordained male members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Kirtland who received these things were begun in the temple there, Ohio finished within four years from the year this prophecy was given.&lt;ref name="en.fairmormon.org"/&gt;

The Community of Christ has constructed the [[Independence Temple]] on the Greater Temple Lot.

|| Richard Abanes contends that this prophecy was not fulfilled because both cities still exist.&lt;ref name="Abanes, p 463"&gt;Abanes, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; But Latter Day Saints believe that the conditions precedent for this prophecy were not fulfilled, because the gospel was accepted, not rejected, in both New York and Boston.

| {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 87}}
|| December 25, 1832
||    Latter Day Saints believe that the [[American Civil War]] fulfilled this prophecy, in part: it was a war between the northern and the southern states, the war began in South Carolina, and the southern states did call upon the United Kingdom for military assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Peterson | first = Paul H. | contribution = Civil War Prophecy | contribution-url = http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5606 | pages = 287–288 | editor1-last = Ludlow | editor1-first = Daniel H | editor1-link = Daniel H.

One non-Mormon who referenced the destruction was [[General Alexander Doniphan]], who, when he saw the burned homes in Missouri, said he recalled Smith's words when he, Smith, advised him not to purchase land in that region. “The fields and farms and houses will be destroyed, and only the chimneys will be left to mark the desolation, Smith said.” Later, Donaphan observed: “In the spring of 1862 my regiment went south, and it was during that time that ‘Order No. 11’ was issued ... [when] I went down the Blue river, we found houses, barns, outbuildings, nearly all burned down, and nothing left standing but the chimneys....

||'''Wind up in 56 Years''' "[T]he coming of the Lord, which is nigh—even fifty-six years should wind up the scene."
| ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of Church]]'' '''2''':182
|| February 14, 1835
|| Critic [[Richard Abanes]] claims this prophecy was not fulfilled because the Second Coming of Jesus did not happen within 56 years of the statement.&lt;ref name="Abanes, p 464"/&gt; Latter Day Saints claim that this was not necessarily a prophecy because it was not contained in a revelation and that Smith may have been expressing an opinion on the timing of the Second Coming.

In 1843, Smith related the following: "I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following: Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter. I was left thus, without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or whether I should die and thus see his face. I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.14-17?lang=eng#13 Doctrine and Covenants 130:14–17].&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter Day Saints argue that in this later instance, Smith did not claim to know the timing of the Second Coming, which should cause us to question whether his 1835 statement was a prophetic statement.

|-
|| '''Wealth from Salem''': Smith would receive "wealth pertaining to gold and silver" in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].
| {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 111|verse=4}}
|| August 4, 1836
|| Latter Day Saints argue that the revelation did not say that Smith would receive the wealth on his 1836 trip to Salem, but rather that it would occur "in due time". The LDS Church teaches that "in Salem was a treasure of much greater value to the kingdom than that for which they had come. There were many souls in Salem whom the Lord knew would accept the gospel. ... [in the early 1840s,] Elder [Erastus] Snow baptized over one hundred people" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Church Educational System, 2001) at § 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

|| July 23, 1837
|| Though Marsh was excommunicated shortly thereafter,&lt;ref name="Abanes, p 465"&gt;Abanes, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; in 1857, he was rebaptized into the LDS Church. Marsh wrote an autobiography in 1864, documenting his significant missionary service. Latter Day Saints therefore believe that the prophecy was fulfilled as it pertains to Marsh's preaching.&lt;ref name="en.fairmormon.org"/&gt;

| '''Oliver Granger''': "And again, I say unto you, I remember my servant [[Oliver Granger]]; behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord."
|| {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 117|verse=12|range=-15}}
|| July 8, 1838
|| One member of the LDS Church has written: "The surest evidence that Oliver Granger is held in sacred remembrance is that his name is included in one of our four (4) most sacred books constituting the Standard Works, the Doctrine and Covenants. This, in itself, fulfills the prophecy."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Gibson, [http://www.lightplanet.com/response/answers/olivergranger.htm "Is Oliver Granger's Name Forgotten?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Mormon apologist has argued that "the words 'sacred remembrance' most likely refer to the fact that the ''Lord'' would remember him. After all, the verse begins with the Lord saying, 'I remember my servant Oliver Granger.'"&lt;ref&gt;John A.

|-
|| '''Enemies punished''': While in prison, God stated through Smith that "cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed", that Smith's enemies would be taken "in their own craftiness", and that "not many years hence ... [they] and their posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall".
| {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 121|verse=11}}
|| March 20, 1839
|| The meaning of this prophecy, its referenced target, and the extent of its fulfillment has long been controversial.

Latter Day Saints argue that the unfortunate events which befell some of Smith's enemies is evidence that the prophecy was fulfilled.&lt;ref name="en.fairmormon.org"/&gt;  Another argument set forth by adherents is that the prophecy applied more to spiritual punishments in the afterlife rather than temporal punishments.&lt;ref name="en.fairmormon.org"/&gt;

|| '''Orson Hyde's Dedicatory Prayer[At the Request of Joseph Smith]''': On October 24, 1841, [[Orson Hyde]] dedicated the Holy Land for the return of Judah and the House of Israel generally at the request of Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith said "In due time thou shalt go to Jerusalem, the land of thy fathers, and be a watchman unto the house of Israel; and by thy hands shall the Most High do a great work, which shall prepare the way and greatly facilitate the gathering together of that people." During the 1840 April church conference, Joseph Smith commissioned Elder Hyde to go to Palestine and there dedicate that land for the return of the Jewish people. Jews "Have been scattered abroad among the Gentiles for a long period; and in our estimation, the time of the commencement of their return to the Holy Land has already arrived."

|| ''' [[White Horse Prophecy]] ''': A lengthy discourse in which Smith reportedly said, "You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber ... and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse"; and that the temple in Jackson County, Missouri, "will be built in this generation."

|| ''' Government Overthrown''': "I prophesy in the name of the Lord God of Israel, unless the United States redress the wrongs committed upon the Saints in the state of Missouri and punish the crimes committed by her officers that in a few years the government will be utterly overthrown and wasted, and there will not be so much as a potsherd left for their wickedness."
| ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''5''':394
|| May 18, 1843
|| Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled;&lt;ref name="Abanes, p 466"/&gt; however, in 1861, the secession of [[Missouri]] was in dispute. During the war, Missouri was claimed by both the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and had two competing [[State governments of the United States|state governments]], sending representatives to both the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]]. Missouri was hotly contested during the war and her Confederate government was utterly overthrown and wasted when the state was laid waste by Union troops. Many people who had driven the saints from their homes were themselves ousted and their property burned, their livestock slaughtered or confiscated under [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order 11]]. Other Latter Day Saints argue that Smith may have been referring to the rulling [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which was defeated in the [[United States presidential election, 1852|presidential election of 1852]], later to dissolve and disappear from the political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_prophecies.shtml|accessdate=1 December 2017|title=Fulfilled Prophecies of Joseph Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other Latter Day Saints argue that formal apologies have been delivered to the Saints by government officials, including an official apology from Missouri in 1976. They argue that allowing Utah—which was dominated by Latter Day Saints—to obtain statehood in 1896 could be regarded as "redress" of the wrongs committed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

| '''Dr. Richards will not have hole in garment''': Shortly before his imprisonment in [[Carthage Jail]], Smith told [[Willard Richards]] that the time would come that the balls would fly around him like hail, and he should see his friends fall on the right and on the left, but that there should not be a hole in his garment.
|| ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''6''':619
|| July 1844
|| Latter Day Saints believe that this prophecy was fulfilled. Although he was in the room where Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were shot and killed, Richards escaped from the incident uninjured. [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], who was also present in the room, was shot a number of times but survived.

| '''Joseph and Hyrum Smith to die if re-captured''': Five days before his death, Smith wrote: "I told Stephen Markham that if I and Hyrum were ever taken again we should be massacred, or I was not a prophet of God"
|| ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''6''':546
|| July 22, 1844

| '''Dan Jones to serve a mission to Wales''':  This is commonly referred to as Smith's "last prophecy" and took place in [[Carthage Jail]] the night before Smith was killed.

|| ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''6''':601
|| July 26 or 27, 1844
|| Latter Day Saints believe this prophecy was fulfilled. Although Jones was ill and believed to be dying of an illness at the time of his conversation with Smith,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Jones recovered and later went to Wales as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] for the LDS Church.

[[Image:Our Lady of China MS.JPG|310px|thumb|[[Statue]] of Our Lady of China at the National Shrine of Our Lady of China, Meishan (梅山鄉) CHIAYI, Taiwan]]
'''Our Lady of China''' ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 中华圣母, [[Traditional Chinese]]: 中華聖母, [[pinyin]]: ''Zhōnghuá Shèngmǔ'') is the name given to an [[Marian apparition|apparition]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in [[Donglu]], [[China]], first appearing in 1900.

==History==
At the close of the 1924 Shanghai Synod of Bishops in China, the first national conference of bishops in the country,  Archbishop [[Celso Costantini]] (剛恆毅), Apostolic Delegate in China, along with all the bishops of China, consecrated the Chinese people to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1941, Pope [[Pius XII]] designated the feast day as an official feast of the Catholic liturgical calendar.&lt;ref name=Kung&gt;[http://www.cardinalkungfoundation.org/pm/PMourladyofchina.php "Our Lady of China", The Cardinal Kung Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, following the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Chinese Bishops conference, upon approval from the Holy See, placed the feast day on the [[vigil]] (day preceding) of [[Mothers Day]] (the second Sunday of May).&lt;ref name=Kung/&gt;

==The Apparition==
During the [[Boxer Rebellion]], a great number of soldiers attacked the village of [[Donglu]], Hebei. The village consisted of a small community of Christians founded by the Vincentian Fathers. The Virgin Mary appeared in white, and a fiery horseman (believed to be St Michael) chased away the soldiers. The pastor, Fr Wu, commissioned a painting of Mary with Christ child dressed in golden imperial robes. This painting became the image of Our Lady, Queen of China. Donglu became a place of pilgrimage in 1924. The image was blessed and promulgated by Pope Pius XI in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicansmacau.org/?p=2280 "Our Lady, Queen of China", St Dominic's Priory, Macau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
There is a [[mosaic]] of Our Lady of China in the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, DC, established and dedicated in 2002 under the Most Rev. Michael J. Bransfield &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalshrine.com/site/c.osJRKVPBJnH/b.4953557/k.7180/Upper_Church_Floor_Plan.htm Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate conception]&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some controversy because the image used in the mosaic is not the officially approved image of Our Lady of China, but instead uses the image of Our Lady of China and Baby Jesus painted by John Lu Hung Nien. The late Cardinal Thomas Tien Keng-Hsin, the first Chinese Cardinal, used this image for the prayer card for the persecuted in China, which was widely promoted in the U.S.A. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/yq2/yq328.html "Our Lady of China", The Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several churches, chapels, and pastoral centers around the world, predominantly those focused on ministry to [[Chinese language|Chinese-speaking]] [[Catholics]], have adopted the name, including a mission in [[Washington, DC]]. St. Genevieve's Chinese Roman Catholic Church, Fresno, California also honors Our Lady of China. There is a Chapel of Our Lady of China in the Diocese of Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olc.faithweb.com/ R.C. Our Lady of China Chapel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines where the Chinese and Chinese-Filipinos comprise the biggest ethnic community, the Santa Maria Parish of the Jesuit Fathers, located at the old Ateneo campus in Iloilo City, is the only church in the country dedicated to Our Lady of China that is duly recognized by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). The Archdiocesan Shrine of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in D. Jakosalem, Cebu City, still by the Jesuits, also houses an image of Our Lady of China. It used to be dedicated to this title of Our Lady until the patronage was changed to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Although Binondo in Manila is the country's Chinese capital, both the Minor Basilica of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz (Filipino Parish) and the Binondo Chinese Parish does not house an image of the Chinese Madonna (as clarified by representatives of both parishes). As of April 2015, images of Our Lady of China (sometimes referred to as Our Lady of Sheshan) can be found at the following Chinese-Filipino Catholic communities: Santa Maria Parish-Our Lady of China, Iloilo City; Archdiocesan Shrine of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Cebu City; Saint Peter the Apostle Parish, Paco, Manila; Lorenzo Ruiz Mission Society Seminary, Manila; Saint Jude Catholic School (National Shrine of Saint Jude Thaddeus), Manila and Queen of Peace Parish, Bacolod City.

The [[Our Lady of Sheshan]] is another, similar apparition which has attained like acclamation and fame among Chinese Christians.

'''Our Lady of Salvation''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de Salvación}}), also known as '''Our Lady of Light''', is a [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Titles of Mary|title]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]]. The devotion to Our Lady of Salvation is based on a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary that was first venerated in Joroan (now part of [[Tiwi, Albay]]) in the [[Philippines]]. The image was [[canonical coronation|canonically crowned]] by the Catholic Church on 25 August 1976, as the heavenly [[Patron saint|patroness]] of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Albay (province)|Albay]].&lt;ref name="ourlady0"&gt;de Leon (1988). p I. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rationale&gt;de Leon (1988) p III&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The original, 18th-century image of Our Lady of Salvation reflects her role, according to Catholic doctrine, as Co-Redemptrix. The Virgin is portrayed as carrying the Christ Child in her left arm, while her right arm grasps a man&lt;ref group=note&gt;The man portrayed in the original image as being saved from the devil is usually misinterpreted as a child.&lt;/ref&gt; by the wrist as he is about to fall into a gaping [[Hellmouth]]. An angel kneels at the foot of the Virgin, offering a basket of burning hearts to Christ, who holds a burning heart in his right hand, while his left hand is stretched in a gesture of accepting the hearts.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;[http://shrines.healthypinoy.com/luzon/our-lady-of-salvation.php Diocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Salvation] ''shrines.healthypinoy.com'' accessed May 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Our Lady of Salvation.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The original image of Our Lady of Salvation]]
Much of the history regarding the statue of the Lady of Salvation and the Marian devotion centered on it rely heavily on the written accounts, based on tradition, of the first [[parish priest]] of Joroan, Rev Lamberto S. Fulay (1919–1935), in his booklet ''An Kasaysayan Kan Ladawan Ni Birhen de Salvacion''.&lt;ref name="ourlady0"/&gt;

===The ''Calpi'' tree===
According to the Fulay account, in the 1770s a certain ''[[hacienda|haciendero]]'' named ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Silverio Arcilla of [[Buhi, Camarines Sur|Buhi]], assigned a [[tenant farmer]] called Mariano Dacoba, to one of his vast estates in Joroan (once known as Cagnipa), which was a satellite ''[[barangay|barrio]]'' of Buhi. While Dacoba was clearing parts of Arcilla's ''hacienda'' one day, he chopped down a big ''Calpi'' tree. Although already severed at the base, the tree's leaves did not wilt and maintained its life and freshness. The tenant informed Arcilla about it, and the latter consulted with the pastor of Buhi.&lt;ref name=ourlady2&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=albay&gt;[http://tourism.albay.gov.ph/joroanchurch.htm Nuestra Señora de Salvación and Joroan] Albay Tourism Website accessed May 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Joroan was under the jurisdiction of Buhi during the Spanish colonial period&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain sculptor called Bagacumba was commissioned by the pastor of Buhi to carve an image from the Calpi trunk that Dacoba had found. Three images were carved out of the wood: that of Our Lady of Salvation, one of Our Lady of Solitude, and that of [[Saint Anthony of Padua]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The statues of Our Lady of Salvation, [[María de la Soledad|Our Lady of Solitude]], and St. Anthony of Padua were given to the barrios of Joroan, Buhi, and Tambo respectively&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 1776, the image of Our Lady of Salvation was lent to Joroan on condition that the village's residents build a chapel at the centre of their ''[[barangay|barrio]]''. Consequently, a certain Sotera Cababag was assigned as the chapel's ''Hermana Mayor'', in charge of caring for the image.&lt;ref name=ourlady2&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1853 agreement===
Buhi was initially the image's rightful owner as Arcilla (who owned the land the statue's wood came from), the parish priest who had it commissioned, and the sculptor were all from the town. On 21 January 1853, Buhi and Joroan had an agreement transferring rights over the image to the latter. Buhi's parish priest and ''Gobernadorcillo'', Rev Antonio Guadalajara and Mariano Buenaflor, respectively, made the pact with Joroan's [[barrio lieutenant]]s. In accordance with the agreement, Buhi surrendered all its rights over the image if the people of Joroan made an offering of fifty [[Philippine peso|pesos]], and an additional twenty-five for a bell.&lt;ref name=pesos&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miracles===

====First miracle====
Joroan, according to Fulay, was often the target of [[Moro people|Muslim]] marauders due to its proximity to the sea. During an attack, the people of Joroan would flock to the image and pray to the Virgin for protection. Tradition notes that Muslims pillaging Joroan would constantly fail to ignite houses, and this was attributed to the Virgin.&lt;ref name=ourlady2&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Fulay, the exact period of the phenomenon of the torch is unknown, although he suggests that it was sometime during the reign of Manuel Grivaljo as Bishop of the See of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Caceres|Nueva Cáceres]] (1748-1761)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliverance of ''Hermana'' Tiray====
The second miracle was when a ''Hermana Mayora'' known only as Tiray was captured in a Moro raid. After a year of being held captive in [[Sulu]], Tiray fell into a deep sleep and upon waking up, had realised that she was not in her quarters but was standing in an unknown forest. She then saw in a strange, white deer in the woods, which she, out of curiosity, followed through the mountains until she lost sight of it. Tiray discovered that she had already been miraculously transported to [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]], and was now only 38&amp;nbsp;km away from Joroan. After this incident, the people of Joroan moved the chapel further away from the sea to a higher location in the mountains, in order to avoid its desecration by raiders.&lt;ref name=ourlady2/&gt;

====Apparition====
[[File:Joroan Beach.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The Beaches of Joroan, where Muslim raiders mounted their attacks, was also where folklore situates the apparition of Our Lady of Salvation.]]
The third miracle was an apparition of Our Lady of Salvation. Four devotees from the island of [[Catanduanes]] went on a pilgrimage to Joroan, bringing along with them a set of beeswax candles which they intended to offer at the shrine. Upon reaching shore, three of them made a detour to Buhi to light candles for Saint Anthony, while the fourth pilgrim was left to guard their boat. As the fourth man strolled along the beach at dusk, he met a woman carrying her child. The woman asked him for a candle that she may light her way home to the mountains, as it was almost dark. The man refused since the candle was not his, but the woman was insistent and promised that she would return the candle the next morning if he would come to her house uphill. Out of generosity, the man acquiesced to the lady, who told him he can the next day enquire where she lived from the town lieutenant of Joroan, so that she can return him his candle.

The next day, the man did as he was told, but the town lieutenant did not know where the mysterious lady lived. The lieutenant referred the pilgrim to the ''Hermana Mayor'', who was also of no help, save for advising the man to seek divine guidance at the chapel of Our Lady of Salvation. Upon arriving at the chapel, the pilgrim was surprised when, at the foot of the image, lay unused and unlit exactly the same candle which he had lent the mysterious lady the day before. Upon seeing that the image resembled the mysterious woman, the man was filled with [[compunction]]. and after leaving the candle alone, prostrated and asked the Virgin to pray for his sins.&lt;ref name=ourlady4&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Muslim raid====
[[File:The Iranun (Ilanun) Moro 'pirate'.jpg|thumb|right|200|A 19th-century illustration of an [[Iranun people|Iranun]] pirate.]]
The fourth miracle attributed to Our Lady of Salvation occurred during the years that a Dominga de los Reyes succeeded Tiray as ''Hermana Mayor''. While on one of their raids, the Moro pirates were said to have retreated almost immediately after seeing a vision of heavily armed men. The vision was said to have traumatised the raiders so much that it was the last Muslim attack on the shores of Joroan.&lt;ref name=ourlady5&gt;de Leon (1988). p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;It can be said that the vision was just a means of scaring the Muslim raiders; no actual army was ever recorded to have been on that occasion, hence an illusion&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Boat====
On the eve of the feast of Our Lady of Salvation in 1884, a group from [[Partido (Philippines)|the Partido]] was sailing to Joroan when a whirlwind attacked the boat. Giant waves almost capsized their boat, which suddenly regained its balance. Even though they were almost dumped into the water, the passengers' clothes were completely dry as though freshly ironed. The people in the boat attributed their escape from death to Our Lady of Salvation.&lt;ref name=ourlady8&gt;de Leon (1988). p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundary dispute===
In the late 19th century, a territorial dispute arose over whether Joroan was governed from Buhi in Ambos Camarines, or [[Tiwi, Albay|Tiwi]] in Albay. A Captain Vera of Albay, however, argued that Tiwi's proximity to Joroan gave it rightful jurisdiction. Vera won the case, and Joroan was annexed by Tiwi.&lt;ref name=ourlady6&gt;de Leon (1988). p 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction of a new church===
Joroan became very peaceful in the 1860s, as the boundary dispute was resolved, and the Muslims no longer attacked the ''barrio''. During this time, ''Doña'' Clara de Vera, the wife of a certain landlord named ''Don'' Vicente de Vera,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Don Vicente de Vera was known in Joroan as a wealthy landlord&lt;/ref&gt; became the image's ''Hermana Mayor''. ''Doña'' Clara vowed to care for the image until her death, and financed its silver and gold plating.&lt;ref name=shrine/&gt;&lt;ref name=ourlady7&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsatisfied with her lifetime service, De Vera initiated constriction of a new church at the centre of the Joroan. In her eagerness to construct, she sought the help of her friend, ''Doña'' Saturnina de Bayot of [[Tabaco, Albay|Tabaco]], to finance the project. Another acquaintance, ''Don'' Manuel Casa of [[Manila]], also contributed greatly, sending the needed materials and an architect. During the long trip to Joroan, the architect Casa had dispatched fell seriously ill, and men had to support him as he supervised construction. After a great deal of pain, the architect was suddenly cured on the ninth day of his work.

===Disputes with Tiwi===
[[File:Tiwi Parish Church, Tiwi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Church in Tiwi where the image was enshrined from 1895 to 1919.]]

====''Traslación''====
After the church was finished, the image was [[Translation (relic)|translated]] from the mountain chapel to the new shrine, beginning the annual custom of the image's ''traslación'' to Tiwi.&lt;ref name=ourlady7/&gt;

The people of Tiwi were also ardent devotees of Our Lady of Salvation. Tradition gives account that whenever the fiesta in Tiwi was approaching, the parish priest would personally retrieve the image from Joroan.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Traslación'' can be generally defined as a Spanish term for an action and effect of moving from place to someone or something&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of the image in Tiwi was a moment of great rejoicing, and a band would accompany its entry into the town.&lt;ref name=ourlady9-1&gt;de Leon (1988). p 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Transportation from Joroan to Tiwi was either by land or by sea. However, a 9km land travel was very difficult during that time due to the lack of proper roads leading to Joroan, so travel by sea was more convenient&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was cut short by the typhoon that devastated Joroan in 1895. The chapel was completely destroyed, but the image was miraculously still standing intact on its pedestal. The people of Joroan reconstructed half of the chapel from the debris, but later on everything deteriorated. A long and bitter rift between the peoples of Joroan and Tiwi began, and since the former was under the rule of the latter, Rev Francisco Borondia took the image to Tiwi until a proper chapel was built in Joroan.&lt;ref name=ourlady9-1&gt;de Leon (1988). p 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

This meant that the direction of the ''traslación'' was reversed, and it was now the people of Joroan who borrowed the image during fiestas&amp;mdash; an arrangement they greatly resented. They almost lost their right to it; that is why they had spent a lot of time, effort, and money to recover it, and had to inevitably incur the ire of the people of Tiwi.&lt;ref name=ourlady9-1/&gt;

====Disputes with Ricardo Sayson====
[[File:Bishop John Bernard McGinley.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Most Rev. John Bernard McGinley, Bishop of Nueva Cáceres and arbiter of the dispute between Tiwi and Joroan over the image.]]
In 1917, Joroan planned to hold a grand celebration from the beginning of the [[novena]] honouring the image up to a few days after the fiesta. On the ninth day, the people of Joroan requested of Rev Ricardo Sayson, the Tiwi parish priest, that the image be allowed to stay a little longer in Joroan so that might make further homage to the Virgin. Sayson refused, and arrogantly taunted the people, daring them to file a complaint at court.&lt;ref name="newparish"&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Joroan drafted a letter to Most Rev John Bernard McGinley, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Caceres|Bishop of Nueva Cáceres]], requesting designation of a separate pastor for Joroan. Pedro Colar I and Lino Clutario were tasked to deliver the request, and immediately set out for the [[episcopal see|see]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], but turned back since McGinley was visiting Albay. The emissaries overtook McGinley in [[Iriga, Albay|Iriga]], but the bishop refused to discuss the matter there, suggesting that they talk about it in [[Malinao, Albay|Malinao]] on 17 November 1917. On the appointed date, Joroan again sent Clutario, this time with Miguel Diolata, and the brothers Felipe and Lorenzo Clutario.&lt;ref name="newparish"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Felipe and Lorenzo Clutario are brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lino Clutario was the group's spokesman, as he had the best command of English. During their audience, Clutario told Bishop McGinley that Joroan wanted a separate pastor for their barrio, and that the image of Our Lady of Salvation be ordered returned to them. The Bishop declined the first request due to a lack of priests in his diocese, but contemplated on the second with the order of the verification of the origin of the image. Another audience was set for two days later, this time with Tiwi as the venue, but nothing favourable for the people of Joroan resulted from the conference. The issue was brought to court, with Narciso Cultivo spearheading the case of the real owner of the image, and Domingo Imperial as lawyer. The civil court however deemed it an ecclesiastical matter and soon dropped it, endorsing the case to Bishop McGinley.&lt;ref name="newparish"/&gt;

====Creation of Joroan Parish====
In 1918, Rev. Tomás Bernales succeeded Sayson as pastor of Tiwi. Bishop McGinley authorised him to settle the dispute with Joroan. In May of that year, Councilor Alfajara and Lieutenant Cultivo of Joroan met with Bernales, and both sides agreed that Joroan was to become a separate parish covering Sogod, Matalibong, Bariis, Maynonong, Misibis, Dapdap, and Mayong. Bishop McGinley was informed of the agreement, and named Rev. Lamberto S. Fulay as its first parish priest. The Parish of Joroan was canonically erected on 18 September 1919, with Fulay assuming duties as curé on 8 October.&lt;ref name="newparish"/&gt;

The image of the Lady of Salvation was still in Tiwi, so in accordance with the 1918 agreement, another ''Traslación'' was scheduled for 20 November 1919. Joroan Church had no proper paraphernalia for the time being, so Bernales lent some of his things, while donations began to pour in from all over Albay to the newly established parish.&lt;ref name="homecomming"&gt;de Leon (1988). pp 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The images was greeted with fireworks as its boat docked at Joroan, and there great jubilation among the townsfolk. Early the next morning, a solemn [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] was celebrated with a huge number of pilgrims from all over the Bicolandia in attendance. Also present were the [[Vicar Forane]]; the pastors of Tiwi, Tabaco, and [[Nabua, Camarines Sur|Nabua]]; the Governor of Albay; the board members of the Provincial Government; the Municipal President; the Municipal Council; and other prominent people.&lt;ref name="homecomming"/&gt;

====Episcopal Decree of 1919====
Among the terms of agreement made when Joroan was raised to the status of parish was the Episcopal Decree ''Constandoonos'' of 18 September 1919.  The decree states that:

{{quote|''Menos qué por el espacio de quince días continuos cada año pueda estar (la imagen) en la iglesia de Tiwi, bajo instrucción del Parroco de Tiwi, para el debido culto de los fieles. Y se ordena que la transferancia y conducción annual a Tiwi sean hechos con todo decoro y solemnidad convenientes.''

(“Except for a space of fifteen consecutive days, the image can stay in the church of Tiwi under the disposition of its parish priest for the due cult of the faithful. It is ordained that the annual transfer and conduction to Tiwi be made with proper decorum and solemnity.”)&lt;ref&gt;Libro de Ordenes N.I., Tiwi, Cir N. 180, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although already a parish by now, Joroan still had several issues. The Decree was no guarantee that the image was now fully in Joroan's possession, so a committee was organised with the purpose of appealing to Bishop McGinley for the Decree's revision and removal of the clause “except for a span of fifteen days”. McGinley rejected the request by further stating that the Decree is part of the terms of agreement for the elevation of Joroan to the status of a parish, and that its representatives signed it.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle&gt;de Leon (1988) pp. 16-20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rising tensions====
In 1920, Joroan was reminded to comply with the Decree. The people however, were still adamant for fear that something unfavourable might happen and majority of the people, especially the women, no longer favoured the idea of lending the image of the Lady of Salvation to Tiwi. This prompted Bishop McGinley to dispatch to Joroan Fr. Luis Dimaruba, a priest vested with ecclesiastical authority, to advise the people regarding their insolence, and to persuade them about the urgency of lending the image to Tiwi since the fiesta was approaching. However, it was only after the encouragement and assurance of the image’s return by their parish priest that led the people to reluctantly lend Tiwi the image.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;

On 6 August 1920, a cohort with Bernales leading them, arrived in Joroan to take the image. Before the image was taken, Bernales reassured the people that the image shall be returned after fifteen days. The absence of the image in the altar of their church made the people of Joroan so anxious that they never lost track of the fifteen-day promise. However, realizing that Tiwi had not yet returned the image even though the fifteen-day agreement had already expired, the people dispatched a big boat to Tiwi so that they could remind Bernales that the agreement had already expired and also to personally get the image.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;

====The August Riot====
When Fulay greeted Bernales, the later was compelled to return the image. A huge number of people from Tiwi were present in the church to bid the image farewell. However, when the image was about to be handed over to Fulay, one of the onlookers screamed and seized the image from Bernales. The visitors from Joroan cried foul and rioting ensued.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;

The message was clear: the people of Tiwi refused to give back the image by violently declaring that the image was theirs. This claim is backed by the alleged testimony of the elders of Tiwi that the image in question was just a copy of the original: the copy belonged to Tiwi, while the original was Joroan’s. Folklore held that in those days there was an antique image of Our Lady of Salvation, and that the image’s Hermana Mayor was a certain Mitay. When it was still in a good condition it used to be brought down to the chapel whenever the image was in Tiwi, but that this has already been deteriorated with age. The people of Joroan abandoned it, and that the title of Our Lady of Salvation which the present image now bears originated from this antique image.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;

====Final settlement====
Fulay, seeing that the brawl would do no good, advised his parishioners to go home instead. He then wrote a letter to Bishop McGinley about the heightened tensions between the peoples of Joroan and Tiwi. In response, McGinley reassured Joroan that the image will be returned to them. Owing to the previous rioting, the image was kept in the house of Vicente Vera for more than a month, and it was only on 28 September of that year that the image was returned to Joroan.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;

To prevent future violence, Bishop McGinley on 18 August 1920 declared that:

{{cquote|“We suppress and cancel by this presents [the clause “fifteen consecutive days”] and confirm the rest of the said Decree reserving to us. However, the right to take measure we deem necessary to avoid or suppress abuses which may crop up in the cult of the image, and to vindicate our exclusive right over the image in reference”.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Original Spanish Text: ''Suprimimos y cancelamos por el presente y confirmamos el resto de dicho decreto, reservándonos sin embargo el derecho de tomar quantas medidas juzgaremos necesarias para evitar o suprimir abusos que pudierán surgír en el culto de la imagen y para vindicar nuestra exclusivo propiedad en la imagen de referencia.'' (Libro de Ordenes, no. 1, Tiwi, p 44)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;}}

To keep the ardour of the same Marian devotion in Tiwi and to prevent further tensions, McGinley also permitted the creation of a replica for Tiwi. The original image has been permanently enshrined in Joroan since 1920.&lt;ref name=thelaststruggle/&gt;

===Later years===

====Coronation====
On 8 December 1975, Teotimo Pacis, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Legazpi|Bishop of Legazpi]], formally declared the Virgin Mary, under the title of Our Lady of Salvation, as the heavenly patroness of Albay. In 1976, the Diocese formally celebrated the Bicentennial Jubilee of its patroness. One of the projects during the Bicentennial was the completion of the shrine. The original design of the shrine was the handiwork of Juanito Pelea of Tiwi, but was later redesigned and finished under the supervision of Fidel Siappo of [[Legazpi City, Albay|Legazpi City]]. After its completion, Bishop Pacis blessed the shrine on 21 August 1976.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt;&lt;ref name=shrine/&gt;

On 25 August, as a culmination to its Bicentennial year, [[Jaime Sin|Jaime Cardinal Sin]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], crowned Our Lady of Salvation, while the Joroan Church was proclaimed a Diocesan shrine.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt;&lt;ref name=shrine/&gt;

==Veneration==
Every year, during the month of August until September, devotees from all over the Bicol Region visit the shrine of the Lady of Salvation in Joroan. The last Saturday of August is traditionally reserved as a special day of veneration wherein pilgrims would walk in a procession for 9&amp;nbsp;km from the St. Lawrence Church of Tiwi to the Diocesan Shrine in Joroan.&lt;ref name="ven"&gt;Barcelona (2004) Ynang Maria: A Celebration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pilgrimagetojoroan&gt;[http://aboutph.com/2010/08/pilgrimage-to-joroan-joroan-tiwi-albay/ Pilgrimage to Joroan] ''aboutph.com'' accessed May 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In Barangay Pasadena, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Metro Manila]], the image is fêted on the third weekend of May with a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and procession.
 
In Caridad, Culasi, Antique, the barrio fiesta is celebrated every end of the month of May. It starts on the "bisperas" mass or the eve of the fiesta mass on May 28 and the fiesta proper is on May 29. The new image of Nuestra Senora de Salvacion was donated by the Cadiena-Española Family.

The '''Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat Kuntsevych''' ('''SSJK''') is a society of [[traditionalist Catholic|traditionalist]] [[priest]]s and seminarians originating from the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] which is led by the excommunicated priest [[Basil Kovpak]]. It is based in [[Riasne]], [[Lviv]], Western [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papastronsay.com/Ukraine.htm Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat - Ukrainian Rite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611201954/http://www.papastronsay.com/Ukraine.htm |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lviv, the society maintains a [[seminary]], at which currently thirty students reside, and takes care of a small convent of [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian]] [[nun|sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redemptorists.org.uk/red/mag/ruthen10.htm A Convent for Tradition in the Ukraine] Web site of the [[Transalpine Redemptorist]]s who became reconciled with the Holy See in 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113192948/http://www.redemptorists.org.uk:80/red/mag/ruthen10.htm |date=13 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSJK is affiliated with the [[Society of St. Pius X]] and [[Holy Orders]] are conferred by the latter society's [[bishop]]s in the [[Roman Rite]]. The SSJK clergymen, however, exclusively follow a version of [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] [[Byzantine Rite]] in the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] [[recension]]. According to senior officials of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic hierarchy, the society operates in direct defiance of the hierarchy.

==Seminary==
The seminary of the SSJK is dedicated to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] and currently is attended by thirty [[seminarian]]s. The seminary, the society says, is intended to be a modest support in the conversion to Catholicism not only of Ukraine, but of [[Russia]] as well. Devotion to [[Our Lady of Fatima]] and fidelity to traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology (with an emphasis on pre-conciliar theological emphases) are considered important.

==Relations with the ''sui iuris'' Ukrainian Catholic Church and the Holy See==
===Opposition to de-Latinization===
The SSJK rejects the [[liturgical latinisation|de-Latinization]] reforms currently being strongly enforced within the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], which is in [[full communion]] with [[Holy See|Rome]]. These reforms began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan [[Andrey Sheptytsky]]. According to his biographer [[Cyril Korolevsky]], however, Metropolitan Andrey opposed the use of force against liturgical Latinizers. He expressed fear that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the [[Raskol|1666 Schism]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt; Cyril Korolevsky, ''Metropolitan Andrew (1868–1944)'', Translated and Edited by Serge Keleher. Stauropegion Brotherhood, Lviv, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The de-Latinisation of the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree ''[[Orientalium Ecclesiarum]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]]) and several subsequent documents. This resulted in the Latinisations being discarded within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The Soviet occupation of Western Ukraine had meanwhile forced Byzantine Catholics into a clandestine existence and the Latinizations continued to be used in the underground. After the prescription against the UGCC was lifted in 1989, numerous UGCC priests and hierarchs arrive from the diaspora and attempted to enforce liturgical conformity.

In his memoir ''Persecuted Tradition'', [[Basil Kovpak]] has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinize. He alleges that numerous laity, who have been attached to the Latinizations since the days of the underground, would prefer to stay home on Sunday rather than attend a de-Latinized liturgy.

The SSJK for instance opposes the removal of the [[stations of the cross]], the [[rosary]], and the [[monstrance]] from the liturgy and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In rejecting these reforms, they also reject the right of the Church authorities to make these reforms; thus who controls the formate of liturgy becomes an important point of debate.

Critics{{who|date=August 2013}} of the SSJK point out that their liturgical practice favours severely abbreviated services and imported [[Roman Rite]] devotions over the traditional and authentic practices and ancient devotions of Eastern Tradition and particularly the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Proponents counter that these "Latin" symbols and rituals, borrowed from their [[Latin Rite|Latin Catholic]] [[Poland|Polish]] neighbours, have long been practised by Ukrainian Greek Catholics, in some cases for centuries, and that to suppress them is to deprive the Ukrainian Catholic faithful of a part of their own sacred heritage. The central point in the dispute is over what constitutes 'organic development'. 

The [[Holy See]], however, has argued since before the Second Vatican Council that [[Liturgical Latinisation|Latinization]] was not an organic development. Frequently cited examples of this are [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1894 [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientalium dignitas]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saint Pius X]]'s instructions that the priests of the [[Russian Catholic Church]] should offer the Liturgy, "No More, No Less, and No Different," than the Orthodox and Old Ritualist clergy.

===Church Slavonic===
[[Image:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir the Great]]. The society declares that one of its main goals is conversion of [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] to unity with the [[Catholic Church]].]]

The SSJK also opposes the abandonment of [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], the traditional [[liturgical language]] of the Slavic Churches (both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) in favour of the modern [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] in the Liturgy of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. The society holds that Church Slavonic is essential to stress necessary Catholic unity among all [[Slavic peoples]], and to avoid [[nationalism]] which has for a long time divided Slavic Christians.

However, critics{{who|date=August 2013}} claim that the essence of Eastern liturgical practice is to pray in a language which is understood by the people, and that Church Slavonic has ceased to be such a language, becoming a pale imitation of the Western practice of using Latin to promote unity. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church has a large presence in many non-Slavic countries, with numerous eparchies and parishes in the diaspora, exacerbating the problem of parishioners not understanding what is being celebrated as well as raising issues of assimilation.

===Ecumenism===
The Society of Saint Josaphat condemns [[ecumenism]] with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] currently practised by both the [[Holy See]] and the Ukrainian Catholic Church. Instead the society promotes Catholic [[missionary]] activities among the Orthodox, who are not in communion with the [[Holy See]]. In ''Persecuted Tradition'', Basil Kovpak cites numerous examples of the UGCC turning away Orthodox clergy and laity who wish to convert. In many cases, he alleges, this is because the converts are not ethnically Ukrainian.

===Attempted excommunication===
In 2003, Cardinal [[Lubomyr Husar]] excommunicated SSJK superior Kovpak from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Kovpak appealed this punishment at the [[Roman Rota]] in [[Vatican City]] and the excommunication was declared null and void by reason of a lack of canonical form.

==Ordinations in 2006==
On 22 November 2006 [[Bishop]] [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] who was then a member of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX), illicitly ordained two priests and seven deacons in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], for the SSJK, in violation of canon 1015 §2, and of canons 1021 and 1331 §2 of the Code of Canon Law, and the corresponding canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. An SSPX priest who was present remarked, "We were all very edified by their piety, and I myself was astonished by the resemblance of the atmosphere amongst the seminarians with that which I knew in the seminary&amp;nbsp;– this in spite of the difference of language, nationality and even rite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/entret/2006/jenkins/versionanglaise/anglais2006.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823133035/http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/entret/2006/jenkins/versionanglaise/anglais2006.php |archivedate=23 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Ihor Vozniak]] of Lviv (the archdiocese in which Kovpak is incardinated) denounced Williamson's action as a "criminal act" and condemned Kovpak's participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests that Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the archeparchy.&lt;ref&gt;The Holy See has likewise declared SSPX priests to be "suspended from exercising their priestly functions" ([http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm Letter of Monsignor Camille Perl, Secretary of the [[Ecclesia Dei]] Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202034019/http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm |date=2 February 2003 }}). A minority of them&amp;nbsp;– ordained before 1976 by archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] for the SSPX&amp;nbsp;– were and remained until now incardinated in several European dioceses. They are thus in the same position as excommunicated Kovpak, who is incardinated in the Ukrainian Archdiocese of Lviv. The newly-ordained clergy, however, are not incardinated into any Ukrainian Catholic diocese, and thus are not clergy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials of the Lviv archdiocese said that Kovpak could face [[excommunication]], and that "'he deceives the church by declaring that he is a Greek (Byzantine) Catholic priest,' while supporting a group [SSPX] that uses the old Latin liturgy exclusively, eschewing the Byzantine tradition, and does not maintain allegiance to the Holy See."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=47961 Catholic World News: Byzantine Catholics decry Lefebvrite inroads into Ukraine] The accusation of "eschewing the Byzantine tradition" refers to Kovpak's championing of Latinizing elements which were followed by Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church since the 17th century, but forcibly purged following the Second Vatican Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Kovpak's excommunication process was restarted by the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and confirmed by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] on 23 November 2007.&lt;ref name="Ukrainian priest excommunicated"&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=54919 Ukrainian priest excommunicated] Catholic World News, 21 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

John Jenkins, a member of the Society of St. Pius X, said in 2006 that the new archbishop of Lviv declared that his main task for the following year was to eradicate the "Lefebvrists" from his territory.&lt;ref&gt;La Porte Latine, 31 March 2006 [http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/entret/2006/jenkins/versionanglaise/anglais2006.php Interview with 'La Porte Latine'] La Porte Latine, 31 March 2006, by Father Jenkins, Prior of Warsaw ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107093537/http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/entret/2006/jenkins/versionanglaise/anglais2006.php |date=7 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the society==
Although the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, with the backing of the Holy See, had thus declared Kovpak excommunicated and the Society of St. Josaphat lacking faculties for a ministry within the Catholic Church, they themselves maintain that, though they are in dispute with Lubomyr and, presumably, with his successor, [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]], and through their association with the Society of St Pius X, indirectly in dispute with the church hierarchy, they are loyal to the [[Pope]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], and are merely resisting what they consider to be [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernism]], [[indifferentism]], and [[liberalism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The '''religious views of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy''' resulted in him being considered the [[Voltaire]] of South India. Both opposed religion virulently because, in their views, the so-called men of religion invented myths and superstitions to keep the innocent and ignorant people in darkness and to go on exploiting them.&lt;ref name="Veeramani"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] has been a harsh critic of the Aryan influenced Hinduism in Tamil Nadu, more than the faiths of Islam, Buddhism and Christianity. He has spoken appreciatively of these other faiths in India finding in their ethics principles of equality and justice, thus advocating them if they can prove an alternative to Brahamanic Hinduism. With regards to institutionalized religion being used for personal gain, Periyar stated that ''"religion goes hand in hand with superstition and fear. Religion prevents progress and suppresses man. Religion exploits the suppressed classes."'' As religions, however, they are prone to be hit by accusation of superstition, exploitation and irrationalism.&lt;ref name="Diehl"&gt;Diehl, ''E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar'', p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Dravidian politics-col}}
In periyar's school of thought, there was no religion by name Vedic Hinduism derived from the name of a place. With no distinct doctrines and no particular sacred book, it was said to be an imaginary religion preaching the superiority of the Brahmin the inferiority of the Shudra, and the untouchability of the Panchama.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi"&gt;Saraswathi, S. ''Towards Self-Respect'', pp. 118 &amp; 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maria Misra]] compares him to the [[philosophe]]s, {{Cquote|"His contemptuous attitude to the baleful influence of [[Hinduism]] in Indian public life is strikingly akin to the anti-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] diatribes of the enlightenment philosophes."&lt;ref&gt;Vishnu's crowded temple, India since the great rebellion, p181, Maria Misra, 2008, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13721-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Through the Self-Respect Movement,Periyar preached that compared to other religions, Hinduism placed many restrictions on men by prohibiting all except a small minority of Brahmins from reading the religious texts or discusing religious matters and by evolving a caste system in the name of divine law, and by creating several gods and festivals to provide an assured income and prosperity to the small Brahmin group at the expense of all others.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-2"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaikkam Periyar Ramasamy and Mahatma Gandhi—the former on a mission to destroy the essential practices perpetuated under Hinduism and the latter on a mission to protect, safeguard and rejuvenate the essence of Hindu religion—agreed on the basic point of the need to remove many evils practiced in the form of religion. Gandhiji aspired to 'reform' the religion by rejecting its formalities and moving out of it. Both believed that the Hindus should realize that Hinduism was not a religion and whatever they practiced in the name of Hindu religion had no religious basis or sanction. Both were of the opinion that religious faith was used to perpetuate inequalities on the basis of birth and ideas of purity and pollution.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-2"/&gt;

When the ideal of Dravidian nationalism was projected in the 1940s, Periyar's religious philosophy also underwent a modification to assert that Hinduism was not the religion of the Dravidians. There was no Dravidian ''Veda'' and the Aryan ''Vedas'' prevalent among Dravidians were said to be the sacred books which prescribed how Dravidians should be treated but put a bar on Dravidians from acquiring a knowledge of these texts. In his Presidential Address at the Justice Confederation in 1940 EVR said:&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

"We have to bring about certain reforms in our religion. Many of our countrymen think that they are Hindus. When you call yourself a Hindu you admit Aryan principles. The words Hindu and Hinduism were not used by our forefathers in any of their works. Historians of world religions say that the sacred books of the Hindus are the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]], the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]], the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]]. You will notice that none of the ancient religious works of the Dravidians have been included among those religious books. A careful study of the [[Vedas]], etc., proves beyond doubt that they were written with a view to disgrace, enslave and exploit the Dravidians. It is this Hinduism which says that we are Sudras and Rakshasas. Again it is this Hinduism which is responsible for the introduction of caste distinction and growth of feud among the sons of the soil. All our superstitions and meaningless and absurd rituals and ceremonies are the result of following the tenets of Hinduism. In addition to our social subjugation and enslavement it paved the way for our political enslavement also by Aryans. If we think calmly we shall see that it is as necessary to be free from Hinduism in the field of religion as it is to be separated from [[Aryavarta]] in the field of politics."&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3"/&gt;

Thanthai Periyar, even while upholding rationalism, executed his duties of a `dharmakartha' of a temple at Erode, to everybody's appreciation. 
."&lt;ref name="Periyar as dharmakartha"&gt;
{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/08/26/stories/2006082600660400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=The known and the unknown | date=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marai Malai Adigal is an eminent Tamil Saivite scholar who founded Saiva Siddhantha Association. He lived as a Saiva saint.This orthodox Saiva scholar was once invited by Thanthai Periyar to stay in his place or ashram. Maraimalai Adigal agreed to stay with Periyar for a month. In that one month, Periyar respected the orthodoxy of Adigal and ordered not to cook non-vegetarian food in the ashram and instructed his aides not to do anything that would offend the saiva practices of Adigal. Periyar respected true believers.

==Islam==
Ramasamy said "Bane of Tamils is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamilans". In his book "Vedangalin Vandavalangal", he had separate chapters where he criticized Quran and Bible.

In the early days of the Self-Respect Movement when Periyar was vociferous that Hindu religion, Manudharma and the Congress should be destroyed, he was inclined to play a political game by expressing an opinion that Islam alone was the religion that carried political weight and those depressed in the Hindu order could consider conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-4"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

For eradicating the evil of 'shudrahood', the threat of conversion was occasionally exercised. The Dravidian movement repeatedly complained about the imposition of Aryan religion on Dravidians. ''"Unless we become either the Panchama, i.e., Adi Dravida or Muslims, we will not get respect, justice and progress,"'' said EVR. He clarified that the idea was not to place the Dravidian people under the authority of Muslim religious leaders abroad but to practice the tenets of equality, righteous conduct and mutual respect. He emphasized that he was not an advocate of Islam but was only trying to find a remedy to the sufferings under Aryan, brahminical system and to find a rightful place for Dravidians in the independent country.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-5"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', pp. 124 &amp; 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==

Peiyar found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion as self-respect movement. The search for basis began in the course of the movement and was intensified soon after independence. It was again an experiment in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the shudrahood of Hinduism. A conference to propagate Buddhism was convened in Erode on January 31, 1954.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-6"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he and his wife [He married Maniammai when he was 74 years old] went to Burma to attend the celebration of the 2500th anniversary of Buddha.&lt;ref name="Diehl4"&gt;Diehl, ''E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar stated that what he was propagating could be found in the teachings of Buddha given 2000 years ago and wanted to revive them as the independent government had accepted the wheel of the Buddha and Hindus have regarded Buddha as an ''avatar''. Brahmins were accused of covering Buddha within the Aryan religion as they had been hiding Tiruvalluvar within the Aryan fold. EVR pointed out that Buddha also laid stress on rationalism, on intellect as the precept, and on thought process for accepting anything. The persecution of Buddha by Brahmins, the burning of Buddhist institutions and teachings and the 'export' of Buddhism to China, Japan and Ceylon were recalled at the conference and Periyar observed that Buddha Vihars at Srirangam, Kanchi, Palani and Tirupati were converted as Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-6"/&gt;

==Christianity==
Periyar said "Bane of Tamils is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamilans". In his book "Vedangalin Vandavalangal", he had separate chapters where he criticized Quran and Bible.

He was against evangelical movement of DGS Dinakaran and fought with him on this issue. In Periyar's publication, Naathigan, he used to vehemently oppose and criticize Dinakaran calling him fraud.

Christianity was viewed by Periyar similar to monotheistic faith of Islam. He stated that, "So far as god is concerned we find the Christians and Muslims, somewhat reformed from the olden days of barbarians. They say that there can be only one God. They say that it is beyond human comprehension. They say that God does good to those who are good and punishes those who are bad. They say that God has no name or shape. They talk of good qualities".&lt;ref name="Veeramani2"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; He took an interest in Rev. [[Martin Luther]], where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer.

'''Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal)''' was a splinter group of the [[Parkash Singh Badal]]-led [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] (SAD). The party was launched in 2004 with Surjit Kaur Barnala (wife of SAD leader [[Surjit Singh Barnala]]) as its president. [[Prem Singh Chandumajra]] also joined it after being denied a ticked by the Badal-led SAD, but later left to join SAD (Badal) again in 2007.

The party contested the [[Patiala]] seat, but failed. In 2007, the party merged back into the Badal-led [[Shiromani Akali Dal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20070103/553953.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, however, the party split out of SAD again. In 2014, the party merged into the [[Indian National Congress]] this time.&lt;ref&gt;http://sikhsangat.org/2014/surjit-barnala-becomes-congressman-merges-sadlongowal-into-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz''' (also spelled '''Rabinowitz''', '''Rabinowich''', '''Rabinovitch''') (1801 – 16 March 1866) was the first [[Rebbe]] of the [[Radomsk (Hasidic dynasty)|Radomsk]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] dynasty and one of the great Hasidic masters of [[History of the Jews in 19th-century Poland|19th-century Poland]]. He is known as the '''''Tiferes Shlomo''''' after the title of his ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]]'', which is considered a classic in Hasidic literature.

==Early life==
Rabinowicz's year of birth is variously cited as 1795,&lt;ref name="finkel"/&gt; 1796,&lt;ref name="yizkor"/&gt; 1800,&lt;ref name="Rosenstein"/&gt; 1801,&lt;ref name="negina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heichalhanegina.blogspot.com/2006/03/musical-talents-of-tiferes-shlomo.html |title=The Musical Talents of the "Tiferes Shlomo"|date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2011 |publisher=Heichal Hanegina}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1803.&lt;ref name="codex"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uK5pa3R4d8C&amp;pg=PA251 |page=251 |title=Codex Judaica: Chronological Index of Jewish History |last=Kantor |first=Mattis |publisher=Zichron Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-9670378-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chazaq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chazaq.org/?section=articles&amp;categoryId=51&amp;articleId=359 |title=Yahrzeits – Week of 29 Adar |accessdate=7 July 2011 |publisher=chazaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/printArticle.cfm?contentid=38878 |title=Radomsker Rebbe's ''Yahrzeit'' |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rabbi Gershon |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2011 |work=[[The Jewish Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Włoszczowa]], Poland&lt;ref name="yizkor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/radomsko/rad110.html#shlomohle |title=Reb Shlomohle Radomsker |last=Bader |first=Gershom |accessdate=7 July 2011 |publisher=Radomsker Memorial Book |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Rabbi Dov Zvi (d. 1839), the ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|av beis din]]'' (head of the rabbinical court) of Włoszczowa.&lt;ref name="Rosenstein"/&gt; Like most of the Jews of Poland, Rabbi Shlomo was called by his first name and [[patronymic]]; his children were the first to begin using the surname Rabinowicz.&lt;ref name="yizkor"/&gt; He was a descendant of Rabbi [[Nathan Nata Spira]] (1585 – 1633), a leading Polish [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and author of ''[[Megaleh Amukot|Megaleh Amukos]]''.&lt;ref name="finkel"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlvXDMNboYwC&amp;pg=PA348 |page=348 |title=Kabbalah: Selections From Classic Kabbalistic Works From Raziel Hamalach To The Present Day |last=Finkel |first=Avraham Yaakov |year=2003 |publisher=[[Targum Press]] |isbn=1-56871-218-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabinowicz studied in the yeshiva in [[Piotrków Trybunalski]], where he was regarded as a prodigy. By his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] he knew the entire ''Urim Ve'umin'' of Rabbi [[Jonathan Eybeschutz|Yonatan Eibeshutz]] by heart and had composed his own ''chiddushim'' (novel Torah thoughts). Late at night, he would study Kabbalah texts.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt;

Later he became a ''talmid'' of Rabbi Meir of Apta,&lt;ref name="dia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diapositive.pl/chasydzi_radomska.htm |title=Chasidim of Radomsko |publisher=diapositive.pl|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yeshshem.com/hilulatammuz.htm |title=Hilula and Yarzeit for the Hebrew Month of Tammuz – 25 Tammuz|publisher=Yesh Shem |year=2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in turn a disciple of the [[Chozeh of Lublin]]. He became a Hasid of Rabbi Meir of Apta, Rabbi Fishele of Strikov, and Rabbi Yehoshua of Pshedburz. He also traveled to the [[Modzitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Modzitzer]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Moditz (Hasidic dynasty)#Rebbe Yechezkel Taub of Kuzmir|Yechezkel of Kuzmir]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Halberstam]] of [[Sanz]].&lt;ref name="yizkor"/&gt; Though he was born 14 years after the death of Rebbe [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]], he also considered himself a disciple of the latter and visited his grave every year. Since as a [[Kohen]] he was not allowed to come in contact with graves, he had a wall built around the area so that he could pray there.&lt;ref name="nishmas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nishmas.org/biograph/tifshlom.htm |title=The Tiferes Shlomo |publisher=nishmas.org |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Radomsk==
Rabinowicz married Gitele, a pious woman who fasted every Monday and Thursday. She lived to the age of 92.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt; After his marriage, he studied in the [[beth midrash]] in Włoszczowa while his wife ran a small store to support them. The store was not successful, however, and for this reason, when Rabinowicz was offered the position of Rav of the small Polish town of [[Radomsko]] (Radomsk), his rebbe, Rabbi Meir of Apta, advised him to accept.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt; Rabinowicz became Rav of Radomsk in 1834.&lt;ref name="finkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yizkor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chazaq"/&gt; His weekly salary was 15 [[Polish gulden]] (2 [[ruble]]s and 25 [[Ruble|kopeks]]), an apartment, and an [[etrog]] for [[Sukkot]]. Later his salary increased to 6 rubles per week, and his wife was allowed to run her own business.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yizkor"/&gt;

Under his leadership, the Jewish community of Radomsk grew in prestige and population.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt; Rabinowicz founded the Radomsk Hasidic dynasty in 1843.&lt;ref name="Radomsko"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/radomsk/Radomsko.htm |title=Radomsko |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2011 |publisher=jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rabbi [[Moshe Biderman]] of [[Lelov (Hasidic dynasty)|Lelov]] moved to [[Jerusalem]] in 1850 and instructed his Hasidim to follow Rabinowicz, the latter's influence as a Rebbe grew significantly.&lt;ref name="chazaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shtetl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Radomsk/RadomskerRebbe.html |title=Radomsker Rebbe Who Perished in Jewish Martyrdom in the Warsaw Ghetto |last=Ungar |first=Manashe |date=19 April 1950 |publisher=The Day-Morning Journal |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to attract thousands of Hasidim&lt;ref name="negina"/&gt; and Radomsk grew into a major center of Hasidut.&lt;ref name="finkel"/&gt; The masses revered their Rebbe for his lofty prayers, beautiful singing voice, and benevolence towards their needs,&lt;ref name="yizkor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="virtual"/&gt; while the more scholarly Hasidim admired his profound discourses in [[Halakha]] and [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name="finkel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=xX8VTuSsA4nNhAeq1Pxe&amp;ct=result&amp;id=zO5CAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=shlomo+of+radomsk&amp;q=radomsker |page=314 |title=Ideas and Ideals of the Hassidim |last=Aron |first=Milton |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabinowicz was a master at interpreting Torah verses through [[gematria]] and Hebrew letter permutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeEIOEYFHrUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=shlomo+of+radomsk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=84MVTrmXC8OmhAfq6YlY&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=shlomo%20of%20radomsk&amp;f=false |page=54 |title=The Book of Self Creation |last=Swart |first=Jacobus G. |publisher=Sangreal Sodality Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-620-42884-2 |location=Gauteng, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his Hasidim were philosopher Aaron Marcus Verus and physician Chaim David Bernard of Piotrków.&lt;ref name="virtual"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16334.html |title=Radomsko (Radomsk), Solomon Ha-Kohen Rabinowich of |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |year=2010 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as he served as a Rebbe to thousands, Rabinowicz paid special attention to the needs of the Jews of Radomsk proper. When local Jews were conscripted by the Czar's army, he and his [[gabbai]] went door to door, collecting [[Pidyon Shvuyim|money]] to bribe the officials to release them. He also collected money for the poor to buy firewood in the winter, and to make [[matzo]]s at [[Pesach]].&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt; He spoke out often on the challenges facing the Jewish people of his day, including [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]].&lt;ref name="past"/&gt; In 1862 he pronounced a ban on the wearing of [[hoop skirt]]s by Jewish women.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt;

Rabinowicz had a beautiful singing voice and was renowned as a [[chazzan]] and composer of Hasidic music. His prayers were infused with both great emotion and great joy. He composed and sang new ''[[nigunim]]'' (melodies) each year for the [[High Holy Days]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s.&lt;ref name="negina"/&gt; He also had a practice of visiting a different [[tzadik]] every [[Shavuot]]. On one such occasion, he visited the Tzadik of Kuzmir, Rabbi Emanuel of Pashdeborz, and was asked to lead the [[Akdamut]] [[piyyut]]. Rabinowicz requested the accompaniment of 80 singers, and the resulting choir, with his voice soaring over all, had a powerful effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leh26AnUhcYC&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108 |title=Chassidic Ecstasy in Music |last=Barzilai |first=Shmuel |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2009 |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-58452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabinowicz used his soul-stirring ''nigunim'' to rouse his Hasidim to great fervor on [[Shabbat]] and Jewish holidays.&lt;ref name="kabb"&gt;Finkel, ''Kabbalah'', p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent money to one of his Hasidim in [[Safed]], Israel so that the latter would organize a Radomsker [[Shalosh Seudos]] meal every Shabbat at which his ''niggunim'' would be sung.&lt;ref name="negina"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Rabinowicz died after reciting the ''[[Tikkun Chatzot]]'' prayers in the early-morning hours of Friday, 16 March 1866 (29 [[Adar]] 5626).&lt;ref name="shtetl"/&gt; He was buried later that day in an ''[[Ohel (grave)|ohel]]'' on the grounds of the Jewish cemetery in Radomsk. His son and grandson were later buried in the same ''ohel''.&lt;ref name="Radomsko"/&gt; His death was part of a triple loss for Polish Jewry, as he, the [[Yitzchak Meir Alter|Chiddushei Harim]], and the [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn|Tzemach Tzedek]] died within a month of each other.&lt;ref name="codex"/&gt;

He left three sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name="feinkind"/&gt; His sons were: Aryeh Leibusz (1823–1890),&lt;ref name="Rosenstein"/&gt; a Torah scholar and businessman;&lt;ref name="past"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/radomsko/rad052.html |title=Remembrances of the Past |last=Poznanski |first=Yehieil |publisher=Radomsko Memorial Book |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsz (Zvi) Meir (d. 1902), who presided as ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|av beis din]]'' of Radomsk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.feedblitz.com/157142/~3861208 |title=Av Yahrtzeits |accessdate=7 July 2011 |publisher=Zchus Avos Yogen Aleinu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded his father as Rav of the town;&lt;ref name="past"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenstein"/&gt; and [[Avraham Yissachar Dov Rabinowicz|Avraham Yissachar Dov]], the ''Chesed LeAvraham'' (1843–1892), who succeeded his father as Radomsker Rebbe.&lt;ref name="dia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shtetl"/&gt;

Rabinowicz's discourses on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] and ''chagim'' (Jewish festivals) were published posthumously in [[Warsaw]] in 1867–1869 as the two-volume ''Tiferes Shlomo''.&lt;ref name="Rosenstein"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=xX8VTuSsA4nNhAeq1Pxe&amp;ct=result&amp;id=nKQWAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=shlomo+of+radomsk&amp;q=shlomo+warsaw  |page=232 |title=The Unbroken Chain: Biographical sketches and the genealogy of illustrious Jewish families from the 15th-20th century |last=Rosenstein |first=Neil |publisher=Shengold Publishers |year=1976 |isbn= 0-88400-043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dia"/&gt; This work, considered a textbook of Hasidic thought,&lt;ref name="nishmas"/&gt; met with widespread acclaim and has been continuously reprinted.&lt;ref name="kabb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rebshlomo.org/transcriptions/months/adar/purim/purim-nothing-else-matters/ |title=Purim: Nothing Else Matters |last=Carlebach |first=Rabbi Shlomo |authorlink=Shlomo Carlebach |date=15 March 1984 |accessdate=7 July 2011 |publisher=The Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Short Creek Community''' (now [[Colorado City, Arizona]], and [[Hildale, Utah]]), founded in 1913, began as a small ranching town in the [[Arizona Strip]].&lt;ref name="Zoellner J1"&gt;{{citation |last= Zoellner |first= Tom |date= June 28, 1998 |title= Polygamy: Throughout its history, Colorado City has been home for those who believe in virtues of plural marriage |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |page= J1 |id= Archive Article ID: 100F28A4D3D36BEC ([[NewsBank]]) |url= http://www.sltrib.com/1998/jun/06281998/sunday_a/sunday_a.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20000505002302/http://www.sltrib.com/1998/jun/06281998/sunday_a/sunday_a.htm |archive-date= 2000-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s it was settled by [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]], who remain there to this day.

==History==
In May 1935, members of the [[Council of Friends (Woolley)|Council of Friends]], a breakaway group from the [[Salt Lake City]]-based [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), sent a handful of followers to the Short Creek Community with the express purpose of building "a branch of the Kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;''Diary of Joseph Lyman Jessop,'' vols. 1-3 (privately published, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow believed that the isolated Creek could provide a place of refuge for those engaging in the covert practice of polygamy, a [[felony]]; within a month, the town's population more than doubled. The Council of Friends membership desired a remote location where they could practice [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]], which had been [[1890 Manifesto|publicly abandoned]] by the LDS Church in 1890.

On July 26, 1953, Arizona Governor [[John Howard Pyle]] sent troops into the settlement to stop polygamy in what became known as the [[Short Creek raid]]. The two-year legal battle that followed became a public relations disaster that damaged Pyle's political career and set a hands-off tone toward the town in Arizona for the next 50 years.  The [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS) later developed in the same geographical region and changed the name to Colorado City and Hildale to eliminate any ties to the Short Creek raids.&lt;ref name="Zoellner J1"/&gt;

== Council of Friends ==
{{LDSpolygamy}}
{{main|Council of Friends (Woolley)|l1=Council of Friends}}
The concept of a Council of Friends or '''Priesthood Council''' was central to the [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] theology developed by [[Lorin C. Woolley]] and others in the Short Creek Community.  The Short Creek Community
was home to this council starting in the late 1920s.  Since the authority of the Council of Friends pertained to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] and not to the Church, early Mormon fundamentalists, most of the residents of Short Creek Community had been excommunicated from the LDS Church.  They felt that the existence of the Council of Friends gave them the right to continue solemnizing [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriages]] even after [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|Church President]] [[Wilford Woodruff]]'s [[1890 Manifesto]] discountenancing the practice.

{{As of|2017}}, the descendants of the Short Creek Community are reported to have a high rate of cases of [[fumarase deficiency]], an otherwise extremely rare genetic condition that causes severe physical and mental disability.

According to Indian and Tibetan legend, King '''Suchandra''' (Tib. ''Dawa Sangpo'') of the northeastern Indian Kingdom of [[Shambhala]] was the one who requested teaching from the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] that would allow him to practice the [[buddhadharma|dharma]] without renouncing his worldly enjoyments and responsibilities. In response to his request, the Buddha gave the first [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] initiation and teachings at [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], a small town in [[Andhra Pradesh]] in southeastern [[India]], supposedly emanating at the same time he was also delivering the [[Prajñā-Pāramitā Sūtras]] at [[Griddhraj Parvat|Vulture Peak Mountain]] at [[Rajgir]] in North India. Along with King Suchandra, 96 minor kings and emissaries from Shambhala are also said to have received the teachings.

Suchandra is considered to be an emanation of [[Vajrapani]], and a [[bodhisattva]] on the 10th ground. By practicing the Kalachakra, the whole of Shambhala became an enlightened society, with Suchandra as the ruler. King Suchandra wrote down the Kalachakra teachings he received, composing the 12,000-verse "Mula" or root text, which has not survived. He also built a huge three-dimensional Kalachakra mandala in the center of the kingdom. Suchandra is said to have died only two years after receiving the teachings. The six kings who followed him were known as "dharmarajas" or "truth kings," and each is said to have reigned for over 100 years. The twenty-five rulers that follow them are known as [[Kalki]] kings.

== Tāranātha's version ==

From the website www.kalachakra.org (by Kalachakra scholar Edward Smith):

″The following is taken from "dpal dus kyi 'khor lo'i chos bskor gyi byung khungs nyer mkho", by Tāranātha:

On the full moon of the month Caitra in the year following his enlightenment, at the great stupa of Dhānyakaṭaka (dpal ldan 'bras dpung kyi mchod rten), the Buddha emanated the mandala of "The Glorious Lunar Mansions". In front of an audience of countless Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, vīras, ḍākinīs, the twelve great gods, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, spirits and fortunate people gathered from the 960 million villages north of the river Śītā, was requested by the emanation of Vajrapani, the king Sucandra (zla ba bzang po), to teach the tantra. 

He taught not just this tantra, but all tantras. Countless men and non-humans achieved the realisations of their desires. Some teachings were taken to other human realms, and the Dharma king Sucandra wrote the Tantras in textual form in his land of Sambhala. He composed the explanatory Tantra in 60,000 verses to the Mūlatantra of 12,000. (Both of these are now lost.)

He had divine workers construct from jewels a maṇḍala palace of Kālacakra, 400 cubits across. He taught the mantrayāna to many humans and many of them achieved the highest realisation. In the second year after the teaching of the Mūlatantra, having installed as regent his son, the emanation of Kṣitigarbha, Sureshvara (lha'i dbang po), he passed on.

After him came other emanations of tenth level Bodhisattvas: Sureśvara (lha dbang), Tejī (gzi brjid can), Somadatta (zla bas byin), Sureśvara (lha'i dbang phyug), Viśvamūrti (sna tshogs gzugs) and Sureśāna (lha'i dbang ldan). They also spread the teachings as did Sucandra.″

{{Islam}}
The '''Takbīr''' ({{lang|ar|تَكْبِير}}, {{IPA-ar|tækˈbiːr|pron}}), also transliterated ''Tekbir'' or ''Takbeer'', is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase ''{{transl|ar|DIN|'''Allāhu akbar'''}}'' ({{lang|ar|[[:wikt:الله أكبر|الله أكبر]]}}), usually translated as "God is [the] greatest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Times of the Five Daily Prayers|url=http://www.raleighmasjid.org/how-to-pray/times.htm|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allahu Akbar|url=http://middleeast.about.com/od/a/g/allahu-akbar-definition.htm|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common [[Islam]]ic Arabic expression, used in various contexts by [[Muslim]]s; in formal [[prayer]], in the call for prayer ([[Adhan|adhān]]),&lt;ref name="Nigosian102"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nigosian |first=S. A. |title= Islam: Its History, Teaching, and Practices |year=2004 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=[[Indiana]] |isbn= 0-253-21627-3 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an informal expression of [[faith]], in times of distress, or to express resolute determination or defiance.

The form ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāhu}}'' is the [[nominative]] of ''[[Allah]]'', meaning "[[God in Islam|God]]". In the context of Islam, it is the [[Proper noun|proper name]] of the Abrahamic god.&lt;ref name="EoQ"&gt;Böwering, Gerhard, ''God and His Attributes'', Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, D. B. ''The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', 2nd edition. Brill, 1971. Volume 3, H-Iram, p. 1093, ''[[Ilah]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[:wikt:أكبر|akbar]]}}'' is the [[Elative (gradation)|elative]] of the adjective ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kabīr}}'', meaning "great", from the [[Semitic root|Semitic]] [[:wikt:ك ب ر|root]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[kāf|k]]-[[bāʼ|b]]-[[rāʼ|r]]}}''. As used in the {{transl|ar|DIN|Takbīr}} it is usually translated as "greatest", but some authors prefer "greater".&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Lane, ''[[Arabic English Lexicon]]'', 1893, gives for ''kabir'': "greater, and greatest, in body, or corporeal substance, and in estimation or rank or dignity, and more, or most, advanced in age, older, and oldest" [https://archive.org/stream/ArabicEnglishLexicon.CopiousEasternSources.EnlargedSuppl.Kamoos.Lane.Poole.1863/07.ArabicEnglLex.v1p7.let.21.22.23.24.Qaf.Kaf.Lam.Mim..Lane-Poole.1885.#page/n113/mode/2up (p. 2587)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007201240/https://archive.org/stream/ArabicEnglishLexicon.CopiousEasternSources.EnlargedSuppl.Kamoos.Lane.Poole.1863/07.ArabicEnglLex.v1p7.let.21.22.23.24.Qaf.Kaf.Lam.Mim..Lane-Poole.1885.#page/n113/mode/2up |date=October 7, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Practical Arabic Grammar|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ex4UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=akbar+arabic+grammar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uCjTxeHCPG&amp;sig=icroi8vf4Valyx2IF4XUeFoDAcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gnXuUeb_ItGx4APKrIH4Cw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=comparative&amp;f=false|year=1887|author=A.O.Green|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The formula, as the briefest expression of the absolute superiority of the One God, is used in Muslim life in different circumstances, in which the idea of God, His greatness and goodness is suggested." Wensinck, A. J. ''The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', 2nd edition. Brill, 2000. Volume 10, T-U, p. 119, Takbir.
&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is often transliterated less accurately as ''Allah akbar''. The term ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Takbīr}}'' itself is the stem II [[Arabic grammar|verbal noun]] (''{{transl|ar|DIN|tafʿīlun}}'') of the [[triliteral root]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[kāf|k]]-[[bāʼ|b]]-[[rāʼ|r]]}}'', meaning "great", from which ''akbar'' "greater" is derived.

The phrase is well known for its common use in [[Islamism|Islamist]] protests, and as a battle cry in [[Islamic extremism]] and [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-PBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=%22allahu+akbar%22+jihadist+battle+cry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W-VsVL7oO4GBsQTi5YCQDg&amp;ved=0CLoBEOgBMBs#v=onepage&amp;q=%22allahu%20akbar%22%20jihadist%20battle%20cry&amp;f=false|title=Symbolism in Terrorism|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZRzBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22allahu+akbar%22+jihadist+battle+cry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W-VsVL7oO4GBsQTi5YCQDg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22allahu%20akbar%22%20jihadist%20battle%20cry&amp;f=false|title=Obama, the Media, and Framing the U.S. Exit from Iraq and Afghanistan|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVhHGJkfZDoC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=%22allahu+akbar%22+jihadist+battle+cry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W-VsVL7oO4GBsQTi5YCQDg&amp;ved=0CIcBEOgBMBI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22allahu%20akbar%22%20jihadist%20battle%20cry&amp;f=false|title=Islam in Russia|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

[[File:Allahoakbar.svg|thumb|left|The takbīr in [[Nastaʿlīq script|nastaʿlīq]]]]
[[File:Takbir of prayer.jpg|thumb|A [[Muslim]] raises both of his hands to recite the Takbīr in prayer.|left]]
This phrase is recited by [[Muslim]]s in many different situations. For example, when they are very happy, to express approval, to prevent a Muslim from becoming prideful by reminding them that Allah is their source of success, or as a [[battle cry]], during times of extreme stress. The phrase is not found in the Quran, which does not refer to God as ''akbar'', but uses the name ''al-Kabīr'' "The Great" or ''Kabīr'' "Great", commonly translated as "Most Great" (13:9, 31:30, 22:62, 34:23, 40:12, 4:34).

===In prayer===
The phrase is said during each stage of both [[salah]] (obligatory prayers, performed five times a day), and [[nafl prayer|nafl]] (supererogatory prayers performed at will). The Muslim call to prayer (''[[adhan]]'') by the ''[[muezzin]]'' and to commence prayer (''[[iqama]]'') also contains the phrase.&lt;ref name="Nigosian102"/&gt;

===In times of distress===
{{See also|Garuda Indonesia Flight 152}}

The phrase is sometimes used during distress.

Just before [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 152]] crashed into the jungle near [[Medan]], Indonesia, the pilot screamed "Aaaaaaah! ''Allāhu akbar''" into his radio. According to a radio communication transcript, the pilot's conversation with the air controller had been in English, but his [[last words]] were the takbir as the plane crashed on September 26, 1997, killing all 234 people aboard in Indonesia's deadliest crash. It was suspected that the crash may have been due to either [[disorientation]] or [[turbine engine failure]] caused by local dense [[smog]] resulting from forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-leftright-confusion-led-to-smog-air-crash-1242039.html |title=Left-right confusion led to smog air crash |publisher=The Independent |date=September 30, 1997 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970929&amp;slug=2563204|title=Business - Indonesian Pilot Was Confused Before Crash - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In times of joy and gratitude ===
When Reshma Begum was discovered alive 17 days after the [[2013 Savar building collapse]] in Bangladesh which killed 1129 people, crowds jubilantly cried "''Allāhu akbar''" to express their joy and gratitude that she had survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrea|first=Crossan|title=Survivor Found in Collapsed Bangladesh Building After 17 Days|url=http://www.theworld.org/2013/05/bangladesh-survivor/|publisher=PRI's The World|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survivor pulled from Bangladesh ruins after 17 days|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130513/survivor-pulled-bangladesh-ruins-after-17-days|publisher=Global Post|accessdate=4 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928054402/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130513/survivor-pulled-bangladesh-ruins-after-17-days|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a multi-purpose phrase, it is sometimes used by Arab [[football]] commentators as an expression of amazement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=500_1245902201|title=Arab commentator screams "Allāhu akbar" after USA's goal on Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Following births and deaths ===
The phrase is used after the birth of a child as a means of praising God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerrahi.org/library/articles/birth_school |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827111517/http://www.jerrahi.org/library/articles/birth_school |archivedate=2013-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[hadith]], [[Muhammad]] is reported to have spoken the Takbīr after a funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janathimessage.co.uk/Literature/Beliefs_of_Ahle_Sunnah/The%20Permissibility%20of%20Reciting%20Azaan%20at%20Graveside.html|title=The Permissibility of Reciting Azaan at Graveside|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Eid Festival and the Hajj ===
During the festival of [[Eid al-Adha]] and the days preceding it, Muslims recite the Takbīr. This is particularly the case on the [[Day of Arafah]].&lt;ref name="Rabbani"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabbani|first=Faraz|title=The Day of `Arafah: The 9th of Dhu'l Hijjah|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=763&amp;CATE=3|publisher=Qibla.com|accessdate=4 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015192812/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=763&amp;CATE=3|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabbani"/&gt;

It has been used historically as a [[battle cry]] during war.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig W. Adamec, Historical Dictionary of Islam, Scarecrow Press, 2nd ed. 2009, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian usage===
During the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, it was shouted from rooftops in Iran during the evenings as a form of protest. This practice returned in the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090614/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election Yahoo News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617072238/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090614/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |date=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WU-cxEEJ-E |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date=June 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which protested the election results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8386335.stm|title=How Iran's opposition inverts old slogans |date=December 7, 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people shouted it from 22:00–22:30 every night after the 2009 Iranian election to protest the result.

===In Syrian and Iraqi insurgency===
In videos released during the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Free Syrian Army]], [[Al-Nusra Front]], other rebel and Islamist groups and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] forces are heard shouting "Takbir" and "Allāhu akbar" in the background while fighting. Even more "secular" groups such as the Free Syrian Army - Operation Southern Storm have been heard yelling the phrase before the firing of heavy weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle for Syria's South (Full Length)|url=https://news.vice.com/video/the-battle-for-syrias-south-full-length|website=www.news.vice.com|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–13)]], Islamist fighters were seen and heard shouting "''takbīr''" and "''Allāhu akbar''".

Jihadist and the Islamic extremist videos have also shown its fighters making ''takbīr'' with [[Index finger#Index finger in Islam|the index finger up]].

=== Radical fundamentalist usage ===
The phrase is well known among Western non-Muslims for its common use as a battle cry in [[Islamist extremism]] and [[Islamist terrorism]].&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com2"/&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[FBI]] released a letter reportedly handwritten by the hijackers and found in three separate locations on the day of the attacks—at [[Dulles International Airport]], at the [[United Airlines Flight 93|Pennsylvania crash site]], and in hijacker [[Mohamed Atta]]'s suitcase. It included a checklist of final reminders for the 9/11 hijackers. An excerpt reads: "When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. Shout, 'Allāhu akbar,' because this strikes fear in the hearts of the non-believers." Also, in the cockpit voice recorders found at the crash site of [[United Airlines Flight 93|Flight 93]], the hijackers are heard reciting the Takbīr repeatedly as the plane plummets toward the ground and the passengers attempt to retake control of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/letter.htm FBI Releases Copy of 4 Page Letter Linked to Hijackers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907212923/https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/letter.htm |date=September 7, 2010 }}''FBI, Press Conference national Press Release'', September 28, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/network/personal/instructions.html Instructions for the Last Night] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425091707/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/network/personal/instructions.html |date=April 25, 2016 }}, ''PBS Frontline'', "Inside the Terror Network, tracking their personal stories."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNJZQVZIzegC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22because+this+strikes+fear+into+the+hearts+of+the+non-believers%22&amp;num=100&amp;ei=seJtS5aaL5WqzgS63fj2DQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22because%20this%20strikes%20fear%20in%20the%20hearts%20of%20the%20non-believers%22&amp;f=false|title=Holy Terrors, Second Edition|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10379952"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10379952&amp;pnum=0 |title=Tracey Barnett: Suicide bombers follow a morality of their own |author=Barnett, Tracey |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 16, 2011 |date=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On flags==
The phrase ''Allāhu akbar'' is written on the center of the [[flag of Iraq]], 22 times along the borders of the central white stripe on the [[flag of Iran]], and beneath the [[shahada]] in the [[flag of Afghanistan]] in white script on the central red background as determined by the 2004 draft constitution.

===Iraq===
During the [[Gulf War]] in January 1991, [[Saddam Hussein]] held a meeting with top military commanders, where it was decided to add the words ''Allāhu akbar'' (described as the Islamic [[battle cry]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=37gTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J5ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5117,3700016&amp;dq=flag+iraq+islamist+allahu-akbar&amp;hl=en |title='&amp;#39;New Straits Times' |publisher=google.com |date=January 15, 1991 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Iraq's flag to boost his secular regime's religious credentials, casting himself as the leader of an Islamic army.&lt;ref name="usat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-04-26-iraq-flag_x.htm|title=U.S.-picked Iraq leaders approve new flag|date=April 26, 2004|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Deroy Murdock |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/268429/the-911-connection/deroy-murdock |title=Murdock, Deroy, "The 9/11 Connection," The National Review, April 3, 2003 |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617021913/http://article.nationalreview.com/268429/the-911-connection/deroy-murdock |archivedate=June 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hussein described the flag as "the banner of jihad and monotheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OkasRnU4K0C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=flag+%22allahu+akbar%22&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=flag%20%22allahu%20akbar%22&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;Saddam's war of words: politics, religion, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait'&amp;#39;, Jerry Mark Long, University of Texas Press, 2004, ISBN 0-292-70264-7 |publisher= |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the US-picked [[Iraqi Governing Council]] approved a new flag for Iraq that abandoned symbols of Hussein's regime, such as the words ''Allāhu akbar''.&lt;ref name="usat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FE26Ak05.html |title=Rosen, Nir, "Iraq's religious tide cannot be turned back," '&amp;#39;Asia Times'&amp;#39; |publisher=Atimes.com |date=May 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, however, Iraq's [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|parliament]] passed a law to change the flag by leaving in the phrase, but changing the [[calligraphy]] of the words ''Allāhu akbar'', which had been a copy of Hussein's handwriting, to a [[Kufic]] script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan22/0,4670,IraqFlagDispute,00.html Abdul-Zahra, Qassim, "Iraqi Lawmakers Vote to Change Flag," ''[[USA Today]]'', January 22, 2008, accessed February 9, 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305202752/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan22/0%2C4670%2CIraqFlagDispute%2C00.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdul |first=Qassim |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-02-05-1386576333_x.htm |title=Abdul-Zahra, Qassim, "Iraq unveils flag without Saddam's stars", '&amp;#39;USA Today'&amp;#39; |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi flag under Hussein had each of the two words of the phrase written in one of the spaces between the stars on the central band; the 2008 flag, while leaving the phrase in, removes the stars.

===Iran===
The phrase ''Allāhu akbar'' is written on the [[flag of Iran]], as called for by Article 18 of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iran|title=Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=koyJAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Mizan Press|isbn=978-0-933782-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase appears 22 times on the flag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2007/11/14/is_israel_a_jewish_state/ Jacoby, Jeff, "Is Israel a Jewish State?", ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', November 14, 2007, accessed February 11, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808061732/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2007/11/14/is_israel_a_jewish_state/ |date=August 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
The Afghan constitution that came into force on January 4, 2004, required that ''Allāhu akbar'' be inscribed on Afghanistan's national flag.&lt;ref&gt;[ McCarthy, Andrew C., "Cold Comfort on Islam and Apostasy; No one who’s actually read the Afghan constitution should be surprised by the Abdul Rahman case", ''[[National Review]]'', March 27, 2006, accessed February 11, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waziristan===
A resistance movement that fought British rule in [[Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]], in the 1930s used a red flag bearing ''Allāhu akbar'' in white letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9628676.html |title="Analysis: A ride on the wild side," '&amp;#39;UPI'&amp;#39; |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=September 19, 2005 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[topography of ancient Rome]], the '''Tarentum''' or '''Terentum''' was a religious precinct north of the [[Trigarium]], a field for equestrian exercise, in the [[Campus Martius]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing'' (University of California Press, 1986), pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Manuel des Institutions Romaines'' (Hachette, 1886), pp. 558, 560; [[Marcel Le Glay]], "Remarques sur la notion de ''Salus'' dans la religion romaine,"  ''La soteriologia dei culti orientali nell' imperio romano: Études préliminaires au religions orientales dans l'empire romain'', Colloquio internazionale Roma, 1979 (Brill, 1982), p. 442 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eMoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=%22près+du+Tarentum,+au+Trigarium%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22près%20du%20Tarentum%2C%20au%20Trigarium%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological survey of the site shows that it had no buildings.&lt;ref&gt; [[Robert E. A. Palmer]], ''Studies of the Northern Campus Martius in Ancient Rome'' (American Philosophical Society, 1990), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tarentum gave its name to the ''ludi tarentini'' ("Tarentine Games"), the archaic ''[[ludi]]'' that became the [[Secular Games]]; the name is perhaps less likely to have come from the place [[History of Taranto|Tarentum]] in [[Apulia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich S. Gruen]], "Poetry and Politics: The Beginnings of Latin Literature," in ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'' (Brill, 1990), p. 83, note 17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DG43AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22ludi+tarentini%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ludi%20tarentini%22&amp;f=false  online.] Calvert Watkins, ''[[How to Kill a Dragon|How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics]]'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), devotes a chapter to the meaning of ''tarentum''.&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the Tarentum is indicated primarily by the discovery in 1930 of the inscribed record of the Saecular Games ''(acta)'' held in 17 BC, which traditionally took place there.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Studies of the Northern Campus Martius,'' p. 20, is more skeptical than many scholars about establishing the exact location and limits of the Tarentum.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the precinct within which the underground Altar of [[Dīs Pater|Dis]] and [[Proserpina]] was located.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 122 (1978), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth and the ''ludi''==

The Tarentine Games were presented most notably in 249 BC, as a "crisis ritual"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Communicating with the Gods," in ''A Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, 2010), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[First Punic War]], in accordance with the [[Sibylline Books]]. The ''ludi'' took the form of three-night rites&lt;ref&gt;''Tribus noctibus'', [[Censorinus]] 17.8 ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#17.8 Latin]). Three-night rites were also characteristic of the Gallic religious calendar, as evidenced by notations of the [[Gaulish]] word ''trinoχtion'' (equivalent to [[Latin]] ''trinoctium''), "fête des Trois Nuits," in the [[Coligny calendar]]; Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise: Une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental'' (Paris: Éditions Errance, 2003, 2nd ed.), pp. 302–303.&lt;/ref&gt; and horse races to honor Dis and Proserpina, the divine couple who had an underground altar at the site.&lt;ref&gt;See Platner's entry on the ''Ara Ditis et Proserpina'' at [[LacusCurtius]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Ditis_Patris-Proserpinae.html online]; [[Livy]], ''Periocha'' [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae048.html#49 49]: ''Ludi Diti patri ad Tarentum ex praecepto librorum facti'' ("games for Father Dis took place at the Tarentum, in accordance with the books," presumably the [[Sibylline Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In a common version of the myth, Proserpina ([[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Persephone]]) was [[raptio|abducted]] by the ruler of the underworld and driven underground in his chariot to become his bride and queen.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', pp. 558, 577.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars think that the Roman ''Dis pater'' ("Rich Father") is a [[Latin]] translation of the Greek ''Plouton'' ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) and that his cult was established among the Romans with the celebration of the games in 249 BC.&lt;ref&gt;H. D. Jocelyn, ''The Tragedies of Ennius'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 331, with reference to [[Kurt Latte]], ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' (C.H. Beck, 1967, 1992), p. 246ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro regarded the nocturnal theatrical performances that took place during the games as a seminal event in the history of Roman drama.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus 17.8; Rupke, "Communicating with the Gods," p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]] argued that these ceremonies had originated with the cult of [[Maris (mythology)|Maris]], an [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] ''[[daimon]]'' of death later [[interpretatio graeca|identified]] with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in a [[chthonic]] form, along with [[Feronia (mythology)|Ferona]] as the consort of Maris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "The Origin of the ''Ludi Saeculares''," in ''Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion''  (Brill, 1956), p. 219 ''et passim''; see also [[John F. Hall|John F. Hall III]], "The Saeculum Novum of Augustus and its Etruscan Antecedents," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.3 (1986), p. 2574.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Calvert Watkins]], the word ''tarentum'' in reference to the Roman site most likely means "tomb" or "sepulcher,"&lt;ref&gt;Watkins notes (p. 348) that the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' omits the ''tarentum'' of [[Acca Larentia|Acca]] in the [[Velabrum]], where based on a reconstructed passage of [[Varro]] (''De lingua latina'' 6.23–24) the meaning "tomb" is required; Varro glosses ''tarentum Accas'' (an archaic form of the [[genitive]] singular [[grammatical gender|feminine]]) with ''sepulchrum Accae''.&lt;/ref&gt; or more fundamentally, "a place for crossing," that is, a [[Liminality|liminal]] place.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''How to Kill a Dragon'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zalmoxianism''' or '''Zamolxianism'''&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, pp. 139-140&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movement in [[Romania]] which promotes the rebuilding of an [[ethnic religion]] and spirituality of the [[Romanians]] through a process of reconnection to their ancient [[Dacians|Dacian]] and [[Thracians|Thracian]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The religion takes its name from [[Zalmoxis]] or Zamolxe, at the same time the name of the primordial god and the [[archetype]] of the enlightened man in [[Paleo-Balkan mythology]]. Scholars Bakó and Hubbes (2011) have defined Zalmoxianism, like the other ethnic religious revivals of [[Europe]], as a [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]] ethno-paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The reconstruction of ancient [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Dacian and Thracian]] religion and mythology has been strictly connected with the field of [[dacology]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst contemporary supporters of Zalmoxianism, the emigrant dacologist Octavian Sărbătoare even proposed to make it the official religion of [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==

===Gebeleizis Association===
The "Gebeleizis Association" ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Societatea Gebeleizis''), though far from being the only Zalmoxian group in Romania, has been the most studied formation.&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; It has 500 members split into 15 branches.&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 149: quoting Margareta Lupu&lt;/ref&gt; The core values of the organisation are expressed by its motto "One Family, One Nation, One Territory" ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''O Familie, Un Neam, Un Teritoriu'');&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; for the ideas promoted, the Gebeleizis Association has been subject of media scandal, and accused of [[extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakó-Hubbes, 2011, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Gebeleizis]]" was the same as [[Zalmoxis]] among the [[Thracians]].

===''Zamolxe'' group===
Another group is the ''Zamolxe'', based in [[Bucharest]], whose high priest is Alexandru Mihail. They worship the old Thraco-Dacian pantheon of gods, and claim that the name "Zalmoxis" comes from ''zamol'', meaning "earth".&lt;ref&gt;Maras Loks: [http://www.marasloks.lv/public/?id=101 Zamolxe]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Zvi Raphaeli''' (b. Egypt 1924, d. 2005) was an Israeli impressionist painter. A rabbi by profession, he merged religion and art deftly in his paintings. He was educated in France from the age of three, and studied art at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, and also at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem, Israel. He initially studied engineering but after losing many close relatives including his father and brother in World War II, Raphaeli decided to study to be an artist. He was a member of the [[French Resistance]] during World War II, and lived in Israel where he moved to, in 1945 at the age of 21. Later on in his life, he also lived in the United States.

== Art ==
He is known for his works of art in varied media, including oil and watercolor, depicting street scenes in Israel, scenes from Jewish life and festivities, and occasionally floral still subjects. Style: His primary medium of painting was oil on canvas, with a prominent [[impasto]] technique, that brings depth to the subject. In the 70's, Raphaeli made his stamp as an art critic as well, providing his critique to various other Israeli artists like Moshe Givati at the nationwide 'Summer ‘70 Exhibition' held at the Goldman Gallery, [[Haifa]]. Austrian born Israeli Art critic Theodore F. Meisels once wrote in the [[Jerusalem Post]]: "Still, one should watch out; Should Raphaely, who behind his beard is far younger than he looks, ever attempt to harmonize his two worlds, then this genuine painting 'Chassid' could develop into an Israeli Chagall....."

Raphaeli has also authored and illustrated the [[Haggadah]] (a Jewish text for "telling" from father to son, the story of deliverance of Jews from Egypt), in his version THE PESSACH HAGGADAH [Hardcover-1975, Miller Publication, 1975]
