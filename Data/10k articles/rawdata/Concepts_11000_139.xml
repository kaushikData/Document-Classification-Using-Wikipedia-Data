'''Agni''' in [[Samskrita]] means "fire", and according to [[Ayurveda]] Agni happens to be the entity that is responsible for all digestive and metabolic processes in the human beings.

== Classification of Agni based on its location ==

Depending upon the stage of metabolism where a specific Agni is functionally active, Agni has been classified into three sub-classes: 'Jaṭharāgni', 'Bhūtāgni' and 'Dhātvagni'.

== Jaṭharāgni ==
While Jaṭharāgni acts on the food in the digestive tract and converts it into absorbable form, the Bhūtāgni acts after the digested material has been absorbed.

== Bhūtāgni ==
Bhūtāgni is of 5 types. Each of these 5 acts on the 5 primordial constituents of the absorbed food: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space. These 5 Bhutagnis transform the substrates into such form that can be assimilated at tissue level.

== Dhātvagni ==
The third class of Agni, the Dhātvagni, acts at the level of tissue metabolism and is helpful in the tissue nourishment tissue metabolism. This is of 7 types based on the kind of tissue that it helps nourishing.

== Classification of Agni based on its strength ==

Further, Ayurveda recognizes four functional states of Agni: regular, irregular, intense, and weak.

== Samāgni == 
Samāgni ensures complete digestion of the food ingested at the proper time without any irregularity. Its activity is neither too intense nor too weak. It is just appropriate and therefore, is ideal too. This results when all Doshas, Vata-Pitta-Kapha are in a state of equilibrium.

== Vişamāgni ==
Vişamāgni represents an unpredictable state of Agni, which is due to the dominance of Vayu. It sometimes quickly digests the food and at other times it does so very slowly, representing unpredictability.

== Tīkşņāgni ==
Tīkşņāgni results because of the dominance of Pitta which is intense, and hence, it easily digests even a very heavy meal, in a very short span of time.

== Mandāgni ==
Mandāgni is opposite to the Tīkşņāgni: it is subdued in its activity. This Agni is unable to digest and metabolize even a small quantity of food. This state of Agni is a result of the dominance of Kapha.

The '''Altamuran Revolution''' ({{lang-it|Rivoluzione di Altamura}}, also ''Rivoluzione altamurana'') was a three month period of self-government of Italian town [[Altamura]], right after the birth of the [[Parthenopean Republic]] (23 January 1799) which ousted the Bourbons and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The city of the Kingdom of Naples was then defeated and taken by the so-called [[Sanfedisti]], led by cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], after a battle on the city walls. After being defeated, most Altamurans managed to flee from ''porta Bari'', one of Altamura's main gates.

In February 1799, the news that the king had fled to [[Palermo]] arrived in Altamura. Altamura population then reorganized and embraced the ideals propagated by the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Arbre de la liberté|Liberty Tree]] was also planted in what it was then called ''piazza del mercato'' (today it's called ''piazza Duomo''). In the meantime, the [[Sanfedisti]],led by the cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], were getting closer and closer, determined to restore the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Bourbons]] dynasty. [[Sanfedisti]] left Matera and arrived at the gates of Altamura on 9 May 1799. Altamura had already fixed everything before the battle, by closing the secondary city gates, fusing the church bells in order to make new cannons and preparing ammunition. On 9 May, the battle took place, but soon Altamurans ran off of ammunition and they started to shoot coins. This let the enemy realize that the situation inside the city was critical and that they wouldn't last for long. On the night of 9 May  1799, most Altamurans managed to escape from ''porta Bari'' (perhaps accidentally or thanks to [[Fabrizio Ruffo | Ruffo]] unbeknown to his troops). On the morning of 10 May, [[Sanfedisti]] entered Altamura, sacking and slaughtering an unknown number of Altamurans who had remained there. The stay of [[Sanfedisti]] and [[Ruffo]] inside the city lasted 14 days, during which Altamurans gradually returned and some of them were killed or imprisoned. By the end of May 1799, the situation had already normalized and Altamura had returned under the full control of the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

The number of deaths among [[Sanfedisti]] has been estimated at around 1,400 people, but it is not clear how many [[Altamurans]] were killed. Some historians estimated the losses among Altamurans from about forty to a hundred people, while other historians suggested that many Altamurans and [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] people from other cities may have been counted as Sanfedisti. In this case, the death toll among Altamurans and Parthenopean Republicans would be much higher.

The effect was first described by [[Daniel Ellsberg]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borcherding|first1=Katrin|last2=Laričev|first2=Oleg Ivanovič|last3=Messick|first3=David M.|title=Contemporary Issues in Decision Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3l9AAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=978-0-444-88618-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
When buying a house, many people choose a fixed rate mortgage, where the interest rate is set in stone, over a variable rate mortgage, where the interest rate fluctuates with the market. This is the case even though a variable rate mortgage has statistically been shown to save money.

As an example, consider a bucket containing 30 balls. The balls are either red, black or white. Ten of the balls are red, and the remaining 20 are either black or white, with all combinations of black and white being equally likely. In option X, drawing a red ball wins a person $100, and in option Y, drawing a black ball wins them $100. The probability of picking a winning ball is the same for both options X and Y. In option X, the probability of selecting a winning ball is 1 in 3 (10 red balls out of 30 total balls). In option Y, despite the fact that the number of black balls is uncertain, the probability of selecting a winning ball is also 1 in 3. This is because the number of black balls is equally distributed among all possibilities between 0 and 20. The difference between the two options is that in option X, the probability of a favorable outcome is known, but in option Y, the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown ("ambiguous").

In spite of the equal probability of a favorable outcome, people have a greater tendency to select a ball under option X, where the probability of selecting a winning ball is perceived to be more certain. The uncertainty as to the number of black balls means that option Y tends to be viewed less favorably. Despite the fact that there could possibly be twice as many black balls as red balls, people tend not to want to take the opposing risk that there may be fewer than 10 black balls. The "ambiguity" behind option Y means that people tend to favor option X, even when the probability is the same.

A more realistic example might be the way people invest money. A risk-averse investor might tend to put their money into "safe" investments such as government bonds and bank deposits, as opposed to more volatile investments such as stocks and funds. Even though the stock market is likely to provide a significantly higher return over time, the investor might prefer the "safe" investment in which the return is known, instead of the less predictable stock market in which the return is not known.{{clarify|reason=The risk-averse investor actually has a lesser probability of losing money if he puts it into safe investments—in contrast to the ball-picking case, where the difference of probability is imagined. That is not an example of the effect.|date=January 2016}} The ambiguity effect is a possible explanation why people are reluctant to adopt new practices in the work place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Stephen D. |last1=Ritchie|title=Pro .NET Best Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdoWkN4_rI8C&amp;pg=PA320|year=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-4023-5|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is human to avoid ambiguous knowledge - to assume things are knowable when they are not. This is related to the [[clustering illusion]]. When presented with large amounts of confounding variables, people still tend to claim knowledge of the unknowable.  This produces cognitive dissonance which when avoided leads people to try to change venues to something with more certainty.

== Explanation ==
One possible explanation of the effect is that people have a rule of thumb ([[Heuristic#Psychology|heuristic]]) to avoid options where information is missing.&lt;ref name="FrischBaron1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisch|first1=Deborah|last2=Baron|first2=Jonathan|title=Ambiguity and rationality|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=1|issue=3|year=1988|pages=149–157|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960010303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RitovBaron1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritov|first1=Ilana|last2=Baron|first2=Jonathan|title=Reluctance to vaccinate: Omission bias and ambiguity|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=3|issue=4|year=1990|pages=263–277|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960030404|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/vac.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will often lead them to seek out the missing information. In many cases, though, the information cannot be obtained. The effect is often the result of calling some particular missing piece of information to the person's attention.

'''Echolocation''', also called '''bio sonar''', is the biological [[sonar]] used by several kinds of [[animals]].
Echolocating animals emit calls out to the environment and listen to the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] of those calls that return from various objects near them. They use these echoes to locate and identify the objects. Echolocation is used for [[animal navigation|navigation]] and for [[foraging]] (or hunting) in various environments.

Echolocating animals include some mammals and a few birds; most notably [[microchiroptera]]n [[bat]]s and [[odontocetes]] (toothed whales and dolphins), but also in simpler form in other groups such as [[shrew]]s, one genus of [[megachiroptera]]n bats (''[[Rousettus]]'') and two cave dwelling [[bird]] groups, the so-called cave [[swiftlet]]s in the genus ''[[Aerodramus]]'' (formerly ''Collocalia'') and the unrelated [[Oilbird]] ''Steatornis caripensis''.&lt;ref name=Rousettus&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=R.

The term ''echolocation'' was coined by the American zoologist [[Donald Griffin]], whose work with [[Robert Galambos]] was the first to convincingly demonstrate its existence in bats in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk.

Echolocation in [[odontocetes]] (toothed whales) was not properly described until two decades after Griffin and Galambos' work, by Schevill and McBride in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schevill | first1=W.E. | last2=McBride | first2=A.F. | year=1956 | title=Evidence for echolocation by cetaceans | journal=Deep-Sea Research | volume=3 | issue=2| pages=153–154 | doi=10.1016/0146-6313(56)90096-x|bibcode=1956DSR.....3..153S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1953, [[Jacques Yves Cousteau]] suggested in his first book, ''[[The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure|The Silent World]]'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;206–207) that porpoises had something like [[sonar]], judging by their navigational abilities.

== Principle ==

Echolocation is the same as active [[sonar]], using sounds made by the animal itself. Ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment. The relative intensity of sound received at each ear as well as the time delay between arrival at the two ears provide information about the horizontal angle (azimuth) from which the reflected sound waves arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.051 | author=Jones G. | year=2005 | title=Echolocation | journal=Current Biology | volume =15 | issue=13 | pages=484–488 | pmid=16005275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some human-made sonars that rely on many extremely narrow beams and many receivers to localize a target ([[multibeam sonar]]), animal echolocation has only one transmitter and two receivers (the ears) positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to perceive distance and direction. With echolocation, the bat or other animal can see not only where it is going but also how big another animal is, what kind of animal it is, and other features.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.

At the most basic level, echolocation is based on the neural anatomy of auditory brain circuitry. In essence, ascending brain pathways in the brain stem allow the brain to calculate the difference between the two ears to very small fractions of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Auditory Pathway: Structure and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=437jBwAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer |date=2012-12-06 |isbn=978-1-468-41300-7 |first=Josef |last=Syka |first2=R.

==Bats==

[[File:PipiBat.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Spectrogram]] of ''[[Pipistrellus]]'' bat vocalizations.  Detail is shown as the pulses transition to a faster repetition rate.  The bat appears to use a hybrid pulse which combines a sharp falling frequency [[chirp]] with an extended constant frequency tail.  Such a [[waveform]] may offer combined benefits of range estimation as well as Doppler shift detection.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}]]

{{Listen|filename=Pipistrellus.ogg|title=Pipistrellus Pulses|description=Recording of ''Pipistrellus'' bat approaching its prey.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

[[Microbat]]s use echolocation to [[Animal navigation|navigate]] and forage, often in total darkness. They generally emerge from their roosts in caves, attics, or trees at dusk and hunt for insects into the night. Their use of echolocation allows them to occupy a niche where there are often many [[insect]]s (that come out at night since there are fewer predators then), less competition for food, and fewer species that may prey on the bats themselves.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Microbats generate [[ultrasound]] via the [[larynx]] and emit the sound through the open mouth or, much more rarely, the nose. The latter is most pronounced in the [[horseshoe bats]] (''Rhinolophus spp.''). Microbat {{Audio|Ultrasonic_bat_calls.ogg|calls}} range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, mostly beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz). Bats may estimate the elevation of targets by interpreting the [[interference pattern]]s caused by the echoes reflecting from the [[tragus (ear)|tragus]], a flap of skin in the external ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Muller| first=R.| year=2004| title=A numerical study of the role of the tragus in the big brown bat| journal=JASA| volume=116| pages=3701–3712| doi=10.1121/1.1815133 | issue=6 |bibcode=2004ASAJ..116.3701M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two hypotheses about the evolution of echolocation in bats. The first suggests that [[Larynx|laryngeal]] echolocation evolved twice in Chiroptera, once in the [[Yangochiroptera]] and once in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Teeling | display-authors=etal | year=2000 | title=Molecular evidence regarding the origin of echolocation and flight in bats |  journal=Nature | volume=403 | issue=| pages=188–192 |bibcode=2000Natur.403..188T |doi=10.1038/35003188 | pmid=10646602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Order Chiroptera (Bats)| publisher=Animal Diversity Web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Chiroptera.html | accessdate =2007-12-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071221224447/http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Chiroptera.html| archivedate= 21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposes that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family [[Pteropodidae]] (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus ''[[Rousettus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Springer | display-authors=etal   | year=2001 | title=Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation |  journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=98 | issue=11| pages=6241–6246 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111551998 | pmid=11353869 | pmc=33452|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.6241S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual bat species echolocate within specific frequency ranges that suit their environment and prey types. This has sometimes been used by researchers to identify bats flying in an area simply by recording their calls with ultrasonic recorders known as "bat detectors". However echolocation calls are not always species specific and some bats overlap in the type of calls they use so recordings of echolocation calls cannot be used to identify all bats. In recent years researchers in several countries have developed "bat call libraries" that contain recordings of local bat species that have been identified known as "reference calls" to assist with identification.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since the 1970s there has been an ongoing controversy among researchers as to whether bats use a form of processing known from [[radar]] termed [[Coherence (signal processing)|coherent]] cross-correlation. Coherence means that the phase of the echolocation signals is used by the bats, while [[cross-correlation]] just implies that the outgoing signal is compared with the returning echoes in a running process. Today most – but not all – researchers believe that they use cross-correlation, but in an incoherent form, termed a filter bank receiver.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

When searching for prey they produce sounds at a low rate (10–20 clicks/second). During the search phase the sound emission is coupled to respiration, which is again coupled to the wingbeat. This coupling appears to dramatically conserve energy as there is little to no additional energetic cost of echolocation to flying bats.&lt;ref&gt;Speakman and Racey 1991&lt;/ref&gt; After detecting a potential prey item, microbats increase the rate of pulses, ending with the '''terminal buzz''', at rates as high as 200  clicks/second. During approach to a detected target, the duration of the sounds is gradually decreased, as is the energy of the sound.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Calls and ecology===

Bats belonging to the suborder [[Microchiroptera]] (microbats) occupy a diverse set of ecological conditions – they can be found living in environments as different as [[Europe]] and [[Madagascar]], and hunting for food sources as different as insects, frogs, nectar, fruit, and blood.  Additionally, the characteristics of an echolocation call are adapted to the particular environment, hunting behavior, and food source of the particular bat.  However, this adaptation of echolocation calls to ecological factors is constrained by the phylogenetic relationship of the bats, leading to a process known as descent with modification, and resulting in the diversity of the Microchiroptera today.&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"&gt;Jones and Teeling 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"&gt;Grinnell 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"&gt;Zupanc 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"&gt;Fenton 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"&gt;Neuweiler 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"&gt;Simmons and Stein 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustic features===

Describing the diversity of bat echolocation calls requires examination of the frequency and temporal features of the calls. It is the variations in these aspects that produce echolocation calls suited for different acoustic environments and hunting behaviors.&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiryu et al. 2007"&gt;Hiryu et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frequency====

Bat call frequencies range from as low as 11&amp;nbsp;kHz to as high as 212&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Jones, G. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=G. | last2=Holderied | first2=M.

''Euderma maculatum'', a species that feeds on moths, uses a particularly low frequency of 12.7&amp;nbsp;kHz that cannot be heard by moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fullard | first1=J. | last2=Dawson | first2=J. | year=1997 | title=The echolocation calls of the spotted bat euderma maculatum are relatively inaudible to moths |  journal=J Exp Biol | volume=200 | issue=| pages=129–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frequency modulation and constant frequency====

Echolocation calls can be composed of two different types of frequency structure: [[frequency modulated]] (FM) sweeps, and constant frequency (CF) tones. A particular call can consist of one, the other, or both structures.  An FM sweep is a broadband signal – that is, it contains a downward sweep through a range of frequencies. A CF tone is a narrowband signal:  the sound stays constant at one frequency throughout its duration.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Intensity====

Echolocation calls have been measured at intensities anywhere between 60 and 140 [[decibels]].&lt;ref&gt;Surlykee et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Certain microbat species can modify their call intensity mid-call, lowering the intensity as they approach objects that reflect sound strongly.  This prevents the returning echo from deafening the bat.&lt;ref name="Hiryu et al. 2007"/&gt; High-intensity calls such as those from aerial-hawking bats (133&amp;nbsp;dB) are adaptive to hunting in open skies. Their high intensity calls are necessary to even have moderate detection of surroundings because air has a high absorption of ultrasound and because insects’ size only provide a small target for sound reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Holderied | first1=M. W. | last2=von Helversen | first2=O. | year=2003 | title=Echolocation range and wing beat period match in aerial-hawking bats | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=270 | issue=1530| pages=2293–2299 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2487 | pmid=14613617 | pmc=1691500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the so-called "whispering bats" have adapted low-amplitude echolocation so that their prey, moths, which are able to hear echolocation calls, are less able to detect and avoid an oncoming bat.&lt;ref&gt;Fullard 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Harmonic composition====

Calls can be composed of one frequency or multiple frequencies comprising a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]].  In the latter case, the call is usually dominated by a certain harmonic ("dominant" frequencies are those present at higher intensities than other harmonics present in the call).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====Call duration====

A single echolocation call (a call being a single continuous trace on a sound [[spectrogram]], and a series of calls comprising a sequence or pass) can last anywhere from 0.2 to 100 milliseconds in duration, depending on the stage of prey-catching behavior that the bat is engaged in.  For example, the duration of a call usually decreases when the bat is in the final stages of prey capture – this enables the bat to call more rapidly without overlap of call and echo. Reducing duration comes at the cost of having less total sound available for reflecting off objects and being heard by the bat.&lt;ref name="Jones, G. 2007"/&gt;

====Pulse interval====

The time interval between subsequent echolocation calls (or pulses) determines two aspects of a bat's perception. First, it establishes how quickly the bat's auditory scene information is updated. For example, bats increase the repetition rate of their calls (that is, decrease the pulse interval) as they home in on a target. This allows the bat to get new information regarding the target's location at a faster rate when it needs it most. Secondly, the pulse interval determines the maximum range that bats can detect objects. This is because bats can only keep track of the echoes from one call at a time; as soon as they make another call they stop listening for echoes from the previously made call. For example, a pulse interval of 100 ms (typical of a bat searching for insects) allows sound to travel in air roughly 34 meters so a bat can only detect objects as far away as 17 meters (the sound has to travel out and back). With a pulse interval of 5 ms (typical of a bat in the final moments of a capture attempt), the bat can only detect objects up to 85&amp;nbsp;cm away. Therefore, the bat constantly has to make a choice between getting new information updated quickly and detecting objects far away.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Moss 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====FM signal advantages====

[[File:Yannick Dauby - Bats echolocation (CC by).ogg|thumb|Echolocation call produced by ''[[Pipistrellus pipistrellus]]'', an FM bat. The ultrasonic call has been "[[heterodyne]]d" – multiplied by a constant frequency to produce frequency subtraction, and thus an audible sound – by a bat detector. A key feature of the recording is the increase in the repetition rate of the call as the bat nears its target – this is called the "terminal buzz".]]

The major advantage conferred by an FM signal is extremely precise range discrimination, or localization, of the target.  J.A. Simmons demonstrated this effect with a series of elegant experiments that showed how bats using FM signals could distinguish between two separate targets even when the targets were less than half a millimeter apart.  This ability is due to the broadband sweep of the signal, which allows for better resolution of the time delay between the call and the returning echo, thereby improving the cross correlation of the two. Additionally, if harmonic frequencies are added to the FM signal, then this localization becomes even more precise.&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;

One possible disadvantage of the FM signal is a decreased operational range of the call.  Because the energy of the call is spread out among many frequencies, the distance at which the FM-bat can detect targets is limited.&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt; This is in part because any echo returning at a particular frequency can only be evaluated for a brief fraction of a millisecond, as the fast downward sweep of the call does not remain at any one frequency for long.&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;

====CF signal advantages====

The structure of a CF signal is adaptive in that it allows the CF-bat to detect both the velocity of a target, and the fluttering of a target's wings as Doppler shifted frequencies.  A [[Doppler shift]] is an alteration in sound wave frequency, and is produced in two relevant situations:  when the bat and its target are moving relative to each other, and when the target's wings are oscillating back and forth. CF-bats must compensate for Doppler shifts, lowering the frequency of their call in response to echoes of elevated frequency – this ensures that the returning echo remains at the frequency to which the ears of the bat are most finely tuned.  The oscillation of a target's wings also produces amplitude shifts, which gives a CF-bat additional help in distinguishing a flying target from a stationary one.&lt;ref&gt;Schnitzler and Flieger 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;

Additionally, because the signal energy of a CF call is concentrated into a narrow frequency band, the operational range of the call is much greater than that of an FM signal.  This relies on the fact that echoes returning within the narrow frequency band can be summed over the entire length of the call, which maintains a constant frequency for up to 100 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt;

====Acoustic environments of FM and CF signals====

A frequency modulated (FM) component is excellent for hunting prey while flying in close, cluttered environments.  Two aspects of the FM signal account for this fact:  the precise target localization conferred by the broadband signal, and the short duration of the call.  The first of these is essential because in a cluttered environment, the bats must be able to resolve their prey from large amounts of background noise.  The 3D localization abilities of the broadband signal enable the bat to do exactly that, providing it with what Simmons and Stein (1980) call a "clutter rejection strategy."  This strategy is further improved by the use of harmonics, which, as previously stated, enhance the localization properties of the call.  The short duration of the FM call is also best in close, cluttered environments because it enables the bat to emit many calls extremely rapidly without overlap. This means that the bat can get an almost continuous stream of information – essential when objects are close, because they will pass by quickly – without confusing which echo corresponds to which call.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt;

A constant frequency (CF) component is often used by bats hunting for prey while flying in open, clutter-free environments, or by bats that wait on perches for their prey to appear.  The success of the former strategy is due to two aspects of the CF call, both of which confer excellent prey-detection abilities.  First, the greater working range of the call allows bats to detect targets present at  great distances – a common situation in open environments.  Second, the length of the call is also suited for targets at great distances:  in this case, there is a decreased chance that the long call will overlap with the returning echo.  The latter strategy is made possible by the fact that the long, narrowband call allows the bat to detect Doppler shifts, which would be produced by an insect moving either towards or away from a perched bat.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt;

===Neural mechanisms===

Because bats use echolocation to orient themselves and to locate objects, their auditory systems are adapted for this purpose, highly specialized for sensing and interpreting the stereotyped echolocation calls characteristic of their own species.  This specialization is evident from the inner ear up to the highest levels of information processing in the auditory cortex.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Inner ear and primary sensory neurons===

Both CF and FM bats have specialized inner ears which allow them to hear sounds in the ultrasonic range, far outside the range of human hearing.  Although in most other aspects, the bat's auditory organs are similar to those of most other mammals, certain bats ([[horseshoe bats]], ''Rhinolophus spp.'' and the [[moustached bat]], ''Pteronotus parnelii'') with a constant frequency (CF) component to their call (known as high duty cycle bats) do have a few additional adaptations for detecting the predominant frequency (and harmonics) of the CF vocalization. These include a narrow frequency "tuning" of the inner ear organs, with an especially large area responding to the frequency of the bat's returning echoes.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;

The [[basilar membrane]] within the [[cochlea]] contains the first of these specializations for echo information processing.  In bats that use CF signals, the section of membrane that responds to the frequency of returning echoes is much larger than the region of response for any other frequency.  For example, in the greater horseshoe bat, ''[[Rhinolophus ferrumequinum]]'', there is a disproportionately lengthened and thickened section of the membrane that responds to sounds around 83&amp;nbsp;kHz, the constant frequency of the echo produced by the bat's call.  This area of high sensitivity to a specific, narrow range of frequency is known as an "acoustic [[fovea centralis|fovea]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schuller and Pollack 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Odontocetes (toothed whales and dolphins) have similar cochlear specializations to those found in bats. Odontocetes also have the highest neural investment of any cochleae reported to date with ratios of greater than 1500 ganglion cells/mm of basilar membrane.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Further along the auditory pathway, the movement of the basilar membrane results in the stimulation of primary auditory neurons.  Many of these neurons are specifically "tuned" (respond most strongly) to the narrow frequency range of returning echoes of CF calls.  Because of the large size of the acoustic fovea, the number of neurons responding to this region, and thus to the echo frequency, is especially high.&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"&gt;Carew 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inferior colliculus===

In the [[Inferior colliculus]], a structure in the bat's midbrain, information from lower in the auditory processing pathway is integrated and sent on to the auditory cortex.   As George Pollak and others showed in a series of papers in 1977, the [[interneurons]] in this region have a very high level of sensitivity to time differences, since the time delay between a call and the returning echo tells the bat its distance from the target object. While most neurons respond more quickly to stronger stimuli, collicular neurons maintain their timing accuracy even as signal intensity changes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

These interneurons are specialized for time sensitivity in several ways.  First, when activated, they generally respond with only one or two [[action potential]]s.  This short duration of response allows their action potentials to give a very specific indication of the exact moment of the time when the stimulus arrived, and to respond accurately to stimuli that occur close in time to one another.  In addition, the neurons have a very low threshold of activation – they respond quickly even to weak stimuli.  Finally, for FM signals, each interneuron is tuned to a specific frequency within the sweep, as well as to that same frequency in the following echo.   There is specialization for the CF component of the call at this level as well.  The high proportion of neurons responding to the frequency of the acoustic fovea actually increases at this level.&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollak 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditory cortex===

The [[auditory cortex]] in bats is quite large in comparison with other mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kanwal |first=Jagmeet S. |last2=Rauschecker |first2=Josef P. |date=2007-05-01 |title=Auditory cortex of bats and primates: managing species-specific calls for social communication |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience |volume=12 |pages=4621–4640 |pmc=4276140 |pmid=17485400 |doi=10.2741/2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various characteristics of sound are processed by different regions of the cortex, each providing different information about the location or movement of a target object.   Most of the existing studies on information processing in the auditory cortex of the bat have been done by [[Nobuo Suga]] on the mustached bat, ''[[Pteronotus parnellii]]''. This bat's call has both CF tone and FM sweep components.

Suga and his colleagues have shown that the cortex contains a series of "maps" of auditory information, each of which is organized systematically based on characteristics of sound such as [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]]. The neurons in these areas respond only to a specific combination of frequency and timing (sound-echo delay), and are known as [[combination-sensitive neurons]].

The systematically organized maps in the auditory cortex respond to various aspects of the echo signal, such as its delay and its velocity.  These regions are composed of "combination sensitive" neurons that require at least two specific stimuli to elicit a response.  The neurons vary systematically across the maps, which are organized by acoustic features of the sound and can be two dimensional.  The different features of the call and its echo are used by the bat to determine important characteristics of their prey.  The maps include:

[[File:BatAuditoryCortex.JPG|thumb|420px|right|Sketch of the regions of the auditory cortex in a bat's brain]]

*'''FM-FM area''':  This region of the cortex contains FM-FM combination-sensitive neurons.  These cells respond only to the combination of two FM sweeps: a call and its echo.  The neurons in the FM-FM region are often referred to as "delay-tuned," since each responds to a specific time delay between the original call and the echo, in order to find the distance from the target object (the range).  Each neuron also shows specificity for one harmonic in the original call and a different harmonic in the echo.  The neurons within the FM-FM area of the cortex of ''Pteronotus'' are organized into columns, in which the delay time is constant vertically but increases across the horizontal plane.  The result is that range is encoded by location on the cortex, and increases systematically across the FM-FM area.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1975"&gt;Suga et al. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suga et al. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''CF-CF area''':  Another kind of combination-sensitive neuron is the CF-CF neuron.  These respond best to the combination of a CF call containing two given frequencies – a call at 30&amp;nbsp;kHz (CF1) and one of its additional [[harmonics]] around 60 or 90&amp;nbsp;kHz (CF2 or CF3) –  and the corresponding echoes.  Thus, within the CF-CF region, the changes in echo frequency caused by the [[Doppler shift]] can be compared to the frequency of the original call to calculate the bat's velocity relative to its target object.  As in the FM-FM area, information is encoded by its location within the map-like organization of the region.  The CF-CF area is first split into the distinct CF1-CF2 and CF1-CF3 areas.  Within each area, the CF1 frequency is organized on an axis, perpendicular to the CF2 or CF3 frequency axis.  In the resulting grid, each neuron codes for a certain combination of frequencies that is indicative of a specific velocity&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1987"&gt;Suga et al. 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''DSCF area''':  This large section of the cortex is a map of the acoustic fovea, organized by frequency and by amplitude.  Neurons in this region respond to CF signals that have been Doppler shifted (in other words, echoes only) and are within the same narrow frequency range to which the acoustic fovea responds.  For ''Pteronotus'', this is around 61&amp;nbsp;kHz.  This area is organized into columns, which are arranged radially based on frequency.  Within a column, each neuron responds to a specific combination of frequency and amplitude. Suga's studies have indicated that this brain region is necessary for frequency discrimination.&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1987"/&gt;

==Toothed whales==

[[File:Toothed whale sound production.png|thumb|420px|right|Diagram illustrating sound generation, propagation and reception in a toothed whale. Outgoing sounds are red and incoming ones are green]]

Biosonar is valuable to [[toothed whales]] (suborder [[Odontoceti]]), including [[dolphin]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[river dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s and [[sperm whale]]s, because they live in an underwater habitat that has favourable acoustic characteristics and where [[visual perception|vision]] is extremely limited in range due to [[underwater|absorption]] or [[turbidity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Cetacean evolution consisted of three main radiations. Throughout the middle and late Eocene periods (49-31.5 million years ago), [[archaeocete]]s, primitive toothed Cetacea that arose from terrestrial mammals with the creation of aquatic adaptations, were the only known archaic Cetacea.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fordyce | first1=R. E. | year=1980 | title=Whale evolution and oligocene southern-ocean environments |  journal= 	Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=31 | issue=| pages=319–336 | doi=10.1016/0031-0182(80)90024-3|bibcode = 1980PPP....31..319F }}&lt;/ref&gt; These primitive aquatic mammals did not possess the ability to echolocate, although they did have slightly adapted underwater hearing.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 2003"&gt;Fordyce, R. E. 2003. Cetacean evolution and Eocene-Oligocene oceans revisited. From greenhouse to icehouse: the marine eocene-oligocene transition:154–170.&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology of acoustically isolated ear bones in basilosaurid archaeocetes indicates that this order had directional hearing underwater at low to mid frequencies by the late middle Eocene.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D.R. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lindberg | first1=D.R. | last2=Pyenson | first2=N.D. | year=2007 | title=Things that go bump in the night: evolutionary interactions between cephalopods and cetaceans in the tertiary |  journal=Lethaia | volume=40 | issue=4| pages=335–343 | doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2007.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the extinction of archaeocete at the onset of the Oligocene, two new lineages in the early Oligocene period (31.5-28 million years ago) comprised a second radiation. These early mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes can be dated back to the middle Oligocene in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 1980"/&gt; Based on past phylogenies, it has been found that the evolution of odontocetes is monophyletic, suggesting that echolocation evolved only once 36 to 34 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D.R. 2007"/&gt; Dispersal rates routes of early odontocetes included transoceanic travel to new adaptive zones. The third radiation occurred later in the Neogene, when present dolphins and their relatives evolved to be the most common species in the modern sea.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 2003"/&gt;

The evolution of echolocation could be attributed to several theories. There are two proposed drives for the hypotheses of cetacean radiation, one biotic and the other abiotic in nature. The first, adaptive radiation, is the result of a rapid divergence into new adaptive zones. This results in diverse, ecologically different clades that are incomparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slater | first1=G. J. | last2=Price | first2=S.

These ecological opportunities were the result of abundant dietary resources with low competition for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Steeman | first1=M. E. | last2=Hebsgaard | first2=M.

A second, more abiotic drive is better supported. Physical restructuring of the oceans has played a role in echolocation radiation. This was a result of global climate change at the [[Eocene-Oligocene boundary]]; from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. Tectonic openings created the emergence of the Southern ocean with a free flowing Antarctic Circumpolar current.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg &amp; Pyenson 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steeman et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These events allowed for a selection regime characterized by the ability to locate and capture prey in turbid river waters, or allow odontocetes to invade and feed at depths below the photic zone. Further studies have found that echolocation below the photic zone could have been a predation adaptation to [[Diel vertical migration|diel migrating]] [[cephalopods]].&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D.R. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fordyce | first1=R.E. | last2=Barnes | first2=L.G. | year=1994 | title=The evolutionary history of whales and dolphins |  journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume=22 | issue=1| pages=419–455 | doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.22.1.419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its advent, there has been [[adaptive radiation]] especially in the family [[Delphinidae]] (dolphins) in which echolocation has become extremely derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McGowen | first1=M.R. | last2=Spaulding | first2=M. | last3=Gatesy | first3=J. | year=2009 | title=Divergence date estimation and a comprehensive molecular tree of extant cetaceans |  journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume=53 | issue=3| pages=891–906 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.08.018 | pmid=19699809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two proteins have been found to play a major role in toothed whale echolocation. Prestin, a motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea, has an association between the number of nonsynonymous substitutions and hearing sensitivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Y. |title=Cetaceans on a Molecular Fast Track to Ultrasonic Hearing |journal=Current Biology |date=2010|volume=20 |pages=1834–1839 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.008 |issue=20 |pmid=20933423}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has undergone two clear episodes of accelerated protein evolution in cetaceans: on the ancestral branch of odontocetes and on the branch leading to delphinioidae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first episode of acceleration is connected to odontocete divergence, when echolocation first developed, and the second occurs with the increase in echolocation frequency seen in the family Delphinioidae. Cldn14, a member of the tight junction proteins which form barriers between inner ear cells, shows exactly the same evolutionary pattern as Prestin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=H. H.|title=Adaptive evolution of tight junction protein claudin-14 in echolocating whales |journal=Gene |date=2013|volume=530 |pages=208–214|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2013.08.034 |issue=2|pmid=23965379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two events of protein evolution, for Prestin and Cldn14, occurred at the same times as the tectonic opening of the [[Drake Passage]] (34-31 Ma) and the Antarctic ice growth at the middle Miocene climate transition (14 Ma), with the divergence of odontocetes and mysticetes occurring with the former, and the speciation of delphinioidae with the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steeman |first1=M. E. |title=Radiation of Extant Cetaceans Driven by Restructuring of the Oceans |journal=Systematic Biology |date=2009 |volume=58 |pages=573–585 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/syp060 |issue=6 |pmid=20525610 |pmc=2777972}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong connection between these proteins, the ocean restructuring events, and the echolocation evolution.
[[File:Killer_whale_residents_broadband.ogg|left|thumb|Southern resident [[killer whale]]s using echolocation.]]
One specific type of echolocation, narrow-band high frequency (NBHF) clicks, evolved at least four times in groups of odontocetes, including the pygmy sperm whale ([[Kogiidae]]) and porpoise ([[Phocoenidae]]) families, ''[[La Plata dolphin|Pontoporia blainvillei]]'', the genus ''[[Cephalorhynchus]]'', and part of the genus ''[[Lagenorhynchus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Morisaka | first1=T. | last2=Connor | first2=R.C. | year=2007 | title=Predation by killer whales (''Orcinus orca'') and the evolution of whistle loss and narrow-band high frequency clicks in odontocetes |  journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=20 | issue=4| pages=1439–1458 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01336.x | pmid=17584238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kyhn, L.A. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kyhn | first1=L.A. | last2=Jensen | first2=F.H. | last3=Beedholm | first3=K. | last4=Tougaard | first4=J. | last5=Hansen | first5=M. | last6=Madsen | first6=P.T. | year=2010 | title=Echolocation in sympatric Peale's dolphins (''Lagenorhynchus australis'') and Commerson's dolphins (''Cephalorhynchus commersonii'') producing narrow-band high-frequency clicks |  journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=213 | issue=11| pages=1940–1949 | doi=10.1242/jeb.042440 | pmid=20472781}}&lt;/ref&gt; These high frequency clicks likely evolved as adaptation of predator avoidance, as they inhabit areas that have many killer whales and the signals are inaudible to killer whales due to the absence of energy below 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Another reason for variation in echolocation is habitat. For all sonar systems the limiting factor deciding whether a returning echo is detected is the echo-to-noise ratio (ENR). The ENR is given by the emitted source level (SL) plus the target strength, minus the two-way transmission loss (absorption and spreading) and the received noise.&lt;ref name="Kyhn, L.A. 2010" /&gt; Animals will adapt either to maximize range under noise-limited conditions (increase source level) or to reduce noise clutter in a shallow and/or littered habitat (decrease source level). In cluttered habitats, such as coastal areas, prey ranges are smaller, and species like  Commerson's dolphin (''[[Cephalorhynchus commersonii']]') have lowered source levels to better suit their environment.&lt;ref name="Kyhn, L.A. 2010" /&gt;

Toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the 'melon'. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities. Most toothed whales use clicks in a series, or click train, for echolocation, while the sperm whale may produce clicks individually. Toothed whale whistles do not appear to be used in echolocation. Different rates of click production in a click train give rise to the familiar barks, squeals and growls of the [[bottlenose dolphin]]. A click train with a repetition rate over 600 per second is called a burst pulse. In bottlenose dolphins, the auditory brain response resolves individual clicks up to 600 per second, but yields a graded response for higher repetition rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cranford, T.W., (2000). "In Search of Impulse Sound Sources in Odontocetes." In ''Hearing by Whales and Dolphins'' (Springer Handbook of Auditory Research series), W.W.L. Au, A.N. Popper and R.R. Fay, Eds. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that some smaller toothed whales may have their tooth arrangement suited to aid in echolocation.  The placement of teeth in the jaw of a bottlenose dolphin, for example, are not symmetrical when seen from a vertical plane, and this asymmetry could possibly be an aid in the dolphin sensing if echoes from its biosonar are coming from one side or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, A.D., and Klinowska, M.A., (1990).

In ''Sensory Abilities of Cetaceans'' vol 196 ed J A Thomas and R A Kastelein (New York: Plenum) pp 255–67 (NATO ASI Series A)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobbins | first1=P | year=2007 | title=Dolphin sonar—modeling a new receiver concept |  journal=Bioinspired Biomimicry | volume=2 | issue=1| pages=19–29 | doi=10.1088/1748-3182/2/1/003|bibcode=2007BiBi....2...19D | url=http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/Dolphin+sonar%E2%80%94modelling+a+new+receiverDobbins.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea lacks experimental support.

Echoes are received using complex fatty structures around the lower jaw as the primary reception path, from where they are transmitted to the middle ear via a continuous fat body. Lateral sound may be received though fatty lobes surrounding the ears with a similar density to water. Some researchers believe that when they approach the object of interest, they protect themselves against the louder echo by quietening the emitted sound. In bats this is known to happen, but here the hearing sensitivity is also reduced close to a target.&lt;ref&gt;Ketten 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ketten 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Echolocation jamming in animals}}

Echolocation systems are susceptible to interference known as [[echolocation jamming]] or sonar jamming. Jamming occurs when non-target sounds interfere with target echoes.

'''Avidyā''' (Sanskrit; Pāli: ''avijjā''; Tibetan phonetic: ''ma rigpa'') in Buddhist literature is commonly translated as "ignorance".{{Sfn|Keown|2013|p=73}}{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn|Robert Buswell |Donald Lopez|2013|pp=1070}} The concept refers to ignorance or misconceptions about the nature of metaphysical reality, in particular about the [[anicca|impermanence]] and [[anatta|non-self]] doctrines about reality.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus |title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-97342-3 |pages=533–534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Conze|2013|pp=39-40}} It is the root cause of ''[[Dukkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness),{{Sfn|Robert Buswell |Donald Lopez|2013|p=86}} and asserted as the first link, in Buddhist phenomenology, of a process that leads to [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|repeated birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Webster|title=The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S89fgAUG2AEC|date=31 December 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27941-8|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avidyā is mentioned within the Buddhist teachings as ignorance or misunderstanding in various contexts:
* [[Four Noble Truths]]{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=67}}
* The first link in the twelve links of dependent origination
* One of the three poisons within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Six root unwholesome factors|six root kleshas]] within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings
* One of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] in the Theravada tradition 
* Equivalent to [[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings

Within the context of the twelve links of dependent origination, avidya is typically symbolized by a person who is blind or wearing a blindfold.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Etymology==
''Avidyā'' is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of ''a'' and ''vidya'', meaning "not vidya". The word ''vidya'' is derived from the Sanskrit root ''vid'', which means "to know, to perceive, to see, to understand".&lt;ref name=mmwp918&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''avidya'' means to "not know". The ''vid*''-related terms appear extensively in the [[Rigveda]] and other [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=mmwp918/&gt;

In Vedic literature, ''avidya'' refers to "ignorance, spiritual ignorance, illusion"; in early Buddhist texts, states Monier-Williams, it means "ignorance with non-existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''weid''-, meaning "to see" or "to know". It is a cognate with the Latin verb ''vidēre'' ("to see") and English ''wit''.

==Overview==
Avidya is explained in different ways or on different levels within different Buddhist teachings or traditions. On the most fundamental level, it is ignorance or misunderstanding of the nature of reality; {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Avidya can be defined on different levels; for example, it can be defined as a mis-perception of the nature of reality, or as not understanding the four noble truths. For example:
* [[Jeffrey Hopkins]] states: "[Ignorance] isn't just an inability to apprehend the truth but an active misapprehension of the status of oneself and all other objects—one's own mind or body, other people, and so forth. It is the conception or assumption that phenomena exist in a far more concrete way than they actually do. Based on this misapprehension of the status of persons and things, we are drawn into afflictive desire ([[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]) and hatred ([[dvesha]])..."&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1992), p. 4 (from the Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sonam Rinchen states: "Every action leaves its imprint on the mind, and later craving and grasping activate the imprint to bring about its result. Underlying this kind of action is our ignorance, namely our innate misconception of the self, the root of all our troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}} more specifically about the nature of not-Self and dependent origination doctrines.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn|Conze|2013|pp=39-40}}{{Sfn|Williams|Tribe|2000|pp=66-67, Quote: From this perspective Not-Self and dependent origination together come to form the two pillars of the final gnosis (vidya) which is the antidote to ignorance (avidya).}} ''Avidya'' is not lack of information, states Peter Harvey, but a "more deep seated misperception of reality".{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=67}} Gethin calls Avidya as 'positive misconception', not mere absence of knowledge.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|p=150}} It is a key concept in Buddhism, wherein ''Avidya'' about the nature of reality, rather than sin, is considered the basic root of ''[[Dukkha]]''.{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=65-68}} Removal of this ''Avidya'' leads to overcoming of ''Dukkha''.{{Sfn|Edelglass|2009|p=171}}

While Avidyā found in Buddhism and other Indian philosophies is often translated as "ignorance", states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because it means more than ignorance. He suggests the term "unwisdom" to be a better rendition.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Meaning of Unwisdom (Avidya)| author= Alex Wayman|journal = Philosophy East and West| volume= 7| number= 1/2| year= 1957| pages= 21–25 | jstor= 1396830| doi=10.2307/1396830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions).&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt; Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;

Monks, but when there is the attitude 'I am',
there there is descent of the 
five sense-faculties of eye.... body.
Monks, there is the mind organ,
there are mental objects,
there is the element of knowledge;
monks, the uninstructed ordinary person,

born of stimulation by spiritual ignorance [''Avijja''],
thinks 'I am'.

In other contexts, avidya includes not knowing or not understanding the nature of phenomena as impermanent, the [[Four Noble Truths]],{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=67}} other Buddhist doctrines, or the path to end suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst (2009), Buddhist Teaching in India, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-861715667}}, pages 40-43&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Peter Harvey|2013|pp=5, 40, 134-137}} Sonam Rinchen states ''Avidya'' in the context of the twelve links, that "[Ignorance] is the opposite of the understanding that the person or other phenomena lack intrinsic existence. Those who are affected by this ignorance create actions which precipitate them into further worldly existence."&lt;ref&gt;Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Not understanding the [[Four Noble Truths]], or its implications, is also Avidya.&lt;ref name=s1&gt;Ajahn Sucitto (2010), Kindle Locations 1125-1132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avidya in Buddhist traditions==
Avidya appears as a major item of discussion in two doctrines about the nature of reality, in various Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winston L. King|title=Buddhism and Christianity: Some Bridges of Understanding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaZTAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-56555-9|pages=186–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|author2=Frank E.

The doctrines of no-self and impermanence are thus the keystones of ''dhammic'' order."&lt;/ref&gt; One relates to the [[Anatta]] (Anatman) doctrine, that is ignorance or misconceptions about "Self", when in reality there is only non-Self according to Buddhism.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=146-159, 243}}{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=72, 125-126, 144}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Charles Harris |title=The Continuity of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLZeKatsbaYC |year=1991|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-09448-2 |pages=138–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second relates to [[Anicca]] doctrine, that is ignorance or misconceptions about "permanence", when the nature of reality is impermanence.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=73-75}}{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=68}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Charles Harris |title=The Continuity of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLZeKatsbaYC |year=1991|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-09448-2 |pages=174–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada===
{{Nidanas|float=right}}
Bhikkhu Bodhi states that Avidya is an important part of the Theravada Abhidharma teachings about [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent arising]] about conditions that sustain the wheel of birth and death. One such condition is the karmic formations that arise from ignorance. In other words, states Bodhi, ignorance (avijja) obscures "perception of the true nature of things just as a cataract obscures perception of visible objects". In the Suttanta literature, this ignorance refers to the non-knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. In the Abhidharma literature, in addition to the Four Noble Truths, it is the non-knowledge of one's 'past pre-natal lives' and 'post-mortem future lives' and of dependent arising.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ACrogsyJmoAC A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma: The Abhidhammattha Sangaha], Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana===
{{see also|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika_distinction#Ignorance_-_The_Object_to_be_Negated}}
The Mahayana tradition considers ignorance about the nature of reality and immemorial past lives to be a primordial force, which can only be broken through the insight of Emptiness (''[[sunyata]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruno Petzold |title=The Classification of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZH29oiIuIkC |year=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-03373-2 |pages=259–260, 849 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to other Buddhist traditions, states Jens Braarvig, Avidyā is not so much emphasized, instead the emphasis on "construing an illusory reality" based on conceptualization when the ultimate reality is Emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guttorm Fløistad|title=Philosophie asiatique/Asian philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDHyCAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-011-2510-9|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avidya is the greatest impurity and the primary cause of suffering, rebirth. The insight into Emptiness, state Garfield and Edelglass, that is the "lack of inherent nature of all phenomena, including the self, cuts the impurities", an insight into Emptiness yields full awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield|author2=William Edelglass|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vajrayana===
{{main article|Twelve Nidānas}}
The Vajrayana tradition considers ignorance as fetters of bondage into samsara, and its teachings have focussed on a Tantric path under the guidance of a teacher, to remove ''Avidya'' and achieve liberation in a single lifetime.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=162}}

Avidyā is identified as the first of the twelve links of dependent origination (twelve nidanas)—a sequence of links that describe why a being reincarnates and remains bound within the [[samsara]], a cycle of repeated births and deaths in six realms of existence.&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2015p50"/&gt; The twelve nidanas are an application of the Buddhist concept of [[pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination). This theory, presented in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] II.2–4 and [[Digha Nikaya]] II.55–63, asserts that rebirth, re-aging and re-death ultimately arise through a series of twelve links or ''nidanas'' ultimately rooted in Avidyā, and the twelfth step ''Jarāmaraṇa'' triggers the dependent origination of ''Avidyā'', recreating an unending cycle of [[dukkha]] (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2015p50"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M. Emmanuel|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_lmCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-14466-3|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F Harold Smith|title=The Buddhist Way of Life: Its Philosophy and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA1FoKPGIRgC&amp;pg=PT37|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-02929-6|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Removing avidya ==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
Avidya or ignorance can be eliminated directly by cultivating its opposite viz. Knowledge, wisdom and perception, where the above refer to the true knowledge and perception of reality. 
The various ways to remove Avidya is by learning from Guru/teacher who knows or from books and scriptures. Also Avidya can be removed through Meditation or more precisely practice of Dhyana and Yoga. Through practice of Dharma and righteousness Avidya gets removed. 
Unrighteous karma increases Ignorance while Ignorance perpetuates Adharma.

One dictionary definition is "an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, fear, etc., produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful, or the like: in awe of God; in awe of great political figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awe zw228

|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awe |work=Dictionary |publisher=[[Reference.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another dictionary definition is a "mixed emotion of reverence, respect, dread, and wonder inspired by authority, genius, great beauty, sublimity, or might: We felt awe when contemplating the works of Bach. The observers were in awe of the destructive power of the new weapon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awe |url=http://thefreedictionary.com/awe |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, awe is directed at objects considered to be more powerful than the subject, such as the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the [[Grand Canyon]], the vastness of the cosmos, or [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0q9NMTC8z3IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pleasure+james+a+russell&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxmtfp3pjXAhUBMJoKHTA2AuEQuwUIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pleasure|first=James A.|last=Russell|date=30 October 2017|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=30 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fpd_NiHlU7QC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=lightning+strike+awe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjey_bu4JjXAhWDA5oKHeC7D3gQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Preaching Christ from Ecclesiastes: Foundations for Expository Sermons|first=Sidney|last=Greidanus|date=3 May 2010|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|accessdate=30 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Awe is difficult to define, and the meaning of the word has changed over time. Related concepts are [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]], [[admiration]], [[Elevation (psychology)|elevation]], and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. In ''Awe: The Delights and Dangers of Our Eleventh Emotion'', [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychologist]] and positive psychology guru Pearsall presents a phenomenological study of awe. He defines awe as an "overwhelming and bewildering sense of connection with a startling universe that is usually far beyond the narrow band of our consciousness." Pearsall sees awe as the 11th emotion, beyond those now scientifically accepted (i.e., [[love]], [[fear]], [[sadness]], [[embarrassment]], [[curiosity]], [[pride]], [[enjoyment]], [[depression (mood)|despair]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and [[anger]]).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearsall, Paul |title=Awe: The Delights and Dangers of Our Eleventh Emotion |publisher=Health Communications, Inc. |year=2007|isbn=0757305857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions allow for awe to be a positive or a negative experience, but when asked to describe events that elicit awe, most people only cite positive experiences.&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Michelle |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |last3=Mossman |first3=Amanda |year=2007 |title=The nature of awe: Elicitors, appraisals, and effects on self-concept |url= |journal=Cognition and Emotion |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=944–963 |doi=10.1080/02699930600923668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Atlanta Lightning Strike edit1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|This [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] lightning strike might have inspired awe.]]
The term awe stems from the Old English word ''ege'', meaning “terror, dread, awe,” which may have arisen from the Greek word ''áchos'', meaning “pain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awe etymology |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awe |publisher=[[Dictionary.com|Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''awesome'' originated from the word ''awe'' in the late 16th century, to mean “filled with awe.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awesome |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/awesome |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''awful'' also originated from the word ''awe'', to replace the word Old English word ''egeful'' (“dreadful”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awful |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awful |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Evolutionary theories===
'''Awe reinforces social hierarchies'''

Keltner and Haidt&lt;ref name="faculty.virginia.edu"/&gt; proposed an evolutionary explanation for awe. They suggested that the current emotion of awe originated from feelings of ''primordial awe'' – a hard-wired response that low-status individuals felt in the presence of more powerful, high-status individuals, which would have been adaptive by reinforcing social hierarchies. This primordial awe would have only occurred when the high-status person had characteristics of vastness (in size, fame, authority, or prestige) that required the low-status individual to engage in Piagetian [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|accommodation]] (changing one’s mental representation of the world to accommodate the new experience). Keltner and Haidt propose that this primordial awe later generalized to any stimulus that is both vast and that requires accommodation. These stimuli still include being in the presence of a more powerful other (prototypical primordial awe), but also spiritual experiences, grand vistas, natural forces/disasters, human-made works, music, or the experience of understanding a grand scientific theory. Keltner and Haidt propose that awe can have both positive and negative connotations, and that there are five additional features of awe that can color one’s experience of the emotion: [[threat]], [[beauty]], [[:wikt:-ability|ability]], [[virtue]], and the [[supernatural]].

'''Awe is a sexually-selected characteristic'''

Keltner and Haidt’s model has been critiqued by some researchers, including by psychologist Vladimir J. Konečni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Vladimir|last1=Konečni |year=2005 |title=The Aesthetic Trinity: Awe, Being Moved, Thrills. Bulletin of Psychology and the Arts |format=PDF |url=http://konecni.ucsd.edu/pdf/2005%20Aesthetic%20Trinity,%20Bulletin%20of%20P.%20and%20A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni argued that people can only experience awe, especially aesthetic awe (of which, according to him, a "sublime stimulus-in-context" is the principal cause) when they are not in actual physical danger. Konečni postulated that the evolutionary origins of awe are from unexpected encounters with natural wonders, which would have been sexually selected for because [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]], intellectual sensitivity, emotional sensitivity, and elite membership would have been attractive characteristics in a mate, and these characteristics would also have given individuals greater access to awe-inspiring situations. Since high-status people are more likely to be safe from danger and to have access to awe-inspiring situations, Konečni argued that high-status people should feel awe more often than low-status people. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested and verified.

'''Awe increases systematic processing'''

A third evolutionary theory is that awe serves to draw attention away from the self and toward the environment.&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiota 2006 61–71"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Michelle |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |last3=John |first3=Oliver |year=2006 |title=Positive emotion dispositions differentially associated with Big Five personality and attachment style |url= |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=61–71 |doi=10.1080/17439760500510833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griskevicius 2010 190–206"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griskevicius |first=Vladus |last2=Shiota |first2=Michelle |last3=Neufeld |first3=Samantha |year=2010 |title=Influence of different positive emotions on persuasion processing: a functional evolutionary approach |url= |journal=Emotion |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=190–206 |doi=10.1037/a0018421 |pmid=20364895}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs as a way to build informational resources when in the presence of novel and complex stimuli that cannot be assimilated by current knowledge structures. In other words, awe functions to increase systematic, accommodative processing, and this would have been adaptive for survival. This hypothesis is the most recent and has received the most empirical support, as described in the section on [[#Social consequences of awe|social consequences of awe]].

===Non-evolutionary theories===

'''Sundararajan's awe'''

Humanistic/forensic psychologist Louis Sundararajan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Louise|last1=Sundararajan |year=2005 |title=Religious Awe: Potential Contributions of Negative Theology to Psychology, "Positive" or Otherwise |format=PDF |url=http://www.indigenouspsych.org/Members/Sundararajan,%20Louise/Religious%20Awe--Potential%20Contributions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; also critiqued Keltner and Haidt’s model by arguing that being in the presence of a more powerful other elicits admiration, but does not require mental accommodation because admiration merely reinforces existing social hierarchies. Sundararajan expanded upon Keltner and Haidt’s model by arguing that first, an individual must be confronted with perceived vastness. If an individual can [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|assimilate]] this perceived vastness into her or his existing mental categories, s/he will not experience awe. If an individual cannot assimilate the perceived vastness, then s/he will need to [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|accommodate]] to the new information (change her or his mental categories). If this is not accomplished, an individual will experience trauma, such as developing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. If an individual can accommodate, s/he will experience awe and wonder. By this model, the same vast experience could lead to increased rigidity (when assimilation succeeds), increased flexibility (when assimilation fails but accommodation succeeds), or psychopathology (when both assimilation and accommodation fail). Sundararajan did not speculate on the evolutionary origins of awe.

==Research==
Despite the meaningfulness that feelings of awe can bring, it has rarely been scientifically studied. As [[Richard Lazarus]] (1994) wrote in his book on emotions, “Given their [awe and wonder’s] importance and emotional power, it is remarkable that so little scientific attention has been paid to aesthetic experience as a source of emotion in our lives” (p.&amp;nbsp;136). Research on awe is in its infancy and has primarily focused on describing awe (e.g., physical displays of awe and who is likely to experience awe) and the social consequences of awe (e.g., helping behavior and susceptibility to persuasion by weak messages).

===Precipitants===
Shiota, Keltner, and Mossman (2007)&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt; had participants write about a time they felt awe and found that nature and art/music were frequently cited as the eliciting stimulus. Although most definitions allow for awe to be positive or negative, participants only described positive precipitants to awe, and it is therefore possible that positive awe and awe+fear (i.e., horror) are distinctly different emotions.

===Emotional experience===
In the same set of experiments by Shiota, Keltner, and Mossman (2007),&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt; the researchers had participants write about a time they recently experienced natural beauty (awe condition) or accomplishment (pride condition). When describing the experience of natural beauty, participants were more likely to report that they felt unaware of day-to-day concerns, felt the presence of something greater, didn't want the experience to end, felt connected with the world, and felt small or insignificant. 

It is not yet known whether awe is experienced differently in different cultures{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

===Physical displays===
Researchers have also attempted to observe the physical, non-verbal reactions to awe by asking participants to remember a time they felt awe and to express the emotion nonverbally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Michelle |last2=Campos |first2=Belinda |last3=Keltner |first3=Dacher |year=2003 |title=The Faces of Positive Emotion: Prototype Displays of Awe, Amusement, and Pride |url= |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1000 |issue=1 |pages=296–299 |doi=10.1196/annals.1280.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this method, researchers observed that awe is often displayed through raised inner eyebrows (78%), widened eyes (61%), and open, slightly drop-jawed mouths (80%). A substantial percent of people also display awe by slightly jutting forward their head (27%) and visibly inhaling (27%), but smiling is uncommon (10%). Cross-cultural research is needed to determine whether physical displays of awe differ by culture.

===Personality and awe===
Some individuals may be more prone to experiencing awe. Using self- and peer-reports, researchers&lt;ref name="Shiota 2006 61–71"/&gt; found that regularly experiencing awe was associated with openness to experience (self and peer-ratings) and extroversion (self-ratings). Later studies&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt; also found that people who regularly experience awe ("awe-prone") have lower need for cognitive closure and are more likely to describe themselves in oceanic (e.g. "I am an inhabitant of the planet Earth"), individuated, and universal terms, as opposed to more specific terms (e.g. "I have blonde hair").

===Social consequences===
A more recent study found that experiencing awe increased perceptions of time and led to a greater willingness to donate time, but not to donate money.&lt;ref name="Rudd 2012 1130–1136"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudd |first=Melanie |last2=Vohs |first2=Kathleen |last3=Aaker |first3=Jennifer |year=2012 |title=Awe expands people's perception of time, alters decision making, and enhances well-being |url= |journal=Psychological Science |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=1130–1136 |doi=10.1177/0956797612438731 |pmid=22886132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater willingness to donate time appeared to be driven by decreased impatience after experiencing awe. Experiencing awe also led participants to report greater momentary life satisfaction and stronger preferences for experiential versus material goods (e.g. prefer a massage to a watch).&lt;ref name="Rudd 2012 1130–1136"/&gt; Awe, unlike most other positive emotions, has been shown to increase [[Heuristic-systematic model of information processing|systematic processing]], rather than [[Heuristic-systematic model of information processing|heuristic processing]], leading participants who experience awe to become less susceptible to weak arguments.&lt;ref name="Griskevicius 2010 190–206"/&gt;

==Awe and atheism==
Awe has recently become a topic of interest in atheist groups, in response to statements from some religious individuals who say that atheists do not experience awe, or that experiencing awe makes one spiritual or religious, rather than an atheist. For example, see Oprah's comment that she would not consider swimmer [[Diana Nyad]] an atheist because Nyad experiences awe, as well as the response to this video by interfaith activist [[Chris Stedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stedman |first=Chris |title=What Oprah gets wrong about atheism |publisher=CNN Belief Blog |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/16/what-oprah-gets-wrong-about-atheism/ |date=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awe is often tied to religion, but awe can also be secular. For more examples, see the writings on being an "aweist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aweism |url=http://www.atheistnexus.org/profiles/blogs/aweism-1 |publisher=Atheist Nexus |date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by sociologist and atheist Phil Zuckerman, the book ''[[Religion for Atheists]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Botton |first=Alain |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf3eWWmWFsQC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Religion for Atheists |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=9780141937601}}&lt;/ref&gt; by author [[Alain de Botton]], and the video on how secular institutions should inspire awe by performance philosopher [[Jason Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Silva |first=Jason |title=How can secular institutions inspire the same awe of religious ones? |url=http://itsabeautifulearth.com/2013/08/20/how-can-secular-institutions-inspire-the-same-awe-of-religious-ones/ |publisher=The S.P.A.C.E.

==Etymology==
The term ''biological diversity'' was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the year 1968 lay book ''A Different Kind of Country''&lt;ref name="Dasmann1968"&gt;{{cite book|first=Raymond Fredric |last=Dasmann|title=A Different Kind of Country|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DgM2jwEACAAJ}}|year=1968|publisher=Collier Books|isbn=978-0-02-072810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. [[Thomas Lovejoy]], in the foreword to the book ''Conservation Biology'',&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soulé, Michael E. |author2=Wilcox, Bruce A. |title=Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87893-800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term to the scientific community. Until then the term "natural diversity" was common, introduced by The Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] in an important 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E. Jenkins |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of the term "biological diversity".

The term's contracted form ''biodiversity'' may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 ''National Forum on Biological Diversity'' organized by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as the title of the [[proceedings]]&lt;ref name="WilsonSciences1988"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.O. |last1=Wilson|title=Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DSGF1xQBYi8C}}|date=1 January 1988|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-03739-6}} [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913154719/http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html |date=13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of that forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Biodiversity Assessment: Summary for Policy-makers|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VKnimgEACAAJ}}|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56481-6}} Annex 6, Glossary. Used as source by [http://www.biodiv.be/glossary_keywords/B "Biodiversity", Glossary of terms related to the CBD], [[Belgium|Belgian]] Clearing-House Mechanism. Retrieved 2006-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders and concerned citizens.

A similar term in the United States is ''"natural heritage."'' It pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- I've never come across this term--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/natural-heritage/|title=Massachusetts Natural Heritage &amp; Endangered Species Program|last=NHESP|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

"Biodiversity" is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]]. Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species and [[ecosystems]] of a region".&lt;ref name="Larsson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zeTU8QauENcC|page=178}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n0FvYeoHtAIC|page=40}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:

* taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
* ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of [[ecosystem diversity]])
* morphological diversity (which stems from [[genetic diversity]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=AK |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00803.x |pages=193–203 |title=Save those molecules: molecular biodiversity and life}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Functional group (ecology)|functional diversity]] (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is functional diversity, and why do we care?|url = http://jonlefcheck.net/2014/10/20/what-is-functional-diversity-and-why-do-we-care-2/|website = sample(ECOLOGY)|accessdate = 2015-12-22|first = Jon|last = Lefcheck|date = 2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This multilevel construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...".&lt;ref name=wilcox84&gt;

The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]] and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

One textbook's definition is "variation of life at all levels of biological organization".&lt;ref name="GastonSpicer2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kevin J. |last1=Gaston|first2=John I. |last2= Spicer|title=Biodiversity: An Introduction|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lY8rc4bcIDwC}}|date=13 February 2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-1857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]] and [[gene transfer]] that drive evolution.&lt;ref name=wilcox84/&gt;

Measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels.

[[File:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]])]]

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, [[soil]]s, geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, species and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as the [[Cape Floristic Region]] and lower in polar regions generally.  [[Rain forests]] that have had wet climates for a long time, such as [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuní National Park]] in [[Ecuador]], have particularly high biodiversity.&lt;ref name=dotearth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/a-durable-yet-vulnerable-eden-in-amazonia/ | title=A Durable Yet Vulnerable Eden in Amazonia | work=Dot Earth blog, New York Times

===Latitudinal gradients===
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}}

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[Geographical pole|poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles.&lt;ref name=MoraRobertson2003&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20013.pdf |vauthors=Mora C, Robertson DR |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 | title=Causes of latitudinal gradients in species richness: a test with fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific | journal=Ecology | volume = 86 | pages =  1771–1792 |format=PDF | doi=10.1890/04-0883 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = D.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis ("the [[fractal]] biodiversity") was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2016). The fractal nature of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. Biologia, 71(6), 669-672.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the [[species]] pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[net primary production]] (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological [[hypervolume]]. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hypervolumes, whose [[fractal dimension]] rises up to three moving towards the [[equator]].

===Hotspots===
A [[biodiversity hotspot]] is a region with a high level of [[Endemism|endemic]] species that have experienced great [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/biodiversity-hotspots | author = Biodiversity A-Z | title = Biodiversity Hotspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by [[Norman Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02240252 | author = Myers N | year = 1988 | title = Threatened biotas: 'hot spots' in tropical forests | url = | journal = Environmentalist | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 187–208 | pmid = 12322582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02239720 | author = Myers N | year = 1990 | title = The biodiversity challenge: expanded hot-spots analysis | url = http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Gwen%27s%20Files/Biodiversity/Chapters/Info%20to%20use/Chapter%207/biodiversityhotspotMyers.pdf| journal = Environmentalist | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 243–256 | pmid = 12322583 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.468.8666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20027.pdf | author=Tittensor D. | year=2011 | title= Global patterns and predictors of marine biodiversity across taxa | journal=Nature | volume = 466 | pages =  1098–1101 |format=PDF | doi=10.1038/nature09329 | pmid=20668450 | issue=7310|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010Natur.466.1098T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey K. |last=McKee|title=Sparing Nature: The Conflict Between Human Population Growth and Earth's Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=omgIyInG8qEC|page=108}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3558-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the [[tropics]].

Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. [[Selection bias]] amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity.

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of [[evolution]]. The [[origin of life]] has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[microorganism]]s – [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[protozoan]]s and [[protist]]s.

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; The worst was the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]].&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A | displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million,&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt; the vast majority [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=heywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725181504/http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2010 |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |accessdate=2009-06-21 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 318| issue = 7304| doi = 10.1038/466318a| year = 2010| journal = Nature| volume = 466| title = Does diversity always grow?| last1 = Okasha | first1 = S.|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..318O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary diversification===
The existence of a ''global carrying capacity'', limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled."&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt;

It also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biox.stanford.edu/highlight/stanford-researchers-discover-animal-functional-diversity-started-out-poor-became-richer|title=Stanford researchers discover that animal functional diversity started out poor, became richer over time - Welcome to Bio-X|website=biox.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18677962 | year = 2008 | last1 = Markov | first1 = AV | last2 = Korotaev | first2 = AV | title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–94 | journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward O. |last=Wilson|title=The Future of Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Guosshxltn4C}}|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, in his ''Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory'',  [[Roberto Cazzolla Gatti]] proposed that species themselves are the architects of biodiversity, by proportionally increasing the number of potentially available niches in a given ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2011). Evolution is a cooperative process: the biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain why. Theoretical Biology Forum, 104(1), 35-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study led to the idea that biodiversity is [[autocatalytic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R., Hordijk, W., &amp; Kauffman, S. (2017). Biodiversity is autocatalytic. Ecological Modelling, 346, 70-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[ecosystem]] of interdependent [[species]] can be, therefore, considered as an [[Emergent properties|emergent]] [[autocatalytic set]] (a self-sustaining network of mutually "[[catalytic]]" entities), where one (group of) species enables the existence of (i.e., creates niches for) other species. This view offers a possible answer to the fundamental question of why so many species can [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in the same ecosystem.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified).&lt;ref name=heywood /&gt; Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s and in general, land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species may exists on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt;

# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services. After an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
[[File:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[South America]]]]

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: [[genetic diversity|intraspecific diversity]], which includes the genetic variety within a single species, like the potato (''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, ''S. tuberosum'').

The other category of agricultural diversity is called [[species diversity|interspecific diversity]] and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce etc.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems"&gt;{{cite book|first=John H. |last=Vandermeer|title=The Ecology of Agroecosystems|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AFRQSuQGHiIC}}|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On [[monoculture]] farms, the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive [[pesticide]]s, mechanized tools and [[genetically modified organism|transgenic engineering techniques]], then to [[crop rotation|rotate crops]]. Although some [[polyculture]] farmers use the same techniques, they also employ [[integrated pest management]] strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology and energy.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures, relies on biodiversity at some point.
* The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato blight]] of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million.

This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] (ACSF) at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|title=Study: Loss of species is bad for your health|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/BiodiversityHealth.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|right|[[Agriculture]] production, pictured is a [[tractor]] and a [[chaser bin]]]]
Many industrial materials derive directly from biological sources. These include building materials, fibers, dyes, rubber and oil. Biodiversity is also important to the security of resources such as water, timber, paper, fiber and food.&lt;ref&gt;

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribot | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouquet | first2 = N. | last3 = Villeger | first3 = S. | last4 = Raymond | first4 = M. | last5 = Hoff | first5 = F. | last6 = Boissery | first6 = P. | last7 = Holon | first7 = F. | last8 = Deter | first8 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Taxonomic and functional diversity increase the aesthetic value of coralligenous reefs | url = http://nicolasmouquet.free.fr/publications/Tribot_el_al_2016_Scientific_Reports.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Scientific Reports | volume =  6| issue = | pages =  34229| doi = 10.1038/srep34229 | pmid = 27677850 | pmc = 5039688 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...634229T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our [[atmosphere]] and [[water supply]]. Biodiversity is directly involved in [[water purification]], recycling [[nutrient]]s and providing fertile soils.

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the [https://www.wnf.nl/custom/LPR_2016_fullreport/ World Wildlife Fund]. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that "the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago". Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in [[Latin America]], plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.&lt;ref name="LivingPlanetReport2014"&gt;{{citation|url=http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |accessdate=4 October 2014 |title=Living Planet Report 2014 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101711/http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in ''[[PLOS One]]'' found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of [[Sussex University]] stated that their study suggested that humans "appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon.

===Introduced and invasive species===
{{Main|Introduced species|Invasive species}}
[[File:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of [[East Asia]] that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons]]
Barriers such as large [[rivers]], [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of [[allopatric speciation]]. The term [[invasive species]] is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torchin|first=Mark E.|author2=Lafferty, Kevin D. |author3=[[Dobson, Andrew P.]] |author4=McKenzie, Valerie J. |author5=Kuris, Armand M.|title=Introduced species and their missing parasites|journal=Nature|date=6 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6923|pages=628–630|doi=10.1038/nature01346|pmid=12571595|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..628T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Jonathan M.|author2=D'Antonio, Carla M.|title=Elton Revisited: A Review of Evidence Linking Diversity and Invasibility|journal=Oikos|date=1 October 1999|volume=87|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3546992|jstor=3546992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=J.

Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GUREVITCH|first=J|author2=PADILLA, D|title=Are invasive species a major cause of extinctions?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=1 September 2004|volume=19|issue=9|pages=470–474|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.005|pmid=16701309}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: [[alpha diversity]]) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: [[beta diversity]]). Overall [[gamma diversity]] may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sax|first=Dov F.|author2=Gaines, Steven D. |author3=Brown, James H.|title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 December 2002|volume=160|issue=6|pages=766–783|doi=10.1086/343877|pmid=18707464}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. [[Local extinction|Extirpation]], [[population decline]] and [[Species homogeneity|homogenization]] of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jude, David auth.|first=ed. by M. Munawar|title=The lake Huron ecosystem: ecology, fisheries and management|year=1995|publisher=S.P.B. Academic Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5103-117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], [[Prunus spinosa]] from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the ''[[Thecla betulae]]'' butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of [[kudzu]] from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= ScienceDaily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408163917.htm |title=Are invasive plants a threat to native biodiversity?

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its [[gene pool]]. This problem is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of [[gene flow]] is normal adaptation and not all [[gene]] and [[genotype]] constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 | title = Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression | year = 1996 | last1 = Rhymer | first1 = Judith M. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = Daniel | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 27 | pages = 83–109 | jstor = 2097230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PottsBarbour2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bradley M. |last1=Potts|first2=Robert C.|last2= Barbour|first3=Andrew B. |last3=Hingston|title=Genetic Pollution from Farm Forestry Using Eucalypt Species and Hydrids: A Report for the RIRDC/L &amp; WA/FWPRDC Joint Venture Agroforestry Program|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PyQIOAAACAAJ}}|year=2001|publisher=RIRDC|isbn=978-0-642-58336-9 |issn=1440-6845}}

===Overexploitation===
{{Main|Overexploitation}}

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

About 25% of world [[fishery|fisheries]] are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | year = 2007 | last1 = Grafton | first1 = R.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food security|Genetic erosion}}

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution. This has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.&lt;ref name="bulletin28"&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html "Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal"; ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified organism]]s contain genetic material that is altered through [[genetic engineering]].

Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique [[genotype]]s, threatening future access to [[food security]]. A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate.&lt;ref name="bulletin28" /&gt;&lt;!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better so as to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--&gt;

===Protection and restoration techniques===
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;with [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem]] (DAISY), using the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life|barcode of life]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcoding.si.edu/ |title=Barcode of Life |publisher=Barcoding.si.edu |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120801074239/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.ht…|date=1 August 2012|archivedate=1 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.

As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured, "missing" species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life#Resources and collaborations|Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].

*[[Biodiversity banking]] places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian [[Native Vegetation Management Framework]].
*[[Gene bank]]s are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;via tree nurseries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/vlaanderen-heeft-45-zaadtuinen-voor-autochtone-bomen-en-struiken.aspx?artikel=0935212d-8b19-45a4-9cda-167ff68d347c |title=Belgium creating 45 "seed gardens"; gene banks with intent to reintroduction |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
*Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create [[wildlife corridor]]s that correspond to the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Protected areas==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Protected areas are meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dolomitipark.it/doc_pdf/parchi.sola.terra/07.ProtectedAreas_Biodiversity.pdf|title=Protected Areas and Biodiversity: An Overview of Key Issues|last=Mulongoy|first=Kalemani Jo|last2=Chape|first2=Stuart|publisher=CBD Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC|year=2004|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, UK|pages=15 and 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baillie|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ya-Ping|first2=Zhang|date=September 14, 2018 |title=Space for nature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1051|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=1051 |doi=10.1126/science.aau1397|pmid=30213888|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National parks===
{{Main|National park}}
National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
[[Wildlife sanctuary|Wildlife sanctuaries]] aim only at conservation of species and have the following features:

#The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation.
#The killing, hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary.
#Private ownership may be allowed.
#[[Forestry]] and other usages can also be permitted.

===Forest reserves===
The [[forest]]s play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species. In reserved forests, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics:

#They are large inaccessible forests.
#Many of these are unoccupied.
#They are ecologically and economically less important.

====Steps to conserve the forest cover====
{{see|forest cover}}
#An extensive [[reforestation]]/[[afforestation]] program should be followed.
#Alternative [[environment-friendly]] sources of fuel energy such as [[biogas]] other than wood should be used.
#Loss of biodiversity due to [[forest fire]] is a major problem, immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken.
#[[Overgrazing]] by cattle can damage a forest seriously. Therefore, certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle.
#Hunting and [[poaching]] should be banned.

===Zoological parks===
In [[zoological park]]s or zoos, live animals are kept for public [[recreation]], education and conservation purposes. Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities, provide opportunities for threatened species to [[captive breeding|breed in captivity]] and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care. Zoos play a major role in creating [[environmental awareness|awareness]] about the need to conserve nature.

===Botanical gardens===
In [[botanical garden]]s, plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes. They consist of a collection of living plants, grown outdoors or under glass in [[greenhouse]]s and conservatories. In addition, a botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or [[herbarium]] and such facilities as lecture rooms, laboratories, libraries, museums and experimental or research plantings.

==Resource allocation==
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=conservationists-triage-determine-which-endangered-species-to-save Conservationists Use Triage to Determine which Species to Save and Not; Like battlefield medics, conservationists are being forced to explicitly apply triage to determine which creatures to save and which to let go] 23 July 2012 ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones-Walters | first1 = L. | last2 = Mulder | first2 = I. | doi = 10.1016/j.jnc.2009.06.001 | title = Valuing nature: The economics of biodiversity | journal = Journal for Nature Conservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–247 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | url=http://mdvnaturalist.com/images/econmics_of_biodiversity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global agreements such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], give "sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can become a type of [[biopiracy]] when such principles are not respected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements]] (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies [[informed consent]] between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|fair agreement on benefit sharing]].

===National level laws===
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, [[fishing]] and hunting rights).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue.
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of [[genetically modified organisms]], gene [[patent]]s and process patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/patents.shtml |title=Gene Patenting |publisher=Ornl.gov |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/envtllaw/issues/vol12/bosselman-for%20web.pdf |title=Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U.

India passed the [[Biological Diversity Act]] in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge.

==Analytical limits==

===Taxonomic and size relationships===
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x | author = Wilson Edward O | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Earth's species are microbial. Contemporary biodiversity physics is "firmly fixated on the visible [macroscopic] world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/429804a | author = Nee S | year = 2004 | title = More than meets the eye | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6994| pages = 804–805 | pmid = 15215837 |bibcode = 2004Natur.429..804N }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, microbial life is [[metabolically]] and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., [[extremophile]]). "On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit [[ribosomal RNA]], visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs.

== Diversity study (botany) ==
The number of morphological attributes that can be scored for diversity study is generally limited and prone to environmental influences; thereby reducing the fine resolution required to ascertain the phylogenetic relationships. DNA based markers- microsatellites otherwise known as ''simple sequence repeats'' (SSR) were therefore used for the diversity studies of certain species and their wild relatives.

In the case of [[cowpea]], a study conducted to assess the level of genetic diversity in cowpea germplasm and related wide species, where the relatedness among various taxa were compared, primers useful for classification of taxa identified, and the origin and phylogeny of cultivated cowpea classified show that SSR markers are useful in validating with species classification and revealing the center of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogunkanmi|first=Liasu Adebayo|date=|title=Genetic diversity of cowpea and its wild relatives|url=|journal=Unilag SPGS (Thesis &amp; Dissertation 1970-2012)|volume=|pages=144–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed by [[Roy John Britten]] and [[Eric H. Davidson]] in 1969, the model postulates four classes of [[DNA]] sequence: an integrator gene, a producer gene, a receptor site, and a sensor site. The sensor site regulates the integrator gene, responsible for synthesis of activator RNA. The integrator gene cannot synthesize activator RNA unless the sensor site is activated. Activation and deactivation of the sensor site is done by external stimuli, such as hormones. The activator RNA then binds with a nearby receptor site, which stimulates the synthesis of [[mRNA]] at the [[structural gene]].

This theory would explain how several different integrators could be synthesized at the same time. In addition, this theory would explain the pattern of [[repetitive DNA]] sequences followed by a unique [[DNA]] sequence that exists in [[gene]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Genetics Classical to Modern| last=Gupta| first=P.K.| publisher=Rastogi Publications| year=2007| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[satellite communications]], '''carrier-to-noise-density ratio''' ('''''C/N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''') is the [[ratio]] of the [[carrier signal|carrier]] [[power (physics)|power]] ''C'' to the [[noise power density]] ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', expressed in [[dB-Hz]].
When considering only the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] as a source of noise, it is called '''carrier-to-receiver-noise-density ratio'''.

It determines whether a receiver can lock on to the carrier and if the information [[encoded]] in the [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] can be retrieved, given the amount of noise present in the received signal. The carrier-to-receiver noise density ratio is usually expressed in [[decibel|dBHz]].

The noise power density, ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''=''kT'', is the receiver noise power per [[hertz]], which can be written in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k'' (in joules per [[kelvin]]) and the [[noise temperature]] ''T''  (in kelvins).

A  '''chaordic organization''' refers to a [[system]] of organization that blends characteristics of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[:wikt:order|order]]. The term was coined by [[Dee Hock]], the founder and former CEO of the [[VISA]] credit card association.

The mix of chaos and order is often described as a harmonious coexistence displaying characteristics of both, with neither chaotic nor ordered behavior dominating. The chaordic principles have also been used as guidelines for creating human organizations -- [[business]], [[nonprofit]], [[government]] and hybrids—that would be neither centralized nor anarchical networks.

In [[political theory]] and particularly [[Marxism]], '''class consciousness''' is the set of beliefs that a person holds regarding their [[social class]] or economic rank in society, the structure of their class, and their class interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Erik Olin|chapter=Class|editors=Beckert, Jens &amp; Zafirovski, Milan|title=International encyclopedia of economic sociology|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-28673-2|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9yEAm0yVaQC&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borland-2008-p134" /&gt; It is an awareness that is key to sparking a revolution that would, "create a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], transforming it from a wage-earning, property-less mass into the ruling class" according to [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sociological Theory in the Classical Era|last = Appelrouth|first = Scott|publisher = SAGE|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-4129-7564-3|location = United States of America|pages = 26|last2 = Desfor Edles|first2 = Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist theory==
While German theorist [[Karl Marx]] rarely used the term "class consciousness", he did make the distinction between "class in itself", which is defined as a category of people having a common relation to the [[means of production]], and a "class for itself", which is defined as a stratum [[collective action|organized in active pursuit]] of its own interests.&lt;ref name="Borland-2008-p134"&gt;{{cite book |author=Borland, Elizabeth|chapter=Class consciousness|editor=Parrillo, Vincent N.|title=Encyclopedia of social problems, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&amp;pg=PT134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining a person's social class can be a determinant for their awareness of it. Marxists define classes on the basis of their relation to the means of production &amp;ndash; especially on whether they own [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Non-Marxist social scientists distinguish various [[Social stratification|social strata]] on the basis of income, occupation, or status.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Elster, ''An Introduction to Karl Marx''.

Early in the nineteenth century, the labels "[[working class]]es" and "[[middle class]]es" were already coming into common usage. "The old hereditary aristocracy, reinforced by the new gentry who owed their success to commerce, industry, and the professions, evolved into an "[[upper class]]". Its consciousness was formed in part by public schools (in the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|British sense]] where it refers to a form of private school) and Universities. The upper class tenaciously maintained control over the political system, depriving not only the working classes but the middle classes of a voice in the political process."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/Class.html.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Georg Lukács' ''History and Class Consciousness'' (1923) ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Class [[consciousness]], as described by [[Georg Lukács]]'s famous ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923), is opposed to any [[psychology|psychological]] conception of consciousness, which forms the basis of individual or mass psychology (see [[Freud]] or, before him, [[Gustave Le Bon]]). According to Lukács, each social class has a determined class consciousness which it can achieve. In effect, as opposed to the [[liberalism|liberal]] conception of consciousness as the basis of [[individualism|individual freedom]] and of the [[social contract]], Marxist class consciousness is not an origin, but an achievement (i.e. it must be "earned" or won). Hence, it is never assured: the [[proletariat]]'s class consciousness is the result of a permanent struggle to understand the "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[Universality (philosophy)|totality]]" of the [[philosophy of history|historical process]].

According to Lukács, the proletariat was the first class in history that may achieve true class consciousness, because of its specific position highlighted in the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' as the "living negation" of [[capitalism]]. All others classes, including the [[bourgeoisie]], are limited to a "[[false consciousness]]" which impedes them from understanding the totality of history: instead of understanding each specific moment as a portion of a supposedly deterministic historical process, they [[universality (philosophy)|universalize]] it and believe it is everlasting. Hence, capitalism is not thought as a specific phase of history, but is naturalized and thought of as an eternal solidified part of history. Says Lukács, this "false consciousness", which forms [[ideology]] itself, is not a simple [[error]] as in classical philosophy, but an [[illusion]] which cannot be dispelled.

[[Marx]] described it in his theory of [[commodity fetishism]], which Lukács completed with his concept of [[reification (Marxism)|reification]]: [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is what follows the worker's estrangement to the world following the new life acquired by the product of his work. The dominant bourgeois ideology thus leads the individual to see the achievement of his [[labour (economics)|labour]] take a life of its own. Furthermore, [[Division of labour|specialization]] is also seen as a characteristic of the ideology of modern [[rationalism]], which creates specific and independent domains (art, politics, science, etc.). Only a global perspective can point out how all these different domains interact, argues Lukács. He also points out how [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] brought to its limit the classical opposition between the abstract form and the concrete, historical content, which is abstractly conceived as irrational and [[contingent]]. Thus, with Kant's rational system, history becomes totally contingent and is thus ignored. Only with [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic]] can a mediation be found between the abstract form and the abstract notion of a concrete content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/lukacs3.htm Georg Lukács, ''History and Class Consciousness'' Complete Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the bourgeois loses his individual point of view in an attempt to grasp the reality of the totality of society and of the historical process, he is condemned to a form of false consciousness. As an individual, he will always see the collective result of individual actions as a form of "[[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[law (principle)|law]]" to which he must submit himself (liberalism has gone so far as seeing an [[invisible hand]] in this collective results, making capitalism the best of all possible worlds). By contrast, the proletariat would be, according to Lukács, the first class in history with the possibility to achieve a true form of class consciousness, granting it [[knowledge]] of the totality of the historical process.

The proletariat takes the place of Hegel's ''[[Weltgeist]]'' ("World Spirit"), which achieves history through ''[[Volksgeist]]'' ("the spirit of the people"): the [[idealist]] conception of an abstract Spirit making history, which ends in the realm of Reason, is replaced by a [[materialism|materialist]] conception based not on [[Mythology|mythical]] Spirits, but on a concrete "identical [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]-object of history": the proletariat. The proletariat is both the "object" of history, created by the capitalist social formation; but it is also the "subject" of history, as it is its labour that shapes the world, and thus, knowledge of itself is also, necessarily, knowledge of the reality and of the totality of the historical process. The proletariat's class consciousness is not immediate; class consciousness must not be mistaken either with the consciousness of one's future and collective interests, opposed to personal immediate interests.

The possibility of class consciousness is given by the objective process of history, which transforms the proletariat into a [[commodity]], hence objectifying it. Class consciousness is thus not a simple subjective act: "as consciousness here is not the consciousness of an object opposed to itself, but the object's consciousness, the act of being conscious of oneself disrupts the objectivity form of its object" (in "Reification and the Proletariat's Consciousness" §3, III "The proletariat's point of view"). In other words, instead of the bourgeois subject and its corresponding ideological concept of individual [[free will]], the proletariat has been transformed into an object (a commodity) which, when it takes consciousness of itself, transforms the very structure of objectivity, that is of reality.

This specific role of the proletariat is a consequence of its specific position; thus, for the first time, consciousness of itself (class consciousness) is also consciousness of the totality (knowledge of the entire social and historical process). Through [[dialectical materialism]], the proletariat understands that what the individual bourgeois conceived as "laws" akin to the [[physical law|laws of nature]], which may be only manipulated, as in [[Descartes]]'s dream, but not changed, is in fact the result of a social and historical process, which can be controlled. Furthermore, only dialectical materialism links together all specialized domains, which modern rationalism can only think as separate instead of as forming a totality.

Only the proletariat can understand that the so-called "eternal laws of economics" are in fact nothing more than the historical form taken by the social and economical process in a capitalist society. Since these "laws" are the result of the collective actions of individuals, and are thus created by society, Marx and Lukács reasoned that this necessarily meant that they could be ''changed''. Any attempt in transforming the so-called "laws" governing capitalism into universal principles, valid in all times and places, are criticized by Lukács as a form of false consciousness.

As the "expression of the revolutionary process itself", dialectical materialism, which is the only theory with an understanding of the totality of the historical process, is the theory which may help the proletariat in its "struggle for class consciousness". Although Lukács does not contest the Marxist primacy of the economic [[base and superstructure|base]] on the ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (not to be mistaken with vulgar [[economic determinism]]), he considers that there is a place for autonomous struggle for class consciousness.

In order to achieve a unity of [[theory]] and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], theory must not only tend toward reality in an attempt to change it; reality must also tend towards theory. Otherwise, the historical process leads a life of its own, while theorists make their own little theories, desperately waiting for some kind of possible influence over the historical process. Henceforth, reality itself must tend toward the theory, making it the "expression of the revolutionary process itself". In turn, a theory which has as its goal helping the proletariat achieve class consciousness must first be an "objective theory of class consciousness". However, theory in itself is insufficient, and ultimately relies on the struggle of humankind and of the proletariat for consciousness: the "objective theory of class consciousness is only the theory of its objective possibility".

==Criticism==

Economist [[Ludwig Von Mises]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig von Mises]] ([1957], 2007). Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution. Auburn, Alabama: [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], p. 113. {{ISBN|978-1-933550-19-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that "Marx confus[ed] the notions of caste and class". Mises allowed that class consciousness, and the associated class struggle, were valid concepts in some circumstances where rigid social [[caste]]s exist; e.g., when [[slavery]] is legal, and slaves thus share a common motive for ending their disadvantaged status relative to other castes. "But no such conflicts are present in a society in which all citizens are equal before the law," according to Mises. "No logical objection can be advanced against distinguishing various classes among the members of such a society. Any classification is logically permissible, however arbitrarily the mark of distinction may be chosen. But it is nonsensical to classify the members of a capitalistic society according to their position in the framework of the social division of labor and then to identify these classes with the castes of a status society."

Philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]] argued that the "theory of class consciousness is false"&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Kolakowski, “My Correct Views on Everything,” The Socialist Register 1974, pp. 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; and that attempts by Marxist–Leninists to advance the concept of class consciousness necessarily led to totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;’Marxism, being a scientific theory, could not be a spontaneous product of the working class [according to Lenin], but had to be imported from outside, by intellectuals equipped with scientific knowledge, became the peculiar ideological instrument to justify a new idea of the party of manipulators. Since the working class is in principle incapable of articulating theoretically its consciousness, it is possible and even necessary that the "genuine" theoretical consciousness of the working class should be incarnated in a political organism that could consider itself the carrier of this consciousness regardless of what the "empirical" working class thought about it, given that the "empirical" consciousness of this class is irrelevant in defining who in a given moment represents its interest. This is why the theory of class consciousness instilled from outside and the whole idea of scientific socialism so conceived served to justify the fact that in all kinds of political activity and later in the exercise of political power, the working class may be and must be replaced by the political apparatus which is the vehicle of its consciousness at the highest level. The whole Leninist and then Stalinist principle of dictatorship which the proletariat exercises through the intermediary of its self-appointed representatives, is only a development of the idea of "scientific socialism" so conceived.’ Leszek Kolakowski, “Althusser’s Marx” The Socialist Register 1971, pp. 111–128&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Ernest van den Haag]] has argued:
 {{cquote|One way is to say that "objectively" people have common class interests and should act according to the class struggle pattern — but that they are not always "class conscious". They suffer from "false consciousness". But this is (a) not true; nor would it (b) help much if it were.

a) There often are conflicts among objective economic interests within a Marxian class — e.g. among workers. Conflicts occur over migration, international trade, religion or race. And workers often have objective interests in common with capitalists and in conflict with the interests of other groups of workers. Class membership is no more and possibly less decisive than say race membership in determining one's political views. If you insist on the importance of race, you may persuade people to act according to their "racial interests" for a while — as the Nazis did. If you convince people that they should act according to what you tell them are your class interests, they might. The prophecy becomes self-fulfilling. But the action comes from race or class propaganda — not from race or class as objective facts.

b) Further if we assume that classes are as important as Marx thought but that people do not act accordingly, because not having read Marx, they are not class conscious – if "class consciousness" becomes independent of class membership — and if class membership is neither sufficient nor necessary to bring the expected class behaviour, then social classes become one of many groups that influence man's action on some occasions. This would be a correct theory. But the distinctive point of Marxian theory is that class membership is decisive in determining most and particularly political actions. This is patently wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Haag, Ernest van den (1987) [http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/12/rp_12_3.pdf "Marxism as pseudo-science"], ''Reason Papers'' No. 12, Spring 1987&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, it has been argued that the class interests of any class must be empirically determined by examining their actual behavior - they do not have objectively existing interests. People must assume social identities as members of a class before it becomes possible to identify what those interests are by examining their behavior and positions. It has been observed, for example, that workers form attachment to the capitalist system (through trade unions) rather than antagonism.&lt;ref&gt;John Scott, Gordon Marshall (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1839">In [[mathematical logic]], '''cointerpretability''' is a [[binary relation]] on [[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theories]]: a formal theory ''T'' is '''cointerpretable''' in another such theory ''S'', when the language of ''S'' can be translated into the language of ''T'' in such a way that ''S'' proves every formula whose translation is a [[theorem]] of ''T''. The "translation" here is required to preserve the logical structure of formulas. 

This concept, in a sense dual to [[interpretability]], was introduced by {{harvtxt|Japaridze|1993}}, who also proved that, for theories of [[Peano arithmetic]] and any stronger theories with effective [[axiomatization]]s, cointerpretability is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;-conservativity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56963">The '''Copenhagen interpretation''' is an expression of the meaning of [[quantum mechanics]] that was largely devised in the years 1925 to 1927 by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. It remains one of the most commonly taught [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Wimmel1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wimmel |first=Hermann |year=1992 |title=Quantum Physics &amp; Observed Reality: A Critical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4sJ_fgyZJEC&amp;pg=PA2 |page=2 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=978-981-02-1010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Copenhagen interpretation, physical systems generally do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict the probabilities that measurements will produce certain results. The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement. This feature is known as [[wave function collapse]].

There have been many objections to the Copenhagen interpretation over the years. These include: discontinuous jumps when there is an observation, the probabilistic element introduced upon observation, the subjectiveness of requiring an observer, the difficulty of defining a measuring device, and the necessity of invoking classical physics to describe the "laboratory" in which the results are measured.

[[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|Alternatives]] to the Copenhagen interpretation include the [[many-worlds interpretation]], the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|De Broglie–Bohm (pilot-wave) interpretation]], [[quantum Bayesianism]], and [[quantum decoherence]] theories.

==Background==

[[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Niels Bohr]] postulated the occurrence of energy in discrete quantities ([[quantum|quanta]]) in order to explain phenomena such as the spectrum of [[black-body radiation]], the [[photoelectric effect]], and the stability and [[Emission spectrum|spectra]] of atoms. These phenomena had eluded explanation by classical physics and even appeared to be in contradiction with it. Although elementary particles show predictable properties in many experiments, they become thoroughly unpredictable in others, such as attempts to identify individual particle trajectories through a simple physical apparatus.

[[Classical physics]] draws a distinction between particles and waves. It also relies on continuity and determinism in natural phenomena. In the early twentieth century, newly discovered atomic and subatomic phenomena seemed to defy those conceptions. In 1925–1926, quantum mechanics was invented as a mathematical formalism that accurately describes the experiments, yet appears to reject those classical conceptions. Instead, it posits that probability, and discontinuity, are fundamental in the physical world. Classical physics also relies on causality. The standing of causality for quantum mechanics is disputed.

Quantum mechanics cannot easily be reconciled with everyday language and observation, and has often seemed counter-intuitive to physicists, including its inventors.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'' (1958): "I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighbouring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be so absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copenhagen interpretation intends to indicate the proper ways of thinking and speaking about the physical meaning of the [[mathematical]] formulations of quantum mechanics and the corresponding experimental results. It offers due respect to discontinuity, probability, and a conception of wave–particle dualism. In some respects, it denies standing to causality.

==Origin of the term==

[[Werner Heisenberg]] had been an assistant to [[Niels Bohr]] at [[Niels Bohr Institute|his institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] during part of the 1920s, when they helped originate quantum mechanical theory.  In 1929, Heisenberg gave a series of invited lectures at the University of Chicago explaining the new field of quantum mechanics.  The lectures then served as the basis for his textbook, ''[[The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory]]'', published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg, ''The historical development of quantum theory'', Springer-Verlag, 2001, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book's preface, Heisenberg wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the whole, the book contains nothing that is not to be found in previous publications, particularly in the investigations of Bohr.  The purpose of the book seems to me to be fulfilled if it contributes somewhat to the diffusion of that 'Kopenhagener Geist der Quantentheorie' [i.e., Copenhagen spirit of quantum theory] if I may so express myself, which has directed the entire development of modern atomic physics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term 'Copenhagen interpretation' suggests something more than just a spirit, such as some definite set of rules for interpreting the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, presumably dating back to the 1920s. However, no such text exists, apart from some informal popular lectures by Bohr and Heisenberg, which contradict each other on several important issues{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. It appears that the particular term, with its more definite sense, was coined by Heisenberg in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Howard 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Who invented the Copenhagen Interpretation? A study in mythology |year=2004 |last1=Howard |first1=Don |journal=Philosophy of Science |pages=669–682 | jstor=10.1086/425941 |volume=71 |issue=5 |doi=10.1086/425941|url=http://www.nd.edu/~dhoward1/Copenhagen%20Myth%20A.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; while criticizing alternate "interpretations" (e.g., [[David Bohm]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of 'Hidden' Variables. I &amp; II|year=1952 |last1=Bohm |first1=David |journal=Physical Review |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=166–193 |bibcode=1952PhRv...85..166B |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.85.166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kragh, ''Quantum generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century'', Princeton University Press, 1999, p. 210. ("the term 'Copenhagen interpretation' was not used in the 1930s but first entered the physicist’s vocabulary in 1955 when Heisenberg used it in criticizing certain unorthodox interpretations of quantum mechanics.")&lt;/ref&gt;  Lectures with the titles 'The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory' and 'Criticisms and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation', that Heisenberg delivered in 1955, are reprinted in the collection ''Physics and Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'', Harper, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the book was released for sale, Heisenberg privately expressed regret for having used the term, due to its suggestion of the existence of other interpretations, that he considered to be "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Olival Freire Jr., "Science and exile: David Bohm, the hot times of the Cold War, and his struggle for a new interpretation of quantum mechanics", ''Historical Studies on the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Volume 36, Number 1, 2005, pp. 31–35.  ("I avow that the term ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ is not happy since it could suggest that there are other interpretations, like Bohm assumes. We agree, of course, that the other interpretations are nonsense, and I believe that this is clear in my book, and in previous papers. Anyway, I cannot now, unfortunately, change the book since the printing began enough time ago.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the term==

According to an opponent of the Copenhagen interpretation, [[John G. Cramer]], "Despite an extensive literature which refers to, discusses, and criticizes the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, nowhere does there seem to be any concise statement which defines the full Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref name="Cramer 649"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cramer |first=John G. |title=The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |date=1986 |volume=58 |issue=3 |page=649 |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_20.html#2.0 |doi=10.1103/revmodphys.58.647 |bibcode=1986RvMP...58..647C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108072338/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_20.html#2.0 |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

There is no uniquely definitive statement of the Copenhagen interpretation. It consists of the views developed by a number of scientists and philosophers during the second quarter of the 20th Century. Bohr and Heisenberg never totally agreed on how to understand the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Bohr once distanced himself from what he considered to be Heisenberg's more subjective interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different commentators and researchers have associated various ideas with it. [[Asher Peres]] remarked that very different, sometimes opposite, views are presented as "the Copenhagen interpretation" by different authors.&lt;ref&gt;"There seems to be at least as many different Copenhagen interpretations as people who use that term, probably there are more. For example, in two classic articles on the foundations of quantum mechanics, Ballentine (1970) and Stapp (1972) give diametrically opposite definitions of 'Copenhagen.'", {{cite journal  |author1=Asher Peres |title=Popper's experiment and the Copenhagen interpretation |year=2002 |volume=33 |page=23 |journal=Stud. History Philos. Modern Physics |arxiv=quant-ph/9910078|bibcode=1999quant.ph.10078P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic principles generally accepted as part of the interpretation include:

#A [[Schrödinger equation|wave function &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;]] represents the [[quantum state|state]] of the system. It encapsulates everything that can be known about that system before an observation; there are no additional "hidden parameters".&lt;ref&gt;"... for the ″hidden parameters″ of Bohm's interpretation are of such a kind that they can ''never'' occur in the description of real processes, if the quantum theory remains unchanged." [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29 in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics'', ed. [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]] with the assistance of [[Leon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon, London, at p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The wavefunction evolves smoothly in time while isolated from other systems.
# The properties of the system are subject to a principle of incompatibility. Certain properties cannot be jointly defined for the same system at the same time. The incompatibility is expressed quantitatively by [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]. For example, if a particle at a particular instant has a definite location, it is meaningless to speak of its momentum at that instant.
# During an [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|observation]], the system must interact with a laboratory device. When that device makes a measurement,  the wave function of the systems is said to [[wave function collapse|collapse, or irreversibly reduce]] to an [[Introduction to eigenstates|eigenstate]] of the [[observable]] that is registered.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg reduction"&gt;"It is well known that the 'reduction of the wave packets' always appears in the Copenhagen interpretation when the transition is completed from the possible to the actual. The probability function, which covered a wide range of possibilities, is suddenly reduced to a much narrower range by the fact that the experiment has led to a definite result, that actually a certain event has happened. In the formalism this reduction requires that the so-called interference of probabilities, which is the most characteristic phenomena [''sic''] of quantum theory, is destroyed by the partly undefinable and irreversible interactions of the system with the measuring apparatus and the rest of the world." [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1959/1971). Criticism and counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, Chapter 8, pp. 114–128, in ''Physics and Philosophy: the Revolution in Modern Science'', third impression 1971, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, at p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The results provided by measuring devices are essentially classical, and should be described in ordinary language.  This was particularly emphasized by Bohr, and was accepted by Heisenberg.&lt;ref&gt;"Every description of phenomena, of experiments and their results, rests upon language as the only means of communication. The words of this language represent the concepts of ordinary life, which in the scientific language of physics may be refined to the concepts of classical physics. These concepts are the only tools for an unambiguous communication about events, about the setting up of experiments and about their results." [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1959/1971). Criticism and counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, Chapter 8, pp. 114–128, in ''Physics and Philosophy: the Revolution in Modern Science'', third impression 1971, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, at p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The description given by the wave function is probabilistic. This principle is called the [[Born rule]], after [[Max Born]].
#The wave function expresses a necessary and fundamental [[wave–particle duality]]. This should be reflected in ordinary language accounts of experiments. An experiment can show particle-like properties, or wave-like properties, according to the [[complementarity principle]] of [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;"... there is no reason to consider these matter waves as less real than particles." [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1959/1971). Criticism and counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, Chapter 8, pp. 114–128, in ''Physics and Philosophy: the Revolution in Modern Science'', third impression 1971, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, at p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The inner workings of atomic and subatomic processes are necessarily and essentially inaccessible to direct observation, because the act of observing them would greatly affect them.
# When quantum numbers are large, they refer to properties which closely match those of the classical description. This is the [[correspondence principle]] of Bohr and Heisenberg.

==Metaphysics of the wave function==
The Copenhagen interpretation denies that the wave function provides a directly apprehensible image of an ordinary material body or a discernible component of some such,&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Bohr|Bohr, N.]] (1928). 'The quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory', ''Nature'', '''121''': 580–590, {{doi|10.1038/121580a0}}, p. 586: "there can be no question of an immediate connexion with our ordinary conceptions".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1959/1971). 'Language and reality in modern physics', Chapter 10, pp. 145–160, in ''Physics and Philosophy: the Revolution in Modern Science'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, {{ISBN|0-04-530016 X}}, p. 153: "our common concepts cannot be applied to the structure of the atoms."&lt;/ref&gt; or anything more than a theoretical concept.

In metaphysical terms, the Copenhagen interpretation views [[quantum mechanics]] as providing knowledge of phenomena, but not as pointing to 'really existing objects', which it regarded as residues of ordinary intuition. This makes it an [[epistemic]] theory. This may be contrasted with Einstein's view, that physics should look for 'really existing objects', making itself an [[ontic]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Jammer|Jammer, M.]] (1982). 'Einstein and quantum physics', pp. 59–76 in ''Albert Einstein: Historical and Cultural Perspectives; the Centennial Symposium in Jerusalem'', edited by G. Holton, Y. Elkana, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, {{ISBN|0-691-08299-5}}. On pp. 73–74, Jammer quotes a 1952 letter from Einstein to Besso: "The present quantum theory is unable to provide the description of a real state of physical facts, but only of an (incomplete) knowledge of such. Moreover, the very concept of a real factual state is debarred by the orthodox theoreticians. The situation arrived at corresponds almost exactly to that of the good old Bishop Berkeley."&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphysical question is sometimes asked: "Could quantum mechanics be extended by adding so-called "hidden variables" to the mathematical formalism, to convert it from an epistemic to an ontic theory?" The Copenhagen interpretation answers this with a strong 'No'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198. Translation as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]: "Since the statistical nature of quantum theory is so closely [linked] to the uncertainty in all observations or perceptions, one could be tempted to conclude that behind the observed, statistical world a "real" world is hidden, in which the law of causality is applicable. We want to state explicitly that we believe such speculations to be both fruitless and pointless. The only task of physics is to describe the relation between observations."&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes alleged, for example by [[John Stewart Bell|J.S. Bell]], that Einstein opposed the Copenhagen interpretation because he believed that the answer to that question of "hidden variables" was "yes". That allegation has achieved mythical potency, but is mistaken. Countering that myth, [[Max Jammer]] writes "Einstein never proposed a hidden variable theory."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Jammer|Jammer, M.]] (1982). 'Einstein and quantum physics', pp. 59–76 in ''Albert Einstein: Historical and Cultural Perspectives; the Centennial Symposium in Jerusalem'', edited by G. Holton, Y. Elkana, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, {{ISBN|0-691-08299-5}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein explored the possibility of a hidden variable theory, and wrote a paper describing his exploration, but withdrew it from publication because he felt it was faulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Belousek |first1=D.W. |year=1996 |title=Einstein's 1927 unpublished hidden-variable theory: its background, context and significance |url=|journal=Stud.

Because it asserts that a wave function becomes 'real' only when the system is observed, the term "subjective" is sometimes proposed for the Copenhagen interpretation. This term is rejected by many Copenhagenists&lt;ref&gt;"Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature." [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1959/1971). Criticism and counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, Chapter 8, pp. 114–128, in ''Physics and Philosophy: the Revolution in Modern Science'', third impression 1971, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, at p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; because the process of observation is mechanical and does not depend on the individuality of the observer.

Some authors{{who|date=May 2018}} have proposed that Bohr was influenced by [[positivism]] (or even [[pragmatism]]). On the other hand, Bohr and Heisenberg were not in complete agreement, and they held different views at different times. Heisenberg in particular was prompted to move towards [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Historically, Heisenberg wanted to base quantum theory solely on observable quantities such as the intensity of spectral lines, getting rid of all intuitive (anschauliche) concepts such as particle trajectories in space–time. This attitude changed drastically with his paper in which he introduced the uncertainty relations – there he put forward the point of view that it is the theory which decides what can be observed. His move from positivism to operationalism can be clearly understood as a reaction on the advent of Schrödinger’s wave mechanics which, in particular due to its intuitiveness, became soon very popular among physicists. In fact, the word anschaulich (intuitive) is contained in the title of Heisenberg’s paper.", from {{cite arXiv |eprint=quant-ph/0210152 |author1=Claus Kiefer |title=On the interpretation of quantum theory – from Copenhagen to the present day |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], while participating in a colloquium at Cambridge, denied that the Copenhagen interpretation asserted "What cannot be observed does not exist." He suggested instead that the Copenhagen interpretation follows the principle "What is observed certainly exists; about what is not observed we are still free to make suitable assumptions. We use that freedom to avoid paradoxes."&lt;ref name="Cramer 649"/&gt;

==Born rule==

Max Born speaks of his probability interpretation as a "statistical interpretation" of the wave function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = M. | authorlink = Max Born | year = 1955 | title = Statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics | url = | journal = Science | volume = 122 | issue = 3172| pages = 675–679 | doi=10.1126/science.122.3172.675| pmid = 17798674 |bibcode = 1955Sci...122..675B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... the statistical interpretation, which I have first suggested and which has been formulated in the most general way by von Neumann, ..." [[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1953). The interpretation of quantum mechanics, ''Br. J. Philos. Sci.'', '''4'''(14): 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Born rule]] is essential to the Copenhagen interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Bohr|Bohr, N.]] (1928). 'The quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory', ''Nature'', '''121''': 580–590, {{doi|10.1038/121580a0}}, p. 586: "In this connexion [Born] succeeded in obtaining a statistical interpretation of the wave functions, allowing a calculation of the probability of the individual transition processes required by the quantum postulate.".&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers do not all follow the same terminology. The phrase "statistical interpretation", referring to the "ensemble interpretation", often indicates an interpretation of the Born rule somewhat different from the Copenhagen interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ballentine | first1 = L.E. | year = 1970 | title = The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics | url = http://nthur.lib.nthu.edu.tw/dspace/handle/987654321/65291| journal = Rev. Mod. Phys. | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 358–381 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.42.358|bibcode = 1970RvMP...42..358B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). Einstein's statistical theories, in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher Scientist'', ed. P.A. Schilpp, Open Court, La Salle IL, volume 1, pp. 161–177.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Copenhagen interpretation, it is axiomatic that the wave function exhausts all that can ever be known in advance about a particular occurrence of the system. The "statistical" or "ensemble" interpretation, on the other hand, is explicitly agnostic about whether the information in the wave function is exhaustive of what might be known in advance. It sees itself as more 'minimal' than the Copenhagen interpretation in its claims. It only goes as far as saying that on every occasion of observation, some actual value of some property is found, and that such values are found probabilistically, as detected by many occasions of observation of the same system. The many occurrences of the system are said to constitute an 'ensemble', and they jointly reveal the probability through these occasions of observation. Though they all have the same wave function, the elements of the ensemble might not be identical to one another in all respects, according to the 'agnostic' interpretations. They may, for all we know, beyond current knowledge and beyond the wave function, have individual distinguishing properties. For present-day science, the experimental significance of these various forms of Born's rule is the same, since they make the same predictions about the probability distribution of outcomes of observations, and the unobserved or unactualized potential properties are not accessible to experiment.

==Nature of collapse==
{{main|wave function collapse|quantum decoherence}}
Those who hold to the Copenhagen interpretation are willing to say that a wave function involves the various probabilities that a given event will proceed to certain different outcomes. But when the apparatus registers one of those outcomes, no probabilities or [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the others linger.&lt;ref&gt;"Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature." [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1959/1971). Criticism and counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, Chapter 8, pp. 114–128, in ''Physics and Philosophy: the Revolution in Modern Science'', third impression 1971, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, at p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Howard, wave function collapse is not mentioned in the writings of Bohr.&lt;ref name="Howard 2004"/&gt;

Some argue that the concept of the collapse of a "real" wave function was introduced by Heisenberg and later developed by [[John von Neumann]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;"the "collapse" or "reduction" of the wave function. This was introduced by Heisenberg in his uncertainty paper [3] and later postulated by von Neumann as a dynamical process independent of the Schrodinger equation", {{cite arXiv | eprint = quant-ph/0210152 | author1 = Claus Kiefer | title = On the interpretation of quantum theory – from Copenhagen to the present day | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Heisenberg spoke of the wavefunction as representing available knowledge of a system, and did not use the term "collapse" per se, but instead termed it "reduction" of the wavefunction to a new state representing the change in available knowledge which occurs once a particular phenomenon is registered by the apparatus (often called "measurement").&lt;ref&gt;W. Heisenberg "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik," ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', Volume 43, 172–198 (1927), as translated by John Wheeler and Wojciech Zurek, in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'' (1983), p. 74.  ("[The] determination of the position selects a definite "''q''" from the totality of possibilities and limits the options for all subsequent measurements.  ... [T]he results of later measurements can only be calculated when one again ascribes to the electron a "smaller" wavepacket of extension λ (wavelength of the light used in the observation).  Thus, every position determination reduces the wavepacket back to its original extension λ.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 [[David Bohm]] developed [[decoherence]], an ''explanatory mechanism'' for the ''appearance'' of wave function collapse. Bohm applied decoherence to [[Louis DeBroglie]]'s [[pilot wave]] theory, producing [[Bohmian mechanics]],&lt;ref name="bohm52a"&gt;[[David Bohm]], A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of "Hidden Variables", I, ''Physical Review'', (1952), 85, pp 166–179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bohm52b"&gt;[[David Bohm]], A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of "Hidden Variables", II, ''Physical Review'', (1952), 85, pp 180–193&lt;/ref&gt; the first successful hidden variables interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Collapse was avoided  by [[Hugh Everett]] in 1957 in his relative state interpretation.&lt;ref name=everett57&gt;[[Hugh Everett]],  Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics, ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' vol 29, (1957) pp 454–462, based on unitary time evolution without discontinuities.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decoherence was largely&lt;ref name=zeh&gt;[[H. Dieter Zeh]], On the Interpretation of Measurement in Quantum Theory, ''Foundations of Physics'', vol. 1, pp. 69–76, (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; ignored until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="zurek81"&gt;[[Wojciech H. Zurek]], Pointer Basis of Quantum Apparatus: Into what Mixture does the Wave Packet Collapse?, ''Physical Review D'', 24, pp. 1516–1525 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek82"&gt;[[Wojciech H. Zurek]], Environment-Induced Superselection Rules, ''Physical Review D'', 26, pp.1862–1880, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-separability of the wave function==

The domain of the wave function is configuration space, an abstract object quite different from ordinary physical space–time. At a single "point" of configuration space, the wave function collects probabilistic information about several distinct particles, that respectively have physically space-like separation. So the wave function is said to supply a non-separable representation. This reflects a feature of the quantum world that was recognized by Einstein as early{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} as 1905.

In 1927, Bohr drew attention to a consequence of non-separability. The evolution of the system, as determined by the Schrödinger equation, does not display particle trajectories through space–time. It is possible to extract trajectory information from such evolution, but not simultaneously to extract energy–momentum information. This incompatibility is expressed in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The two kinds of information have to be extracted on different occasions, because of the non-separability of the wave function representation. In Bohr's thinking, space–time visualizability meant trajectory information. Again, in Bohr's thinking, 'causality' referred to energy–momentum transfer; in his view, lack of energy–momentum knowledge meant lack of 'causality' knowledge. Therefore Bohr thought that knowledge respectively of 'causality' and of space–time visualizability were incompatible but complementary.&lt;ref name="Howard 2004"/&gt;

==Wave–particle dilemma==

{{further|Wave-particle duality}}

The term Copenhagen interpretation is not well defined when one asks about the wave–particle dilemma, because Bohr and Heisenberg had different or perhaps disagreeing views on it.

According to Camilleri, Bohr thought that the distinction between a wave view and a particle view was defined by a distinction between experimental setups, while, differing, Heisenberg thought that it was defined by the possibility of viewing the mathematical formulas as referring to waves or particles. Bohr thought that a particular experimental setup would display either a wave picture or a particle picture, but not both. Heisenberg thought that every mathematical formulation was capable of both wave and particle interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Camilleri | first1 = K | year = 2006 | title = Heisenberg and the wave–particle duality | url = | journal = Stud. Hist. Phil. Mod. Phys. | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 298–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camilleri, K. (2009). ''Heisenberg and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: the Physicist as Philosopher'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-88484-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Landé]] was for a long time considered orthodox. He did, however, take the Heisenberg viewpoint, in so far as he thought that the wave function was always mathematically open to both interpretations. Eventually this led to his being considered unorthodox, partly because he did not accept Bohr's one-or-the-other view, preferring Heisenberg's always-both view. Another part of the reason for branding Landé unorthodox was that he recited, as did Heisenberg, the [[Quantal translative momentum transfer|1923 work]]&lt;ref name="Duane 1923"&gt;[[William Duane (physicist)|Duane, W.]] (1923). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1085314/pdf/pnas01878-0020.pdf The transfer in quanta of radiation momentum to matter, ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' '''9'''(5): 158–164].&lt;/ref&gt; of old-quantum-theorist [[William Duane (physicist)|William Duane]], which anticipated a quantum mechanical theorem that had not been recognized by Born. That theorem seems to make the always-both view, like the one adopted by Heisenberg, rather cogent. One might say "It's there in the mathematics", but that is not a physical statement that would have convinced Bohr. Perhaps the main reason for attacking Landé is that his work demystified the phenomenon of diffraction of particles of matter, such as [[Buckminsterfullerene|buckyballs]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Jammer|Jammer, M.]] (1974). ''The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: the Interpretations of QM in Historical Perspective'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-43958-4}}, pp. 453–455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance among physicists==

Throughout much of the twentieth century the Copenhagen interpretation had overwhelming acceptance among physicists.  Although astrophysicist and science writer [[John Gribbin]] described it as having fallen from primacy after the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, J. ''Q for Quantum''&lt;/ref&gt; according to a very informal poll (some people voted for multiple interpretations) conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Max Tegmark |title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words? |year=1998 |pages=855–862 |volume=46 |journal=Fortsch.

In more recent polls conducted at various quantum mechanics conferences, varying results have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Kofler |author3=A.

Nelson, "Yet Another Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics", arXiv:1306.4646. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4646v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2017 article, physicist and Nobel laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] states that the Copenhagen interpretation "is now widely felt to be unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Steven Weinberg|title=The Trouble with Quantum Mechanics | url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/01/19/trouble-with-quantum-mechanics/ | work=New York Review of Books | date=19 January 2017 | accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The nature of the Copenhagen interpretation is exposed by considering a number of experiments and paradoxes.

1. [[Schrödinger's cat]]
:This [[thought experiment]] highlights the implications that accepting uncertainty at the microscopic level has on macroscopic objects.  A cat is put in a sealed box, with its life or death made dependent on the state of a subatomic particle.  Thus a description of the cat during the course of the experiment—having been entangled with the state of a subatomic particle—becomes a "blur" of "living and dead cat."  But this can't be accurate because it implies the cat is actually both dead and alive until the box is opened to check on it.  But the cat, if it survives, will only remember being alive.  Schrödinger resists "so naively accepting as valid a 'blurred model' for representing reality."&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Schrödinger, in an article in the ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 124, 323–38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''How can the cat be both alive and dead?''

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: The wave function reflects our knowledge of the system. The wave function &lt;math&gt;(|\text{dead}\rangle + |\text{alive}\rangle)/\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; means that, once the cat is observed, there is a 50% chance it will be dead, and 50% chance it will be alive.

2. [[Wigner's friend]]
:Wigner puts his friend in with the cat. The external observer believes the system is in the state &lt;math&gt;(|\text{dead}\rangle + |\text{alive}\rangle)/\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;. His friend, however, is convinced that the cat is alive, i.e. for him, the cat is in the state &lt;math&gt;|\text{alive}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. ''How can Wigner and his friend see different wave functions?''

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: The answer depends on the positioning of [[Heisenberg cut]], which can be placed arbitrarily. If Wigner's friend is positioned on the same side of the cut as the external observer, his measurements collapse the wave function for both observers. If he is positioned on the cat's side, his interaction with the cat is not considered a measurement.

3. [[Double-slit experiment|Double-slit]] [[diffraction]]
:Light passes through double slits and onto a screen resulting in a diffraction pattern. ''Is light a particle or a wave?''

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: Light is neither. A particular experiment can demonstrate particle (photon) or wave properties, but not both at the same time ([[Complementarity (physics)|Bohr's complementarity principle]]).

:The same experiment can in theory be performed with ''any'' physical system: electrons, protons, atoms, molecules, viruses, bacteria, cats, humans, elephants, planets, etc. In practice it has been performed for light, electrons, [[buckminsterfullerene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.160401 |pmid=11690188 |title=Diffraction of Complex Molecules by Structures Made of Light |year=2001 |last1=Nairz |first1=Olaf |last2=Brezger |first2=Björn |last3=Arndt |first3=Markus |last4=Zeilinger |first4=Anton |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=87 |issue=16|pages=160401 |arxiv = quant-ph/0110012 |bibcode = 2001PhRvL..87p0401N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.100404 |title=Matter-Wave Interferometer for Large Molecules |year=2002 |last1=Brezger |first1=Björn |last2=Hackermüller |first2=Lucia |last3=Uttenthaler |first3=Stefan |last4=Petschinka |first4=Julia |last5=Arndt |first5=Markus |last6=Zeilinger |first6=Anton |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |issue=10|arxiv = quant-ph/0202158 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88j0404B |pmid=11909334 |pages=100404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some atoms. Due to the smallness of [[Planck's constant]] it is practically impossible to realize experiments that directly reveal the wave nature of any system bigger than a few atoms but, in general, quantum mechanics considers all matter as possessing both particle and wave behaviors. The greater systems (like viruses, bacteria, cats, etc.) are considered as "classical" ones but only as an approximation, not exact.

4. [[EPR paradox|EPR (Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen) paradox]]
:Entangled "particles" are emitted in a single event. Conservation laws ensure that the measured spin of one particle must be the opposite of the measured spin of the other, so that if the spin of one particle is measured, the spin of the other particle is now instantaneously known. Because this outcome cannot be separated from quantum randomness, no information can be sent in this manner and there is no violation of either special relativity or the Copenhagen interpretation.

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: Assuming wave functions are not real, wave-function collapse is interpreted subjectively. The moment one observer measures the spin of one particle, he knows the spin of the other. However, another observer cannot benefit until the results of that measurement have been relayed to him, at less than or equal to the speed of light.

:Copenhagenists claim that interpretations of quantum mechanics where the wave function is regarded as real have problems with EPR-type effects, since they imply that the laws of physics allow for influences to propagate at speeds greater than the speed of light. However, proponents of [[many worlds]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#local Michael price on nonlocality in Many Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[transactional interpretation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_38.html#3.9 Relativity and Causality in the Transactional Interpretation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202142056/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_38.html |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_33.html#3.7 Collapse and Nonlocality in the Transactional Interpretation]&lt;/ref&gt; (TI) maintain that Copenhagen interpretation is fatally non-local.

:The claim that EPR effects violate the principle that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light have been countered by noting that they cannot be used for signaling because neither observer can control, or predetermine, what he observes, and therefore cannot manipulate what the other observer measures.

==Criticism==
The completeness of quantum mechanics (thesis 1) was attacked by the [[EPR paradox|Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen thought experiment]] which was intended to show that quantum mechanics could not be a complete theory.

[[bell test experiments|Experimental tests of]] [[Bell's inequality]] using particles have supported the quantum mechanical prediction of entanglement.

The Copenhagen interpretation gives special status to measurement processes without clearly defining them or explaining their peculiar effects. In his article entitled "Criticism and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory," countering the view of Alexandrov that  (in Heisenberg's paraphrase) "the wave function in configuration space characterizes the objective state of the electron." Heisenberg says,

{{quote|Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the "possible" to the "actual," is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1958"&gt;Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'', Harper, 1958, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many [[physicist]]s and [[philosopher]]s{{who|date=May 2018}} have objected to the Copenhagen interpretation, both on the grounds that it is non-deterministic and that it includes an undefined measurement process that converts probability functions into non-probabilistic measurements. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] comments "I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Einstein#Sourced|"God does not throw dice" quote]]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Do you really think the moon isn't there if you aren't looking at it?"&lt;ref&gt;A. Pais, ''Einstein and the quantum theory'', Reviews of Modern Physics '''51''', 863–914 (1979), p. 907.&lt;/ref&gt; exemplify this. Bohr, in response, said, "Einstein, don't tell God what to do."&lt;ref&gt;Bohr recollected his reply to Einstein at the 1927 [[Solvay Congress]] in his essay "Discussion with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics", in ''Albert Einstein, Philosopher–Scientist'', ed. Paul Arthur Shilpp, Harper, 1949, p. 211: "...in spite of all divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit animated the discussions.  On his side, Einstein mockingly asked us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities took recourse to dice-playing ("''ob der liebe Gott würfelt''"), to which I replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in everyday language."  Werner Heisenberg, who also attended the congress, recalled the exchange in ''Encounters with Einstein'', Princeton University Press, 1983, p. 117,: "But he [Einstein] still stood by his watchword, which he clothed in the words: 'God does not play at dice.'  To which Bohr could only answer: 'But still, it cannot be for us to tell God, how he is to run the world.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Weinberg]] in "Einstein's Mistakes", ''[[Physics Today]]'', November 2005, page 31, said:

{{quote|All this familiar story is true, but it leaves out an irony. Bohr's version of quantum mechanics was deeply flawed, but not for the reason Einstein thought. The Copenhagen interpretation describes what happens when an observer makes a measurement, but the observer and the act of measurement are themselves treated classically. This is surely wrong: Physicists and their apparatus must be governed by the same quantum mechanical rules that govern everything else in the universe. But these rules are expressed in terms of a wave function (or, more precisely, a state vector) that evolves in a perfectly deterministic way. So where do the probabilistic rules of the Copenhagen interpretation come from?

Considerable progress has been made in recent years toward the resolution of the problem, which I cannot go into here. It is enough to say that neither Bohr nor Einstein had focused on the real problem with quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen rules clearly work, so they have to be accepted. But this leaves the task of explaining them by applying the deterministic equation for the evolution of the wave function, the Schrödinger equation, to observers and their apparatus.}}

The problem of thinking in terms of classical measurements of a quantum system becomes particularly acute in the field of [[quantum cosmology]], where the quantum system is the universe.&lt;ref&gt;'Since the Universe naturally contains
all of its observers, the problem arises to come up with an interpretation of
quantum theory that contains no classical realms on the fundamental level.', {{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0210152|author1=Claus Kiefer|title=On the interpretation of quantum theory – from Copenhagen to the present day|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. T. Jaynes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Clearing up Mysteries – The Original Goal |year=1989 |last1=Jaynes |first1=E. T. |journal=Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods |pages=7 | url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a Bayesian point of view, argued that probability is a measure of a state of information about the physical world.  Quantum mechanics under the Copenhagen interpretation interpreted probability as a physical phenomenon, which is what Jaynes called a [[mind projection fallacy]].

Common criticisms of the Copenhagen interpretation often lead to the problem of [[Cardinality of the continuum|continuum]] of random occurrences: whether in time (as subsequent measurements, which under certain interpretations of the [[measurement problem]] may happen continuously) or even in space. A recent experiment showed that a particle may leave a trace about the path which it used when travelling as a wave &amp;ndash; and that this trace exhibits equality of both paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.

The view that particle diffraction logically guarantees the need for a wave interpretation has been questioned. A recent experiment has carried out the two-slit protocol with helium atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Ph. H. Schmidt et al.|first=|date=5 September 2013|title=Momentum Transfer to a Free Floating Double Slit: Realization of a Thought Experiment from the Einstein-Bohr Debates|url=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=111|issue=103201|pages=|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.103201|via=|bibcode=2013PhRvL.111j3201S}}. See also the article on [[Bohr–Einstein debates#Post-revolution: First stage|Bohr–Einstein debates]]. Likely there are even more such apparent interactions in various areas of the photon, for example when reflecting from the whole shutter.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic physics of quantal momentum transfer considered here was originally pointed out in 1923, by [[William Duane (physicist)|William Duane]], before quantum mechanics was invented.&lt;ref name="Duane 1923"/&gt; It was later recognized by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). [http://philpapers.org/rec/HEITPP ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory''], translated by C. Eckart and F.C.

[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23825865M/Quantum_mechanics ''Quantum Mechanics''], Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons, London, pp. 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also recently been considered by [[Carolyne Van Vliet|Van Vliet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Vliet | first1 = K. | authorlink = Carolyne Van Vliet | year = 1967 | title = Linear momentum quantization in periodic structures | url = | journal = Physica | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 97–106 | doi=10.1016/0031-8914(67)90138-3|bibcode = 1967Phy....35...97V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Vliet | first1 = K. | authorlink = Carolyne Van Vliet | year = 2010 | title = Linear momentum quantization in periodic structures ii | url = | journal = Physica A | volume = 389 | issue = 8| pages = 1585–1593 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2009.12.026|bibcode = 2010PhyA..389.1585V }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the diffracting slits are considered as classical objects, theoretically ideally seamless, then a wave interpretation seems necessary, but if the diffracting slits are considered physically, as quantal objects exhibiting collective quantal motions, then the particle-only and wave-only interpretations seem perhaps equally valid.

==Alternatives==
{{further|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
The [[Ensemble interpretation]] is similar; it offers an interpretation of the wave function, but not for single particles. The [[consistent histories]] interpretation advertises itself as "Copenhagen done right". Although the Copenhagen interpretation is often confused with the idea that [[consciousness causes collapse]], it defines an "observer" merely as that which collapses the wave function.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1958" /&gt; [[Quantum information]] theories are more recent, and have attracted growing support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Under [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[determinism]], if the wave function is regarded as ontologically real, and collapse is entirely rejected, a [[many worlds]] theory results. If wave function collapse is regarded as ontologically real as well, an [[objective collapse theory]] is obtained. Under [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[determinism]] (as well as non-localism), a [[hidden variable theory]] exists, e.g., the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm interpretation]], which treats the wavefunction as real, position and momentum as definite and resulting from the expected values, and physical properties as spread in space. For an atemporal indeterministic interpretation that “makes no attempt to give a ‘local’ account on the level of determinate particles”,&lt;ref name="Kastner2010"/&gt; the conjugate wavefunction, ("advanced" or [[retrocausality|time-reversed]]) of the relativistic version of the wavefunction, and the so-called "retarded" or time-forward version&lt;ref&gt;The non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]] does not admit advanced solutions.&lt;/ref&gt; are both regarded as real and the [[transactional interpretation]] results.&lt;ref name="Kastner2010"&gt;The Quantum Liar Experiment, RE Kastner, Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, Vol. 41, Iss. 2, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many physicists{{who|date=May 2018}} have subscribed to the [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, a position often equated with eschewing all interpretation. It is summarized by the sentence "Shut up and calculate!". While this slogan is sometimes attributed to [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref&gt;http://home.fnal.gov/~skands/slides/A-Quantum-Journey.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Richard Feynman]], it seems to be due to [[David Mermin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physics Today |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages= 10–11|url=http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_57/iss_5/10_1.shtml |title=Could Feynman Have Said This? |author=N.

'''David Hammons''' (born 1943) is an American artist especially known for his works in and around [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==

David Hammons was born in 1943 in [[Springfield, Illinois]], the youngest of ten children of a single mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schjeldahl|first=Peter|title=The Walker|journal=The New Yorker|date=December 23, 2002|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/12/23/021223craw_artworld|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962 he moved to Los Angeles, where he started attending Chouinard Art Institute (now [[CalArts]]) from 1966 to 1968 and the [[Otis Art Institute]] from 1968 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hammons - Biography|url=http://www.lmgallery.com/artists/david-hammons/?view=bio|publisher=L&amp;M Arts|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he was influenced by internationally known artists such as [[Bruce Nauman]], [[John Baldessari]], and [[Chris Burden]], but was also part of a pioneering group of [[African-American]] artists and jazz musicians in Los Angeles, with influence outside the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960–1980|url=http://www.momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/352|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 Hammons settled in New York City, where he slowly became better known nationally. He still lives and works in New York.

==Art practice==
Much of his work reflects his commitment to the civil rights and [[Black Power]] movements. A good example is the early ''Spade with Chains'' (1973), where the artist employs a provocative, derogatory term, coupled with the literal [[spade|gardening instrument]], in order to make a visual pun between the blade of a shovel and an African mask, and a contemporary statement about the issues of bondage and resistance. This was part of a larger series of "Spade" works in the 1970s, including ''Bird'' (1973), where [[Charlie Parker]] is evoked by a spade emerging from a saxophone, and ''Spade'', a 1974 print where the artist pressed his face against the shape leaving a caricature-like imprint of Negroid features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|author2=Christian Haye|title=Wreaking Havoc on the Signified|journal=Frieze|date=May 22, 1985|issue=22|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/wreaking_havoc_on_the_signified/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Hammons took part in [[Colab]]'s ground-breaking ''The Times Square Show'', which acted as a forum for exchange of ideas for a younger set of alternative artists in New York. His installation was made of glistening scattered shards of glass (from broken bottles of Night Train wine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahern|first=Charles|title=The Times Square Show revisited|url=http://timessquareshowrevisited.com/accounts/charlie-ahearn.html|work=(as told to Shawna Cooper, August 8, 2011)|publisher=Hunter College Gallery, CUNY|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works play on the association of basketball and young black men, such as drawings made by repeatedly bouncing a dirty basketball on huge sheets of clean white paper set on the floor; a series of larger-than-life basketball hoops, meticulously decorated with bottle caps, evoking Islamic mosaic and design; and ''Higher Goals'' (1986), where an ordinary basketball hoop, net, and backboard are set on a three-story high pole - commenting on the almost impossible aspirations of sports stardom as a way out of the ghetto.

Through his varied work and media, and frequent changes in direction, Hammons has managed to avoid one signature visual style. Much of his work makes allusions to, and shares concerns with minimalism and post-minimal art, but with added Duchampian references to the place of Black people in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|author2=Christian Haye|title=Wreaking Havoc on the Signified|journal=Frieze|date=May 22, 1985|issue=22|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/wreaking_havoc_on_the_signified/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[James Turrell]]'s works concerning perception of light, Hammons said "I wish I could make art like that, but we're too oppressed for me to be dabbling out there.... I would love to do that because that could also be very black. You know, as a black artist, dealing just with light. They would say, "how in the hell could he deal with that, coming from where he did?" I want to get to that, I'm trying to get to that, but I'm not free enough yet. I still feel I have to get my message out."&lt;ref&gt;Mcfadden, Jane. "Here, here, or there : on the whereabouts of art in the seventies." ''Pacific standard time : Los Angeles art 1945-1980''. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his focus on cultural overtones, Hammons’s work also discusses the notions of public and private spaces, as well as what constitutes a valuable commodity. An illustration of these concepts can be seen in ''Bliz-aard Ball Sale'' (1983), a performance piece in which Hammons situates himself alongside street vendors in downtown [[Manhattan]] in order to sell snowballs which are priced according to size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Can you remove the rainbow from happening?|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=13122|work=InEnArt|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act serves both as a parody on commodity exchange and a commentary on the capitalistic nature of art fostered by art galleries. Furthermore, it puts a satirical premium on "[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]", ridiculing the superficial luxury of racial classification as well as critiquing the hard social realities of street vending experienced by those who have been discriminated against in terms of race or class.

Also noteworthy is the artist's use of discarded or [[Abject Art|abject]] materials, including but not limited to elephant dung, chicken parts, strands of African-American hair, and bottles of cheap wine. Many critics see these objects as evocative of the desperation of the poor, Black urban class, but Hammons reportedly saw a sort of sacrosanct or ritualistic power in these materials, which is why he utilized them so extensively.

==Others==

In "The Window: Rented Earth: David Hammons,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Window: Rented Earth: David Hammons |url=http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/27 |publisher=New Museum archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early solo exhibition at the [[New Museum]], Hammons dealt with the diametrically opposed relationship between spirituality and technology by juxtaposing an African tribal mask with a modern-day invention—a child’s toy television set.

Hammons explored the [[video]] medium, collaborating with artist [[Alex Harsley]] on a number of video works, including ''Phat Free'' (originally titled ''Kick the Bucket''), which was included in the [[Whitney Biennial]] and other venues. Hammons and Harsley have also collaborated on [[Installation art|installations]] at New York's 4th Street Photo Gallery, a noted East Village artist exhibition and project space.

In a show at L &amp; M Arts in uptown Manhattan (January 18–March 31, 2007, his first authorized New York show since 2002, although there have been unauthorized surveys), Hammons collaborated with Japanese artist Chie (Hasegawa) Hammons in a piece that enjoyed public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brooklyn Rail'' (April 2007), "David and Chie Hammons," review by Jen Schwarting; ''The Village Voice'' (February 27, 2007), "Fur What It's Worth," by Jerry Saltz; among others.&lt;/ref&gt; In the posh uptown gallery specially selected by Hammons (who does not accept to be associated with any one gallery), they installed full-length fur coats on antique dress forms—two minks, a fox, a sable, a wolf and a chinchilla: "Hammons and his wife have also painted, burned, burnished, and stained the backs of all of these coats, turning them into aesthetic/ethical/sartorial traps.... Hammons has said that he wants 'to slide away from visuals and get deeper.' At L &amp; M, not only does Hammons do this; along the way he conjures thoughts of shamanism, politics, consumerism, animism, genre painting, animal rights, and jokes. Here, we're treated to a sensibility as barbed, serious, maybe fearsome, and as passionate as any in the art world."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, "Fur What It's Worth", ''[[The Village Voice]]'', February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and awards==
Hammons’s ''African American Flag'' is a part of the permanent collection of New York’s [[Museum of Modern Art]]. He also has work in the permanent collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York; [[Fogg Art Museum]], Cambridge; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington DC]]; [[Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago]], Chicago; [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]; [[Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain]], [[Paris]]; [[The Tate]], [[London]]; and other museums and collections.

Hammons received the [[MacArthur Fellowship]] (popularly known as the "Genius Grant") in July 1991.

'''Dāna''' ([[Devanagari]]: दान) is a [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] word that connotes the virtue of generosity, [[charity (practice)|charity]] or giving of [[alms]] in Indian philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0435302993}}, pages 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ckc17/&gt; It is alternatively transliterated as ''daana''.&lt;ref name=shahsoulful&gt;Shah et al (2013), Soulful Corporations: A Values-Based Perspective on Corporate Social Responsibility, Springer, {{ISBN|978-8132212744}}, page 125, Quote: "The concept of Daana (charity) dates back to the Vedic period. The Rig Veda enjoins charity as a duty and responsibility of every citizen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Hasan and J Onyx (2008), Comparative Third Sector Governance in Asia, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1441925961}}, page 227&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], dāna is the practice of cultivating generosity. It can take the form of giving to an individual in distress or need.&lt;ref name=ganguli311/&gt; It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.&lt;ref name=ganguli/&gt;

According to historical records, dāna is an ancient practice in Indian traditions, tracing back to [[Vedic]] traditions.&lt;ref name="shahsoulful"/&gt;&lt;ref name=birunihind/&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
Dāna (Sanskrit: दान) means giving, often in the context of donation and charity.&lt;ref name=sedict&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dAna&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 दान] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In other contexts, such as rituals, it can simply refer to the act of giving something.&lt;ref name=sedict/&gt; Dāna is related to and mentioned in ancient texts with concepts of ''Paropakāra'' (परोपकार) which means benevolent deed, helping others;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=paropakAra&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 परोपकार] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helena Águeda Marujo and Luis Miguel Neto (2013), Positive Nations and Communities, Springer, {{ISBN|978-9400768680}}, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dakshina'' (दक्षिणा) which means gift or fee one can afford;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dakSiNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 दक्षिणा] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bhiksha'' (भिक्षा), which means alms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dakSiNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhikSA] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Garcia Gomez et al. (2014), Religious Perspectives on Human Vulnerability in Bioethics, Springer, {{ISBN|978-9401787352}}, pages 170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.&lt;ref name=kandm3&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 361-382&lt;/ref&gt;

While dāna is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called ''utsarga''. This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facility among others.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, page 54-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in Hindu scriptures===
The ''[[Rigveda]]'' has the earliest discussion of ''dāna'' in the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=rhdana&gt;R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rigveda'' relates it to ''satya'' "truth" and in another hymn points to the guilt one feels from not giving to those in need.&lt;ref name=rhdana/&gt; It uses ''da'', the root of word ''dāna'', in its hymns to refer to the act of giving to those in distress. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]], for example, translates Book 10, Hymn 117 of the Rig veda as follows:
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;The Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape,
The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds none to comfort him,
The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat,
Hardens his heart against him, when of old finds not one to comfort him.

Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food, and the feeble,
Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in future troubles,
No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food, will offer nothing.

Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer pathway,
Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling,
The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food – I speak the truth – shall be his ruin,
He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats with no partaker.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The [[Upanishads]], composed before 500 BCE, present some of the earliest Upanishadic discussion of dāna. [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion or love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (dāna).&lt;ref name=kane/&gt;

[[Chandogya Upanishad]], Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] (asceticism), '''dāna''' (charity), arjava (straightforwardness), [[ahimsa]] (non-injury to all sentinent beings) and satyavacana (truthfulness).&lt;ref name=kane&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n61/mode/2up Samanya Dharma], History of Dharmasastra, Vol. 2, Part 1, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' describes the right and wrong forms of ''dāna'' in verses 17.20 through 17.22.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 653-655&lt;/ref&gt; It defines ''sāttvikam'' (good, enlightened, pure) charity, in verse 17.20, as one given without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person. It defines ''rajas'' (passion, ego driven, active) charity, in verse 17.21, as one given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruits and results, or grudgingly. It defines ''tamas'' (ignorant, dark, destructive) charity, in verse 17.22, as one given with contempt, to unworthy person(s), at a wrong place and time. In Book 17, Bhadwad Gita suggests steadiness in ''sattvikam dāna'', or the good form of charity is better; and that ''tamas'' should be avoided.&lt;ref name=ckc17&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 634-661&lt;/ref&gt; These three psychological categories are referred to as the ''[[guṇa]]s'' in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Theos Bernard (1999), Hindu Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813731}}, pages 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adi Parva]]'' of the Hindu Epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes.&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n143/mode/2up Adi Parva], Chapter XCI, verses 3-4, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 87 of ''Adi Parva'', it calls sweet speech and refusal to use harsh words or wrong others even if you have been wronged, as a form of charity. In the ''[[Vana Parva]]'', Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, "conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty".&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n737/mode/2up Vana Parva], Chapter CXCIV, verse 6, page 291&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Anushasana Parva]]'' in Chapter 58, recommends public projects as a form of dāna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data9/upload/0288/145&amp;first=1&amp;last=537&amp;barcode=99999990290213 Anushasana Parva]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062735/http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata9%2Fupload%2F0288%2F145&amp;first=1&amp;last=537&amp;barcode=99999990290213 |date=February 22, 2014 }} The Mahabharata, Translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the building of drinking water tanks for people and cattle as a noble form of giving, as well as giving of lamps for lighting dark public spaces.&lt;ref name=ganguli/&gt; In later sections of Chapter 58, it describes planting public orchards, with trees that give fruits to strangers and shade to travelers, as meritorious acts of benevolent charity.&lt;ref name=ganguli&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/306/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C. Roy (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 59 of Book 13 of the ''Mahabharata'', [[Yudhishthira]] and Bhishma discuss the best and lasting gifts between people:

{{quote|An assurance unto all creatures with love and affection and abstention from every kind of injury, acts of kindness and favor done to a person in distress, whatever gifts are made without the giver's ever thinking of them as gifts made by him, constitute, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest and best of gifts (dāna).|The Mahabharata, XIII.59&lt;ref name=ganguli311&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/310/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LIX] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original: −

The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' discusses when dāna is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures exist in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'', written between 200 BCE and 400 CE, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It discusses charity, dedicating Chapter 23 of Book 1 on Virtues to it.&lt;ref name=gutenberg/&gt; ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' suggests charity is necessary for an virtuous life and happiness. He states in Chapter 23: "Giving to the poor is true charity, all other giving expects some return"; "Great, indeed, is the power to endure hunger.
Greater still is the power to relieve other's hunger"; "Giving alms is a great reward in itself to one who gives".&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=December 16, 2014 }} see Chapter 23, Book 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tirukkural-tirukkural/oclc/777453934?referer=di&amp;ht=edition Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai : Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 101, he states: "Believing wealth is everything, yet giving away nothing, is a miserable state of mind"; "Vast wealth can be a curse to one who neither enjoys it nor gives to the worthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_101.htm Wealth That Benefits No One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216063951/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_101.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} see Chapter 101, Book 1&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Mahabharata, Tirukkuṛaḷ also extends the concept of charity to deeds (body), words (speech) and thoughts (mind). It states that a brightly beaming smile, the kindly light of loving eye, and saying pleasant words with sincere heart is a form of charity that every human being should strive to give.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H. Drew, Rev John Lazarus, and Mr F W Ellis (1886), WH Allen &amp; Company; see section 1.2.6 Verse 93; page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in rituals===
Dāna is also used to refer to [[ritual|rituals]]. For example, in a [[Hindu wedding]], ''kanyādāna'' (कन्यादान) refers to the ritual where a father gives his daughter's hand in marriage to the groom, after asking the groom to promise that he will never fail in his pursuit of [[dharma]] (moral and lawful life), [[artha]] (wealth) and [[kama]] (love). The groom promises to the bride's father, and repeats his promise three times in presence of all gathered as witness.&lt;ref&gt;P.H. Prabhu (2011), Hindu Social Organization, {{ISBN|978-8171542062}}, see pages 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, PV (1974), History of Dharmasastra: Ancient and Medieval Civil Law in India (Vol 2.1), Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. pages 531–538&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of charity includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, godāna (donation of a cow),&lt;ref&gt;Padma (1993), The Position of Women in Mediaeval Karnataka, Prasaranga, University of Mysore Press, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; bhudāna (भूदान) (donation of land), and ''vidyādāna'' or [[jnana|jñānadāna]] (विद्यादान, ज्ञानदान): Sharing knowledge and teaching skills, ''aushadhādāna'' (औषधदान): Charity of care for the sick and diseased, ''abhayadāna''(अभयदान): giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and ''anna dāna'' (अन्नादान): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Abbe Dubois and Henry Beauchamp (2007), Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies, {{ISBN|978-1602063365}}, pages 223, 483-495&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effect of dāna===
Charity is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity principle]].&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt;
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Living creatures get influenced through dānam,
Enemies lose hostility through dānam,
A stranger may become a loved one through dānam,
Vices are killed by dānam.&lt;/poem&gt;
|A Hindu Proverb|&lt;ref name=krma365&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 365-366&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other Hindu texts, such as ''Vyasa Samhita'', state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives.&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (1979), {{Google books|tws7AAAAMAAJ|The Dharma-shastras}}, Volumes 3, Cosmo Publishers, pages 20-29&lt;/ref&gt; The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a [[dharma|dharmic]] act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; The donor's intent and responsibility for diligence about the effect of dāna on the recipient is considered as important as the dāna itself. While the donor should not expect anything in return with dāna, the donor is expected to make an effort to determine the character of the recipient, likely return to the recipient and to the society.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; Some medieval era authors state that ''dāna'' is best done with ''shraddha'' (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without ''anasuya'' (finding faults in the recipient).&lt;ref name=bilimoriadaana/&gt; These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of "unquestioning hospitality", where the ''dāna'' ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.&lt;ref name=bilimoriadaana&gt;P Bilimoria et al. (2007), Dana as a Moral Category, in Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 196-197 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in historical records===
[[Al-Biruni]], the Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about 1017, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, "It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible."&lt;ref name=birunihind&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 2), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000157.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), pages 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms.&lt;ref&gt;Al Biruni states that another one-ninth is put into savings/reserve, one-ninth in investment/trade for profits&lt;/ref&gt; Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve.| Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī, Tarikh Al-Hind, 11th century AD&lt;ref name="birunihind"/&gt;}}

''Satram''s, called ''Choultry'', ''Dharamsala'' or ''Chathram''s in parts of India, have been one expression of Hindu charity. Satrams are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major [[Hindu temple]] sites in [[South Asia]] as well as near major temples.&lt;ref&gt;KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kota Neelima (2012), Tirupati, Random House, {{ISBN|978-8184001983}}, pages 50-52; Prabhavati C.

[[Hindu temple]]s served as charitable institutions. [[Burton Stein]]&lt;ref name=burste/&gt; states that South Indian temples collected donations (melvarum) from devotees, during the [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire]] periods in 1st millennium through first half of 2nd millennium AD.&lt;ref&gt;SK Aiyangar, Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120618503}}, pages 158-164&lt;/ref&gt; These ''dāna'' were then used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.&lt;ref name=burste&gt;Burton Stein, The Economic Function of a Medieval South Indian Temple, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19 (February, 1960), pp 163-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton Stein (February 4, 1961), The state, the temple and agriculture development, The Economic Weekly Annual,  pp 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu treatises on dāna===
''[[Mitākṣarā]]'' by [[Vijñāneśvara]] is an 11th-century canonical discussion and commentary on dāna, composed under the patronage of [[Chalukya dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion about charity is included in its thesis on ''ācāra'' (moral conduct).

Major Sanskrit treatises that discuss ethics, methods and rationale for charity and alms giving in Hinduism include, states Maria Heim,&lt;ref name=heim45/&gt; the 12th-century ''Dāna Kānda'' "Book of Giving" by Laksmidhara of [[Kannauj]], the 12th-century ''Dāna Sāgara'' "Sea of Giving" by Ballālasena of [[Bengal]], and the 14th-century sub-book ''Dānakhanda'' in ''Caturvargacintamani'' "The Gem of the Four Aims of Human Life" by Hemadiri of Devagiri (modern [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra]]). The first two are few hundred page treatises each, while the third is over a thousand-page compendium on charity, from a region that is now part of modern-day eastern [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]; the text influenced Hindus of Deccan region and South India from 14th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=heim45&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna as a formal religious act is directed specifically to a monastic or spiritually-developed person. In Buddhist thought, it has the effect of purifying and transforming the mind of the giver.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generosity developed through giving leads to experience of material wealth and possibly being reborn in happy states. In the [[Pāli Canon]]'s ''[[Dighajanu Sutta]]'', generosity (denoted there by the Pāli word ''cāga'', which can be synonymous with ''dāna'') is identified as one of the four traits conditioning happiness and wealth in the next life. Conversely, lack of giving leads to unhappy states and poverty.

Dāna leads to one of the [[pāramitā]]s or "perfections", the ''dānapāramitā''. This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Buddhists believe that giving without seeking anything in return leads to greater spiritual wealth.

Dana is, as with Hindu texts like Mitaksara and Vahni Purana and in Buddhist texts, described as a virtue and [[duty]] in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, pages 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an act of compassion, and must be done with no desire for material gain.&lt;ref name=thomaswatts&gt;Thomas Watts (2006), Encyclopedia of World Poverty, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-1412918077}}, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Four types of Dana are discussed in the texts of Jainism: ''Ahara-dana'' (donation of food), ''Ausadha-dana'' (donation of medicine), ''Jnana-dana'' (donation of knowledge) and ''Abhaya-dana'' (giving of protection or freedom from fear, asylum to someone under threat).&lt;ref name=thomaswatts/&gt; Dāna is one of ten means to gain positive karma, in the soteriological theories of Jainism. Medieval era texts of Jainism dedicate a substantial portion of their discussions to the need and virtue of Dāna.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2007), Dāna as a Moral Category, in Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges (Editors: P Bilimoria et al.), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 193-205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
Dāna, called [[Vand Chhako]], is considered one of three duties of Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml Sikh Beliefs] BBC Religions (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The duty entails sharing part of one's earnings with others, by giving to charity and caring for others. Examples of dāna in Sikhism include [[selfless service]] and [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Fleming, Thinking about God and Morality, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0435307004}}, page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''enema''' is the injection of fluid into the [[Large intestine|lower bowel]] by way of the [[rectum]].&lt;ref name=Cullingworth_introduction&gt;Cullingworth, ''A Manual of Nursing, Medical and Surgical'':155&lt;/ref&gt; 

In standard medicine, the most frequent uses of enemas are to relieve constipation and for bowel cleansing before a medical examination or procedure;&lt;ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Soapsuds_enema |title = Soapsuds enema |website = Biology-Online Dictionary |publisher = Biology-Online |accessdate = 6 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also, they are employed as a [[lower gastrointestinal series]] (also called a barium enema),&lt;ref name=NIH_barium&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003817.htm |title = Barium enema |website = MedlinePlus |publisher = U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services – National Institutes of Health (NIH) |accessdate = 6 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to check diarrhea, as a vehicle for the administration of food, water or medicine, as a stimulant to the general system, as a local application and, more rarely, as a means of reducing temperature,&lt;ref name=Cullingworth_introduction /&gt; as treatment for [[encopresis]], and as a form of [[rehydration therapy]] ([[proctoclysis]]) in patients for whom [[intravenous therapy]] is not applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0885-3924(97)00367-9 |last1 = Bruera |first1 = E |last2 = Pruvost |first2 = M |last3 = Schoeller |first3 = T |last4 = Montegjo |first4 = G |last5 = Watanabe |first5 = S |date = April 1998 |title = Proctoclysis for Hydration of Terminally Ill Cancer Patients |journal = Jour Pain Symptom Management |volume = 15 |issue = 4 |pages = 216–9 |pmid=9601155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other contexts, enemas are used by some alternative health therapies, used recreationally, chiefly as part of sexual activities, but also in sadomasochism, as well as simply for pleasure, used to intoxicate with alcohol, used to administer drugs for both recreational and religious reasons, and used for punishment.

== Medical usage ==
{{Columns-list}}

The principal medical usages of enemas are:

=== Bowel cleansing ===
[[File:Soapsuds Enemas.jpg|thumb|Soapsuds enemas, in a can with a nozzle typical for a cleansing enema, and in a contrast enema bag with a barium nozzle]]
[[File:Enema prepared, disposable.jpg|thumb|A prepared, disposable enema]]

==== Acute treatments ====
As [[bowel]] stimulants, enemas are employed for the same purposes as orally administered [[laxative]]s: To relieve [[constipation]]; To treat [[fecal impaction]]; To empty the colon prior to a medical procedure such as a [[colonoscopy]]. A large volume or high enema&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/high%20enema|title=high enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/meds/prac_skills_alg/Care%20of%20patients/Administering%20an%20Enema.htm |title=Administering an Enema |website=Care of patients |date=14 July 2015 |publisher=Ternopil State Medical University |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/nursepractice/ch/ch12e1.html |title=Types of Enemas |website=Fundamentals of Nursing Practice |publisher=Professional Education, Testing and Certification Organization International |author= Rhodora Cruz |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/low%20enema|title=low enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such enemas' mechanism consists of the volume of the liquid causing rapid expansion of the intestinal tract in conjunction with, in the case of certain solutions, irritation of the intestinal [[mucosa]], resulting in powerful [[peristalsis]] and a feeling of extreme fecal urgency. The enema is retained until there is a uncontrollable urge to defecate, at which time the recipient may expel any [[feces|fecal matter]] loosened by the instilled solution together with the solution itself. The procedure may cause uncomfortable bloating and cramping.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===== Water-based solutions =====

Plain water can be used, simply functioning mechanically to expand the colon, thus prompting evacuation.

[[Castile soap]] is commonly added because its irritation of the colon's lining increases the urgency to defecate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0897189704000801|title=Safety and effectiveness of large-volume enema solutions |author= MarileeSchmelzer, Lawrence R.Schiller, Richard Meyer, Susan M.Rugari, PattiCase|date=November 2004 |journal=Applied Nursing Research |accessdate=July 22, 2017 |doi=10.1016/j.apnr.2004.09.010 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=265–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, mild [[hand soap]] can be dissolved in the water.&lt;ref name=therapeutic-aspects-of-hydrotherapy/&gt;{{Dubious |reason=Only referenced in non medical contexts; the one reference here IS from a legitimate medical source, BUT its subject is an alternative medicine matter|date=September 2018}} However, liquid handsoaps and detergents should not be used.&lt;ref name=Biology_Online_Dictionary/&gt;

[[Glycerol]] is a specific bowel mucosa irritant serving to induce peristalsis via a [[Osmotic laxative|hyperosmotic effect]].&lt;ref name= Glycerol&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.drugs.com/cdi/glycerin-enema.html |title= Glycerin Enema |publisher= Drugs.com | accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in a dilute solution, e.g., 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = E. Bertani, A. Chiappa, R. Biffi, P. P. Bianchi, D. Radice, V. Branchi, S. Spampatti, I. Vetrano, B. Andreoni | title = Comparison of oral polyethylene glycol plus a large volume glycerine enema with a large volume glycerine enema alone in patients undergoing colorectal surgery for malignancy: a randomized clinical trial  | journal = Colorectal Disease | volume = 13 | issue = 10  | pages = e327–e334 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21689356  | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2011.02689.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[buffer solution|Buffered]] [[sodium phosphates#Use|sodium phosphate]] solution draws additional water from the bloodstream into the colon to increase the effectiveness of the enema, but can be rather irritating to the colon, causing intense cramping or "griping."

[[saline (medicine)#Normal|Normal saline]] is least irritating to the colon, at the opposite end of the spectrum. Like plain water, it simply functions mechanically to expand the colon, but having a neutral concentration gradient, it neither draws [[electrolyte]]s from the body, as happens with plain water, nor draws water into the colon, as occurs with phosphates. Thus, a salt water solution can be used when a longer period of retention is desired, such as to soften an impaction.

Likewise, [[baking soda|baking]] [[baking soda|soda]] (sodium bicarbonate) can be dissolved in the water.&lt;ref name=therapeutic-aspects-of-hydrotherapy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ijpsr.com/bft-article/a-review-on-therapeutic-aspects-of-hydrotherapy/?view=fulltext|title=A REVIEW ON THERAPEUTIC ASPECTS OF HYDROTHERAPY|last=Chaurasia|first=Gita |last2=Patil |first2=Amruta |last3=Dighe |first3=Shweta |date=2015|website=International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |reason=Only referenced in non medical contexts; the one reference here IS from a legitimate medical source, BUT its subject is an alternative medicine matter|date=September 2018}}

===== Other solutions =====

Equal parts of milk and molasses heated together to slightly above normal body temperature have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Pam Hufford|last2=Metules|first2=Terri J|date=April 2001|title=Some old-fashioned enemas still work and are still used|url=|journal=RN|volume=64|pages=80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the milk sugars and proteins nor the molasses are absorbed in the lower intestine, thus keeping the water from the enema in the intestine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://med.virginia.edu/pediatrics/about/clinical-and-patient-services/patient-tutorials/chronic-constipation-encopresis/treatment-of-chronic-constipation | title=Treatment of Chronic Constipation |work=Clinical And Patient Services &gt; Tutorials for Patients &amp; Families |publisher=University of Virginia School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics | accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mineral oil]] functions as a lubricant and stool softener, but often has the side effect of sporadic seepage from the patient's anus which can soil undergarments for up to 24 hours.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==== Chronic treatments ====
===== Transanal irrigation =====
{{Main|Transanal irrigation}}
''TAI'', also termed ''retrograde irrigation'', is designed to assist evacuation using a water enema&lt;ref name=Emmanuel2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emmanuel|first1=A V|last2=Krogh|first2=K|last3=Bazzocchi|first3=G|last4=Leroi|first4=A-M|last5=Bremers|first5=A|last6=Leder|first6=D|last7=van Kuppevelt|first7=D|last8=Mosiello|first8=G|last9=Vogel|first9=M|last10=Perrouin-Verbe|first10=B|last11=Coggrave|first11=M|last12=Christensen|first12=P|title=Consensus review of best practice of transanal irrigation in adults|journal=Spinal Cord|date=20 August 2013|volume=51|issue=10|pages=732–738|doi=10.1038/sc.2013.86|pmid=23958927|url=http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v51/n10/pdf/sc201386a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a treatment for persons with bowel dysfunction, including [[fecal incontinence]] or constipation, especially [[obstructed defecation]]. Its effectiveness varies considerably, some individuals experiencing complete control of incontinence but others reporting little or no benefit.&lt;ref name=Emmanuel2013 /&gt;

The term ''retrograde irrigation'' distinguishes this procedure from the [[Malone antegrade continence enema]], where irrigation fluid is introduced into the colon proximal to the anus via a surgically created irrigation port.

===== Bowel management =====
{{Main|Bowel management}}
Patients who have a bowel disability, a medical condition which impairs control of [[defecation]], e.g., fecal incontinence or constipation,&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowel Management After Spinal Cord Injury|url=http://www.sci-info-pages.com/bowel.html|website=www.sci-info-pages.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; can use bowel management techniques to choose a predictable time and place to evacuate.&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"/&gt; Without bowel management, such persons might either suffer from the feeling of not getting relief, or they might soil themselves.&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"/&gt;

While simple techniques might include a controlled [[Healthy diet|diet]] and establishing a toilet routine,&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"/&gt; a daily enema can be taken to empty the colon, thus preventing unwanted and uncontrolled bowel movements that day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peña A, Guardino K, Tovilla JM, Levitt MA, Rodriguez G, Torres R Bowel management for fecal incontinence in patients with anorectal malformations Pediatr. Surg. 33:1 133–7 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation,&lt;ref name="Consensus review 2013"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v51/n10/pdf/sc201386a.pdf], Consensus review of best practice of transanal irrigation in adults A V Emmanuel et al. Spinal Cord 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree, thus enabling development of a consistent bowel routine.&lt;ref name="Consensus review 2013" /&gt;  An international consensus on when and how to use transanal irrigation for people with bowel problems was published in 2013, offering practitioners a clear, comprehensive and simple guide to practice for the emerging therapeutic area of transanal irrigation.&lt;ref name="Consensus review 2013" /&gt;

=== Contrast (X-ray) ===

[[File:Barium Contrast Enema.jpg|thumb|A barium enema in a disposable bag manufactured for that purpose]]

In a [[lower gastrointestinal series]] an enema that may contain [[Barium sulphate#Radiocontrast agent|barium sulfate]] powder or a water-soluble contrast agent is used in the [[Röntgen ray|radiological]] imaging of the bowel.  Called a ''barium enema'', such enemas are sometimes the only practical way to ''view'' the colon in a relatively safe manner.&lt;ref name=NIH_barium /&gt; Following barium enema administration, patients often find that flushing the remaining barium with additional water, baking soda, or saline enemas helps restore normal colon activity without complications of constipation from the administration of the barium sulfate.

=== Medication administration ===

The administration of substances into the bloodstream.  This may be done in situations where it is undesirable or impossible to deliver a medication by mouth, such as [[antiemetic]]s given to reduce [[nausea]] (though not many antiemetics are delivered by enema). Additionally, several anti-angiogenic agents, which work better without digestion, can be safely administered via a gentle enema.

The topical administration of medications into the rectum, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[mesalazine]] used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].  Administration by enema avoids having the medication pass through the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]], therefore simplifying the delivery of the medication to the affected area and limiting the amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream.

Rectal corticosteroid enemas are sometimes used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone.

=== Other ===

* There have been a few cases in remote or rural settings, where rectal fluids have been used to rehydrate a person. Benefits include not needing to use sterile fluids.&lt;ref name="pmid19856644"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Tremayne V |title = Proctoclysis: emergency rectal fluid infusion |journal = Nurs Stand |volume = 24 |issue = 3 |pages = 46–8 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19856644 |doi = 10.7748/ns2009.09.24.3.46.c7271 |url = http://vincetremayne.com/resources/Emergency%2Brectal%2Binfusion.pdf |access-date = 25 July 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120328041530/http://vincetremayne.com/resources/Emergency+rectal+infusion.pdf |archive-date = 28 March 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adverse effects ==

Improper administration of an enema can cause electrolyte imbalance (with repeated enemas) or ruptures to the bowel or rectal tissues resulting in internal [[bleeding]]. However, these occurrences are rare in healthy, [[sobriety|sober]] adults. Internal bleeding or rupture may leave the individual exposed to infections from intestinal bacteria. Blood resulting from tears in the colon may not always be visible, but can be distinguished if the feces are unusually dark or have a red hue. If intestinal rupture is suspected, medical assistance should be obtained immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health |first = ME |last = Martelli |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |accessdate = 11 January 2008 |format = &amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AMartelli+intitle%3AEncyclopedia+of+Nursing+and+Allied+Health&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |publisher = [[FindArticles]] |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123073414/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |archivedate = 23 January 2008 |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enema tube and solution may stimulate the [[vagus nerve]], which may trigger an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] such as [[bradycardia]]. Enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed [[abdominal pain]] since the peristalsis of the bowel can cause an inflamed [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] to [[Appendicitis|rupture]].

There are arguments both for and against colonic irrigation in people with [[diverticulitis]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], severe or internal [[hemorrhoids]] or [[tumors]] in the rectum or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], and its usage is not recommended soon after bowel [[surgery]] (unless directed by one's [[health care provider]]). Regular treatments should be avoided by people with [[heart disease]] or [[renal failure]]. Colonics are inappropriate for people with bowel, rectal or anal [[disease|pathologies]] where the pathology contributes to the risk of [[bowel perforation]].&lt;ref name="ihealth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Colon Hydrotherapy |website=Aetna IntelliHealth |url=http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/34968/358752.html?d=dmtContent |date=1 July 2005 |accessdate=23 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807002412/http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/34968/358752.html?d=dmtContent |archivedate=7 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Clyster syringes.jpg|thumb|A normal clyster syringe ''(front)'' and the nozzle for a syringe designed for self-administration ''(rear)''. The latter avoided the need for a second party to attend an embarrassing procedure.]]

''Enema'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔνεμα (''énema''), from ἐνίημι (''eníēmi''), "(I) inject".

''Clyster'' (/ˈklɪstə(r)/), also spelled ''glister'' in the 17th century, rarely "cloister" or "clister" comes from Greek κλυστήρ (''klystḗr''), from κλύζω (''klýzo''), "(I) wash". It is an archaic word for enema, more particularly for enemas administered using a ''clyster syringe''&amp;nbsp;– that is, a [[syringe]] with a rectal nozzle and a plunger rather than a bulb. Clyster syringes were used from the 17th century (or before) to the 19th century, when they were largely replaced by enema bulb syringes, bocks, and bags.

The first mention of the enema in medical literature is in the Ancient Egyptian [[Ebers Papyrus]] ({{circa|1550}} BCE). One of the many types of medical specialists was an Iri, the Shepherd of the Anus. Many medications were administered by enemas.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':31&lt;/ref&gt; There was a Keeper of the Royal Rectum who may have primarily been the pharaoh's enema maker. The god [[Thoth]], according to Egyptian mythology, invented the enema.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Olmec]] from their middle preclassic period (10th through 7th centeries BCE) through the Spanish Conquest used trance-inducing substances ceremonially, and these were ingested via, among other routes, enemas administered using jars.

The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in their late classic age (7th through 10th centuries CE) used enemas for, at least, ritual purposes, in the Xibalban court of the God D whose worship included ritual cult paraphernalia. It is hypothesized that these enemas were for ritual purification and the ingestion of intoxicants and hallucinogens. The Maya illustrated the use of a characteristic enema bulb syringe by female attendants administering clysters ritually.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons and Carlson:92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3528674"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = de Smet PA, Hellmuth NM |title = A multidisciplinary approach to ritual enema scenes on ancient Maya pottery |journal = J Ethnopharmacol |volume = 16 |issue = 2–3 |pages = 213–62 |year = 1986 |pmid = 3528674 |doi = 10.1016/0378-8741(86)90091-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century BC the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] [[Asclepiades of Bithynia]] wrote "Treatment consists merely of three elements: drink, food, and the enema".&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':44&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he contended that indigestion is caused by particles of food that are too big and his prescribed treatment was proper amounts of food and wine followed by an enema which would remove the improper food doing the damage.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second century CE the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]] recommended an enema of pearl barley in milk or rose oil with butter as a nutrient for those suffering from dysentery and unable to eat&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/21-enemas.pdf |title = Information Sheet:21 Enemas |website = Information Sheets |publisher = Museum of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, London |accessdate = 26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Galen mentions enemas in several contexts.&lt;ref name=Galen&gt;{{Citation |last = Mattern |first = Susan P. |year = 2008 |title = Galen and the Rhetoric of Healing |publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location = Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland, USA |isbn=978-0-8018-8835-9 |pages = 31, 145, 149 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXlOC1_liEC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times appear the first illustrations of enema equipment, a clyster syringe consisting of a tube attached to a pump action bulb made of a pig bladder and the 15th century Simple piston syringe clysters came into use. Beginning in the 17th century enema apperatus was chiefly designed for self-administration at home and many were French as enemas enjoyed wide usage in France.&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /&gt;

When clyster syringes were in use in Europe, the patient was placed in an appropriate position (kneeling, with the buttocks raised, or lying on the side); a servant or [[apothecary]] would then insert the nozzle into the anus and press the plunger, resulting in the liquid remedy (generally, [[water]], but also some other preparations) being injected into the colon.

[[File:Klistierbank1.JPG|thumb|Portable enema self-administration apparatus by [[Giovanni Alessandro Brambilla]] (18th century; Medical History Museum, University of Zurich)]]

Because of the embarrassment a woman might feel when showing her buttocks (and possibly her genitals, depending on the position) to a male apothecary, some contraptions were invented that blocked all from the apothecary's view except for the anal area. Another invention was syringes equipped with a special bent nozzle, which enabled self-administration, thereby eliminating the embarrassment.

Clysters were administered for symptoms of constipation and, with more questionable effectiveness, stomach aches and other illnesses.  In his early-modern treatise, ''The Diseases of Women with Child,'' [[François Mauriceau]] records that both midwives and man-midwives commonly administered clysters to labouring mothers just prior to their delivery.

In the 16th century, satirists made physicians a favorite target, resembling Molière's caricature whose prescription for anything was "clyster, bleed, purge," or "purge, bleed, clyster."&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':218&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Thomas More]]'s eldest daughter had fallen sick of the sweating sickness and could not be awakened by doctors. More prayed for her recovery, and then

&lt;blockquote&gt;where incontinent came into his mind, that a glister should be the only way to help her, which when he had told the physicians, they by-and-by confessed, that if there were any hope of health, that it was the very best help indeed, much marvelling of themselves, that they had not afore remembered it.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:William Roper|Roper, William]], [[s:The Life of Sir Thomas More|''The Life of Sir Thomas More'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:A monkey rejects the old style clyster for his new 'clyso-pompe', which he fills with opium and marshmallow Wellcome V0011775.jpg|thumb|19th century satirical cartoon of a monkey rejecting an old style clyster for a new design, filled with marshmallow and opium]]

In the 18th century [[tobacco smoke enema]]s were used to resuscitate drowned people. Tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the Royal Humane Society of London and placed at various points along the Thames.&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /&gt;

Clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[nobility]] of the [[Western world]] up to the 19th century. As medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time, purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of [[ailment]]s, the foremost of which were [[stomach ache]]s and constipation.

[[Molière]], in several of his plays, introduces characters of incompetent [[physician]]s and apothecaries fond of prescribing this remedy, also discussed by Argan, the [[hypochondriac]] patient of ''[[Le Malade Imaginaire]]''. More generally, clysters were a theme in the [[burlesque]] comedies of that time.

According to [[Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]], clysters were so popular at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[France]] that the duchess of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] had her servant give her a clyster in front of the King (her [[modesty]] being preserved by an adequate posture) before going to the [[comedy]]. However, he also mentions the astonishment of the King and Mme de Maintenon that she should take it before them.

In the 19th century many new types of enema administration equipment were devised, including the bulb enema. Later there came to be a device to allow gravity to infuse the solution into the recipient, consisting of a rubber bag or bucket connected to a hose with a nozzle at the other end to insert into the patient's anus, the bag or bucket being held or hung above the patient. These continue to be used, although rubber has been replaced by modern materials and the bags, at least in hospital use, as disposable.&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /&gt;

In the late 20th century the microenema was invented, this being a disposable squeeze bottle with contents that cause the body to draw water into the colon, e.g., sodium biphosphate (popular in the United States) or glycerin (popular in Japan).

[[Nutrient enema]]s were administered with the intent of providing [[nutrition]] when normal [[eating]] is not possible. Although this treatment is ancient, dating back at least to [[Galen]], and commonly used in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name="pmid20766702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Short AR, Bywaters HW |title = Amino-Acids and Sugars in Rectal Feeding |journal = Br Med J |volume = 1 |issue = 2739 |pages = 1361–7 |date = June 1913 |pmid = 20766702 |pmc = 2299894 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.2739.1361 |jstor = 25302025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and still a common technique in 19th century medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Mackenzie JW |title = The nutrient enema |journal = Arch.

=== Alternative medicine ===

The term "colonic irrigation" is commonly used in [[gastroenterology]] to refer to the practice of introducing water through a colostomy or a surgically constructed conduit as a treatment for constipation.&lt;ref name="pmid11113099"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Locke GR, Pemberton JH, Phillips SF |title = AGA technical review on constipation |journal = Gastroenterology |volume = 119 |issue = 6 |pages = 1766–78 |year = 2000 |pmid = 11113099 |doi = 10.1053/gast.2000.20392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has ruled that colonic irrigation equipment is not approved for sale for the purpose of general well-being&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Subpart F—Therapeutic Devices Sec. 876.5220 Colonic irrigation system |website = Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Food and Drugs, Subchapter H – Medical Devices, Part 876 – Gatroenterology-Urology Devices |date = 1 April 2007 |url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=876.5220 |publisher = FDA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has taken action against many distributors of this equipment, including a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Department of Health and Human Services |title = Warning letter to Dotolo Research Corp |url = http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/prod/1999/dotolo.shtml |format = reprint by Casewatch |date = 21 July 1999 |publisher = FDA |accessdate = 31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kellogg's enemas====

In the late 19th century Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] made sure that the bowel of each and every patient was plied with water, from above and below. His favorite device was an enema machine ("just like one I saw in Germany") that could run fifteen gallons of water through a person's bowel in a matter of seconds. Every water enema was followed by a pint of yogurt—half was eaten, the other half was administered by enema "thus planting the protective germs where they are most needed and may render most effective service." The yogurt served to replace "the intestinal flora" of the bowel, creating what Kellogg claimed was a completely clean intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofquackery.com/amquacks/kellogg.htm |title=Dr. John Harvey Kellogg |author= |date= |website=Great American Quacks |publisher=Museum  of Quackery |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pleasure ====
{{Main|Klismaphilia}}
Enjoyment of enemas is known as [[klismaphilia]], which medically is classified as a [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias.html Paraphilias]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [http://www.psychologytoday.com Psychology Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1973|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference.

Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies, by actually receiving or giving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretense of being constipated).&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; An enema can be an auxiliary to, or even a substitute for, genital [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=J.|date=October 1982|title=Klismaphilia--a physiological perspective|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=36|pages=554–66|issn=0002-9564|pmid=7158678|issue=4|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1982.36.4.554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1976|title=Amplification of the erotic enema deviance|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=30|pages=236–55 | issue=2|pmid=937588|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1976.30.2.236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, enemas can stimulate the [[prostate]] gland.

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]] in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female." H stated, :There still other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample ... enemas, and other anal insertions, ... were employed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred Charles | title = Sexual Behavior in the Human Female | publisher = Indiana University Press | place = Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.A. | year = 1953 | isbn = 978-0-253-33411-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enemas are sometimes used in [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, ''Klismaphilia'':74,77,78,79&lt;/ref&gt; for [[erotic humiliation]]&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':515,516,520&lt;/ref&gt; or for physical discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,517&lt;/ref&gt;
                                  
An enema can be employed prior to anal sexual activities such as [[anal sex]], [[anilingus]], and [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] to enhance sensation or remove feces, possibly reducing risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, ''Klismaphilia'':76&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intoxication ====
{{Main|Alcohol enema}}
Noting that deaths have been reported from [[alcohol poisoning]] via enemas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2007-13.html |title = The Enema Within |accessdate = 11 January 2008 |year = 2008 |publisher = [[Darwin Awards]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[alcohol enema]] can be used to very quickly instill alcohol into the bloodstream, absorbed through the membranes of the colon. However, great care must be taken as to the amount of alcohol used. Only a small amount is needed as the intestine absorbs the alcohol far more quickly than the stomach.

Preceding an enema for administration of drugs or alcohol, a cleansing enema may first be used for cleaning the colon to help increase the rate of absorption.&lt;ref name="pmid6126289"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = de Boer AG, Moolenaar F, de Leede LG, Breimer DD |title = Rectal drug administration: clinical pharmacokinetic considerations |journal = Clin Pharmacokinet |volume = 7 |issue = 4 |pages = 285–311 |year = 1982 |pmid = 6126289 |doi = 10.2165/00003088-198207040-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious rituals ===

Enemas have been used for ritual rectal drug administration such as [[balché]], [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[peyote]], and other [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[entheogen]]s, most notably by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and also some other American [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] tribes. Some tribes continue the practice in the present day.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-084550-3"&gt;{{cite book |author = Diamond, Jared M. |title = The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (P.S.) |publisher = Harper Perennial |location = New York, N.Y |year = 1992 |page = 432 |isbn = 978-0-06-084550-6 |oclc =  |doi = }}; pp. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Called [[Basti (Panchakarma)|Basti]] or Vasti in [[Ayurveda]], enemas are part of [[Panchakarma]] procedure in which [[Herbalism|herbal medicines]] are introduced rectally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chakrapaniayurveda.com/basti/ |title=Basti: Medicated Enema Therapy |author= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punitive usage ===

Enemas have also been forcibly applied as a means of punishment. In the vastly influential Latin American text [[Facundo|''Facundo, or Civilization and Barbarism'']], for example, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] describes the use of [[Chili pepper|pepper]] and [[turpentine]] enemas by police forces as a way of discouraging political dissent in post-independence Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;"Ribbons and Rituals". In Problems in Modern Latin American History. Ed. Chasteen and Wood. Oxford, UK: Scholarly Resources, 2005. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] documented instances of enemas being used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in order to ensure "total control" over detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Rushe |first1 = Dominic |last2 = MacAskill |first2 = Ewen |last3 = Cobain |first3 = Ian |last4 = Yuhas |first4 = Alan |last5 = Laughland |first5 = Oliver |title = Rectal rehydration and waterboarding: the CIA torture report's grisliest findings |url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal |accessdate = 13 March 2015 |agency = [[The Guardian]] |date = 9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Learning''' is an Orthodox Jewish organization designed to reach out to [[secular Judaism|secular]] and non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]s in the hopes of bringing them into the [[Baal teshuva movement]].

==History==
Officially incorporated on November 30, 1983,&lt;ref name=corp/&gt; Etz Chaim is a multi-faceted outreach center dedicated to reaching Jews of all backgrounds to experience [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schifrin, Daniel. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222799315/ For Baltimore, A New Expo-sure: At the Jewish Food &amp; Life Expo, everything from matzoh balls to marriage]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. November 8, 1991. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its programs, Etz Chaim helps people find study partners for the process of [[Jewish conversion|conversion]] to Orthodox Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Schifrin, Daniel. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222861829/ Judaism Begins At Home: For Doris Feinstein Pollock, conversion instructor, the home is where Jews by choice should discover Judaism.]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 26, 1993. p. 38. &lt;/ref&gt; Etz Chaim says that success is when a person considers their [[Jewish identity]] more valuable, when a person chooses not to [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarry]], or when a person does one [[mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Richard.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222836269 Getting The Word Out: Jewish outreach workers recommit themselves to strengthening religious observance]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. May 23, 1997. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992, a [[Lubavitch]] family advertised and held Jewish services, ceremonies, and celebrations in their house in Baltimore County.&lt;ref name=homeashul&gt;Lechtman, Jay. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222829213/ When Is A Home A Shul?] ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. February 14, 1992. p. 26. &lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors complained to the local zoning commission, stating that the family were using their home as a synagogue, in direct violation of local zoning laws, parking laws, and noise restrictions.&lt;ref name=homeashul/&gt; Etz Chaim supported the family, stating that enforcing such laws on a place of worship was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=homeashul/&gt;

In 1992, Etz Chaim supported detailed recommendations regarding Jewish celebrations that restricted [[kiddush]] to only one hot dish, cake, and drinks, while a [[b'nai mitzvah]] or wedding celebration may have up to two hot dishes.&lt;ref name= spending&gt;Eisenstadt, Merrie M. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222826957/ Scaling Down Spending Is An Uphill Battle]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 27, 1992. p. 23.  &lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations stated that all religious celebrations be held only at a synagogue itself or a synagogue's facilities.&lt;ref name=spending/&gt;

In 1993, Etz Chaim honored Marc Hurwitz for his working helping college students discover or maintain their Jewish identities and fighting [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, Alan H. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222862550/ Marc Of An Activist: From singles to college students to world Jewry, no cause eludes the self-effacing Marc Hurwitz]".  ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. June 25, 1993. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Etz Chaim moved its headquarters from Northeast Baltimore to [[downtown Baltimore|Center City Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Faygie.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/227253081/ City Addition: Jewish outreach center makes a move downtown]". ''Jewish Exponent'' (Philadelphia_. November 12, 1998. p. 13. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a bill was proposed to prohibiting discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] with regard to public accommodations, housing, and employment in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mlis.state.md.us/2001rs/billfile/SB0205.htm Senate Bill 205]". ''State of Maryland''. April 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Etz Chaim opposed the bill, stating that Orthodox Judaism opposes [[Homosexuality and Judaism|homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Walike, Deborah. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222804961/ Pride and Petition: Some Orthodox Jews join Christian conservatives in opposing Maryland's new protections for homosexuals]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. July 6, 2001. p. 12. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a choir of 61 mixed-gender students in third through fifth grades prepared to sing at a Jewish food and life expo. When Etz Chaim was asked whether it was religiously appropriate for female and male children to sing together, Etz Chaim determined the performance should not go forward.&lt;ref&gt;Harac, Lani. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222805115/ Sounds Of Silence: A coed children's choir performance at an upcoming Jewish gathering was canceled due to Jewish legal concerns]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. December 14, 2001. p. 16. &lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2002, a fire destroyed the Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Phil; Rubin, Neil. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222817466/ Unextinguished Spirit: After a suspicious fire, Etz Chaim Center staffers and students regroup and push on]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. February 8, 2002. p. 10. &lt;/ref&gt; A teenager was arrested and charged with arson.&lt;ref&gt;Harac, Lani. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222798669/ Teen Arrested]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. February 22, 2002. p. 14. &lt;/ref&gt; With money from its insurance carrier and several donors, Etz Chaim was able to rebuild.&lt;ref&gt;Buckelew, Karen.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222788733/ New Start; Etz Chaim prepares to rebuild its Upper Park Heights headquarters]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 05, 2004. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The new, larger facility included a [[Shabbaton]] center,  coffee shop, and library,&lt;ref name= reinventing&gt;Jacobs, Phil.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222821807/ Reinventing Etz Chaim; Outreach organization emerges from the ashes of 2002 fire]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. October 15, 2004. p. 53. &lt;/ref&gt; and it was dedicated in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Phil. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222801548/ Etz Chaim Dedication]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times'' June 24, 2005. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

June 24, 2005. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Rabbi Porter graduated from [[Ner Israel Rabbinical College]].&lt;ref&gt;Somerville, Frank P. L.

'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM'''), also known as '''female genital cutting''' and '''female circumcision''',{{efn|[[Martha Nussbaum]] (''Sex and Social Justice'', 1999): "Although discussions sometimes use the terms 'female circumcision' and 'clitoridectomy', 'female genital mutilation' (FGM) is the standard generic term for all these procedures in the medical literature&amp;nbsp;... The term 'female circumcision' has been rejected by international medical practitioners because it suggests the fallacious analogy to male circumcision&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=119}}}} is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the [[external female genitalia]]. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. [[UNICEF]] estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt;

Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;For the circumcisers and blade: [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 2, 44–46; for the ages: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures differ according to the country or [[ethnic group]]. They include removal of the [[clitoral hood]] and [[clitoral glans]]; removal of the [[Labia minora|inner labia]]; and removal of the inner and [[Labia majora|outer labia]] and closure of the [[vulva]]. In this last procedure, known as [[#Type III|infibulation]], a small hole is left for the passage of urine and [[Menstruation|menstrual fluid]]; the [[vagina]] is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}

The practice is rooted in [[gender inequality]], attempts to control [[human female sexuality|women's sexuality]], and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour and fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 15; {{harvnb|Toubia|Sharief|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse health effects depend on the type of procedure; they can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, [[chronic pain]], the development of [[cyst]]s, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} There are no known health benefits.&lt;ref name=WHO2018health&gt;[[#WHO2018|WHO 2018]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon FGM, and it has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, although the laws are poorly enforced. Since 2010 the [[United Nations]] has called upon healthcare providers to stop performing all forms of the procedure, including [[#reinfibulation|reinfibulation]] after childbirth and symbolic "nicking" of the clitoral hood.&lt;ref name=UN2010Askew&gt;[[#UN2010|UN 2010]]; {{harvnb|Askew|Chaiban|Kalasa|Sen|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition to the practice is not without its critics, particularly among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], who have raised difficult questions about [[cultural relativism]] and the universality of [[human rights]].{{sfn|Shell-Duncan|2008}}

==Terminology==
[[File:Samburu female circumcision ceremony, Kenya.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|[[Samburu people|Samburu]] FGM ceremony, [[Laikipia County|Laikipia]] plateau, Kenya, 2004]]

Until the 1980s FGM was widely known in English as female circumcision, implying an equivalence in severity with [[male circumcision]].{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=119}} From 1929 the [[National Council of Churches of Kenya|Kenya Missionary Council]] referred to it as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of [[Marion Stevenson|Marion Scott Stevenson]], a [[Church of Scotland]] missionary.{{sfn|Karanja|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA93 93], n.&amp;nbsp;631}} References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term ''female genital mutilation'' in the title of a paper in ''American Ethnologist'',{{sfn|Hayes|1975}} and four years later [[Fran Hosken]], an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females''.{{sfn|Hosken|1994}} The [[Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children]] began referring to it as female genital mutilation in 1990, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) followed suit in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other English terms include ''female genital cutting'' (FGC) and ''female genital mutilation/cutting'' (FGM/C), preferred by those who work with practitioners.&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22/&gt;

In countries where FGM is common, the practice's many variants are reflected in dozens of terms, often alluding to purification.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bambara language]], spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as ''bolokoli'' ("washing your hands"){{sfn|Zabus|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} and in the [[Igbo language]] in eastern Nigeria as ''isa aru'' or ''iwu aru'' ("having your bath").{{efn|For example, "a young woman must 'have her bath' before she has a baby".{{sfn|Zabus|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NCJiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40 40]}}}} A common [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for purification has the root ''t-h-r'', used for male and female circumcision (''tahur'' and ''tahara'').{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}} It is also known in Arabic as ''khafḍ'' or ''khifaḍ''.{{sfn|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=3–5}} Communities may refer to FGM as "pharaonic" for [[infibulation]] and ''[[Sunnah|sunna]]'' circumcision for everything else.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=2–3}} ''Sunna'' means "path or way" in Arabic and refers to the tradition of [[Muhammad]], although none of the procedures are required within Islam.{{sfn|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=3–5}} The term ''infibulation'' derives from [[Fibula (brooch)|''fibula'']], Latin for clasp; the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] reportedly fastened clasps through the foreskins or labia of slaves to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical infibulation of women came to be known as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, and as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt.{{sfn|Kouba|Muasher|1985|loc=96–97}} In Somalia it is known simply as ''qodob'' ("to sew up").{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA190 190]}}

The procedures are generally performed by a traditional circumciser (cutter or ''exciseuse'') in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The cutter is usually an older woman, but in communities where the male [[Barber#History|barber]] has assumed the role of health worker he will perform FGM too.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 42–44 and table 5, 181 (for cutters), 46 (for home and anaesthesia).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|UNICEF 2005: "The large majority of girls and women are cut by a traditional practitioner, a category which includes local specialists (cutters or ''exciseuses''), traditional birth attendants and, generally, older members of the community, usually women.

==Classification{{anchor|classification}}==
===Variation===
The WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA issued a joint statement in 1997 defining FGM as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons".&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22/&gt; The procedures vary considerably according to ethnicity and individual practitioners. During a 1998 survey in Niger, women responded with over 50 different terms when asked what was done to them.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt; Translation problems are compounded by the women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=190}} Several studies have suggested that survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction.{{sfn|Jackson|Akweongo|Sakeah|Hodgson|2003}} In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it.{{sfn|Klouman|Manongi|Klepp|2005}} In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.{{sfn|Elmusharaf|Elhadi|Almroth|2006}}

===Types===
[[#Household surveys|Standard questionnaires]] from United Nations bodies ask women whether they or their daughters have undergone the following: (1) cut, no flesh removed (symbolic nicking); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; or (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know.{{efn|UNICEF 2013: "These categories do not fully match the WHO typology. ''Cut, no flesh removed'' describes a practice known as nicking or pricking, which currently is categorized as Type IV. ''Cut, some flesh removed'' corresponds to Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type II (excision) combined. And ''sewn closed'' corresponds to Type III, infibulation."&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt;}} The most common procedures fall within the "cut, some flesh removed" category and involve complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=189}}; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (a UN agency) created a more detailed typology: Types I–III vary in how much tissue is removed; Type III is equivalent to the UNICEF category "sewn closed"; and Type IV describes miscellaneous procedures, including symbolic nicking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4, 23–28; {{harvnb|Abdulcadir|Catania|Hindin|Say|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FGC Types.svg|right|250px|alt=diagram]]
{{anchor|Type I}}'''Type I''' is "partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce". Type Ia{{efn|One WHO report refers to Type 1a as ''circumcision''.&lt;ref name=WHO2016types&gt;[[#WHO2016|WHO 2016]], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368486/box/ch1.box1 Box 1.1 "Types of FGM"].&lt;/ref&gt;}} involves removal of the [[clitoral hood]] only. This is rarely performed alone.{{efn|WHO (2018): Type 1&amp;nbsp;... the partial or total removal of the clitoris&amp;nbsp;... and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris)."&lt;ref name=WHO2018health/&gt;{{pb}}
WHO (2008): "[There is a] common tendency to describe Type I as removal of the prepuce, whereas this has not been documented as a traditional form of female genital mutilation. However, in some countries, medicalized female genital mutilation can include removal of the prepuce only (Type Ia) (Thabet and Thabet, 2003), but this form appears to be relatively rare (Satti et al., 2006). Almost all known forms of female genital mutilation that remove tissue from the clitoris also cut all or part of the clitoral glans itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 25. Also see {{harvnb|Toubia|1994}} and {{harvnb|Horowitz|Jackson|Teklemariam|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The more common procedure is Type Ib ([[clitoridectomy]]), the complete or partial removal of the [[clitoral glans]] (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her thumb and index finger and cuts it off.{{efn|Susan Izett and [[Nahid Toubia]] (WHO, 1998): "[T]he clitoris is held between the thumb and index finger, pulled out and amputated with one stroke of a sharp object."&lt;ref name=WHO1998&gt;[[#WHO1998|WHO 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{anchor|Type II}}'''Type II''' (excision) is the complete or partial removal of the [[Labia minora|inner labia]], with or without removal of the clitoral glans and [[Labia majora|outer labia]]. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner and outer labia. ''Excision'' in French can refer to any form of FGM.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

{{anchor|Type III}}'''Type III''' ([[infibulation]] or pharaonic circumcision), the "sewn closed" category, involves the removal of the external genitalia and fusion of the wound. The inner and/or outer labia are cut away, with or without removal of the clitoral glans.{{efn|WHO 2014: "Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation).{{pb}}"Type IIIa, removal and apposition of the labia minora; Type IIIb, removal and apposition of the labia majora."&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;}} Type III is found largely in northeast Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan (although not in South Sudan). According to one 2008 estimate, over eight million women in Africa are living with Type III FGM.{{efn|USAID 2008: "Infibulation is practiced largely in countries located in northeastern Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.&amp;nbsp;... Sudan alone accounts for about 3.5 million of the women.&amp;nbsp;... [T]he estimate of the total number of women infibulated in [Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea, northern Sudan, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Tanzania, for women 15–49 years old] comes to 8,245,449, or just over eight million women."{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=13–14}}}} According to UNFPA in 2010, 20 percent of women with FGM have been infibulated.&lt;ref name=UNFPATypeIIIestimate&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/promoting-gender-equality "Frequently Asked Questions on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting"], United Nations Population Fund, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In Somalia "[t]he child is made to squat on a stool or mat facing the circumciser at a height that offers her a good view of the parts to be handled.&amp;nbsp;... adult helpers grab and pull apart the legs of the girl.&amp;nbsp;... If available, this is the stage at which a local anaesthetic would be used":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The element of speed and surprise is vital and the circumciser immediately grabs the clitoris by pinching it between her nails aiming to amputate it with a slash. The organ is then shown to the senior female relatives of the child who will decide whether the amount that has been removed is satisfactory or whether more is to be cut off.

After the clitoris has been satisfactorily amputated&amp;nbsp;... the circumciser can proceed with the total removal of the labia minora and the paring of the inner walls of the labia majora. Since the entire skin on the inner walls of the labia majora has to be removed all the way down to the perineum, this becomes a messy business. By now, the child is screaming, struggling, and bleeding profusely, which makes it difficult for the circumciser to hold with bare fingers and nails the slippery skin and parts that are to be cut or sutured together.&amp;nbsp;...

Having ensured that sufficient tissue has been removed to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the opposite sides of the labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.&lt;ref name=Ismail2016p12&gt;{{harvnb|Ismail|2016|loc=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The vagina is opened for sexual intercourse, for the first time either by a midwife with a knife or by the woman's husband with his penis.{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA190 190–191], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA198 198]}} In some areas, including Somaliland, female relatives of the bride and groom might watch the opening of the vagina to check that the girl is a virgin.{{sfn|Ismail|2016|loc=14}} {{anchor|defibulation|deinfibulation|reinfibulation}} The woman is opened further for childbirth (''defibulation'' or ''deinfibulation''), and closed again afterwards (''reinfibulation''). Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again to restore the pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after childbirth, divorce and widowhood.{{efn|Elizabeth Kelly, Paula J. Adams Hillard (''Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology'', 2005): "Women commonly undergo reinfibulation after a vaginal delivery. In addition to reinfibulation, many women in Sudan undergo a second type of re-suturing called El-Adel, which is performed to recreate the size of the vaginal orifice to be similar to the size created at the time of primary infibulation. Two small cuts are made around the vaginal orifice to expose new tissues to suture, and then sutures are placed to tighten the vaginal orifice and perineum. This procedure, also called re-circumcision, is primarily performed after vaginal delivery, but can also be performed before marriage, after cesarean section, after divorce, and sometimes even in elderly women as a preparation before death."{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491}}}}{{sfn|El Dareer|1982|loc=56–64}} Hanny Lightfoot-Klein interviewed hundreds of women and men in Sudan in the 1980s about sexual intercourse with Type III:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.&amp;nbsp;... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{{harvnb|Lightfoot-Klein|1989|loc=380}}; also see {{harvnb|El Dareer|1982|loc=42–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the age of eight, girls are encouraged to stretch their inner labia using sticks and massage. Girls in Uganda are told they may have difficulty giving birth without stretched labia.{{efn|WHO 2005: "In some areas (e.g. parts of Congo and mainland Tanzania), FGM entails the pulling of the labia minora and/or clitoris over a period of about 2 to 3 weeks. The procedure is initiated by an old woman designated for this task, who puts sticks of a special type in place to hold the stretched genital parts so that they do not revert back to their original size. The girl is instructed to pull her genitalia every day, to stretch them further, and to put additional sticks in to hold the stretched parts from time to time. This pulling procedure is repeated daily for a period of about two weeks, and usually no more than four sticks are used to hold the stretched parts, as further pulling and stretching would make the genital parts unacceptably long."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2005|WHO 2005]], 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;For the countries in which labia stretching is found (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe), see {{harvnb|Nzegwu|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA262 262]}}; for the rest, {{harvnb|Bagnol|Mariano|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA272 272–276] (272 for Uganda)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A definition of FGM from the WHO in 1995 included [[gishiri cutting]] and angurya cutting, found in Nigeria and Niger. These were removed from the WHO's 2008 definition because of insufficient information about prevalence and consequences.&lt;ref name="WHO 2008, 27"/&gt; Angurya cutting is excision of the [[hymen]], usually performed seven days after birth. Gishiri cutting involves cutting the vagina's front or back wall with a blade or penknife, performed in response to infertility, obstructed labour and other conditions. In a study by Nigerian physician Mairo Usman Mandara, over 30 percent of women with gishiri cuts were found to have [[vesicovaginal fistula]]e (holes that allow urine to seep into the vagina).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandara|2000|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA98 98], 100; for fistulae, 102}}; also see {{harvnb|Mandara|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
===Short-term and late===
FGM harms women's physical and emotional health throughout their lives.{{sfn|Berg|Underland|Odgaard-Jensen|Fretheim|2014}}{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=49}} It has no known health benefits.&lt;ref name=WHO2018health/&gt; The short-term and late [[complication (medicine)|complications]] depend on the type of FGM, whether the practitioner has had medical training, and whether they used antibiotics and sterilized or single-use surgical instruments. In the case of Type III, other factors include how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns, and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}

[[File:Anti-FGM campaign, Walala Biyotey, 25 January 2014.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=photograph|FGM awareness session run by the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] at the Walalah Biylooley refugee camp, [[Mogadishu]]]]
Common short-term complications include swelling, excessive bleeding, pain, [[Urinary retention|urine retention]], and healing problems/[[wound infection]]. A 2014 systematic review of 56 studies suggested that over one in ten girls and women undergoing any form of FGM, including symbolic nicking of the clitoris (Type IV), experience immediate complications, although the risks increased with Type III. The review also suggested that there was under-reporting.{{efn|Berg and Underland (Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, 2014): "There was evidence of under-reporting of complications. However, the findings show that the FGM/C procedure unequivocally causes immediate, and typically several, health complications during the FGM/C procedure and the short-term period. Each of the most common complications occurred in more than one of every ten girls and women who undergo FGM/C. The participants in these studies had FGM/C types I through IV, thus immediate complications such as bleeding and swelling occur in setting with all forms of FGM/C. Even FGM/C type I and type IV 'nick', the forms of FGM/C with least anatomical extent, presented immediate complications. The results document that multiple immediate and quite serious complications can result from FGM/C. These results should be viewed in light of long-term complications, such as obstetric and gynecological problems, and protection of human rights."{{sfn|Berg|Underland|2014|loc=2}}}} Other short-term complications include fatal bleeding, [[anaemia]], [[urinary infection]], [[septicaemia]], [[tetanus]], [[gangrene]], [[necrotizing fasciitis]] (flesh-eating disease), and [[endometritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=49}}; {{harvnb|Iavazzo|Sardi|Gkegkes|2013}}; {{harvnb|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many girls and women die as a result of the practice, because complications may not be recognized or reported. The practitioners' use of shared instruments is thought to aid the transmission of [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]], although no epidemiological studies have shown this.{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}}

Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} They include the formation of scars and [[keloid]]s that lead to [[Stenosis|strictures]] and obstruction, [[epidermoid cyst]]s that may become infected, and [[neuroma]] formation (growth of nerve tissue) involving nerves that supplied the clitoris.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}}{{sfn|Dave|Sethi|Morrone|2011}} An infibulated girl may be left with an opening as small as 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm, which can cause prolonged, drop-by-drop [[urination]], [[dysuria|pain while urinating]], and a feeling of needing to urinate all the time. Urine may collect underneath the scar, leaving the area under the skin constantly wet, which can lead to infection and the formation of small stones. The opening is larger in women who are sexually active or have given birth by vaginal delivery, but the [[urethra]] opening may still be obstructed by scar tissue. [[Vesicovaginal fistula|Vesicovaginal]] or [[rectovaginal fistula]]e can develop (holes that allow urine or faeces to seep into the vagina).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}{{sfn|Rushwan|2013}} This and other damage to the urethra and bladder can lead to infections and incontinence, [[dyspareunia|pain during sexual intercourse]] and [[infertility]].{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}} [[Dysmenorrhea|Painful periods]] are common because of the obstruction to the [[Menstruation|menstrual flow]], and blood can stagnate in the vagina and uterus. Complete obstruction of the vagina can result in [[hematocolpos]] and [[hematometra]] (where the vagina and uterus fill with menstrual blood).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} The swelling of the abdomen that results from the collection of fluid, together with the lack of menstruation, can lead to suspicion of pregnancy; Asma El Dareer, a Sudanese physician, reported in 1979 that a girl in Sudan with this condition was killed by her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|El Dareer|1982|loc=37}}.

===Pregnancy, childbirth===
[[File:Teaching_communities_about_FGM-C_(12345176104).jpg|thumb|Materials used to teach communities in [[Burkina Faso]] about FGM]]
FGM may place women at higher risk of problems during pregnancy and childbirth, which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} Infibulated women may try to make childbirth easier by eating less during pregnancy to reduce the baby's size.&lt;ref name=RashidRashid2007/&gt;{{rp|99}} In women with vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistulae, it is difficult to obtain clear urine samples as part of prenatal care, making the diagnosis of conditions such as [[pre-eclampsia]] harder.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}} Cervical evaluation during labour may be impeded and labour prolonged or obstructed. Third-degree [[laceration]] (tears), [[Human anus|anal-sphincter]] damage and emergency [[caesarean section]] are more common in infibulated women.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}&lt;ref name=RashidRashid2007&gt;{{harvnb|Rashid|Rashid|2007|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|Neonatal mortality]] is increased. The WHO estimated in 2006 that an additional 10–20 babies die per 1,000 deliveries as a result of FGM. The estimate was based on a study conducted on 28,393 women attending delivery wards at 28 obstetric centres in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II, and 55 percent for Type III. The reasons for this were unclear, but may be connected to genital and [[urinary tract infection]]s and the presence of scar tissue. According to the study, FGM was associated with an increased risk to the mother of damage to the [[perineum]] and [[postpartum bleeding|excessive blood loss]], as well as a need to [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitate]] the baby, and [[stillbirth]], perhaps because of a long [[Childbirth#Second stage: fetal expulsion|second stage of labour]].{{sfn|Banks|Meirik|Farley|Akande|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr30/en/index.html "New study shows female genital mutilation exposes women and babies to significant risk at childbirth"], World Health Organization, 2 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects, sexual function===
According to a 2015 [[systematic review]] there is little high-quality information available on the psychological effects of FGM. Several small studies have concluded that women with FGM suffer from anxiety, depression and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}} Feelings of shame and betrayal can develop when women leave the culture that practises FGM and learn that their condition is not the norm, but within the practising culture they may view their FGM with pride, because for them it signifies beauty, respect for tradition, chastity and hygiene.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} Studies on sexual function have also been small.{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}} A 2013 [[meta-analysis]] of 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries concluded that women with FGM were twice as likely to report no sexual desire and 52 percent more likely to report [[dyspareunia]] (painful sexual intercourse). One third reported reduced sexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berg|Denison|2013}}; {{harvnb|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=51}}; {{harvnb|Sibiani|Rouzi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
===Household surveys===
[[File:Composite FGM world map.svg|thumb|A composite data map showing the % of women and girls aged 15-49 years (unless otherwise stated) who have undergone FGM/C. Source: UNICEF (2016) and a number of additional studies for countries outside Africa not surveyed by UNICEF. Grey countries' data are not covered.]]

Aid agencies define the prevalence of FGM as the percentage of the 15–49 age group that has experienced it.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=193}} These figures are based on nationally representative household surveys known as [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS), developed by [[ICF International|Macro International]] and funded mainly by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID); and [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] (MICS) conducted with financial and technical help from UNICEF.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=190}} These surveys have been carried out in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere roughly every five years, since 1984 and 1995 respectively.&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm "DHS overview"], Demographic and Health Surveys; [http://www.childinfo.org/mics5_questionnaire.html "Questionnaires and Indicator List"], Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; The first to ask about FGM was the 1989–1990 DHS in northern Sudan. The first publication to estimate FGM prevalence based on DHS data (in seven countries) was written by Dara Carr of Macro International in 1997.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013}}

===Type of FGM===
Questions the women are asked during the surveys include: "Was the genital area just nicked/cut without removing any flesh? Was any flesh (or something) removed from the genital area? Was your genital area sewn?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Most women report "cut, some flesh removed" (Types I and II).&lt;ref name=Yoder2013p189TypeI&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47, table 5.2; {{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Type I is the most common form in Egypt,{{sfn|Rasheed|Abd-Ellah|Yousef|2011}} and in the southern parts of Nigeria.{{sfn|Okeke|Anyaehie|Ezenyeaku|2012|loc=70–73}} Type III (infibulation) is concentrated in northeastern Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=13–14}} In surveys in 2002–2006, 30 percent of cut girls in Djibouti, 38 percent in Eritrea, and 63 percent in Somalia had experienced Type III.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47. For the years and country profiles: [[#UNICEFDjibouti|Djibouti]], UNICEF, December 2013; [[#UNICEFEritrea|Eritrea]], UNICEF, July 2013; [[#UNICEFSomalia|Somalia]], UNICEF, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a high prevalence of infibulation among girls in Niger and Senegal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 it was estimated that in Nigeria three percent of the 0–14 age group had been infibulated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEFNigeria|Nigeria]], UNICEF, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of procedure is often linked to ethnicity. In Eritrea, for example, a survey in 2002 found that all [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]] girls had been infibulated, compared with two percent of the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrinya]], most of whom fell into the "cut, no flesh removed" category.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt;

Prevalence figures for the 15–19 age group and younger show a downward trend.{{efn|UNICEF 2013: "The percentage of girls and women of reproductive age (15 to 49) who have experienced any form of FGM/C is the first indicator used to show how widespread the practice is in a particular country&amp;nbsp;... A second indicator of national prevalence measures the extent of cutting among daughters aged 0 to 14, as reported by their mothers. Prevalence data for girls reflect their current&amp;nbsp;– not final&amp;nbsp;– FGM/C status, since many of them may not have reached the customary age for cutting at the time of the survey. They are reported as being uncut but are still at risk of undergoing the procedure. Statistics for girls under age 15 therefore need to be interpreted with a high degree of caution&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2013, 23"&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{pb}} An additional complication in judging prevalence among girls is that, in countries running campaigns against FGM, women might not report that their daughters have been cut.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 25, 100; {{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} For example, Burkina Faso fell from 89 percent (1980) to 58 percent (2010); Egypt from 97 percent (1985) to 70 percent (2015); and Kenya from 41 percent (1984) to 11 percent (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2016|UNICEF 2016]], 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2010, household surveys asked women about the FGM status of all their living daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=194}}; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest concentrations among girls aged 0–14 were in Gambia (56 percent), Mauritania (54 percent), Indonesia (49 percent for 0–11) and Guinea (46 percent).&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; The figures suggest that a girl was one third less likely in 2014 to undergo FGM than she was 30 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2014|UNICEF 2014]], 2.&lt;/ref&gt; If the rate of decline continues, the number of girls cut will nevertheless rise, because of population growth, from 3.6 million a year in 2013 to 4.1 million in 2050.{{efn|UNICEF 2014: "If there is no reduction in the practice between now and 2050, the number of girls cut each year will grow from 3.6 million in 2013 to 6.6 million in 2050.

If nothing is done, the number of girls and women affected will grow from 133 million today to 325 million in 2050.

According to a 2018 study published in the British Medical Journal there has been a large decline in number of FGM cases among the 0-14 year old in Africa in the 1990-2017 period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/07/fgm-rates-in-east-africa-drop-20-years-study-shows FGM rates in east Africa drop from 71% to 8% in 20 years, study shows] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000549 Secular trends in the prevalence of female genital mutilation/cutting among girls: a systematic analysis] British Medical Journal, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural areas, wealth, education===
Surveys have found FGM to be more common in rural areas, less common in most countries among girls from the wealthiest homes, and (except in Sudan and Somalia) less common in girls whose mothers had access to primary or secondary/higher education. In Somalia and Sudan the situation was reversed: in Somalia the mothers' access to secondary/higher education was accompanied by a rise in prevalence of FGM in their daughters, and in Sudan access to any education was accompanied by a rise.&lt;ref&gt;For rural areas, [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 28; for wealth, 40; for education, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age, ethnicity===
FGM is not invariably a [[rite of passage]] between childhood and adulthood, but is often performed on much younger children.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=275}} Girls are most commonly cut shortly after birth to age 15. In half the countries for which national figures were available in 2000–2010, most girls had been cut by age five.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p50&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut before the age of five in Nigeria, Mali, Eritrea, Ghana and Mauritania.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 Demographic and Health Survey in Yemen found that 76 percent of girls had been cut within two weeks of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf UNICEF 2005], 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage is reversed in Somalia, Egypt, Chad and the Central African Republic, where over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut between five and 14.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183/&gt; Just as the type of FGM is often linked to ethnicity, so is the mean age. In Kenya, for example, the [[Kisi people|Kisi]] cut around age 10 and the [[Kamba people|Kamba]] at 16.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A country's national prevalence often reflects a high sub-national prevalence among certain ethnicities, rather than a widespread practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iraq, for example, FGM is found mostly among the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] in [[Erbil]] (58 percent prevalence within age group 15–49, as of 2011), [[Sulaymaniyah]] (54 percent) and [[Kirkuk]] (20 percent), giving the country a national prevalence of eight percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013]. For eight percent in Iraq, 27, box&amp;nbsp;4.4, group&amp;nbsp;5; for the regions in Iraq, 31, map&amp;nbsp;4.6). Also see {{harvnb|Yasin|Al-Tawil|Shabila|Al-Hadithi|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is sometimes an ethnic marker, but it may differ along national lines. For example, in the northeastern regions of Ethiopia and Kenya, which share a border with Somalia, the [[Somali people]] practise FGM at around the same rate as they do in Somalia.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=196, 198}} But in Guinea all [[Fula people|Fulani]] women responding to a survey in 2012 said they had experienced FGM,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220043131/http://data.unicef.org/corecode/uploads/document6/uploaded_country_profiles/corecode/30/Countries/FGMC_GIN.pdf "Guinea"] (2012), UNICEF statistical profile, July 2014, 2/4.&lt;/ref&gt; against 12 percent of the Fulani in Chad, while in Nigeria the Fulani are the only large ethnic group in the country not to practise it.&lt;ref&gt;Chad: [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 35–36; Nigeria: {{harvnb|Okeke|Anyaehie|Ezenyeaku|2012|loc=70–73}}. FGM is practised in Nigeria by the Yoruba, Hausa, Ibo, Ijaw and Kanuri people.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the "three feminine sorrows": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again.{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA187 187]}} Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM.{{sfn|Khazan|2015}}{{sfn|Shell-Duncan|2008}} Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after the grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.{{sfn|Hayes|1975|loc=620, 624}} [[Gerry Mackie]] has compared the practice to [[footbinding]]. Like FGM, footbinding was carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity and appropriate marriage, and "supported and transmitted" by women.{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "Footbinding and infibulation correspond as follows. Both customs are nearly universal where practised; they are persistent and are practised even by those who oppose them. Both control sexual access to females and ensure female chastity and fidelity. Both are necessary for proper marriage and family honor. Both are believed to be sanctioned by tradition. Both are said to be ethnic markers, and distinct ethnic minorities may lack the practices. Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility. Both are defined as aesthetically pleasing compared with the natural alternative. Both are said to properly exaggerate the complementarity of the sexes, and both are claimed to make intercourse more pleasurable for the male."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=999–1000}}}}

FGM practitioners see the procedures as marking not only ethnic boundaries but also gender difference. According to this view, male circumcision defeminizes men while FGM demasculinizes women.&lt;ref&gt;Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf, "Introduction: The Custom in Question", in Abusharaf 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA8 8].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA36 36–37]}} [[Fuambai Ahmadu]], an anthropologist and member of the [[Kono people]] of Sierra Leone, who in 1992 underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a [[Sande society]] initiation, argued in 2000 that it is a male-centred assumption that the clitoris is important to female sexuality. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.&lt;ref name=Ahmadu2000&gt;[[Fuambai Ahmadu]], "Rites and Wrongs: An Insider/Outsider Reflects on Power and Excision," in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA284 284–285].&lt;/ref&gt; Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. "[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny," [[Janice Boddy]] wrote in 2007. "The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}; also see {{harvnb|Boddy|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&amp;pg=PA52 52–61]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In communities where infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=435–436}} Some men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=437}}; {{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local preference for [[dry sex]] causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and [[Vicks VapoRub|Vicks menthol rub]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnol and Mariano 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA277 277–281].&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=437}}

Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 17.4 percent of women opposed FGM (558 out of 3,210), and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.{{sfn|El Dareer|1983|loc=140}} Attitudes are changing slowly. In Sudan in 2010, 42 percent of women who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 178.&lt;/ref&gt; In several surveys since 2006, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq and Yemen most said it should end, although in several countries only by a narrow margin.{{efn|"The highest levels of support can be found in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt, where more than half the female population think the practice should continue."&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 52. Also see figure 6.1, 54, and figures 8.1A&amp;nbsp;– 8.1D, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Social obligation, poor access to information===
[[File:Keur Simbara, Senegal (8592417042), cropped.jpg|thumb|upright-1.2|alt=photograph|Keur Simbara, Senegal, abandoned FGM in 1998 after a three-year program by [[Tostan]].&lt;ref&gt;Malick Gueye, [http://www.tostan.org/blog/social-norm-change-theorists-meet-again-keur-simbara-senegal "Social Norm Change Theorists meet again in Keur Simbara, Senegal"], Tostan, 4 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Against the argument that women willingly choose FGM for their daughters, UNICEF calls the practice a "self-enforcing social convention" to which families feel they must conform to avoid uncut daughters facing social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen Gruenbaum]] reported that, in Sudan in the 1970s, cut girls from an Arab ethnic group would mock uncut [[Zarma people|Zabarma]] girls with ''Ya, Ghalfa!'' ("Hey, unclean!"). The Zabarma girls would respond ''Ya, mutmura!'' (A ''mutmara'' was a storage pit for grain that was continually opened and closed, like an infibulated woman.) But despite throwing the insult back, the Zabarma girls would ask their mothers, "What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?"{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=432–433}}

Because of poor access to information, and because circumcisers downplay the causal connection, women may not associate the health consequences with the procedure. Lala Baldé, president of a women's association in Medina Cherif, a village in Senegal, told Mackie in 1998 that when girls fell ill or died, it was attributed to evil spirits. When informed of the causal relationship between FGM and ill health, Mackie wrote, the women broke down and wept. He argued that surveys taken before and after this sharing of information would show very different levels of support for FGM.{{sfn|Mackie|2003|loc=147–148}} The American non-profit group [[Tostan]], founded by [[Molly Melching]] in 1991, introduced community-empowerment programs in several countries that focus on local democracy, literacy, and education about healthcare, giving women the tools to make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diop2008|Diop et al. (UNICEF) 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, using the Tostan program, [[Malicounda Bambara]] in Senegal became the first village to abandon FGM.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=256ff}} By 2018 over 8,000 communities in eight countries had pledged to abandon FGM and [[child marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tostan.org/female-genital-cutting "Female Genital Cutting"], Tostan, accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{further|Religious views on female genital mutilation}}
Surveys have shown a widespread belief, particularly in Mali, Mauritania, Guinea and Egypt, that FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gruenbaum has argued that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, making it difficult to interpret the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}; [[#MackieLeJeune2008|Mackie and LeJeune (UNICEF) 2008]], 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; FGM's origins in northeastern Africa are pre-Islamic, but the practice became associated with Islam because of that religion's focus on female chastity and seclusion.{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "FGM is pre-Islamic but was exaggerated by its intersection with the Islamic modesty code of family honor, female purity, virginity, chastity, fidelity, and seclusion."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1008}}}} There is no mention of it in the [[Quran]].{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1004–1005}} It is praised in a few [[Hadith terminology|''daʻīf'']] (weak) ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roald|2003|loc=224}}; {{harvnb|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=6–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "The Koran is silent on FGM, but several ''hadith'' (sayings attributed to Mohammed) recommend attenuating the practice for the woman's sake, praise it as noble but not commanded, or advise that female converts refrain from mutilation because even if pleasing to the husband it is painful to the wife."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1004–1005}}}} although it is regarded as obligatory by the [[Shafi'i]] version of [[Sunni Islam]].{{sfn|Roald|2003|loc=243}} In 2007 the [[Al-Azhar University#Council of Senior Scholars|Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research]] in Cairo ruled that FGM had "no basis in core Islamic law or any of its partial provisions".&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEFpress2July2007|UNICEF press release]], 2 July 2007; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Maggie Michael, Associated Press, 2007: "[Egypt's] supreme religious authorities stressed that Islam is against female circumcision.

There is no mention of FGM in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Waje Kunhiyop, ''African Christian Ethics'', Zondervan, 2008, 297: "Nowhere in all of Scripture or in any of recorded church history is there even a hint that women were to be circumcised."&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionaries in Africa were [[#Colonial opposition in Kenya|among the first]] to object to FGM,{{sfn|Murray|1976}} but Christian communities in Africa do practise it. A 2013 UNICEF report identified 17 African countries in which at least 10 percent of Christian women and girls aged 15 to 49 had undergone FGM; in Niger 55 percent of Christian women and girls had experienced it, compared with two percent of their Muslim counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], front page and 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The only Jewish group known to have practised it are the [[Beta Israel]] of Ethiopia.

The practice's origins are unknown. Gerry Mackie has suggested that, because FGM's east-west, north-south distribution in Africa meets in Sudan, infibulation may have begun there with the [[Meroë|Meroite civilization]] (c.&amp;nbsp;800 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;350 CE), before the rise of Islam, to increase confidence in paternity.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=264, 267}}&lt;ref&gt;Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA13 13]{{{pb}}

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;a-m-a:X1-D53-B1&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The spell was found on the [[sarcophagus]] of Sit-hedjhotep, now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], and dates to Egypt's [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=330}}{{efn|Knight adds that Egyptologists are uncomfortable with the translation to ''uncircumcised'', because there is no information about what constituted the circumcised state.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=330}}}} (Paul F.

The examination of [[Mummy|mummies]] has shown no evidence of FGM. Citing the Australian pathologist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], who examined hundreds of mummies in the early 20th century, Knight writes that the genital area may resemble Type III because during mummification the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to cover the [[pudendal cleft]], possibly to prevent sexual violation. It was similarly not possible to determine whether Types I or II had been performed, because soft tissues had deteriorated or been removed by the embalmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2001|loc=331}}, citing G. Elliot Smith, ''A Contribution to the Study of Mummification in Egypt'', Cairo: L'Institut Egyptien, 1906, 30, and [[Marc Armand Ruffer]], ''Studies in the Paleopathology of Egypt'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1921, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (c. 64 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. 23 CE) wrote about FGM after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE: "This is one of the customs most zealously pursued by them [the Egyptians]: to raise every child that is born and to circumcise [''peritemnein''] the males and excise [''ektemnein''] the females&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;BCE, cited in {{harvnb|Knight|2001|loc=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;BCE: "One of the customs most zealously observed among the Aegyptians is this, that they rear every child that is born, and circumcise [περιτέμνειν, ''peritemnein''] the males, and excise [''ektemnein''] the females, as is also customary among the Jews, who are also Aegyptians in origin, as I have already stated in my account of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17B*.html#ref273 Book VII, chapter 2], 17.2.5. (Cohen 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PmL-LogqJ-YC&amp;pg=PA59 59ff], argues that Strabo conflated the Jews with the Egyptians).&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}
[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16D*.html Book XVI, chapter 4], 16.4.9: "And then to the Harbour of Antiphilus, and, above this, to the Creophagi [meat-eaters], of whom the males have their sexual glands mutilated [''kolobos''] and the women are excised [''ektemnein''] in the Jewish fashion."}}{{efn|Knight 2001 writes that there is one extant reference from antiquity, from [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus of Lydia]] in the fifth century BCE, that may allude to FGM outside Egypt. Xanthus wrote, in a history of [[Lydia]]: "The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to 'castrate' their women." Knight argues that the "castration", which is not described, may have kept women youthful, in the sense of allowing the Lydian king to have intercourse with them without pregnancy. Knight concludes that it may have been a reference to sterilization, not FGM.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=326}}}} [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 50 CE) also made reference to it: "the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow."{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=333}} It is mentioned briefly in a work attributed to the Greek physician [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;200 CE): "When [the clitoris] sticks out to a great extent in their young women, Egyptians consider it appropriate to cut it out."{{efn|Knight adds that the attribution to Galen is suspect.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=336}}}} Another Greek physician, [[Aëtius of Amida]] (mid-5th to mid-6th century CE), offered more detail in book 16 of his ''Sixteen Books on Medicine'', citing the physician Philomenes. The procedure was performed in case the clitoris, or ''nymphê'', grew too large or triggered sexual desire when rubbing against clothing. "On this account, it seemed proper to the Egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged," Aëtius wrote, "especially at that time when the girls were about to be married":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The surgery is performed in this way: Have the girl sit on a chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girl's thighs. Have him separate and steady her legs and whole body. Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.

It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, about the size of the membrane that's between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.{{efn|A paragraph break has been added for ease of reading.}}{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=327–328}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The genital area was then cleaned with a sponge, [[frankincense]] powder and wine or cold water, and wrapped in linen bandages dipped in vinegar, until the seventh day when [[calamine]], rose petals, date pits or a "genital powder made from baked clay" might be applied.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=328}}

Whatever the practice's origins, infibulation became linked to slavery. Mackie cites the Portuguese missionary [[João dos Santos]], who in 1609 wrote of a group near Mogadishu who had a "custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them". Thus, Mackie argues, a "practice associated with shameful female slavery came to stand for honor".{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1003, 1009}}

[[Isaac Baker Brown]], an English gynaecologist, president of the [[Medical Society of London]] and co-founder in 1845 of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St. Mary's Hospital]], believed that masturbation, or "unnatural irritation" of the clitoris, caused [[female hysteria|hysteria]], spinal irritation, fits, idiocy, mania and death.{{sfn|Elchalal|Ben-Ami|Gillis|Brzezinski|1997}}&lt;ref name=Allen2000p106&gt;[[Peter Lewis Allen]], ''The Wages of Sin: Sex and Disease, Past and Present'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpQOUx5zoBEC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore "set to work to remove the clitoris whenever he had the opportunity of doing so", according to his obituary.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Protestant missionaries in [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]] (present-day Kenya) began campaigning against FGM in the early 20th century, when Dr. [[John Arthur]] joined the [[Church of Scotland]] Mission (CSM) in Kikuyu. An important ethnic marker, the practice was known by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the country's main ethnic group, as ''irua'' for both girls and boys. It involved excision (Type II) for girls and removal of the foreskin for boys. Unexcised Kikuyu women (''irugu'') were outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn M. Thomas,{{" '}}Ngaitana (I will circumcise myself)': Lessons from Colonial Campaigns to Ban Excision in Meru, Kenya" in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA132 132].{{pb}}
For ''irua'', Jomo Kenyatta, ''Facing Mount Kenya'', New York: Vintage Books, 1962 [1938], 129; for ''irugu'' being outcasts, Kenyatta, 127, and {{harvnb|Zabus|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&amp;pg=PA48 48–49]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jomo Kenyatta]], general secretary of the [[Kikuyu Central Association]] and later Kenya's first prime minister, wrote in 1938 that, for the Kikuyu, the institution of FGM was the "''[[Sine qua non|conditio sine qua non]]'' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality". No proper Kikuyu man or woman would marry or have sexual relations with someone who was not circumcised. A woman's responsibilities toward the tribe began with her initiation. Her age and place within tribal history was traced to that day, and the group of girls with whom she was cut was named according to current events, an [[oral tradition]] that allowed the Kikuyu to track people and events going back hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyatta 1962 [1938], 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the CSM mission in 1925, several missionary churches declared that FGM was prohibited for African Christians. The CSM announced that Africans practising it would be excommunicated, which resulted in hundreds leaving or being expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Fiedler, ''Christianity and African Culture'', Leiden: Brill, 1996, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The stand-off turned FGM into a focal point of the Kenyan independence movement; the 1929–1931 period is known in the country's historiography as the female circumcision controversy.{{sfn|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA241 241–245]}}&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hyam, ''Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1990; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1594780 Murray 1976], 92–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council began referring to FGM as the "sexual mutilation of women", rather than circumcision, and a person's stance toward the practice became a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or to the Kikuyu Central Association.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2000, 132; for the "sexual mutilation of women", Karanja 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA93 93], n.&amp;nbsp;631.{{pb}}

In 1956 the council of male elders (the ''Njuri Nchecke'') in Meru announced a ban on FGM. Over the next three years, thousands of girls cut each other's genitals with razor blades as a symbol of defiance. The movement came to be known as ''Ngaitana'' ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA129 129–131] (131 for the girls as "central actors"); Lynn Thomas, ''Politics of the Womb: Women, Reproduction, and the State in Kenya'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, 89–91.{{pb}}

===Growth of opposition===
{{FGM opposition timeline}}
The first known non-colonial campaign against FGM began in Egypt in the 1920s, when the Egyptian Doctors' Society called for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 10, calls the Egyptian Doctors' Society opposition the "first known campaign" against FGM.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a parallel campaign in Sudan, run by religious leaders and British women. Infibulation was banned there in 1946, but the law was unpopular and barely enforced.{{sfn|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA202 202], 299}}{{efn|FGM is still practised in Sudan. Some states banned it in 2008–2009, but {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, there was no national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 2, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Egyptian government banned infibulation in state-run hospitals in 1959, but allowed partial clitoridectomy if parents requested it.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Heger Boyle, ''Female Genital Cutting: Cultural Conflict in the Global Community'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002, 92, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; (Egypt banned FGM entirely in 2007.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not know what they had cut off from my body, and I did not try to find out. I just wept, and called out to my mother for help. But the worst shock of all was when I looked around and found her standing by my side. Yes, it was her, I could not be mistaken, in flesh and blood, right in the midst of these strangers, talking to them and smiling at them, as though they had not participated in slaughtering her daughter just a few moments ago.&lt;ref&gt;Nawal El Saadawi, ''The Hidden Face of Eve'', London: Zed Books, 2007 [1980], [https://books.google.com/books?id=u5n9zUZuVI8C&amp;pg=PA14 14].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American social scientist, became the first female academic to publish a detailed account of FGM, aided by her ability to discuss it directly with women in Sudan. Her article in ''American Ethnologist'' called it "female genital mutilation", rather than female circumcision, and brought it to wider academic attention.{{sfn|Hayes|1975|loc=21}} [[Edna Adan Ismail]], who worked at the time for the Somalia Ministry of Health, discussed the health consequences of FGM in 1977 with the [[Somali Women's Democratic Organization]].{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA201 201]}}&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Topping, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/somaliland-womens-rights-gender-violence "Somaliland's leading lady for women's rights: 'It is time for men to step up'"], ''The Guardian'', 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later [[Fran Hosken]], an Austria-American feminist, published ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'' (1979),{{sfn|Hosken|1994}} the first to offer global figures. She estimated that 110,529,000 women in 20 African countries had experienced FGM.{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=2}} The figures were speculative but consistent with later surveys.{{sfn|Mackie|2003|loc=139}} Describing FGM as a "training ground for male violence", Hosken accused female practitioners of "participating in the destruction of their own kind".{{sfn|Hosken|1994|loc=5}} The language caused a rift between Western and African feminists; African women boycotted a session featuring Hosken during the UN's Mid-Decade Conference on Women in Copenhagen in July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle 2002, 47; Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the WHO held a seminar, "Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children", in Khartoum, Sudan, and in 1981, also in Khartoum, 150 academics and activists signed a pledge to fight FGM after a workshop held by the [[Babikir Badri|Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies]] (BBSAWS), "Female Circumcision Mutilates and Endangers Women&amp;nbsp;– Combat it!" Another BBSAWS workshop in 1984 invited the international community to write a joint statement for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Shahira Ahmed, "Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies", in Abusharaf 2007, 176–180.&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended that the "goal of all African women" should be the eradication of FGM and that, to sever the link between FGM and religion, clitoridectomy should no longer be referred to as ''sunna''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed 2007, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, founded in 1984 in Dakar, Senegal, called for an end to the practice, as did the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna in 1993. The conference listed FGM as a form of [[violence against women]], marking it as a human-rights violation, rather than a medical issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anika Rahman]] and [[Nahid Toubia]], ''Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Laws and Policies Worldwide'', New York: Zed Books, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kEG6GaudxQEC&amp;pg=PA110 10–11]; for Vienna, [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s and 2000s governments in Africa and the Middle East passed legislation banning or restricting FGM. In 2003 the [[African Union]] ratified the [[Maputo Protocol]] on the rights of women, which supported the elimination of FGM.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Bonino, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/opinion/15iht-edbonino_ed3_.html "A brutal custom: Join forces to banish the mutilation of women"], ''The New York Times'', 15 September 2004; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110409114818/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/Text/Protocol%20on%20the%20Rights%20of%20Women.pdf Maputo Protocol], 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 laws restricting FGM had been passed in at least 23 of the 27 African countries in which it is concentrated, although several fell short of a ban.{{efn|For example, UNICEF 2013 lists Mauritania as having passed legislation against FGM, but (as of that year) it was banned only from being conducted in government facilities or by medical personnel.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p8&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}The following are countries in which FGM is common and in which restrictions are in place as of 2013.

It took the deaths of two girls in 1982, one of them three months old, for that attitude to change.{{sfn|Gallard|1995|loc=1592}}&lt;ref name=Rowling/&gt; In 1991 a French court ruled that the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] offered protection to FGM victims; the decision followed an asylum application from [[Aminata Diop]], who fled an FGM procedure in Mali.&lt;ref&gt;Jana Meredyth Talton, "Asylum for Genital-Mutilation Fugitives: Building a Precedent", [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]], January/February 1992, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is outlawed by several provisions of France's penal code that address bodily harm causing permanent mutilation or torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/current_situation_and_trends_of_female_genital_mutilation_in_france_en.pdf "Current situation of female genital mutilation in France"], European Institute for Gender Equality, European Union.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowling&gt;Megan Rowling [http://news.trust.org//item/?map=france-reduces-genital-cutting-with-prevention-prosecutions-lawyer/ "France reduces genital cutting with prevention, prosecutions – lawyer"], Thomson Reuters Foundation, 27 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; All children under six who were born in France undergo medical examinations that include inspection of the genitals, and doctors are obliged to report FGM.{{sfn|Kool|Wahedi|2014|loc=3–5}} The first civil suit was in 1982,{{sfn|Gallard|1995|loc=1592}} and the first criminal prosecution in 1993.&lt;ref name=Farnsworth1994/&gt; In 1999 a woman was given an eight-year sentence for having performed FGM on 48 girls.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gollaher]], ''Circumcision: A History of the World's Most Controversial Surgery'', New York: Basic Books, 2000, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 over 100 parents and two practitioners had been prosecuted in over 40 criminal cases.&lt;ref name=Rowling/&gt;{{sfn|Kool|Wahedi|2014|loc=3–5}}

==Criticism of opposition==
===Tolerance versus human rights===
[[File:Obioma Nnaemeka (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=photograph|Academic [[Obioma Nnaemeka]] criticized the renaming of female circumcision to female genital mutilation.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://webrecorder.io/Germinal/wikipedia/20180527025854/https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA34 34]}}]]
Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of [[cultural imperialism|cultural colonialism]], and have been criticized in turn for their [[moral relativism]] and failure to defend the idea of universal [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Silverman|Eric K. Silverman]], "Anthropology and Circumcision," ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 33, 2004 (419–445), 420, 427. {{jstor|25064860}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics of the eradicationist position, the [[Reductionism#In science|biological reductionism]] of the opposition to FGM, and the failure to appreciate FGM's cultural context, serves to "[[Othering|other]]" practitioners and undermine their agency—in particular when parents are referred to as "mutilators".{{sfn|Kirby|2005|loc=83}}

Africans who object to the tone of FGM opposition risk appearing to defend the practice. The feminist theorist [[Obioma Nnaemeka]], herself strongly opposed to FGM, argued in 2005 that renaming the practice ''female genital mutilation'' had introduced "a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging [it]".{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} According to Ugandan law professor [[Sylvia Tamale]], the early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices, including not only FGM but also [[dry sex]], [[polygyny]], [[bride price]] and [[levirate marriage]], required correction. African feminists "take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women", she wrote in 2011.{{sfn|Tamale|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA19 19–20]}} Commentators highlight the voyeurism in the treatment of women's bodies as exhibits. Examples include images of women's vaginas after FGM or girls undergoing the procedure.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA30 30–33]}} The 1996 [[#Pulitzer|Pulitzer-prize-winning photographs]] of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl experiencing FGM were published by 12 American newspapers, without her consent either to be photographed or to have the images published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korieh|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA121 121–122]}}; for the photographs, see {{cite web |title=Stephanie Walsh. The 1996 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Feature Photography |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/works/1996-Feature-Photography |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007101527/http://www.pulitzer.org/works/1996-Feature-Photography |archivedate=7 October 2015 |date=1996|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for women. According to the anthropologist Christine Walley, a common position within anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of [[false consciousness]] participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, [[Mary Daly]] and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein.{{sfn|Walley|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA18 18], 34, 43, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA60 60]}} It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that "a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism".&lt;ref name="Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281"/&gt;

===Comparison with other procedures{{anchor|comparison}}===
====Cosmetic procedures====
{{See also|Labiaplasty#Criticism}}
Nnaemeka argues that the crucial question, broader than FGM, is why the female body is subjected to so much "abuse and indignity", including in the West.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA38 38–39]}} Several authors have drawn a parallel between FGM and cosmetic procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsdotter|Essén|2010|loc=32}}; {{harvnb|Berer|2007|loc=1335}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronán Conroy of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] wrote in 2006 that cosmetic genital procedures were "driving the advance" of FGM by encouraging women to see natural variations as defects.{{sfn|Conroy|2006}} Anthropologist [[Fadwa El Guindi]] compared FGM to [[Breast augmentation|breast enhancement]], in which the maternal function of the breast becomes secondary to men's sexual pleasure.{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} [[Benoîte Groult]], the French feminist, made a similar point in 1975, citing FGM and cosmetic surgery as sexist and patriarchal.{{sfn|Wildenthal|2012|loc=148}} Against this, the medical anthropologist [[Carla Obermeyer]] argued in 1999 that FGM may be conducive to a subject's social well-being in the same way that [[rhinoplasty]] and male circumcision are.&lt;ref&gt;Obermeyer 1999, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 2007 ban in Egypt, Egyptian women wanting FGM for their daughters seek ''amalyet tajmeel'' (cosmetic surgery) to remove what they see as excess genital tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Abdel Rahim, [http://timep.org/commentary/midwives-doctors-searching-safer-circumcisions-egypt# "From Midwives to Doctors: Searching for “Safer” Circumcisions in Egypt?"], The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, 25 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|[[Martha Nussbaum]]: a key moral and legal issue with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force.]]
Cosmetic procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] and [[clitoral hood reduction]] do fall within the WHO's definition of FGM, which aims to avoid loopholes, but the WHO notes that these elective practices are generally not regarded as FGM.{{efn|WHO 2008: "Some practices, such as genital cosmetic surgery and hymen repair, which are legally accepted in many countries and not generally considered to constitute female genital mutilation, actually fall under the definition used here. It has been considered important, however, to maintain a broad definition of female genital mutilation in order to avoid loopholes that might allow the practice to continue."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some legislation banning FGM, such as in Canada and the US, covers minors only, but several countries, including Sweden and the UK, have banned it regardless of consent. Sweden, for example, has banned operations "on the outer female sexual organs with a view to mutilating them or bringing about some other permanent change in them, regardless of whether or not consent has been given for the operation".&lt;ref name=EigeSweden/&gt; Gynaecologist Birgitta Essén and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter argue that the law seems to distinguish between Western and African genitals, and deems only African women (such as those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) unfit to make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsdotter|Essén|2010|loc=33}}; {{harvnb|Essén|Johnsdotter|2004|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] argues that a key concern with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force. The distinction between social pressure and physical force is morally and legally salient, comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape. She argues further that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than in developed nations, which reduces their ability to make informed choices.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=123–124}}&lt;ref&gt;Also see [[Yuli Tamir|Yael Tamir]], [http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.3/Tamir.html "Hands Off Clitoridectomy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051255/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.3/Tamir.html |date=8 August 2014 }}, ''Boston Review'', Summer 1996; [[Martha Nussbaum]], [http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.5/nussbaum.html "Double Moral Standards?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051257/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.5/nussbaum.html |date=8 August 2014 }}, ''Boston Review'', October/November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intersex children, male circumcision====

Several commentators maintain that children's rights are violated not only by FGM but also by the genital alteration of [[intersex]] children, who are born with anomalies that physicians choose to correct.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Ehrenreich, Mark Barr, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/crcl/vol40_1/ehrenreich.pdf "Intersex Surgery, Female Genital Cutting, and the Selective Condemnation of 'Cultural Practices{{' "}}], ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'', 40(1), 2005 (71–140), 74–75.{{pb}}

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (general)}}
'''Feminism of the 99%''' ('''F99''') is a contemporary, [[grassroots]], [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] movement, which recognises [[intersectionality]] and advocates activism for and by all women - including those who have been overlooked by other feminist movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was proposed by a collective of prominent American feminists in an appeal published in Viewpoint Magazine in February 2017, and built upon the mobilisation of women seen in [[2017 Women's March|the 2017 Women’s March]] in January. The appeal simultaneously called for an [[International Women's Strike|International Women’s Strike]] on 8 March 2017. It is a successor to the accumulated intellectual legacy of feminist movements such as [[radical feminism]], [[Marxist feminism]], [[Black feminism]] and [[Decolonial feminism|transnational/decolonial feminism]], and asserts that [[Oppression|gender oppression]] is not caused by a single factor, [[sexism]]. They insist that it is rather a multifaceted product of the intersections of [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[colonialism]] and [[capitalism]].

==Background==
The demand for a Feminism of the 99% was published in Viewpoint Magazine on the 3@th of February 2017. It was made in response to the mass mobilisation of women seen in the [[2017 Women's March|2017 Women’s March]]  – a worldwide protest on 21 January 2017, protesting the inauguration of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]] and advocating for [[Women's rights|women’s rights]]'','' [[human rights]] and policy reform. The authors cite the Argentinian movement [[Ni una menos|Ni Una Menos]] as their inspiration, as it too is a [[Fourth-wave feminism|fourth-wave]] [[grassroots]] movement which aims to address [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] issues.  Aiming to build on the momentum of the Women’s March, the authors call attention to what they see as the failures of contemporary feminist movements such as lean-in feminism, which they argue have failed the “overwhelming majority” of women who “do not have access to individual self-promotion and advancement and whose conditions of life can be improved only through policies that defend social reproduction, secure reproductive justice, and guarantee labor rights”. They further argue that the conditions of life of women have deteriorated over the last 30 years due to [[Corporate globalization|corporate globalisation]] and [[Capitalism|capitalist]] systems, especially those of colour, of [[working class]], of [[Migrant worker|migrant]] backgrounds or who are [[Unemployment|unemployed]].

== Key criticisms and demands ==
F99 criticises other contemporary feminist movements, such as lean-in feminism and corporate feminism, for only serving the privileged top 1% of women. It holds the logic that women are able to succeed in their career as long as they work to serve the benefit of the [[patriarchy]], and that this relies on these women having access to resources and opportunities that most women are unable to access. The authors of the appeal recognise the need for a feminist movement which serves the needs of the many, and calls attention to the women who are overlooked by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] feminism. However, they call for the movement to look beyond just issues of [[gender]], criticising a number of key issues and movements including: racialized gender violence, the failings of neoliberalism, attacks on [[Labor rights|labour rights]] and the undervaluing of labour; reproductive injustices; [[homophobia]]; [[transphobia]]; and [[xenophobia]]. The aim of the movement is to contribute to what its creators see as a “a new international feminist movement with an expanded agenda–at once [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], anti-heterosexist, and anti-neoliberal”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Intersectionality#Feminist thought|Intersectional feminist thought]] holds that the lived experience of oppression cannot simply be observed through a single lens of identity: that it’s the combinations of identity expressions, and the kind of experience afforded together that provide a more accurate picture of the hierarchies under which one operates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Brittney|date=1 February 2016|title=Intersectionality|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199328581-e-20|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199328581-e-20|journal=|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903013507/http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199328581-e-20#|archive-date=3 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectionality considers that various forms of [[social stratification]], such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, disability and gender, do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Feminism for the 99% embraces this framework on a fundamental level, and purports that meaningful change must originate from those who experience it firsthand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Black Feminism ===
[[Black feminism]] is a school of thought stating that [[sexism]], [[class oppression]], gender identity and racism are inextricably bound together.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7459645|title=Women, race, &amp; class|last=1944-|first=Davis, Angela Y. (Angela Yvonne),|isbn=0394510399|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=7459645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/887450667|title=Feminism is for everybody : passionate politics|last=1952-|first=Hooks, Bell,|isbn=9781138821590|edition= Second |location=New York|oclc=887450667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Defining-Black-Feminist-Thought.html|title=Defining Black Feminist Thought - The Feminist eZine|website=www.feministezine.com|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929062940/http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Defining-Black-Feminist-Thought.html#|archive-date=29 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, this closely aligns with feminism for the 99% given their simultaneous use of intersectionality. A point of difference between the two movement is that feminism for the 99% has a defined strategy for change, taking inspiration from ''[[Ni una menos|Ni Una Menos]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Socialist Feminism ===
[[Socialist feminism]] is feminism that focuses upon the interconnectivity of the [[patriarchy]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Elizabeth Lapovsky|date=2008|title=Socialist Feminism: What Difference Did It Make to the History of Women's Studies?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20459218|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=34|issue=3|pages=497–525|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926133851/https://www.jstor.org/stable/20459218#|archive-date=26 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism of the 99% frequently parallels with Socialist Feminism given their similar critical assessments of capitalism,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the role of domestic work and social reproduction theory.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marxismocritico.com/2017/10/17/what-is-social-reproduction-theory/|title="What is social reproduction theory?": Tithi Bhattacharya|date=17 October 2017|access-date=24 October 2018|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela Davis]], as one of the keystone ideological sources of feminism for the 99%’s ideological perspective holds [[liberal feminism]] in contempt for its failure to address the concerns of women perceived to be betrayed by their class position: “If standards for feminism are created for those who have already ascended the economic hierarchies of feminism, how is this relevant to women at the bottom?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AfroMarxist|title=Angela Davis Criticizes "Mainstream Feminism" / Bourgeois  Feminism|date=8 January 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzQkVfO9ToQ|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318203818/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzQkVfO9ToQ#|archive-date=18 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words: Davis criticises liberal feminists for acting primarily in the interests of women privileged from race-based and class-based disadvantage.

[[Tithi Bhattacharya]], another key signatory of the feminism for the 99% manifesto, has expanded on [[social reproduction]] theory within the context of gender, providing a marxist analysis of gender disparate divisions of labor as an integral part of the capitalist [[mode of production]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, Bhattacharya suggests that the unpaid acts of childbirth, child-rearing, and domestic duties are themselves acts of productive labor, acted within an as exploitative context consistent with marxist [[Labor theory of value#Karl Marx|labor theory]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A key point, is that these acts are disparately the role of women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In stark contrast to Liberal Feminism, feminism for the 99% holds that effective and meaningful change comes from a non-reformist perspective: that revolutionary change necessitates a more utopian vision.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Feminism for the 99% holds that incremental adjustment of an existing unjust and oppressive hierarchy will never precipitate a just society. To this end, a change from the ground up is required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ni Una Menos ===
The Feminism of the 99% manifesto specifically cites [[Ni una menos|Ni Una Menos]] as a source of inspiration for the movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, the use of a mass strike of all women as the main form of political activism. On 8 March 2017 ([[International Women's Day|International Women’s Day]]), activists across the feminist continuum organised the International Women’s Strike (known in the US as  the Day Without Women),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/womens-strike-march-8.html|title=On March 8, Women Will Go on Strike|last=Evans|first=Dayna|work=The Cut|access-date=24 October 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325221418/https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/womens-strike-march-8.html#|archive-date=25 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2017 Women’s March.

==History==
[[File:Obama testing the Federal Government IT Dashboard.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] using FusionCharts on the [[Vivek Kundra#IT dashboard|Federal IT Dashboard]].]]
The idea behind FusionCharts was born in 2001 when 16-year-old Pallav Nadhani found himself dissatisfied with [[Microsoft Excel]]'s charting capabilities while using the program to complete high school class assignments. Nadhani subsequently authored an article on [[Wrox Press]]'s ASPToday.com technology website which examined the thesis that [[Adobe Flash|Macromedia Flash]], then used mainly for [[web banner]]s and [[pop-up ad]], could be used to build an interactive charting solution for business applications such as [[dashboard (business)|dashboard]]s and reports. The article earned him $1,500 and feedback from developers, which together acted as [[seed money]] and motivation for establishing the FusionCharts concept.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=sbt&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/07/bootstrapping-global-software-company-kolkata-india.html
|title=Bootstrapping a Global $7M Software Company from Kolkata, India
|first=Sramana|last=Mitra
|date=31 July 2012
|publisher=''Small Business Trends''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 at 17, Nadhani founded Infosoft Global. The initial product had 6 charts and was built using [[ActionScript]]. Nadhani worked alone developing the product, website, documents, sales and marketing and customer support for the first three years. As the company began to take off in 2005, he acquired office space in [[Bangur]] and hired 20 employees over the following 2–3 years. The venture grew during this period without raising external funding by [[bootstrapping (business)|bootstrapping]].&lt;ref name=et2/&gt;

By 2009, the company had moved to [[Salt Lake City, Kolkata]], and had grown to over 50 employees. Since arriving in Salt Lake, the staff has expanded by 250 percent of its original size, and in 2011 FusionCharts opened their second office in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref name=et2/&gt;

FusionCharts' client list, with customers across 118 countries and numerous business sectors, has drawn significant attention to the company. The company was placed squarely on the global platform following its 2010 selection by US President [[Barack Obama]] to design the digital dashboards for the federal administration, the [[Vivek Kundra#IT dashboard|Federal IT Dashboard]]. FusionCharts was the first Indian startup to gain the attention of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;

Co-founder Pallav Nadhani is the CEO of FusionCharts and also runs a [[seed funding]] [[venture capital]] fund named Seeders Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeders Inc.|url=http://www.seeders.in/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
In 2009, the company was included in the [[NASSCOM]] EMERGE 50 Leaders for 2009 due to its success in establishing its data visualization software globally.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasscom/&gt; In the same year it was also awarded the [[Deloitte]] Technology Fast50 India award in 2009.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deloitte Technology Fast 50 India 2009 |url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-India/Local%20Assets/Documents/Winners_report_Technology_Fast_50_2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201190343/http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-India/Local%20Assets/Documents/Winners_report_Technology_Fast_50_2009.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte&gt;{{cite web|title=Deloitte Technology Fast 50 India|url=http://www.fusioncharts.com/success-stories/awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FusionCharts was in 2010 named as one of the 15 companies likely to become the next [[Infosys]].&lt;ref name=et1/&gt;

The chart-gadget within [[Google Docs]] is powered by FusionCharts. Internally, [[Google]] employees also employ FusionCharts software for reporting.&lt;ref name=tia1/&gt; FusionCharts says that it powers over one billion charts every month globally.&lt;ref name=mixergy/&gt;&lt;ref name=tia1/&gt;&lt;ref name=tia2/&gt;&lt;ref name=tia3/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasscom/&gt;

==Marketing==
Since its founding in 2003, FusionCharts has put together an almost completely online network of international resellers serving places like [[Korea]], [[Brazil]], [[China]] and the United States.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasscom/&gt;

The company has also made use of [[search engine optimization]] and [[pay per click]] marketing, and engages users and developers by composing articles, whitepapers, and case studies on the subject of data visualization in various online publications.

FusionCharts also engages in advertising in both online and print developer magazines in key markets such as the US, Europe and Korea. The company is increasing its [[social media marketing]] and is emphasizing [[push–pull strategy|push–pull marketing strategy]].&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasscom/&gt;

Another aspect of marketing is a simple licensing framework as well as a [[FOSS]] version of its FusionCharts product that serves over 100,000 users.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasscom/&gt;

FusionCharts is typically targeted to developers who wish to integrate interactive charts in their reports, dashboards, analytics, monitors, and surveys.&lt;ref name=tia1/&gt;

[[File:FusionCharts JavaScript Charting Library.png|thumb|400px|90+ Interactive Charts and 960+ Maps]]

==Products==
Pallav Nadhani's original ASPToday.com article called for creating a charting library using [[Adbe Flash|Flash]], combined with [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] to power it with data. Developers responded positively and shared ideas on how to increase its power and functionality. Subsequently, Pallav coded this idea into a charting application, which led to the birth of the FusionCharts software.&lt;ref name=tia1/&gt;

FusionCharts has since transitioned to use JavaScript, SVG and VML to render charts, widgets and maps. This allows its components to be used on all mobile devices and cross-platform browsers. It does allow for optional rendering using Flash. FusionCharts Suite XT can today be used with any web scripting language to deliver interactive and powerful charts. Using XML and JSON as its data interfaces, FusionCharts Suite XT makes full use of [[HTML 5]] technologies to create compact, interactive, and visually-arresting charts.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=mixergy/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasscom/&gt;&lt;ref name=pluggd1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ro&gt;{{cite web

In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''generalized Lagrangian mean''' ('''GLM''') is a formalism – developed by {{harvs|txt=yes|last1=Andrews|first1=D.G.|last2=McIntyre|year=1978a|first2=M.E.|year2=1978b}} – to unambiguously split a motion into a [[average|mean part]] and an [[oscillation|oscillatory part]]. The method gives a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian description]] for the [[fluid flow|flow]] [[field (physics)|field]], but appointed to fixed [[Eulerian coordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Craik|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In general, it is difficult to decompose a combined wave–mean motion into a mean and a wave part, especially for flows bounded by a wavy surface: e.g. in the presence of [[surface gravity wave]]s or near another undulating bounding surface (like atmospheric flow over mountainous or hilly terrain). However, this splitting of the motion in a wave and mean part is often demanded in [[mathematical model]]s, when the main interest is in the mean motion – slowly varying at scales much larger than those of the individual undulations. From a series of [[postulate]]s, {{harvtxt|Andrews|McIntyre|1978a}} arrive at the (GLM) formalism to split the flow: into a generalised Lagrangian mean flow and an oscillatory-flow part.  

The GLM method does not suffer from the strong drawback of the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian specification of the flow field]] – following individual [[fluid parcel]]s – that Lagrangian positions which are initially close gradually drift far apart. In the Lagrangian frame of reference, it therefore becomes often difficult to attribute Lagrangian-mean values to some location in space.

The specification of mean properties for the oscillatory part of the flow, like: [[Stokes drift]], [[wave action (continuum mechanics)|wave action]], [[pseudomomentum]] and [[pseudoenergy]] – and the associated [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s – arise naturally when using the GLM method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|McIntyre|1978b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McIntyre|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLM concept can also be incorporated into [[variational principle]]s of fluid flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Holm|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">The '''Grothendieck construction''' (named after [[Alexander Grothendieck]]) is a construction used in the mathematical field of [[category theory]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;F\colon \mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathbf{Cat}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[functor]] from any small category to the [[category of small categories]].  The Grothendieck construction for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the category &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(F)&lt;/math&gt; (also written &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_{\textstyle\mathcal{C}} F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{C} \int F&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;F \rtimes \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;), with
* objects being pairs &lt;math&gt;(c,x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c\in \operatorname{obj}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in \operatorname{obj}(F(c))&lt;/math&gt;; and
* morphisms in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}_{\Gamma(F)}((c_1,x_1),(c_2,x_2))&lt;/math&gt; being pairs &lt;math&gt;(f, g)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f: c_1 \to c_2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g: F(f)(x_1) \to x_2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F(c_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
Composition of morphisms is defined by &lt;math&gt;(f,g) \circ (f',g') = (f \circ f', g \circ F(f)(g'))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Slogan ==
"The Grothendieck construction takes structured, tabulated data and flattens it by throwing it all into one big space. The projection functor is then tasked with remembering which box each datum originally came from." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893909845|title=Category theory for the sciences|last=1978-|first=Spivak, David I.,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0262028131|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=6.2.2.5|oclc=893909845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], then it can be viewed as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_G,&lt;/math&gt; with one object and all morphisms invertible.  Let &lt;math&gt;F:\mathcal{C}_G\to\mathbf{Cat}&lt;/math&gt; be a functor whose value at the sole object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_G&lt;/math&gt; is the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_H,&lt;/math&gt; a category representing the group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in the same way.  The requirement that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a functor is then equivalent to specifying a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi:G\to\operatorname{Aut}(H),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(H)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the group of [[automorphism]]s of &lt;math&gt;H.&lt;/math&gt;  Finally, the Grothendieck construction, &lt;math&gt;F \rtimes \mathcal{C}_G,&lt;/math&gt; results in a category with one object, which can again be viewed as a group, and in this case, the resulting group is (isomorphic to) the [[semidirect product]] &lt;math&gt;H \rtimes_\varphi G.&lt;/math&gt;

K. Ogden and his contemporaries, Thesis of James McElvenny, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[philosophy]] developed by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. Based largely on the teachings of [[Hillel the Elder]], Zamenhof originally called it '''Hillelism'''. He sought to reform [[Judaism]] because he hoped that without the strange dress code and purity requirements, it would no longer be the victim of antisemitic propaganda.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The basis of Homaranismo is the sentence known as the [[Golden Rule]]: ''One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself''.

Zamenhof said about Homaranismo:{{Cite quote|date=June 2012}} &lt;blockquote&gt;With Hillelism we don't mean a new denomination; we mean a new corporate-religious order inside the old Jewish religion, which has existed for a long time. Everybody who lives ethically could take part in this religion with a clear conscience, no matter what the religious views he had before looked like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on this idea, he came to the conclusion that this philosophy could be a bridge between religions, not just a subset of Judaism. Zamenhof subsequently renamed his philosophy Homaranismo.

While many different motivations drew early Esperantists to that movement, for Zamenhof Esperanto was always a means by which to facilitate improved human relations, especially beyond boundaries of race, language and culture. Zamenhof's daughter [[Lidia Zamenhof|Lidia]] embraced this philosophy and taught it alongside Esperanto and her adopted religion, the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Despite his entire [[Esperanto]] language project, Zamenhof astonishingly said of Homaranismo, "It is indeed the object of my whole life.  I would give up everything for it."&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Privat, "The Life of Zamenhof", p 117.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zamenhof developed his ideas on Homaranismo in two works: ''Hilelismo'' (1901) and ''Homaranismo'' (1913).

'''Hyperthymic temperament''', or '''hyperthymia''', from Greek ''hyper'' ("over", meaning here ''excessive'') + [[Thumos|θυμός]] ("spirited"), is a proposed personality type characterized by an exceptionally positive mood and disposition. It is generally defined by increased energy, vividness and enthusiasm for life activities as opposed to dysthymia. Hyperthymia is similar to but more stable than [[hypomania]] with complete absence of irritability or negative mood effects.&lt;ref name="wiktionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hyperthymia|title=hyperthymia - Wiktionary|publisher=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Guide to Mood Disorders|author1=Dubovsky, S.L.|author2=Dubovsky, A.N.|date=2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|isbn=9781585627653|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qC2umbulUIwC|page=39|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of the hyperthymic temperament include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/418724{{subscription needed}}{{clarify|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increased energy and [[productivity]]
* short sleep patterns
* vividness, activity [[Extraversion and introversion|extroversion]]
* self-assurance, self-confidence
* strong will
* extreme talkativeness
* tendency to repeat oneself
* [[risk]]-taking/sensation seeking
* breaking [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]]
* very strong [[libido]]
* love of attention
* low threshold for [[boredom]]
* generosity and tendency to overspend
* emotion sensitivity
* cheerfulness and joviality
* unusual warmth
* expansiveness
* tirelessness
* irrepressibility, irresistible, and infectious quality

The clinical, psychiatric understanding of hyperthymia is evolving. Studies have shown that hyperthymic temperament promotes efficient performance of complex tasks under time pressure or extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaracz |first1=Marcin |last2=Paciorek |first2=Przemysław |last3=Buciński |first3=Adam |last4=Borkowska |first4=Alina |title=Affective temperament and executive functions in emergency medicine professionals |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=168 |issue= |pages=192–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25063957 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2014.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this positive characterization, hyperthymia can be complicated with depressive episodes manifesting as a softer form of bipolar illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/439472_5|title=Beyond Antidepressants: Bipolar Spectrum Illness Presenting as Complicated or Refractory Mood Disorders in Primary Care|last=Manning|first=J.

Hyperthymia manifesting intermittently or in an unusual way may mask [[hypomania]] or another psychiatric disorder. Hyperthymia can be most accurately diagnosed by a psychologist or psychiatrist with the help of a patient's family and/or close friends.

'''Infinitism''' is the view that knowledge may be justified by an infinite chain of reasons. It belongs to [[epistemology]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that considers the possibility, nature, and means of [[knowledge]].

==Epistemological infinitism==

Since [[Gettier problem|Gettier]], "knowledge" is no longer widely accepted as meaning "[[justified true belief]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP|url-id=knowledge-analysis|title=The Analysis of Knowledge|date=2017-03-17|edition=Fall 2017|last=Ichikawa|first=Jonathan Jenkins|last2=Steup|first2=Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some epistemologists{{who|date=March 2016}}  still consider knowledge to have a justification condition. Traditional theories of justification ([[foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]]) and indeed some philosophers{{who|date=March 2016}} consider an infinite regress not to be a valid justification. In their view, if ''A'' is justified by ''B'', ''B'' by ''C'', and so forth, then either 
# The chain must end with a link that requires no independent justification (a foundation), 
# The chain must come around in a circle in some finite number of steps (the belief may be justified by its coherence), or 
# Our beliefs must not be justified after all (as is posited by [[Philosophical skepticism|philosophical skeptics]]).

Infinitism, the view, for example, of [[Peter D. Klein]], challenges this consensus, referring back to work of [[Paul Moser]] (1984) and John Post (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/inf-epis/#H2|title = Infinitism in Epistemology|accessdate = 2015-06-19|website = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last = Klein|first = Peter D.|last2 = Turri|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the evidential ancestry of a justified belief must be infinite and non-repeating, which follows from the conjunction two principles that Klein sees as having straightforward intuitive appeal: "The Principle of Avoiding Circularity" and "The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness."

The Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) is stated as follows: "For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then for all y, if y is in the evidential ancestry of x for S, then x is not in the evidential ancestry of y for S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAC says that the proposition to be justified cannot be a member of its own evidential ancestry, which is violated by coherence theories of justification.

The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) is stated as follows: "For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then there is some reason, r1, available to S for x; and there is some reason, r2, available to S for r1; etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAA says that in order to avoid arbitrariness, for any proposition ''x'' to be justified for an epistemological agent, there must be some reason ''r'' available to the agent; this reason will in turn require the same structure of justification, and so on ''ad infinitum''. Foundationalist theories can only avoid arbitrariness by claiming that some propositions are self-justified. But if a proposition is its own justification (e.g. coherentism), then it is a member of its own evidential ancestry, and the structure of justification is circular.

In this view, the conjunction of both PAC and PAA leaves infinitism as the only alternative to skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Availability of Reasons: Klein also relies on the notion of "availability". In other words, a reason must be available to the subject in order for it to be a candidate for justification. There are two conditions that need to be satisfied in order for a reason to be available: objectively and subjectively.

An objectively available reason is stated as follows: "a belief, r, is objectively available to S as a reason for p if '''(1)''' r has some sufficiently high probability and the conditional probability of p given r is sufficiently high; or '''(2)''' an impartial, informed observer would accept r as a reason for p; or '''(3)''' r would be accepted in the long run by an appropriately defined set of people; or '''(4)''' r is evident for S and r makes p evident for S; or '''(5)''' r accords with S's deepest epistemic commitments; or '''(6)''' r meets the appropriate conversational presuppositions; or '''(7)''' an intellectually virtuous person would advance r as a reason for p."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these conditions are sufficient to describe objectively available reasons and are compatible with infinitism. Klein concedes that, ultimately, the proper characterization of objectively available need be a member of this list, but, for the scope of Klein's defense of infinitism, he need not provide a fully developed account of objectively available reasons. Objective availability could be best understood, at least as a working definition, as an existing, truth-apt reason not dependant on the subject.

A subjectively available reason is stated as follows: "S must be able to call on r." (Subjectively available is comparatively straightforward compared to objectively available.) The subject must be able to evoke the reason in their own mind and use the reason in the process of justification. In essence, the reason must be "properly hooked up with S's own beliefs" in order to be subjectively available.

A reason that is both objectively and subjectively available to a subject is a candidate for justification according to infinitism (or, at least for Klein).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objection to Infinitism: Klein addresses an objection to infinitism.

The finite mind objection (attributed to John Williams): The human mind is finite and has a limited capacity. "It is impossible to consciously believe an infinite number of propositions (because to believe something takes some time) and it is impossible to "unconsciously believe"...an infinite number of propositions because the candidate beliefs are such that some of them "defeat human understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply an impossibility that a subject has an infinite chain of reasons which justify their beliefs because the human mind is finite. Klein concedes that the human mind is finite and cannot contain an infinite number of reasons, but the infinitist, according to Klein, is not committed to a subject actually possessing infinite reasons. "The infinitist is not claiming that in any finite period of time...we can consciously entertain an infinite number of thoughts. It is rather that there are an infinite number of propositions such that each one of them would be consciously thought were the appropriate circumstances to arise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, an infinite chain of reasons need not be present in the mind in order for a belief to be justified rather it must merely be possible to provide an infinite chain of reasons. There will always be another reason to justify the preceding reason if the subject felt compelled to make the inquiry and had subjective access to that reason.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3446">The '''Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children''' (IAC) is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) which seeks to change social values and raise consciousness towards eliminating [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) and other traditional practices which affect the health of women and children in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{cite book | title=Protecting Human Rights in Africa: Strategies and Roles of Nongovernmental Organizations | author=Welch, Claude E | year=1995 | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | series=Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights | editor=Bert B.

== History ==

The IAC began at a seminar in [[Dakar]] in 1984 with a focus on fighting harmful practices relating to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), [[childbirth]], [[nutrition]] and food, [[child marriage|early marriage]]; and promoting traditional practices considered beneficial, such as [[breastfeeding]] and [[infant massage|baby massage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Comfort Momoh|Momoh, Comfort]].

It has a liaison office in [[Geneva]] and 15 affiliates in Europe, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and USA.

In 1990, the IAC adopted the term "female genital mutilation" to describe the procedure previously referred to as "female circumcision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Alexia Lewnes |year=2005 |title=Changing a Harmful Social Convention: Female Genital Cutting/Mutilation |booktitle=Innocenti Digest |pages=1–2 |isbn=88-89129-24-7 |url=http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/fgm-gb-2005.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-24 |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |location=Florence, Italy |author=[aed.: Alexia Lewnes ; trad.: Mariette Mosette Barraud]. |oclc=123550797 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AChanging+a+Harmful+Social+Convention%3A+Female+Genital+Cutting%2FMutilation&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2005&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114352/http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/fgm-gb-2005.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1995 publication, the main focus of their strategy for eliminating FGM is through education.&lt;ref name=Welch/&gt;

The IAC considers that legislative change related to FGM in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Togo]] is a result of the lobbying work carried out by the IAC as well as by other NGOs.&lt;ref name=Packer /&gt;

'''Jane Edward Schilling''' (October 8, 1930 – September 13, 2017) was an American activist, historian, and university administrator who served as  founding Vice President of [[Martin University]] in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Early life==
Born Nancy Mary Schilling in 1930 in the lake resort town of [[Minocqua, Wisconsin]], Jane Schilling was the eldest of five children of Lyle Franklin Schilling, a dentist, and wife, Rosalie Julia Wolk Schilling, a homemaker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early on, Nancy excelled in athletics and scholarship. Finding that her high school did not offer the courses she needed to take in order to become a dentist like her father, she moved to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to live with two aunts to attend St. Joseph’s Academy for junior and senior high school. During this period, she found that she had a vocation to follow in the footsteps of her teachers and become a [http://www.csjsl.org/ Sister of St. Joseph of Carondolet].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tribute to Sr. Jane Schilling. 2015 Martin University Founders Day Luncheon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBVrj1JPH8g&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fern (Snooks) Winger, telephone interview, October 31, 2014, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Jelinski, written responses to interview questions, November 9, 2014, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her formation with the Sisters of St. Joseph, she received the name [[Religious sister|Sister]] Jane Edward, a combination of her younger sister’s and brother’s names. An avid scholar, she received her bachelor’s degree in European and American History at [[Fontbonne University]] in Saint Louis and her Master’s of Ancient History at [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] in [[Chicago]]. Following her first assignment as a teacher in St. Rita’s School in [[St. Louis]], she was next assigned to St. Matthew’s School in the inner city. Here, she developed a passion for civil rights and social justice. She assisted with curriculum development for students at the Saint Louis hospital for black residents, Homer G. Phillips, and assisted in ministering to ex-convicts at nearby [http://www.dismashouse.net/ Dismas House], established by [http://www.dismashouse.net/our-history.html Father Charles "Dismas" Clark] and [[Morris Shenker]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Holy Angels==
In 1964, Schilling's was assigned to teach at [http://www.holyangelscatholicschool.org/ Holy Angels Catholic School] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], a school that had transitioned to a majority black student population. She embraced this role with high energy, establishing a drum and bugle corps to increase school pride and visibility within the community. After she was named principal, she engaged in implementing educational reforms of the time, such as [[open classroom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Lateralization of brain function|right/left brain]] teaching, and [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] approaches for teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdye Bryant, Margaret Graves, and Doris Parker, “A New Journey of Hope: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 1903-2003” (Indianapolis: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 2003), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sr. Pat Quinn, CSJ, telephone interview, April 29, 2015, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;"Sister Jane Edward Schilling," biography, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis Province, http://www.csjsl.org/news/sister-jane-edward-schilling-1930-2017.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her arrival at Holy Angels, Schilling's life was radically changed when a new Associate Pastor at Holy Angels Parish, [[Boniface Hardin]], arrived on the scene. The two shared a commitment to education and social change, a bond that created a partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives.

Working together, Schilling and Hardin became activists in church and community reform. They fought police brutality and targeting of black citizens, de facto school [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], lack of representation of black clergy and traditions within the [[Catholic Church]], poverty, and unfair [[Housing discrimination (United States)|housing]] practices. A key focus became the fight to prevent a major highway, [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|Interstate 65]], from bifurcating the predominately black northwest neighborhood surrounding [http://holyangelsindy.org/ Holy Angels Parish].&lt;ref&gt;“CORE Threatens Protest in Planned Highway Controversy,” ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' February 10, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Seek Lawsuit to Halt Construction of Highway thru Negro Community,” ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' February 3, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

When police pressure on the Archbishop of Indianapolis, [[Paul Clarence Schulte|Paul Schulte]], triggered a decision to remove Hardin from Holy Angels Parish in 1969, parishioners rose up and staged a nationally publicized demonstration in [[Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral (Indianapolis)|Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral]] where the Archbishop was presiding at [[Easter]] services.&lt;ref&gt;"150 Walk Out in a Protest at Indianapolis Cathedral,” ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Demonstrators Protest Treatment of Priest,” ''Indianapolis Recorder'', April 12, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Archbishop rescinded his order, Hardin left Holy Angels to found Martin Center, an educational and social justice center, at the close of 1969. Within a year, Schilling received permission from her religious community to work full-time at Martin Center as Education Coordinator.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==The Martin Center==
Martin Center was named for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Martin de Porres|St. Martin de Porres]], patron saint, within the Catholic Church, of poor and mixed race people. Its mission evolved from an initial goal of educating clergy and white people about discriminatory attitudes and practices to include celebrating black cultural heritage and engaging black community members in activism and self-identity. While Hardin traveled as a speaker and consultant to raise funds for the Center, Schilling became the day-to-day administrator.

Drawing on her background as a history scholar, Schilling did the research and production of designs and materials for workshops, speeches, and activities of Martin Center. Soon, the mission of the Center expanded to include the [http://themartincenter.org/ Martin Sickle Cell Center], which received major national funding to educate the community and screen for this disease, and the Afro-American Institute, which focused on African and African-American culture and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Center’s success is vehicle by Father Boniface,” ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' March 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Schilling served as Director of Community Education at the Sickle Cell Center from 1970 to 1977 and received its award for 25 Years of Dedication to Sickle Cell and Visionary Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Father Kenneth Taylor, “Sister Jane Schilling: A Model of Faith,” Indianapolis Recorder, September 28, 2017. http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/religion/article_bb7767ce-a454-11e7-8ce7-13f0c08e208e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Afro-American Institute, Martin Center housed a library of materials and artifacts, created and acquired by Schilling and Hardin. They also produced a regular scholarly periodical, the ''Afro-American Journal'' (1973–78);&lt;ref&gt;Collections of the ''Afro-American Journal'' are in the Indiana University libraries, the Indiana State Library, the Indianapolis Public Library, and the Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; two full-length TV documentaries—''The Kingdom Builders'' and ''For Love of Freedom''&lt;ref&gt;Both films are available in their original Betamax format and DVD. Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;—for the local NBC affiliate in Indianapolis; a weekly radio program, ''The [https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/?f%5Bcollection_ssim%5D%5B%5D=The+Afro-American+in+Indiana+%28radio+series%29 Afro-American in Indiana]'' (1971-1991) for WIAN, the local public radio station;  and a weekly television show, ''Afro-American'' (1974–79), for public television. Schilling co-hosted these programs and was the major researcher behind the productions.

As Martin Center expanded its educational offerings to the community, it collaborated with [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis]] to create courses for college credit. This venture led Schilling and Hardin to found Indiana’s only minority serving institution, [[Martin University]].

==Martin University==
From the start, Schilling's role in the creation and growth of Martin University was chief academic officer, strategist, and educational developer.  As Founding Vice President for Academic Affairs, she was a key voice in articulating the philosophy behind the institution, inspired by the concept of “[[andragogy]]” advanced by [[Malcolm Knowles]]. The approach emphasized drawing on the strengths and past experience of adult learners, the major population of the university. Through her hiring decisions and curriculum and faculty development efforts, Schilling collaborated with Hardin to become the guiding force behind the school’s educational direction.

Schilling presided over Academic Affairs at Martin University from its early beginnings with a handful of students in 1977 as Martin Center College, through 1979 as Martin College became a separate entity from Martin Center, and finally through 1990, when the addition of graduate programs enabled the change to Martin University, a school with nearly 1000 students. She was the key architect of successful accreditation and expansion proposals to the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (changed in 2014 to the [[Higher Learning Commission]]). She became known at Martin for her sense of humor and the compassion she showed students through acts such as serving soup to those who came directly from work to classes.

While Vice President of Martin University, Schilling participated in numerous initiatives within the Indianapolis community, including serving on the [http://www.crispusattucksmuseum.org/ Crispus Attucks Museum] Committee and acting as consultant and workshop facilitator for the [[Indianapolis Public Schools]]. She continued to guide the Martin Center, serving as its Executive Director from 1984 to 1988.

Schilling received a number of Martin University Awards. These included the Mary McLeod Bethune Award and the Martin University Board of Trustees Wind Under Our Wings Award. In 2005, she received the Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Martin University. After 30 years of service, Schilling retired from Martin University in 2007. She died on September 13, 2017 at Nazareth Living House, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis.

'''Josephine Meckseper''' is a [[Germany|German]]-born contemporary commercial artist based in [[New York City]]. Her large-scale installations and films have been shown at various international biennials and museums.

==Life and education==

Josephine Meckseper grew up in [[Worpswede]], Germany, a utopian artist colony founded at the beginning of the 20th century. Meckseper’s maternal great-grand-uncle, [[Heinrich Vogeler]] (1872–1942) is said to have resided there. Meckseper’s father is German artist [[Friedrich Meckseper]] (born 1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Josephine Meckseper|last=Enwezor|first=Okwui|publisher=Hatje Cantz|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephine Meckseper studied at [[Berlin University of the Arts]] in Germany from 1986–1990, and received a MFA from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artipedia.org/artsnews/exhibitions/2007/07/14/josephine-meckseper-at-kunstmuseum-stuttgart/ |title=Josephine Meckseper at Kunstmuseum Stuttgart - Artipedia - Arts News |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814072808/http://artipedia.org/artsnews/exhibitions/2007/07/14/josephine-meckseper-at-kunstmuseum-stuttgart/ |archive-date=2007-08-14 |dead-url=yes |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Meckseper’s work is politically-informed and strongly influenced by [[Situationist International]] and [[Angry Brigade]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dismagazine.com/discussion/27805/the-final-shop/ Lookofsky, Sarah, “Josephine Meckseper – The Final Shop,” dismagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Meckseper founded ''FAT Magazine'', privately distributed at supermarkets, galleries and museums, sometimes heroically stuck on walls in homage Jean-Paul Marat. Four issues have come out since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatmagazine.us/ FAT magazine website. Retrieved August 8, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckseper’s installations, sculptures, photographs, and videos use industrial forms of presentation such as vitrines, window displays, and magazines to demonstrate inextricable influences of consumer culture on society and cultural production. Meckseper melds the aesthetics of modernism with the formal language of commercial display, combining them with images and artifacts of historical and political events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://andrearosengallery.com/artists/josephine-meckseper/bio|title=Andrea Rosen Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=Andrea Rosen Gallery|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often contained within Meckseper’s signature displays are paintings that nod to 20th century European modernist art, such as [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Josephine Meckseper Catalogue No. 2|last=Lotringer|first=Sylvère|publisher=Sternberg Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as photographs and video taken by Meckseper at present-day protests.

'''Manhattan Oil Project'''

In 2012, Meckseper presented the public project Manhattan Oil Project, installing two monumental kinetic sculptures modeled after mid-20th century oil pumps on the corner of 46th Street and 8th Avenue in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artproductionfund.org/projects/josephine-meckseper-manhattan-oil-project|title=Art Production Fund|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 25 feet tall sculptures were inspired by oil pumps that the artist discovered in Electra, a boarded-up town once famous for being the pump jack capital of Texas. Each sculpture was fully motorized to simulate the motions of a working oil pump. Placed in a vacant lot next to Times Square, the pump jacks recalled the ruins of ghost towns, forgotten monuments of America's decaying industrial past.

'''Pellea[s]'''

Meckseper's film ''Pellea[s]'' is a narrative film released in 2018 that expresses through cinema the narratives and relationships contained within the universe within her glass and mirror vitrines. Meckseper explains, "''Pellea[s]'' expands on this historical discourse through cinema and acted out narratives. It is a modern adaptation of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]’s play ''Pelléas et Mélisande'', conflated with the current political realities in the US."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sophiefriedman/2018/01/04/three-australian-arts-festivals-to-see-right-now/2/#27404af258d3|title=Three Australian Arts Festivals To See Right Now|last=Friedman|first=Sophie|date=January 4, 2018|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]] (particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]&lt;ref name=KarmaParveshSingla&gt;{{cite book|author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |publisher=Parvesh singla |pages=5–7 |id=GGKEY:0XFSARN29ZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name=evawong&gt;Eva Wong, Taoism, Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1590308820}}, pp. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives - one's ''[[saṃsāra]]''.&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;&lt;ref name=jamesloch/&gt;

==Definition and meanings==
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Karma as action and reaction: if we show goodness, we will reap goodness.]] 
''Karma'' is the executed "deed", "work", "action", or "act", and it is also the "object", the "intent". [[Wilhelm Halbfass]]&lt;ref name=halbfass2000&gt;Halbfass, Wilhelm (2000), Karma und Wiedergeburt im indischen Denken, Diederichs, München, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; explains karma (karman) by contrasting it with another Sanskrit word ''kriya''. The word ''kriya'' is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, while ''karma'' is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Julius Lipner]] (2010), Hindus: Their religious beliefs and practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pp 261-262&lt;/ref&gt; as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;

Karma, also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma.&lt;ref name=karlpotter&gt;Karl Potter (1964), The Naturalistic Principle of Karma, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 14, No. 1 (Apr., 1964), pp. 39-49&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define.&lt;ref name=wdointro&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp xi-xxv (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Different schools of [[Indologists]] derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that is good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 3-37&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indologists include in the definition of karma theory that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1980), in Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions (O'Flaherty, Editor), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*For Hinduism view: Jeffrey Brodd (2009), World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884899976}}, pp. 47;
*For Buddhism view: Khandro Rinpoche (2003), This Precious Life, Shambhala, pp. 95
&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulty in arriving at a definition of ''karma'' arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction.&lt;ref name=wkasrb&gt;see:
* Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15-32;
* Sharma, A. (1996), On the distinction between Karma and Rebirth in Hinduism, Asian Philosophy, 6(1), pp 29-35;
* Bhattacharya, R. (2012), Svabhāvavāda and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 40(6), pp 593-614&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts. Thus karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657042}}, see article on Karma&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept whose meaning, importance and scope varies between Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. [[Wendy Doniger|O'Flaherty]] claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;

Karma theory as a concept, across different Indian religious traditions, shares certain common themes: causality, ethicization and rebirth.

===Causality===
[[File:Tema Nezahat Gokyigit Park 1060584 nymphaea.jpg|thumb|240px|Lotus symbolically represents karma in many Asian traditions. A blooming lotus flower is one of the few flowers that simultaneously carries seeds inside itself while it blooms. Seed is symbolically seen as cause, the flower effect. Lotus is also considered as a reminder that one can grow, share good karma and remain unstained even in muddy circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Maria I. Macioti, The Buddha Within Ourselves: Blossoms of the Lotus Sutra, Translator: Richard Maurice Capozzi, {{ISBN|978-0761821892}}, pp 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality.&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt; One of the earliest association of karma to causality occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad of Hinduism. For example, at 4.4.5-6, it states:

{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
Now as a man is like this or like that,
according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;
a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;
he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;

And here they say that a person consists of desires,
and as is his desire, so is his will;
and as is his will, so is his deed;
and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|2=[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|3=7th Century BCE&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6MPYs0AkA?url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/quotes/brihadaranyaka-upanishad-4-4-5-6 Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5-6] Berkley Center for Religion Peace &amp; World Affairs, Georgetown University (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jbbu&gt;The words "deed", "acts" above are rendered from karma; see [https://archive.is/20140107061016/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/jrblack/web/SKT/DL/upanishads.html Brihadaranyaka] James Black, Original Sanskrit &amp; Muller Oxford English Translations, University of Wisconsin, United States (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The relationship of karma to causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought.&lt;ref name=brucer&gt;Bruce R. Reichenbach, The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of karma as causality holds that (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anguttara-Nikaya 3.4.33, Translator: Henry Warren (1962), Buddhism in Translations, Atheneum Publications, New York, pp 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Another causality characteristic, shared by Karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.&lt;ref name=jmpj&gt;see:
* James McDermott, Karma and Rebirth in Early Buddhism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 165-192
* Padmanabh Jaini, Karma and the problem of rebirth in Jainism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 217-239
* Ludo Rocher, Karma and Rebirth in the Dharmasastras, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 61-89&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: ''phalas'' and ''samskaras''. A ''phala'' (literally, fruit or result) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, ''samskaras'' are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of ''samskaras''.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown (1996), Karma, character, and consequentialism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, pp 329-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karmic principle can be understood, suggests Karl Potter,&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter's suggestion is supported by the Bhagavad-Gita, which links good bondage and bad bondage to good habits and bad habits respectively. It also lists various types of habits - such as good (sattva), passion (rajas) and indifferent (tamas) - while explaining karma. See the cited Potter reference; elsewhere, in Yoga Sutras, the role of karma to creating habits is explained with ''Vāsanās'' - see Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York, {{ISBN|0-7914-3816-3}}, Chapter 3, particularly pp 102-105&lt;/ref&gt; as a principle of psychology and habit. Karma seeds habits ([[vāsanā]]), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds self perception, and perception influences how one experiences life events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort.&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1998), The final stages of purification in classical yoga, Asian Philosophy, 8(2), pp 85-102&lt;/ref&gt; Thus psyche and habit, according to Potter&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (1983), "Psychology and Karma", ''Philosophy East and West'' 33 (Jan): 49-60.&lt;/ref&gt; link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature. The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a person's "character", as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person's habitual thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=jamesloch/&gt;

===Karma and ethicization===
The second theme common to karma theories is ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence,&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt; which will come to fruition in either this or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual's present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself "reward and punishment", but the law that produces consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Clooney, Evil, Divine Omnipotence, and Human Freedom: Vedānta's Theology of Karma, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; Halbfass notes, good karma is considered as ''[[dharma]]'' and leads to ''punya'' (merit), while bad karma is considered ''adharma'' and leads to ''pāp'' (demerit, sin).&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1998), Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, London, see article on Karma and Rebirth (Indian Conceptions)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reichenbach suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter in the evaluation of one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;see:

===Rebirth===
The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (''saṃsāra'').&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126-128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272-273, 652-654}} Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.&lt;ref name=jamesloch&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction.&lt;ref name=wkasrb/&gt; Karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept, so suggests Creel;&lt;ref&gt;Austin Creel (1986), in Editor: Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is a fact, asserts Yamunacharya,&lt;ref&gt;M Yamunacharya (1966), Karma and Rebirth, Indian Philo. Annual, 1, pp 66&lt;/ref&gt; while reincarnation is a hypothesis; in contrast, Hiriyanna suggests&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyana (1949), Essentials of Indian Philosophy, George Allen Unwin, London, pp 47&lt;/ref&gt; rebirth is a necessary corollary of karma.

Rebirth, or ''saṃsāra'', is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 589&lt;/ref&gt; In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas.&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Karma&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching ''[[moksa]]''. Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.

The theory of "karma and rebirth" raises numerous questions—such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as [[Charvaka]]s, Lokayatana abandoned "karma and rebirth" theory altogether.&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

==Early development==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word  {{IAST|[[:wikt:कर्मन्#Sanskrit|kárman-]]}} (nominative ''{{IAST|kárma}}'') means "work" or "deed",&lt;ref name=krishan/&gt; often used in the context of [[Srauta]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;a neuter ''n''-stem, {{lang|sa|कर्म}}  from the root ''{{IAST|√kṛ}}'' {{lang|sa|कृ}}  "to do, make, perform, accomplish, cause, effect, prepare, undertake" [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0300/mw__0334.html kṛ,कृ] Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/ Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary] (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indo-aryans have borrowed the theory of re-birth after coming in contact with the aboriginal inhabitants of India. Certainly Jainism and non-vedics [..] accepted the doctrine of rebirth as supreme postulate or article of faith."
* Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, [[Cambridge University Press]]: UK {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}, page 86, Quote - "The origin and doctrine of Karma and Saṃsāra are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahaminical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions."

==In Hinduism==
{{Main article|Karma in Hinduism}}

The concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries. The earliest Upanishads began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death. As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include ''pancagni vidya'' (the five fire doctrine), ''pitryana'' (the cyclic path of fathers) and ''devayana'' (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods).&lt;ref&gt;Colebrooke, H. T. (1829), Essay on the Philosophy of the Hindus, Part V. Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 2(1), 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do superficial rituals and seek material gain, claimed these ancient scholars, travel the way of their fathers and recycle back into another life; those who renounce these, go into the forest and pursue spiritual knowledge, were claimed to climb into the higher path of the gods. It is these who break the cycle and are not reborn.&lt;ref name=wmahony&gt;William Mahony (1987), Karman: Hindu and Jain Concepts, in Editor: Mircea Eliade, Encyclopedia of Religion, Collier Macmillan, New York&lt;/ref&gt; With the composition of the Epics - the common man's introduction to [[Dharma]] in Hinduism - the ideas of causality and essential elements of the theory of karma were being recited in folk stories. For example:
{{Quote|
1=As a man himself sows, so he himself reaps; no man inherits the good or evil act of another man. The fruit is of the same quality as the action.
|2=[[Mahabharata]]|3= xii.291.22&lt;ref&gt;E. Washburn Hopkins, Modifications of the Karma Doctrine, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, (Jul., 1906), pp. 581-593&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the thirteenth book of the Mahabharata, also called the Teaching Book ([[Anushasana Parva]]), sixth chapter opens with Yudhishthira asking Bhishma: "Is the course of a person's life already destined, or can human effort shape one's life?"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-251-2}}; see Chapter 3 and Appendix 1&lt;/ref&gt; The future, replies Bhishma, is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-251-2}}; pp 60-64&lt;/ref&gt; Over and over again, the chapters of Mahabharata recite the key postulates of karma theory. That is: intent and action (karma) has consequences; karma lingers and doesn't disappear; and, all positive or negative experiences in life require effort and intent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bruce Long, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
Happiness comes due to good actions, suffering results from evil actions,
by actions, all things are obtained, by inaction, nothing whatsoever is enjoyed.
If one's action bore no fruit, then everything would be of no avail,
if the world worked from fate alone, it would be neutralized.
&lt;/poem&gt;

* There is extensive debate in the Epic Mahabharata about karma, free will and destiny across different chapters and books. Different characters in the Epic take sides, some claiming destiny is supreme, some claiming free will is. For a discussion, see: [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel H. H. Ingalls]], Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 44-45; Quote - "(...) In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny)."; Quote - "This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasize destiny.{{'"}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Over time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, see Karma&lt;/ref&gt; Among the six most studied schools of Hinduism, the theory of karma evolved in different ways, as their respective scholars reasoned and attempted to address the internal inconsistencies, implications and issues of the karma doctrine. According to Halbfass,&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;
* The Nyaya school of Hinduism considers karma and rebirth as central, with some Nyaya scholars such as [[Udayana]] suggesting that the Karma doctrine implies that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Vaisesika school does not consider the karma from past lives doctrine very important.
* The Samkhya school considers karma to be of secondary importance (prakrti is primary).
* The Mimamsa school gives a negligible role to karma from past lives, disregards ''samsara'' and ''moksa''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yoga school considers karma from past lives to be secondary, one's behavior and psychology in the current life is what has consequences and leads to entanglements.&lt;ref name=wmahony/&gt;
* According to Professor [[Wilhelm Halbfass]], the Vedanta school acknowledges the karma-rebirth doctrine, but concludes it is a theory that is not derived from reality and cannot be proven, considers it invalid for its failure to explain evil / inequality / other observable facts about society, treats it as a convenient fiction to solve practical problems in Upanishadic times, and declares it irrelevant; in the Advaita Vedanta school, actions in current life have moral consequences and liberation is possible within one's life as jivanmukti (self-realized person).&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;

The above six schools illustrate the diversity of views, but are not exhaustive. Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as Vedanta school's nondualism and dualism sub-schools. Furthermore, there are other schools of Hinduism such as Charvaka, Lokayata (the materialists) who denied the theory of karma-rebirth as well as the existence of God; to this school of Hindus, the properties of things come from the nature of things. Causality emerges from the interaction, actions and nature of things and people, determinative principles such as karma or God are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Franco (1981), [http://www.sudoc.fr/041081900 Lokayata La Philosophie Dite Materialiste de l'Inde Classique], Nanterre-Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli (1998), Nyaya-Vaisesika, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}{{refn|group=note|[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Bhikkhu Thanissaro]]: "Unlike the theory of [[causality|linear causality]] — which led the [[Vedas|Vedists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] to see the relationship between an act and its result as predictable and tit-for-tat — the principle of ''[[Idappaccayatā|this/that conditionality]]'' makes that relationship inherently complex. The results of kamma ("kamma" is the Pali spelling for the word "karma") experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma, but also from present kamma. This means that, although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results [MN 135], there is no set one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship between a particular action and its results. Instead, the results are determined by the context of the act, both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it [MN 136] and in terms one’s state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result [AN 3:99]. [...] The feedback loops inherent in ''this/that conditionality'' mean that the working out of any particular cause-effect relationship can be very complex indeed. This explains why the Buddha says in AN 4:77 that the results of kamma are [[Acinteyya|imponderable]]. Only a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha—another imponderable itself—would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic network. The basic premise of kamma is simple—that skillful intentions lead to favorable results, and unskillful ones to unfavorable results—but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mapped. We can compare this with the [[Mandelbrot set]], a mathematical set generated by a simple equation, but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely explored."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}}} It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=42}} There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}} The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=131}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}} ''Karmaphala'' is not a "judgement" enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos. Rather, ''karmaphala'' is the outcome of a natural process of cause and effect.{{refn|group=note|[[Khandro Rinpoche]]: "Buddhism is a nontheistic philosophy. We do not believe in a creator but in the causes and conditions that create certain circumstances that then come to fruition. This is called karma. It has nothing to do with judgement; there is no one keeping track of our karma and sending us up above or down below. Karma is simply the ''wholeness'' of a cause, or first action, and its effect, or fruition, which then becomes another cause. In fact, one karmic cause can have many fruitions, all of which can cause thousands more creations. Just as a handful of seed can ripen into a full field of grain, a small amount of karma can generate limitless effects."{{sfn|Khandro Rinpoche|2003|p=95}}}}
Within Buddhism, the real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=21-22}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=79-80}} The ''Acintita Sutta'' warns that "the results of kamma" is one of the [[Acinteyya|four incomprehensible subjects]],{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=14}}&lt;ref name="Acintita"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.077.than.html accesstoinsight, ''Acintita Sutta: Unconjecturable'', Anguttara Nikaya 4.77]&lt;/ref&gt; subjects that are beyond all conceptualization{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=14}} and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason.{{refn|group=note|Dasgupta explains that in Indian philosophy, acintya is "that which is to be unavoidably accepted for explaining facts, but which cannot stand the scrutiny of logic."{{sfn|Dasgupta|1991|p=16}} See also the ''[[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]]'' "Discourse to Vatsagotra on the [Simile of] Fire," Majjhima Nikaya 72,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=852}}&lt;ref name="MN72"&gt;:[http://www.access to insight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html accesstoinsight, ''Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire'', translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Buddha is questioned by Vatsagotra on the "ten indeterminate question,"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=852}} and the Buddha explains that a [[Tathagata]] is like a fire that has been extinguished, and is "deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html accesstoinsight, ''Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire'', transalated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Jainism==
{{Main article| Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|[[Types of Karma (Jainism)|Types of ''Karmas'']] as per Jain philosophy]]
{{See also|Causes of Karma (Jainism)|God in Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], "karma" conveys a totally different meaning from that commonly understood in [[Hindu philosophy]] and western civilization.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hermann Kuhn, Karma, the Mechanism, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain philosophy]] is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates body (matter) from the soul (pure consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya - Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle particles of matter that pervade the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya Umasvati, Tattvartha Sutra, Ch VIII, Sutra 24&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karmas'' are attracted to the karmic field of a soul due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions. Hence the ''karmas'' are the [[subtle matter]] surrounding the [[consciousness]] of a soul. When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present.
[[Jain texts]] expound that seven ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]]'' (truths or fundamentals) constitute reality. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Acharya |last=Pujyapada |translator=S. A. Jain|title=Reality|date=1992|publisher=Jwalamalini Trust|url=https://archive.org/details/Reality_JMT |page=7}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]]''- the soul which is characterized by consciousness
#''[[Ajiva|Ajīva]]''- the non-soul
#''[[Asrava|Āsrava]]''- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''.
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Mokṣha]]'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]],&lt;blockquote&gt;This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to ''shrardha'' (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Collected papers on Jaina studies | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers | editor=Jaini,  Padmanabh | year=2000 | edition=1st | location=Delhi | pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:
# Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. (absence of the exogenous "Divine Entity" in Jainism)
# Jainism advocates that a soul attracts ''karmic'' matter even with the thoughts, and not just the actions. Thus, to even think evil of someone would endure a ''karma-bandha'' or an increment in bad karma. For this reason, Jainism emphasise on developing [[Ratnatraya]] (The Three Jewels): ''samyak darśana'' (Right Faith), ''samyak jnāna'' (Right Knowledge) and ''samyak charitra'' (Right Conduct).
# In Jain theology, a soul is released of worldly affairs as soon as it is able to emancipate from the "karma-bandha".&lt;ref name="FN2M"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=From Nigoda to Moksa: The Story of Marudevi | encyclopedia=Jainism and Early Buddhism: Essays in Honor of Padmanabh S. Jaini | publisher=Asian Humanities Press (an imprint of Jain Publishing Company) | author=Jaini, Padmanabh S. | editor=Qvarnström, Olle | year=2003 | volume=I | location=Fremont CA | pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, ''nirvana'' and ''moksha'' are used interchangeably. ''Nirvana'' represents annihilation of all ''karmas'' by an individual soul and ''moksha'' represents the perfect blissful state (free from all bondage). In the presence of a ''Tirthankara'', a soul can attain ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience) and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.&lt;ref name="FN2M" /&gt;
# The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Even the ''Tirthankaras'' themselves have to go through the stages of emancipation, for attaining that state.
# Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana. Only those who make effort, really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.&lt;ref&gt;Sancheti Asoo Lal, Bhandari Manak Mal – First Steps to Jainism (Part Two): Doctrine of Karma, Doctrine of Anekant and Other Articles with Appendices – Catalogued by [[Library of Congress|Library of U.S. Congress]], Washington, Card No. 90-232383&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in other traditions==
===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], all living beings are described as being under the influence of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'s'' three qualities. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of ''maya'' bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of Maya's nature, ''[[jiva]]s'' (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called "karma". The underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.

This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the Gurbani's ([[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]) law of karma. Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurbani.org/webart40.htm Gurbani.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shintoism===
Interpreted as ''Musubi'', a view of karma is recognized in [[Shintoism]] as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shinto: A Celebration of Life|author=Aidan Rankin|pages=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg8UWWZPxw4C&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
Karma is an important concept in [[Taoism]]. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.&lt;ref name=evawong/&gt;

The karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages.&lt;ref name=lkohn&gt;Livia Kohn (1998), [http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf Steal holy food and come back as a Viper - Conceptions of Karma and Rebirth in Medieval Daoism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109063052/http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf |date=9 January 2014 }}, Early Medieval China, 4, pp 1-48&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone's karma and assigning fate (''ming''). In the second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one's current life was introduced. In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added. One could be reborn either as another human being or another animal, according to this belief. In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.&lt;ref name=lkohn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Zurcher (1980), Buddhist influence on early Taoism, T'oung Pao, Vol. 66, pp 84-147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falun Gong===
Ownby (2008) claims that Falun Gong differs from [[Buddhism]] in its definition of the term "karma" in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term "''de''" or "virtue" is reserved for what might otherwise be termed "good karma" in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering - what Buddhism might refer to as "bad karma". Li says, "A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma."&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China (2008) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Falun Gong]] teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as samsara&lt;ref name=TRAN&gt;Transcending the Five Elements and Three Realms, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html Zhuan Falun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609043918/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html |date=9 June 2011 }}, accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; due to the accumulation of karma.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;Transformation of Karma, Zhuan Falun Lecture 4, accessed 01/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, karma is also the cause of one's continued rebirth and suffering.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt; Li says that due to accumulation of karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt;

Ownby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of "one reaps what one sows". Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are Judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a "system of transmigration", though, "in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived." Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;!-- Ownby 2008 p.110 --&gt; In the same vein of Li's [[monism]], matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Li says that "Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings." He says that in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a "setting of delusion", and return. "That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed."&lt;ref name=ZFLII&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm Zhuan Falun, Volume II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023901/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm |date=21 August 2011 }}, published 1996, translated June 2008, accessed 2008-06-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent "opposition to practitioners' taking [[medication|medicine]] when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the [[illness]] through cultivation." [[Benjamin Penny]] shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that "karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people", Penny asks: "if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of ''xinxing'', then what good will medicine do?"&lt;ref name=Fellow&gt;[[Benjamin Penny]], Canberra, 2001, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present and Future of Falun Gong, A lecture by Harold White Fellow, Benjamin Penny, at the National Library of Australia], accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that "What I'm doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking". Li also states that "An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick."&lt;ref&gt;Lectures in United States, 1997, Li Hongzhi&lt;/ref&gt; Schechter quotes a Falun Gong student who says "It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not."&lt;ref name=schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, ''Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?'', Akashic books: New York, 2001, pp. 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
===Free will and destiny===

One of the significant controversies with the karma doctrine is whether it always implies destiny, and its implications on free will. This controversy is also referred to as the [[moral agency]] problem;&lt;ref name=wrkaufman&gt;Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; the controversy is not unique to karma doctrine, but also found in some form in monotheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;[Moral responsibility] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University (2009); Quote - "Can a person be morally responsible for her behavior if that behavior can be explained solely by reference to physical states of the universe and the laws governing changes in those physical states, or solely by reference to the existence of a sovereign God who guides the world along a divinely ordained path?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will controversy can be outlined in three parts:&lt;ref name=wrkaufman/&gt; (1) A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma:  he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and he merely delivers necessary punishments his "wicked" victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma? (2) Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent is responsible, that the harm is gratuitous, and therefore seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, and assume that the unjust suffering is fate? (3) Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral education--because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings?&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur (1976), The Problem of Evil in Indian Thought, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Macmillan Reference, see Karma&lt;/ref&gt; Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold: (1) The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action. Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent - good or bad. If intent and act can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, new karma can be proven, and the process of justice can proceed against this new karma. The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried. (2) Life forms not only receive and reap the consequence of their past karma, together they are the means to initiate, evaluate, judge, give and deliver consequence of karma to others. (3) Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (see [[moral evil]] versus [[natural evil]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reichenbach, Bruce (1990), The Law of Karma, University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|978-0333535592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mdeb/&gt;

Other schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs and that karma from past lives affects one's present, believe that both free will (''Cetanā'') and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.&lt;ref name=wrkaufman/&gt;&lt;ref name=mdeb&gt;Matthew Dasti and Edwin Bryant (2013), Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199922758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological indeterminacy===
Another issue with the theory of karma is that it is psychologically indeterminate, suggests Obeyesekere.&lt;ref name=goerl&gt;G. Obeyesekere (1968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, Practical religion, Editor: E.R. Leach, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; That is, (1) if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and (2) if the karma from past lives can determine one's future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, or reduce suffering. If something goes wrong {{en dash}} such as sickness or failure at work {{en dash}} the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.&lt;ref name=goerl/&gt;

This psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion adopting the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events. As with the karma-and-free-will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy. Their answers to the psychological indeterminacy issue are the same as those for addressing the free will problem.&lt;ref name=mdeb/&gt;

===Transferability===
Some schools of Asian religions, particularly Popular Theravada Buddhism, allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another. This transfer is an exchange of non-physical quality just like an exchange of physical goods between two human beings. The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Charles Keyes (1983), Merit-Transference in the Kammic Theory of Popular Theravada Buddhism, In Karma, Editors: Charles Keyes and [[Valentine Daniel]], Berkeley, University of California Press;
* F.L. Woodward (1914), The Buddhist Doctrine of Reversible Merit, The Buddhist Review, Vol. 6, pp 38-50&lt;/ref&gt; Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with [[substitutionary atonement]] and vicarious punishment. It defeats the ethical foundations, and dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent. Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving, and such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma (i.e., demerit) from one person to another.

In Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, a claim disputed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, pp 226, see Footnote 74&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools in Hinduism, such as the Yoga and Advaita Vedantic philosophies, and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The problem of evil===
There has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the [[problem of evil]] and related problem of [[theodicy]]. The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs:&lt;ref&gt;R Green (2005), Theodicy, in The Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd Edition (Editor: Lindsay Jones), Volume 12, MacMillian Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657332}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate ([[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]), and (2) That one God knows absolutely everything (omniscient) and is all powerful (omnipotent). The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, "why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world?" Max Weber extended the problem of evil to Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber (Translated by Fischoff, 1993), The Sociology of Religion, Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807042052}}, pp. 129-153&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Eastern traditions, both in theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454-455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Bilimoria (1990), ‘ Hindu doubts about God {{en dash}} Towards a Mimamsa Deconstruction’, International Philosophical Quarterly, 30(4), pp. 481-499&lt;/ref&gt; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in ''Sribhasya''.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt; Epics such as the Mahabharata, for example, suggests three prevailing theories in ancient India as to why good and evil exists {{en dash}} one being that everything is ordained by God, another being karma, and a third citing chance events (''yadrccha'', यदृच्छा).&lt;ref name=ehudson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manmatha Nath Dutt (1895), English translation of The Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 159, verse 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata, which includes Hindu deity Vishnu in the form of Krishna as one of the central characters in the Epic, debates the nature and existence of suffering from these three perspectives, and includes a theory of suffering as arising from an interplay of chance events (such as floods and other events of nature), circumstances created by past human actions, and the current desires, volitions, dharma, adharma and current actions (''purusakara'') of people.&lt;ref name=ehudson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bailey (1983), Suffering in the Mahabharata: Draupadi and Yudhishthira, Purusartha, No. 7, pp. 109-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2001), Rethinking the Mahabharata: A Reader's Guide to the Education of the Dharma King, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226340531}}, Chapters 2 and 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, while karma theory in the Mahabharata presents alternative perspectives on the problem of evil and suffering, it offers no conclusive answer.&lt;ref name=ehudson&gt;Emily Hudson (2012), Disorienting Dharma: Ethics and the Aesthetics of Suffering in the Mahabharata, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199860784}}, pp. 178-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.B.

Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347-364&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–255&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, particularly of the Nyaya school of Hinduism and Sankara in ''Brahmasutra bhasya'', have posited that karma doctrine implies existence of god, who administers and affects the person's environment given that person's karma, but then acknowledge that it makes karma as violable, contingent and unable to address the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Reichenbach (1989), Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 135-149&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Herman states that karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomenon and arises from the karma of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;P. Singh, Sikh perspectives on health and suffering: A focus on Sikh theodicy, in Religion, Health and Suffering (Editors: John Hinnells and Roy Porter), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710306111}}, pp. 111-132&lt;/ref&gt; In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with [[dharma]] and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt; In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.&lt;ref name=bilimoria/&gt;

Those schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley Kaufman (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree, and consider the critique as flawed and a misunderstanding of the karma theory.&lt;ref&gt;Chadha and Trakakis (2007), Karma and the Problem of Evil: A Response to Kaufman, Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol. 57, No. 4, pp. 533-556&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western culture]], influenced by Christianity,&lt;ref name=KarmaParveshSingla/&gt; holds a notion similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase "[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]".

=== Christianity ===
Mary Jo Meadow suggests karma is akin to "Christian notions of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and its effects."&lt;ref name="Meadow2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meadow|first=Mary Jo|title=Christian Insight Meditation|date=28 August 2007|publisher=Wisdom Publications Inc|isbn=9780861715268|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that the Christian teaching on a [[Last Judgment]] according to one's charity is a teaching on karma.&lt;ref name="Meadow2007"/&gt; Christianity also teaches morals such as [[wikt:reap what one sows|one reaps what one sows]] ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:7) and [[live by the sword, die by the sword]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma, rhythmic return to harmony|author=Haridas Chaudhuri|pages=78 and 79|quote=The Meaning of Karma in Integral Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ve_Nim-MChcC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, however, consider the concept of Last Judgment as different from karma, with karma as an ongoing process that occurs every day in one's life, while Last Judgment, by contrast, is a one-time review at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Collyer Knox and Horace Leland Friess, The Review of Religion, Volume 1, Columbia University Press, pp 419-427&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
There is a concept in Judaism called in Hebrew ''midah k'neged midah'', which literally translates to "value against value," but carries the same connotation as the English phrase "measure for measure." The concept is used not so much in matters of law, but rather, in matters of ethics, i.e. how one's actions effects the world will eventually come back to that person in ways one might not necessarily expect.  [[David Wolpe]] compared ''midah k'neged midah'' to karma.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, David.  [https://www.sinaitemple.org/worship/sermons/toldot-training-hands-esau-voice-jacob/ "Drash."] Sinai Temple.  Los Angeles, CA.  18 November 2017.  Drash.  MP3 file.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
[[Jung]] once opined on unresolved emotions and the [[synchronicity]] of karma;
{{Quote|When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. and Wolfgang Pauli, The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche, New York: Pantheon Books, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Popular methods for negating [[cognitive dissonance]] include [[meditation]], [[metacognition]], [[counselling]], [[psychoanalysis]], etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Permanent neuronal changes within the [[amygdala]] and left [[prefrontal cortex]] of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Richard J., Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jessica Schumacher, Melissa Rosenkranz, Daniel Muller, Saki F. Santorelli, Ferris Urbanowski, Anne Harrington, Katherine Bonus, and John F. Sheridan. "Alterations in Brain and Immune Function Produced by Mindfulness Meditation." Psychosomatic Medicine 65 (2003): 564–70&lt;/ref&gt; This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of [[Individuation]] or [[self-actualisation]]. Such [[peak experiences]] are hypothetically devoid of any karma ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]).

=== Theosophy, Spiritism, New Age  ===
The idea of karma was popularized in the [[Western world]] through the work of the [[Theosophical Society]]. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] ''law of return'' or ''Threefold Law,'' the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'

The Theosophist [[I. K. Taimni]] wrote, "Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions."&lt;ref&gt;I.K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when humans reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as animals or other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;E.L. Gardner ''Reincarnation: Some Testimony From Nature'' 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth J. Gergen''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] and [[emeritus]] [[professor]] at [[Swarthmore College]]. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Yale University]] (1957) and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Duke University]] (1962).

==Biography==

The son of [[John Jay Gergen]], the Chair of the Mathematics Department at [[Duke University]], and Aubigne Munger (née Lermond), Gergen grew up in Durham, North Carolina. He had three brothers, one of whom is [[David Gergen]], the prominent political analyst. After completing public schooling, he attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1957, he subsequently became an officer in the U.S. Navy. He then returned to graduate school at Duke University, where he received his PhD in psychology in 1963. His dissertation advisor was [[Edward E. Jones]]. Gergen went on to become an Assistant Professor in the Department of Social Relations at [[Harvard University]], where he also became the Chairman of the Board of Tutors and Advisors for the department and representative to the university's Council on Educational Policy.

In 1967, Gergen took a position as Chair of the Department of Psychology at [[Swarthmore College]], a position he held for ten years. At various intervals, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], the [[University of Marburg]], the [[Sorbonne]], the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], [[Kyoto University]], and [[Adolfo Ibanez University]]. At Swarthmore, he spearheaded the development of the academic concentration in interpretation theory. In an attempt to link his academic work to societal practices, he collaborated with colleagues to create the [[Taos Institute]] in 1996. He is currently Gil and Frank Mustin Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Senior Research Professor at Swarthmore, the Chairman of the Board of the Taos Institute, and an adjunct professor at [[Tilburg University]].

Gergen is married to Mary M. Gergen, Professor Emeritus at [[Penn State University]], and a major contributor to [[feminist psychology]] and performance inquiry. She is the author of over 50 articles and is the co-author (with Ken Gergen) of "Social Construction". They publish the Positive Aging Newsletter with a readership of around 20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth J. Gergen, Ph.D.|url=https://www.taosinstitute.net/kenneth-j-gergen|website=The Taos Institute|publisher=The Taos Institute|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

Gergen's earliest studies challenged the presumption of a unified or coherent self.{{Clarify|reason=What studies, and in what way did they challenge this assumption?|date=June 2017}} He then raised questions about the value of [[altruism]], by exploring the ways in which helping others leads to the recipient's resentment and alienation. 

A major point in Gergen's career was his 1973 article "Social Psychology as History". In the article, he argues that the laws and principles of social interaction are variable over time, and that the scientific knowledge generated by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] actually influences the phenomena it is meant to passively describe. For example, studying obedience to authority may reduce the likelihood of obedience. He argued therefore that social psychology was not fundamentally a cumulative science, but was effectively engaged in the recording and transformation of cultural life. The article proved contentious, receiving criticism, such as from [[Barry R. Schlenker]]. The developing dispute became known as the "Gergen-Schlenker debate" and touched topics around the metatheory of social psychology.&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"&gt;Warren Thorngate (1976) ''"In General" vs. "It depends": Some Comments of the Gergen-Schlenker Debate'';  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 2, S. 404-410.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl E. Weick]] later took Warren Thorngate's contribution to that dispute to formulate [[Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity]], a theorem revolving around research methodology in social sciences.

Also contributing to what was called "the crisis in social psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Kim, U. (1999), "After the 'Crisis' in Social Psychology: The Development of the Transactional Model of Science". ''[[Asian Journal of Social Psychology]]'', 2: 1–19. doi: 10.1111/1467-839X.00023&lt;/ref&gt; was Gergen's subsequent publication on generative theory. Here he proposed that, because theoretical suppositions were not so much recordings of social life as creators, theories should not be judged by their accuracy so much as their potential to open new spaces of action.

Combining these ideas with developments in literary and critical theory, along with the history of science, Gergen went on to develop a radical view of [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] knowledge. This view was proposed as a successor project to what Gergen considered an inherently flawed [[Empiricism|empiricist]] conception of knowledge.  From Gergen's perspective, all human intelligibility (including claims to knowledge) is generated within relationships. It is from relationships that humans derive their conceptions of what is real, rational, and good. From this perspective, scientific theories, like all other reality posits, should not be assessed in terms of truth, but in terms of pragmatic outcomes. Such assessments are inevitably wedded to values, and thus all science is morally and politically weighted in implication. As he saw it, this same form of assessment also applies to social constructionist theory. The question is not its accuracy, but its potentials for humankind.

This latter conclusion informed most of Gergen's subsequent work, in areas including therapy and counseling, education, organizational change, technology, conflict reduction, civil society, and qualitative inquiry. In one form or another, this work is concerned with transforming social life. For the most part, his preferred direction of change is toward more collaborative and participatory relationships. Additionally, he has been concerned with fostering a "[[relational psychoanalysis|relational]]" view of the self, where the "traditional emphasis on the individual mind is replaced by a concern with the relational processes from which rationality and morality emerge."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He is also known for his comment "I am linked therefore I am" as an answer to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' proposition "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".&lt;ref&gt;Relational Being. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these developments are summarized in ''Relational Being, Beyond the Individual and Community,'' which attempts to demonstrate that what are considered mental processes are not so much "in the head" as in relationships. It also attempts to answer charges of [[moral relativism]] with a non-foundational morality of collaborative practice, and to outline a way to bring science together with concerns for the sacred.

Gergen's work is associated with [[social constructionism]]. Other major interests in his diverse works include analyzing the effects of technology on social life, examining connections between social construction and [[theology]], and promoting a more optimistic model of aging.

==Notable concepts==
Concepts that Gergen has written about include:
*''Enlightenment effects''. The moral and political effects on cultural behavior of disseminating scientific knowledge. ("Social psychology as history")
*''Generative theory'': Theory that unsettles common assumptions, and opens up possibilities or new forms of action. ("Toward generative theory")
*''Deficit discourse'': By constructing the world, and particularly individuals, in terms of problems, there is an objectification of deficit and a suppression of positive possibilities. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Cycle of progressive infirmity'': With the dissemination of information about [[Classification of mental disorders#Categorical schemes|categories of mental illness]], people come to see themselves in these terms. As a result, they seek help from the [[Mental health professional|mental health professions]], which are in turn, expanded in numbers. With the expansion of the mental health industry, new diagnostic categories are developed and disseminated. The society becomes progressively infirmed. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Multiphrenia'': The condition, largely attributed to technologies that increase social contact, of being simultaneously drawn in multiple and conflicting directions. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Pregression''. To unsettle the modernist value placed on progress, the proposal that for every change that is effected in societal life, the repercussions will unsettle multiple conditions that people define as positive. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Positive aging'': As an alternative to the pervasive view of aging as decline (deficit discourse), it is possible to discover and construct myriad ways of creating later life as a period of unparalleled growth and enrichment.
*''First and second order morality'': All collaborative relationships will be about some understanding of the good. With multiple groups proclaiming their own good, the stage is set for interminable conflict. Second order morality is achieved through practices that bring otherwise embattled groups into a condition of positive collaboration. (''Relational Being'')
*''Transformative dialogue'': Forms of dialogic practice that dissolve the barriers of meaning separating otherwise conflicted parties. (''Relational Being'')
*''Co-action''. One's actions have no meaning in themselves, but come into meaning through another's collaborative action. At the same time, another's potentially collaborative actions only become so as they are supplemented. All human intelligibility emerges not from individual actors but through co-action. (''Relational Being'')
*''Multi-being''. What is commonly viewed as the individual subject is the common intersection of multiple relationships. (''Relational Being'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12724">The '''Law of Demeter''' ('''LoD''') or '''principle of least knowledge''' is a design guideline for developing [[software]], particularly [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented programs]]. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of [[loose coupling]]. The guideline was proposed by Ian Holland at [[Northeastern University]] towards the end of 1987, and can be succinctly summarized in each of the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
* Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
* Only talk to your immediate friends.

The fundamental notion is that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of "[[information hiding]]". It may be viewed as a corollary to the [[principle of least privilege]], which dictates that a module possess only the information and resources necessary for its legitimate purpose.

It is so named for its origin in the [[Demeter Project]], an [[adaptive programming]] and [[aspect-oriented programming]] effort. The project was named in honor of [[Demeter]], “distribution-mother” and the Greek [[goddess]] of [[agriculture]], to signify a bottom-up philosophy of programming which is also embodied in the law itself.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given for naming the Law of Demeter after the Demeter Project, or for naming the project after the Greek goddess|date=May 2018}}

==In object-oriented programming==
When applied to [[object-oriented]] programs, the Law of Demeter can be more precisely called the “Law of Demeter for Functions/Methods” (LoD-F). In this case, an object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; can request a service (call a method) of an object instance &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, but object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; should not "reach through" object &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; to access yet another object, &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, to request its services. Doing so would mean that object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; implicitly requires greater knowledge of object &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;'s internal structure.
Instead, &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;'s interface should be modified if necessary so it can directly serve object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;'s request, propagating it to any relevant subcomponents. Alternatively, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; might have a direct reference to object &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; and make the request directly to that. If the law is followed, only object &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; knows its own internal structure.

More formally, the Law of Demeter for functions requires that a method &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; of an object &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title      = The Paperboy, The Wallet, and The Law Of Demeter

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; itself
# &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;'s parameters
# Any objects created/instantiated within &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;'s direct component objects
# A global variable, accessible by &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;, in the scope of &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;

In particular, an object should avoid invoking methods of a member object returned by another method. For many modern object oriented languages that use a dot as field identifier, the law can be stated simply as "use only one dot". That is, the code &lt;code&gt;a.b.Method()&lt;/code&gt; breaks the law where &lt;code&gt;a.Method()&lt;/code&gt; does not. As an [[analogy]], when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the dog's legs to walk directly; instead one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.

==Advantages==
The advantage of following the Law of Demeter is that the resulting software tends to be more [[maintainability|maintainable]] and [[Adaptive reuse|adaptable]]. Since objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects, object containers can be changed without reworking their callers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; published experimental results in 1996 suggesting that a lower ''Response For a Class'' (RFC, the number of methods potentially invoked in response to calling a method of that class) can reduce the probability of [[software bug]]s. Following the Law of Demeter can result in a lower RFC. However, the results also suggest that an increase in ''Weighted Methods per Class''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maisqual.squoring.com/wiki/index.php/Weighted_Methods_per_Class|title=Weighted Methods per Class - Maisqual Wiki|website=maisqual.squoring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (WMC, the number of methods defined in each class) can increase the probability of software bugs. Following the Law of Demeter can also result in a higher WMC; see [[#Disadvantages|Disadvantages]].

A [[multilayered architecture]] can be considered to be a systematic mechanism for implementing the Law of Demeter in a software system.
In a layered architecture, code within each [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layer]] can only make calls to code within the layer and code within the next layer down.
"Layer skipping" would violate the layered architecture.

==Disadvantages==
Although the LoD increases the adaptiveness of a software system, it may (but not necessarily will) result in having to write many wrapper methods to propagate calls to components; in some cases, this can add noticeable time and space overhead.&lt;ref name=Basili/&gt;&lt;ref name=BradApp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradapp.com/docs/demeter-intro.html |title=Introducing Demeter and its Laws | last=Appleton | first=Brad |accessdate=6 July 2013 |quote=A side-effect of this is that if you conform to LoD, while it may quite increase the maintainability and "adaptiveness" of your software system, you also end up having to write lots of little wrapper methods to propagate methods calls to its components (which can add noticeable time and space overhead).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pragmatic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask |title=Tell, Don't Ask |publisher=The Pragmatic Programmers, LLC |accessdate=6 July 2013 |quote=The disadvantage, of course, is that you end up writing many small wrapper methods that do very little but delegate container traversal and such. The cost tradeoff is between that inefficiency and higher class coupling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the method level, the LoD leads to narrow interfaces, giving access to only as much information as it needs to do its job, as each method needs to know about a small set of methods of closely related objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, at the class level, the LoD leads to wide (i.e. enlarged) interfaces, because the LoD requires introducing many auxiliary methods instead of digging directly into the object structures &lt;ref name=BradApp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pragmatic/&gt;. One solution to the problem of enlarged class interfaces is the [[Aspect-oriented programming|aspect-oriented]] approach&lt;ref name=AOP-Programming&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where the behavior of the method is specified as an aspect at a high level of abstraction. This is done by having an adaptive method that encapsulates the behaviour of an operation into a place, with which the scattering problem is solved. It also abstracts over the class structure that results in avoiding the tangling problem. The wide interfaces are managed through a language that specifies implementations. Both the traversal strategy and the adaptive visitor use only a minimal set of classes that participate in the operation, and the information about the connections between these classes is abstracted out.

Since the LoD exemplifies a specific type of coupling, and does not specify a method of addressing this type of coupling, it is more suited as a metric for [[code smell]] as opposed to a methodology for building loosely coupled systems.

'''Literal and figurative language''' is a distinction within some fields of [[language]] analysis, in particular [[Stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[semantics]]. 
*'''Literal language''' uses words exactly according to their conventionally accepted [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s or [[denotation]].
*'''Figurative''' (or '''non-literal''') '''language''' uses words in a way that deviates from their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complicated meaning or heightened effect.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/figure%20of%20speech Figure of speech]." ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.

[[Aristotle]] and later the Roman [[Quintilian]] were among the early analysts of [[rhetoric]] who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|DUPLICATE_title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA129|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9780495898023|edition=10|author1=M.H. Abrams|author2=Geoffrey Harpham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769, [[Frances Brooke]]'s novel ''The History of Emily Montague'' was used in the earliest ''Oxford English Dictionary'' citation for the figurative sense of ''literally''; the sentence from the novel used was, "He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally ''to feed among the lilies''."&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5914]&lt;/ref&gt; This citation was also used in the OED's 2011 revision.&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Within literary analysis, such terms are still used; but within the fields of cognition and linguistics, the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used.&lt;ref name="BarberStainton2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Alex|last2=Stainton|first2=Robert J|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2boGE2NKtpsC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2009-11-20|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080965000|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard pragmatic model of comprehension==
Prior to the 1980s, the "standard pragmatic" model of comprehension was widely believed. In that model, it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal, but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made, the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension.&lt;ref name="Katz1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Albert N.|title=Figurative Language and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSxhb_fZLx0C&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195109634|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research has cast doubt on the model. In tests, figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language; and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=Michael William|last2=Keane|first2=Mark T.|title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22ZWi-LVLDcC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841693590|pages=369–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reddy and contemporary views==
Beginning with the work of [[Michael Reddy (linguist)|Michael Reddy]] in his 1979 work "[[Conduit metaphor|The Conduit Metaphor]]", many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a "literal" and "figurative" mode of language.&lt;ref name="Ortony1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortony|first=Andrew|title=Metaphor and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJRvuXA_VcC&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1993-11-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521405614|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human genetics]], the '''Mitochondrial Eve''' (also ''mt-Eve, mt-MRCA'') is the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) of all [[world population|currently living]] [[humans]], i.e., the most recent woman from whom all living humans   descend in an unbroken line purely  through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.

In terms of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial haplogroups]], the mt-MRCA is situated at the divergence of [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macro-haplogroup L]] into [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]] and [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)#Origin|L1–6]].  As of 2013, estimates on the age of this split ranged at around 150,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Two studies published in 2013 had 95% confidence intervals barely overlapping in the neighbourhood of 15 ka, a third study had a 95% confidence interval intermediate between the two others:

The male analog to the "Mitochondrial Eve" is the "[[Y-chromosomal Adam]]" (or Y-MRCA), the individual from whom all living humans are [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]] descended.  As the identity of both matrilineal and patrilineal MRCAs is dependent on genealogical history ([[pedigree collapse]]), they need  not have lived at the same time.

The name "Mitochondrial Eve" alludes to biblical [[Eve]]. This led to repeated misrepresentations or misconceptions in journalistic accounts on the topic. [[Popular science]] presentations of the topic usually point out such possible misconceptions by emphasizing the fact that the position of mt-MRCA is neither fixed in time (as the position of mt-MRCA moves forward in time as [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) lineages become extinct), nor does it refer to a "first woman", nor the only living female of her time, nor the first member of a "new species".&lt;ref&gt;"Caution: This does not make Mitochondrial Eve the first woman, or the first human, or the first member of a new species.
Further Caution: This does not mean that other women alive when Eve was do not have descendants today; they simply do not have living descendants who are descended only through female links.
Yet Further Caution: If a person were to be discovered whose mtDNA showed a pattern of mutations of greater time depth, then the status of Mitochondrial Eve would be reassigned to the most recent female ancestor shared by both that person and the person we now call Mitochondrial Eve." {{cite web |url= http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/resources/clarifications/MitochondrialEve.html |title=Jordan: 'Mitochondrial Eve' |work=weber.ucsd.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Human timeline}}

===Early research===
Early research using  [[molecular clock]] methods was done during the late 1970s to early 1980s.
[[Allan Wilson]], [[Mark Stoneking]], [[Rebecca L. Cann]] and Wesley M. Brown found that [[mutation]] in human mtDNA was unexpectedly fast, at 0.02 substitution per base (1%) in a million years, which is 5–10 times faster than in [[nuclear DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author= Brown WM, George M Jr, Wilson AC|year=1979|title= Rapid evolution of animal mitochondrial DNA | url= | journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=76|issue=4 |pages=1967–71|pmid= 109836| pmc =383514|bibcode= 1979PNAS...76.1967B|last2= George|last3= Wilson|doi= 10.1073/pnas.76.4.1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Related work allowed for an analysis of the evolutionary relationships among [[gorilla]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s (common chimpanzee and [[bonobo]]) and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author= Ferris SD, Brown WM, Wilson AC|year=1981|title= Evolutionary tree for apes and humans based on cleavage maps of mitochondrial DNA| url= | journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=78|issue=4 |pages=2432–36|pmid= 6264476| pmc =319360|bibcode= 1981PNAS...78.2432F|last2= Wilson|last3= Brown|doi= 10.1073/pnas.78.4.2432}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With data from 21 human individuals, Brown published the first estimate on the age of the mt-MRCA at 180,000 years ago in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|vauthors=Brown WM |year=1980|title= Polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA of humans as revealed by restriction endonuclease analysis| journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=77|issue=6 |pages=3605–09|pmid= 6251473 |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.6.3605 |pmc=349666|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.3605B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A statistical analysis published in 1982 was taken as evidence for [[recent African origin]] (a hypothesis which at the time was competing with Asian origin of ''H. sapiens'').&lt;ref name=Cann82&gt;{{Citation|vauthors=Cann RL, Brown WM, Wilson AC |year=1982|title= Evolution of human mitochondrial DNA: a preliminary report | url= | journal= Prog Clin Biol Res|volume=103|issue=Pt A |pages=157–65|pmid= 6298804}}

===1987 publication===
By 1985, data from the mtDNA of 145 women of different populations, and of two [[cell lines]], [[HeLa]] and GM 3043, derived from a Black American and a [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] respectively, was available. After more than 40 revisions of the draft, the manuscript was submitted to [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in late 1985 or early 1986&lt;ref name="git"&gt;{{Citation|author= Gitschier J |year=2010 |title= All about Mitochondrial Eve: An interview with Rebecca Cann | journal= PLoS Genetics|volume=6|issue=3 |pages= e1000959|pmid=20523888| pmc=2877732|doi= 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and published on 1 January 1987. The published conclusion was that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa, at the time dated to between 140,000 and 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid3025745"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Cann RL, Stoneking M, Wilson AC | title = Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 325 | issue = 6099 | pages = 31–36 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3025745 | doi = 10.1038/325031a0 | ref=harv |bibcode = 1987Natur.325...31C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating for "Eve" was a blow to the [[multiregional hypothesis]], which was being  controversially discussed at the time,  and a boost to the theory of the [[recent African origin of modern humans|recent origin model]].&lt;ref name="pmid1840702"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Vigilant L, Stoneking M, Harpending H, Hawkes K, Wilson AC | title = African populations and the evolution of human mitochondrial DNA | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5027 | pages = 1503–07 |date=September 1991 | pmid = 1840702 | doi = 10.1126/science.1840702 | ref=harv  |bibcode = 1991Sci...253.1503V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term "Mitochondrial Eve" or even the name "Eve" in their original paper; it appears to originate with a 1987 article in [[science (journal)|''Science'']] by [[Roger Lewin]], headlined "The Unmasking of Mitochondrial Eve."&lt;ref name=lew&gt;{{Citation|author=Lewin R |year=1987 |title= The unmasking of mitochondrial Eve| url= | journal= Science|volume=238|issue=4823 |pages= 24–26|doi=10.1126/science.3116666 |pmid=3116666|bibcode = 1987Sci...238...24L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biblical connotation was very clear from the start. The accompanying research news in ''Nature'' had the title "Out of the garden of Eden."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Wainscoat J |year=1987 |title= Out of the garden of Eden | url= | journal= Nature|volume=325|issue=6099|pages= 13|doi=10.1038/325013a0|pmid=3796736|bibcode = 1987Natur.325...13W }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Wilson himself preferred the term "Lucky Mother" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilkins A |date=27 January 2012|title= The scientists behind Mitochondrial Eve tell us about the "lucky mother" who changed human evolution forever | url= http://io9.com/5879991/the-scientists-behind-mitochondrial-eve-tell-us-about-the-lucky-mother-who-changed-human-evolution-forever | work= On the Human|publisher= Gawker Media 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thought the use of the name Eve "regrettable."&lt;ref name=lew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Cann RL| year= 1997|chapter= Chapter 4: Mothers, Labels, and Misogyny |title=Women in Human Evolution |editor= Hager LD | publisher=Routledge| location= London |pages= 75–89 | isbn =9780415108331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But the concept of Eve caught on with the public and was repeated in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story (11 January 1988 issue featured a depiction of Adam and Eve on the cover, with the title "The Search for Adam and Eve"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tierney J |year=1992|title= The Search for Adam and Eve| url= http://www.virginia.edu/woodson/courses/aas102%20%28spring%2001%29/articles/tierney.html| work= Newsweek |publisher= Carter G. Woodson Institute for Afro-American and African Studies |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cover story in ''[[time (magazine)|Time]]'' on 26 January 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lemonick MD |date=26 January 1987|title= Everyone's Genealogical Mother| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963320,00.html| work= Time|publisher= Time Inc.|accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and later research===
Shortly after the 1987 publication, criticism of its methodology and  secondary conclusions was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Darlu P, Tassy P |title= Disputed African origin of human populations  |url=  |journal= Nature  |volume= 329 |issue=6135  | pages= 111–12 |year= 1987 |pmid= 3114640|doi= 10.1038/329111b0|bibcode = 1987Natur.329..111D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the dating of mt-Eve and the relevance of the age of the purely matrilineal descent for population replacement was controversially discussed during the 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Maddison DR|title=African Origin of human mitochondrial DNA reexamined |url= |journal= Systematic Zoology |volume= 40 |issue= 3 | pages= 355–63 |year= 1991 |doi=10.2307/2992327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Nei M |title= Age of the common ancestor of human mitochondrial DNA |url= |journal= Mol Biol Evol |volume= 9|issue= 6 | pages= 1176–78 |year= 1992 |pmid= 1435241 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Ayala FJ|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/270/5244/1930.full.pdf|title=The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins| journal= Science|volume= 270|issue=5244 |pages= 1930–36| year=1995 |pmid= 8533083|doi=10.1126/science.270.5244.1930|bibcode = 1995Sci...270.1930A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton, A.

[[Alan Templeton]] (1997) asserted that the study did "not support the hypothesis of a recent African origin for all of humanity following a split between Africans and non-Africans 100,000 years ago" and also did "not support the hypothesis of a recent global replacement of humans coming out of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Templeton A  |title= Out of Africa?

{{Harvtxt|Cann|Stoneking|Wilson|1987}}'s placement of a relatively small population of humans in sub-Saharan Africa was consistent with the hypothesis of Cann (1982) and lent considerable support for the "recent out-of-Africa" scenario.

In 1999 Krings et al. eliminated problems in molecular clocking postulated by Nei (1992){{cn|date=May 2018}} when it was found that the mtDNA sequence for the same region was substantially different from the MRCA relative to any human sequence.

Although the original research did have analytical limitations, the estimate on the age of the mt-MRCA has proven robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Holsinger K |url= http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecturenotes/coalescent/node5.html|title=(Mathematics of the coalescent) An example: Mitochondrial Eve | work= Holsinger Lab |date=29 September 2012 |publisher= | accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cyran KA, Kimmel M |url= |title=Alternatives to the Wright-Fisher model: the robustness of mitochondrial Eve dating| journal= Theor Popul Biol|volume= 78|issue=3 |pages= 165–72| year=2010 |pmid= 20600209|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2010.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent age estimates have remained consistent with the 140–200 kya estimate published in 1987: A 2013 estimate dated Mitochondrial Eve to about 160 kya (within the reserved estimate of the original research) and [[Out of Africa II]] to about 95 kya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fu Q, Mittnik A, Johnson PL, Bos K, Lari M, Bollongino R, Sun C, Giemsch L, Schmitz R, Burger J, Ronchitelli AM, Martini F, Cremonesi RG, Svoboda J, Bauer P, Caramelli D, Castellano S, Reich D, Pääbo S, Krause J |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982213002157 |title=A revised timescale for human evolution based on ancient mitochondrial genomes| journal= Current Biology|volume= 23|issue=7|pages= 553–59|date=March 21, 2013|pmid= 23523248|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.044|pmc=5036973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another 2013 study (based on [[genome sequencing]] of 69 people from 9 different populations) reported the age of Mitochondrial Eve between  99 to 148 kya and that of the [[Y-MRCA]]  between 120 and 156 kya.&lt;ref name=poz/&gt;

Without a DNA sample, it is not possible to reconstruct the complete genetic makeup ([[genome]]) of any individual who died very long ago. By analysing descendants' DNA, however, parts of ancestral genomes are estimated by scientists. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome DNA are commonly used to trace ancestry in this manner. mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or [[matrilineally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Giles|first=Richard E|first2=H |last2=Blanc |first3=H M |last3=Cann |first4=D C |last4=Wallace|year=1980|title=Maternal inheritance of human mitochondrial DNA|journal=PNAS|volume=77|issue=11|pages=6715–19|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/77/11/6715.abstract|doi=10.1073/pnas.77.11.6715|pmid=6256757|pmc=350359|bibcode = 1980PNAS...77.6715G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Birky|first=C.

Branches are identified by one or more unique markers which give a mitochondrial "DNA signature" or "[[haplotype]]" (e.g. the [[Cambridge Reference Sequence|CRS]] is a haplotype). Each marker is a DNA base-pair that has resulted from an [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] [[mutation]]. Scientists sort mitochondrial DNA results into more or less related groups, with more or less recent common ancestors. This leads to the construction of a DNA [[family tree]] where the branches are in biological terms [[clade]]s, and the common ancestors such as Mitochondrial Eve sit at branching points in this tree. Major branches are said to define a [[haplogroup]] (e.g. CRS belongs to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]]), and large branches containing several haplogroups are called "macro-haplogroups".
[[File:Mitochondrial eve tree.gif|thumb|right|200px|Simplified Human mitochondrial phylogeny]]
The mitochondrial clade which Mitochondrial Eve defines is the [[species]] ''[[species:Homo sapiens|Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' itself, or at least the current population or "[[chronospecies]]" as it exists today. In principle, earlier Eves can also be defined going beyond the species, for example one who is ancestral to both modern humanity and [[Neanderthal]]s, or, further back, an "Eve" ancestral to all members of [[genus]] ''[[species:Homo|Homo]]'' and chimpanzees in genus ''[[species:Pan|Pan]]''. According to current nomenclature,
Mitochondrial Eve's haplogroup was within [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|mitochondrial haplogroup L]] because this macro-haplogroup contains all surviving human mitochondrial lineages today, and she must predate the emergence of [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]].

The variation of mitochondrial DNA between different people can be used to estimate the time back to a common ancestor, such as Mitochondrial Eve. This works because, along any particular line of descent, mitochondrial DNA accumulates mutations at the rate of approximately one every 3,500 years per nucleotide.&lt;ref name = "Soares09"&gt;{{Citation|last1= Soares|first1= P |last2=Ermini |first2=L |last3=Thomson  |first3=N |last4=Mormina  |first4= M |last5= Rito|first5= T |last6=Röhl |first6=A  |last7= Salas|first7= A |last8=Oppenheimer |first8= S |last9= Macaulay|first9= V |title=Correcting for purifying selection: an improved human mitochondrial molecular clock |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=740–59 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19500773 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.05.001 |url=|pmc= 2694979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Gibbons|first= A |title=Calibrating the Mitochondrial Clock |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=279 |issue=5347 |pages=28–29 |date=January 1998 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5347.28 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/279/5347/28.full |pmid=9441404|bibcode = 1998Sci...279...28G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are sites in mtDNA (such as: 16129, 16223, 16311, 16362) that evolve more rapidly, have been noted to change within intragenerational timeframes – {{Harvtxt |Excoffier|Yang|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain number of these new variants will survive into modern times and be identifiable as distinct lineages. At the same time some branches, including even very old ones, come to an end, when the last family in a distinct branch has no daughters.

Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common matrilineal ancestor for all modern humans. Whenever one of the two most ancient branch lines dies out, the MRCA will move to a more recent female ancestor, always the most recent mother to have more than one daughter with living maternal line descendants alive today. The number of mutations that can be found distinguishing modern people is determined by two criteria: firstly and most obviously, the time back to her, but secondly and less obviously by the varying rates at which new branches have come into existence and old branches have become extinct. By looking at the number of mutations which have been accumulated in different branches of this family tree, and looking at which geographical regions have the widest range of least related branches, the region where Eve lived can be proposed.

==Popular reception and misconceptions==
''Newsweek'' reported on Mitochondrial Eve based on the Cann ''et al.'' study in January 1988, under a heading of "Scientists Explore a Controversial Theory About Man's Origins". The edition sold a record number of copies.&lt;ref name="oppenheimer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Oppenheimer, Stephen |title=The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn=0-7867-1334-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular name "mitochondrial Eve", of 1980s coinage,&lt;ref name=lew/&gt; has contributed to a number of popular misconceptions. At first, the announcement of a "mitochondrial Eve" was even greeted with endorsement from [[young earth creationism|young earth creationists]], who viewed the theory as a validation of the [[genesis creation story|biblical creation story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author = Wieland C |url= http://creation.com/mitochondrial-eve-and-biblical-eve-are-looking-good-criticism-of-young-age-is-premature|title=Mitochondrial Eve and biblical Eve are looking good: criticism of young age is premature| journal= Journal of Creation |volume= 19|issue=1 |pages= 57–59| year=2005}}

Due to such misunderstandings, authors of [[popular science]] publications since the 1990s have been emphatic in pointing out that the name is merely a popular convention, and that the mt-MRCA was not in any way the "first woman".&lt;ref name="Dawkins04"&gt;{{Citation |last =Dawkins |first = Richard |title=[[The Ancestor's Tale|The ancestor's tale: a pilgrimage to the dawn of evolution]] |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-618-00583-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her position is purely the result of genealogical history of human populations later, and as matrilineal lineages die out, the position of mt-MRCA keeps moving forward to younger individuals over time.

In ''[[River Out of Eden]]'' (1995), [[Richard Dawkins]] discussed human ancestry in the context of a "river of genes", including an explanation of the concept of Mitochondrial Eve.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1995"&gt;{{Citation|author=Richard Dawkins|title=River out of eden: a Darwinian view of life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=5 December 2011|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-06990-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not the only woman===
One common misconception surrounding mitochondrial Eve is that since all women alive today descended in a [[matrilineal|direct unbroken female line]] from her, she must have been the only woman alive at the time.&lt;ref name="Dawkins04"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Takahata93"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Takahata |first1=  N |title=Allelic genealogy and human evolution |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8450756 |doi= 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a039995|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8450756}}""&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[nuclear DNA]] studies indicate that the size of the ancient human population never dropped below tens of thousands. Other women living during Eve's time may have descendants alive today but not in a direct female line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Not a fixed individual over time===
The definition of mitochondrial Eve is fixed, but the woman in prehistory who fits this definition can change. That is, not only can our knowledge of when and where Mitochondrial Eve lived change due to new discoveries, but the actual mitochondrial Eve can change. The mitochondrial Eve can change, when a mother-daughter line comes to an end by chance. It follows from the definition of Mitochondrial Eve that she had at least two daughters who both have unbroken ''female'' lineages that have survived to the present day. In every generation mitochondrial lineages end&amp;nbsp;– when a woman with unique mtDNA dies with no daughters. When the mitochondrial lineages of daughters of mitochondrial Eve die out, then the title of "Mitochondrial Eve" shifts forward from the remaining daughter through her matrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had two or more daughters who together have all living humans as their matrilineal descendants. Once a lineage has died out it is irretrievably lost and this mechanism can thus only shift the title of "Mitochondrial Eve" forward in time.

Because mtDNA mapping of humans is very incomplete, the discovery of living mtDNA lines which predate our current concept of "Mitochondrial Eve" could result in the title moving to an earlier woman.  This happened to her male counterpart, "Y-chromosomal Adam," when older Y lines from Africa were discovered.

===Not necessarily a contemporary of "Y-chromosomal Adam"===
Sometimes mitochondrial Eve is assumed to have lived at the same time as [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] (from whom all living people are descended patrilineally), and perhaps even met and mated with him. Even if this were true, which is currently regarded as highly unlikely, this would only be a coincidence. Like mitochondrial "Eve", Y-chromosomal "Adam" probably lived in Africa. A recent study (March 2013) concluded however that "Eve" lived much later than "Adam"&amp;nbsp;– some 140,000 years later.&lt;ref name="adam2013" /&gt; (Earlier studies considered, conversely, that "Eve" lived earlier than "Adam".)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Not the most recent ancestor shared by all humans===
{{Main|Most recent common ancestor}}
Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common ''matrilineal'' ancestor, not the ''most recent common ancestor''. Since the mtDNA is inherited maternally and recombination is either rare or absent, it is relatively easy to track the ancestry of the lineages back to a MRCA; however, this MRCA is valid only when discussing mitochondrial DNA. An approximate sequence from newest to oldest can list various important points in the ancestry of modern human populations:
* [[most recent common ancestor|The human MRCA]]. [[Monte Carlo simulations]] suggest the MRCA was born surprisingly recently, perhaps even within the last 5,000 years, even for people born on different continents.&lt;ref name=Rodhe2004&gt;{{Citation|last1=Rohde|first1=DL|last2=Olson|first2=S|last3=Chang|first3 =JT|title=Modelling the recent common ancestry of all living humans|journal=Nature|volume=431|issue=7008|pages=562–66|date=September 2004 |pmid=15457259|doi=10.1038/nature02842|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..562R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[identical ancestors point]]. Just a few thousand years before the most recent single ancestor shared by all living humans was the time at which all humans who were then alive either left no descendants alive today or were common ancestors of all humans alive today.  In other words, "each present-day human has exactly the same set of genealogical ancestors" alive at the "identical ancestors point" in time. This is far more recent than when Mitochondrial Eve lived.&lt;ref name=Rodhe2004/&gt;
* Mitochondrial Eve, the most recent female-line common ancestor of all living people.
* "Y-chromosomal Adam", the most recent male-line common ancestor of all living people.

'''Mores''' ({{IPAc-en|'|m|ɔr|eɪ|z}} sometimes {{IPAc-en|'|m|ɔr|iː|z}};&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|mores}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Latin]] ''mōrēs'', {{IPA-all|ˈmoːreːs|}}, plural form of singular ''[[wikt:mos#Latin|mōs]]'', meaning 'manner, custom, usage, or habit') was introduced from English into American English by [[William Graham Sumner]] (1840–1910), an early U.S. [[sociologist]], to refer to [[Norm (social)|social norm]]s that are widely observed and are considered to have greater moral significance than others. Mores include an aversion for societal [[taboos]], such as [[incest]].&lt;ref name=Sociology&gt;{{cite book

'''Folkways''', in sociology, are norms for routine or casual interaction. This includes ideas about appropriate greetings and proper dress in different situations.&lt;ref name=Sociology /&gt;

In short, mores "distinguish the difference between right and wrong, while folkways draw a line between right and rude".&lt;ref name=Sociology /&gt;

Both "mores" and "folkways" are terms coined by William Graham Sumner in 1906.&lt;ref name=Sociology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{wiktionary pipe|mores#Etymology 1|mores}}

==Terminology==
The English word [[morality]] comes from the same Latin root "mōrēs", as does the English noun ''moral''. However, mores do not, as is commonly supposed, necessarily carry connotations of morality. Rather, morality can be seen as a subset of mores, held to be of central importance in view of their content, and often formalized in some kind of [[moral code]].

The Greek terms equivalent to Latin ''mores'' are ''[[ethos]]'' (ἔθος, ἦθος, 'character') or ''[[Law|nomos]]'' (νόμος, 'law'). As with the relation of ''mores'' to ''morality'', ''ethos'' is the basis of the term ''[[ethics]]'', ''nomos'' give the suffix ''-onomy'', as in [[:wikt:astronomy|astronomy]].

==Anthropology==
The meaning of all these terms extend to all customs of proper behavior in a given society, both religious and profane, from more trivial [[convention (norm)|conventional]] aspects of [[custom (law)|custom]], [[etiquette]] or [[politeness]]—"folkways" enforced by gentle social pressure, but going beyond mere "folkways" or conventions in including [[moral code]]s and notions of [[justice]]—down to strict [[taboo]]s, behavior that is unthinkable within the society in question, very commonly including [[incest]] and [[murder]], but also the commitment of outrages specific to the individual society such as [[blasphemy]]. Such religious or sacral customs may vary.

While [[cultural universals]] are by definition part of the ''mores'' of every society (hence also called "empty universals"), the customary norms specific to a given society are a defining aspect of the [[cultural identity]] of an [[ethnicity]] or a [[nation]]. Coping with the differences between two sets of cultural conventions is a question of [[intercultural competence]].

Differences in the ''mores'' of various nations are at the root of [[ethnic stereotype]], or in the case of reflection upon one's own ''mores'', autostereotypes.

[[File:Onion Metaphor - Social Penetration Theory.png|thumb|An onion model used in [[social penetration theory]]]]
The '''onion model''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]-based [[diagram]] template for describing an expanding or extending relationship between several concepts. The name is a [[metaphor]] of the layered shells that become visible when you cut open an [[onion]]. The outer layers in the model typically add size or complexity incrementally to the central layers.

The [[onion diagram]] can be presented as an [[Euler diagram]] or a stacked [[Venn diagram]]. For the record, a stacked Venn contains a series of sets A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; where each set A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a strict [[subset]] of A&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; (and by recursion, of all A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; where m &gt; n). However, as the onion is often used as a metaphor, it doesn't necessarily make sense to interpret the contents of an onion diagram literally or mathematically. 

This diagram format is supported e.g. by [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]'s [[SmartArt]] wizard under the name of "stacked Venn".

==In computing==
The onion model in computing is used as a metaphor for the complex structure of information systems. The system is split into layers to make it easier to understand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/MdRokibulIslam2/mis-management-information-system-lecture-1&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example is to start with the program, operating system and hardware layers. Each of these layers can then be subdivided.

[[Nilli Lavie]] presented the '''perceptual load theory''' in the mid-nineties as a potential resolution to the early/late selection debate.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Tsal|first2=Yehoshua|title=Perceptual load as a major determinant of the locus of selection in visual attention|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1994|volume=56|issue=2|pages=183–197|url=http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/Lavie%20&amp;%20Tsal_1994.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.3758/bf03213897}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= two&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|title=Perceptual load as a necessary condition for selective attention|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1995|volume=21|issue=3|pages=451–468|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fb33/666f554fca9ef4b0da105dc493a9c70edbe0.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.3.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate can be summated through two questions, firstly; when in the information processing stream does attention select target information? Secondly; to what degree do distractor stimuli get processed? Prior to Lavie’s theory there were several other suggestions as to how targets are perceived amongst distractor stimuli.

Researcher’s such as Donald Broadbent &lt;ref name= three&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broadbent|first1=Donald. E|title=Perception and Communication|date=1958|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that selection occurs during the early stages of processing by suggesting that information has to go through a sensory filter, and as that filter has a limited capacity all information that is not directly attended to will decay. Whilst researchers such as Deutsch and Deutsch argued that this filtering &lt;ref name= four&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=J. A.|last2=Deutsch|first2=D|title=Attention: some theoretical considerations|journal=Psychological Review|date=Jan 1963|volume=70|issue=1|pages=80–90|doi=10.1037/h0039515}}&lt;/ref&gt; of irrelevant stimuli occurs in the late stages of processing, in that, all of the information is processed on a sensory level but just before the level of working memory the semantic content of the message is the filter. 
Lavie attempts to resolve this debate by stating that both early and late selection occur varying on the stimulus presented.

From the perspective of perceptual load theory stimulus variation means whether the stimulus has high or low perceptual load. Perceptual load refers to the complexity of the physical stimuli, particularly the distractor stimuli e.g. a square surrounded by circles is a scene with low perceptual load whereas a square surrounded by lots of different shapes has high perceptual load. Due to the assumed limited capacity of attentional resources and that distractors have to be processed before the target it is suggested that, in high load tasks the targets attentional resources are depleted faster therefore being able to attend to the target sooner compared to a low load task. This is because the low load task needs to process more of the distractors to exhaust mental resources, therefore the distractors cause a greater inference in finding the target. This demonstrates that selection occurs both in the early stages of processing (high load condition) when the degree of inference is low as the majority of the resources process the target and enables the individual to ignore distractors. As well as the late stages (low load condition) when the distractors are perceived because they take up fewer attentional resources and as such spill over to the distractors which results in them being perceived, causing an interference.&lt;ref name= five&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartwright-finch|first1=Ula|last2=Lavie|first2=Nilli|title=The role of perceptual load in inattentional blindness|journal=Cognition|date=2007|volume=102|issue=3|pages=321–340|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.01.002|pmid=16480973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= six&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Hirst|first2=A|last3=de Fockhert|first3=J.

==Key assumptions==

Perceptual load theory makes three main assumptions, these are;&lt;ref name= one /&gt;&lt;ref name= two /&gt;

# Attentional resources are limited in capacity.
# Task-relevant stimuli are processed before task-irrelevant stimuli. 
# That all of the attentional resources have to be used up.

Therefore, if the task-relevant stimulus uses all of the attentional resources then none of the task-irrelevant stimuli (distractors) will be processed.

==Criticisms==

In spite of the collection of research that has accumulated over the 90’s and early 2000’s there has been a counter argument posited by Lavie’s PhD supervisor, Tsal Yehoshua. However, it should be noted that in spite of the relevance of Tsal’s critique some of the first critiques to the perceptual load theory pointed out how a visual cue can eliminate the inference effect supposedly created by perceptual load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D. N.|last2=McGrath|first2=A.|last3=McNeil|first3=C.|title=Cuing interacts with perceptual load in visual search|journal=Psychological Science|date=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=284–287|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00452|pmid=12009052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paquet|first1=L|last2=Craig|first2=G. L|title=Evidence for selective target processing with a low perceptual load flankers task|journal=Cognition|date=1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=182–189|doi=10.3758/bf03201111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution Effects===

Primarily; the critique that Tsal makes is that perceptual load theory is not a solution to the early selection versus late selection debate but rather is purely an early selection model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benoni|first1=H|last2=Tsal|first2=Y|title=Conceptual and methodological concerns in the theory of perceptual load|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2013|volume=4|page=522|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00522|pmid=23964262|pmc=3741554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggested reason that causes the inference rates to change between simple versus complex displays is dilution not load.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsal|first1=Y|last2=Benoni|first2=H|title=Where have we gone wrong? Perceptual load does not affect selective attention|journal=Vision Research|date=2010|volume=50|issue=13|pages=1292–1298|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.04.018|pmid=20430048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that the high load condition has lower inference because the higher number/more complex distractors, not because of perceptual load. This was tested in a series of experiments &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; which took the classic perceptual load experiments &lt;ref name= one /&gt; and added a new condition, the dilution condition. The way this condition varied is that it makes the distractors in the task the same colour, and making that colour differ from the target letter. This creates a condition that is low in load, and high in dilution and thus isolates dilution as a variable. The result of this manipulation was not that of a higher inference rate in low perceptual load conditions comparative to high as seen in the original perceptual load experiments. Rather that inference levels were significantly lower in the low load and dilution conditions compared to the high load.

===Distractor Salience===

Another proposed theory to explain results attained by Lavie’s original experiments is that of distractor salience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eltiti|first1=Stacy|last2=Wallace|first2=Denise|last3=Fox|first3=Elaine|title=Selective target processing: Perceptual load or distractor salience?|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=2005|volume=67|issue=5|pages=876–885|doi=10.3758/bf03193540}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests this theory concerns the salience, or prominence, of a distractor as being the primary factor in inducing these results instead of load. By manipulating the onset versus offset of the distractor, research displayed the effect of salience on selective information. In this research onset and offset differed in terms of when the distractor was presented, either simultaneously with the singleton search task (onset) or having it appear with a fixation point before the task (offset). This resulted in an inference effect on reaction times when searching for the target in the onset condition regardless of whether the trial was a high load trial or a low load trial. This demonstrates that the effect seen in Lavie’s work &lt;ref name= one /&gt; is not as a result of load manipulation, but of distractor salience.

===Methodological Issues===

There are also some crucial methodological issues with perceptual load theory research pertaining to experimental design.&lt;ref name= two /&gt;&lt;ref name= five /&gt;&lt;ref name= six /&gt;&lt;ref name= seven /&gt;&lt;ref name= eight /&gt; Specifically, the use of a blocked design compared to a mixed design in the experiments. In this case, blocked experimental design is when all of the trials with either low or high perceptual load are carried out sequentially within a block of trials. Whereas, a mixed experimental design has combination of both low and high perceptual load trials that are randomly intermixed within a block of trials. The issue with using a blocked design is that the repetition of the same experimental condition can allow for attention to be localised in one particular spot. Research has shown that when conducting a perceptual load task under a mixed design there is no significant difference in interference between low load and high load conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Janice E|last2=Jones|first2=Craig|title=Attention to local form information can prevent access to semantic information|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=2010|volume=55|issue=2|pages=609–625|doi=10.1080/02724980143000370|pmid=12047062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, suggesting that when the trials are blocked it is not perceptual load that causes the difference in interference rather how localised the participants field of attention was. This has since been expanded and developed by &lt;ref name= nineteen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Perceptual load vs. dilution: the roles of attentional focus, stimulus category, and target predictability|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=June 2013|volume=4|pages=1–14|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00327|pmid=23761777|pmc=3675768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Identifying Visual Targets Amongst Interfering Distractors: Sorting Out the Roles of Perceptual Load, Dilution, and Attentional Zoom|journal=Attention, Pereception, and Psychophsics|date=2016|volume=78|issue=7|pages=1822–38|doi=10.3758/s13414-016-1149-9|pmid=27250363}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be coined as ‘Attentional Zoom’.

===Attentional Zoom===

As previously discussed attentional zoom was coined by researchers Zhe Chen and Kyle Cave as an alternative explanation to the results seen in perceptual load theory. The pair also critique other attempts into understanding the data presented by perceptual load theory, such as dilution.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Attentional zoom theory states that participants can process distractors when they are within their attentional focus. So when an individual is induced to have a small attentional focus and the distractors fall outside of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eriksen|first1=Charles W|last2=St James|first2=J. D.|title=Visual attention within and around the field of focal attention: A zoom lens model|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1986|volume=40|issue=4|page=225|doi=10.3758/BF03211502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise for a larger attentional focus that incorporates distractors a higher level of inference is seen. This can be demonstrated as separate from dilution as in &lt;ref name= nineteen /&gt; dilution through luminance decrease had no effect on distractor processing whilst being cued as to whether a target would appear in either one of two locations or one of six did. According to dilution theory the two trials should be show similar levels of inference regardless of cueing, however, what this experiment reveals is that when cued for two locations the attentional focus of the participants narrowed, thus reducing the effect of the distractor as it was outside the attentional view. Whereas, when the target was cued for six the attentional focus was forced to widen and as such the distractor could be processed causing an inference effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">In [[propositional calculus]], a '''propositional function''' is a sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of [[logical truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]], except that within the sentence there is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] (''x'') that is not defined or specified, which leaves the statement undetermined. The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. ''n'' variables, in which case the function takes ''n'' arguments).

As a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], ''A''(''x'') or ''A''(''x''{{sub|1}}, ''x''{{sub|2}}, ..., ''x''{{sub|''n''}}), the propositional function is abstracted from [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] or propositional forms.  As an example, let's imagine the predicate, "x is hot".  The substitution of any entity for ''x'' will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though "''x'' is hot" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement.  However, when you assign ''x'' a value, such as [[lava]], the function then has the value ''true''; while if you assign ''x'' a value like [[ice]], the function then has the value ''false''.

Propositional functions are useful in [[set theory]] for the formation of [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. For example, in 1903 [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote in [[The Principles of Mathematics]] (page 106):
:"...it has become necessary to take ''propositional function'' as a [[primitive notion]].

Later Russell examined the problem of whether propositional functions were predicative or not, and he proposed two theories to try to get at this question: the zig-zag theory and the ramified theory of types.&lt;ref name="Tiles"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tiles |first=Mary |authorlink=Mary Tiles |title=The philosophy of set theory an historical introduction to Cantor's paradise |year=2004 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-486-43520-6 |page=159 |url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486435202.html |edition=Dover |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Propositional Function, or a predicate, in a variable ''x'' is a sentence ''p''(''x'') involving ''x'' that becomes a proposition when we give ''x'' a definite value from the set of values it can take.

According to [[Clarence Lewis]], "A [[proposition]] is any expression which is either true or false; a propositional function is an expression, containing one or more variables, which becomes a proposition when each of the variables is replaced by some [[logical value|one of its values]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Lewis]] (1918) ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'', page 232, [[University of California Press]], second edition 1932, Dover edition 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis used the notion of propositional functions to introduce [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, for example, a propositional function of ''n'' variables is a relation of [[arity]] ''n''. The case of ''n'' = 2 corresponds to [[binary relation]]s, of which there are homogeneous relations (both variables from the same set) and [[heterogeneous relation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7002">[[File:Self-regulated learning.png|thumb|300px|A feedback model of the motivation-volition process. Lower labels are terminology of Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=Schmitz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman/&gt;]]
In [[cognitive psychology|psychological]] theories of [[motivation]], the '''Rubicon model''', more completely the '''Rubicon model of action phases''', makes a distinction between motivational and volitional processes. The Rubicon model "defines clear boundaries between motivational and action phases". The first boundary "separates the motivational process of the predecisional phase from the volitional processes of postdecisional phase."&lt;ref name=Achtziger/&gt;  Another boundary is that between initiation and conclusion of an action.&lt;ref name=Achtziger/&gt; A self-regulatory feedback model incorporating these interfaces was proposed later by others, as illustrated in the figure.&lt;ref name=Schmitz/&gt;

The name "Rubicon model" derives from the tale of Caesar's [[Point of no return|crossing the Rubicon River]], a point of no return, thereby revealing his intentions. According to the Rubicon model, every action includes such a point of no return at which the individual moves from goal setting to goal striving.&lt;ref name=Rauber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Corno/&gt;
:"Once subjects move from planning and goal-setting to the implementation of plans, they cross a metaphorical Rubicon. That is, their goals are typically protected and fostered by self-regulatory activity rather than reconsidered or changed, often even when challenged."
::— Lyn Corno, ''The best laid plans'', p. 15 (quoted by Rauber)

The Rubicon model addresses four questions, as identified by Achtziger and [[Peter Gollwitzer|Gollwitzer]]:&lt;ref name=Achtziger/&gt;
#How do people select their goals?
#How do they plan the execution of their goals?
#How do they enact their plans?
#How do they evaluate their efforts to accomplish a specific goal?

The study of these issues is undertaken by both the fields of [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[social psychology]]. A possible connection between these approaches is brain imaging work attempting to relate volition to [[neuroanatomy]].&lt;ref name=Brass/&gt;

==Background==
Human action coordinates such aspects of human behavior as perception, thought, emotion, and skills to classify goals as attainable or unattainable and then to engage or disengage in trying to attain these goals. According to Heckhausen &amp; Heckhausen,&lt;ref name=Heckhausen/&gt; "Research based on the Rubicon model of action phases has provided a wealth of empirical evidence for mental and behavioral resources being orchestrated in this manner." Engagement and disengagement with goals affects personal distress over the unachievable. "By having new goals available, and reengaging in those new goals, a person can reduce distress....while continuing to derive a sense of purpose in life by finding other pursuits of value."&lt;ref name=Wrosch/&gt;

Most of her work concentrates on the reinterpretation of myths. Religious history, mythology, [[Flemish primitives]] painters and also [[mannerism]] provide both the varied sources of her inspiration and the raw materials for artistic explorations.

'''Sensory neuroscience''' is a subfield of [[neuroscience]] which explores the anatomy and physiology of [[neuron]]s that are part of [[sensory system]]s such as vision, hearing, and olfaction. Neurons in sensory regions of the brain respond to stimuli by firing one or more nerve impulses ([[action potential]]s) following stimulus presentation. How is information about the outside world [[neural encoding|encoded]] by the rate, timing, and pattern of action potentials? This so-called [[neural code]] is currently poorly understood and sensory neuroscience plays an important role in the attempt to decipher it. Looking at early sensory processing is advantageous since brain regions that are "higher up" (e.g. those involved in memory or emotion) contain neurons which encode more abstract representations. However, the hope is that there are unifying principles which govern how the brain encodes and processes information. Studying sensory systems is an important stepping stone in our understanding of brain function in general. 

==Typical experiments==
A typical experiment in sensory neuroscience involves the presentation of a series of relevant stimuli to an experimental subject while the subject's brain is being monitored.  This monitoring can be accomplished by noninvasive means such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) or [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), or by more invasive means such as [[electrophysiology]], the use of [[electrode]]s to record the electrical activity of single neurons or groups of neurons. fMRI measures changes in blood flow which related to the level of neural activity and provides low spatial and temporal resolution, but does provide data from the whole brain. In contrast,
Electrophysiology provides very high temporal resolution (the shapes of single [[Dendritic spike|spikes]] can be resolved) and data can be obtained from single cells. This is important since computations are performed within the [[dendrite]]s of individual neurons.

===Single neuron experiments===
In most of the [[central nervous system]], neurons communicate exclusively by sending each other [[action potential]]s, colloquially known as "spikes".  It is therefore thought that all of the information a [[sensory neuron]] encodes about the outside world can be inferred by the pattern of its spikes.  Current experimental techniques cannot measure individual spikes noninvasively.

A typical single neuron experiment will consist of isolating a neuron (that is, navigating the neuron until the experimentor finds a neuron which spikes in response to the type of stimulus to be presented, and (optionally) determining that all of the spikes observed indeed come from a single neuron), then presenting a stimulus protocol.  Because neural responses are inherently variable (that is, their spiking pattern may depend on more than just the stimulus which is presented, although not all of this variability may be true noise, since factors other than the presented stimulus may affect the sensory neuron under study), often the same stimulus protocol is repeated many times to get a feel for the variability a neuron may have.  One common analysis technique is to study the neuron's average time-varying firing rate, called its [[post stimulus time histogram]] or PSTH.&lt;ref name="Budai 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Budai| first1=D. | title=A computer-controlled system for post-stimulus time histogram and wind-up studies.| journal=J Neurosci Methods| volume=51| issue=2 | pages=205-11|date=Mar 1994 | PMID=8051951 | doi=10.1016/0165-0270(94)90012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Receptive field estimation==
One major goal of sensory neuroscience is to try to estimate the neuron's [[receptive field]]; that is, to try to determine which stimuli cause the neuron to fire in what ways.  One common way to find the receptive field is to use [[Regression analysis|linear regression]] to find which stimulus characteristics typically caused neurons to become excited or depressed.  Since the receptive field of a sensory neuron can vary in time (i.e. latency between the stimulus and the effect it has on the neuron) and in some spatial dimension (literally space for vision and somatosensory cells, but other "spatial" dimensions such as the frequency of a sound for auditory neurons), the term [[spatio temporal receptive field]] or STRF is often used to describe these receptive fields.&lt;ref name="Theunissen 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Theunissen| first1=FE.| last2=David| first2=SV.| last3=Singh| first3=NC. | last4=Hsu| first4=A.| last5=Vinje| first5=WE.| last6=Gallant| first6=JL.| title=Estimating spatio-temporal receptive fields of auditory and visual neurons from their responses to natural stimuli.| journal=Network| volume=12| issue=3| pages=289-316|date=Aug 2001| url=http://cocosci.dreamhosters.com/annehsu/papers/strfs.PDF | PMID=11563531 | doi=10.1080/net.12.3.289.316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural stimuli===
One recent trend in sensory neuroscience has been the adoption of natural stimuli for the characterization of sensory neurons.  There is good reason to believe that there has been [[evolution|evolutionary pressure]] on sensory systems to be able to represent natural stimuli well, so sensory systems may exhibit the most relevant behaviour in response to natural stimuli.  The adoption of natural stimuli in sensory neuroscience has been slowed by the fact that the mathematical descriptions of natural stimuli tend to be more complex than of simplified artificial stimuli such as simple tones or clicks in audition or line patterns in vision.  Free software is now available to help neuroscientists interested in estimating receptive fields cope with the difficulty of using natural stimuli.

Sensory neuroscience is also used as a bottom-up approach to studying consciousness.  For example, visual sense and representation has been studied by Crick and Koch (1998),&lt;ref name="Crick 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Crick| first1=F.|author-link=Francis Crick| last2=Koch| first2=C.| title=Consciousness and neuroscience| journal=Cereb Cortex| volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=97–107 |date=Mar 1998 | doi= 10.1093/cercor/8.2.97| pmid=9542889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and experiments have been suggested in order to test various hypotheses in this research stream.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6283">The '''subjective theory of value''' is a [[theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] which advances the idea that the [[value (economics)|value]] of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of his desired ends.&lt;ref&gt;Menger, C. ''Principles of Economics''.  [https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf p. 120]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern version of this theory was created independently and nearly simultaneously by [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[Léon Walras]], and [[Carl Menger]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="stigler"&gt;Stigler, George (1950) "The Development of Utility Theory. I" ''The Journal of Political Economy''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to the subjective theory of value, voluntary [[trade]]s between individuals imply that both parties to the trade subjectively perceive the goods, labour or money they receive as being of higher value to the goods, labour or money they give away. The subjective-value theory holds that one can create value simply by transferring ownership of a thing to someone who values it more highly, without necessarily modifying that thing. Where wealth is understood to refer to individuals' subjective valuation of their possessions, voluntary trades may increase the total wealth in society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-mariotti/subjective-versus-objecti_b_880274.html Steve Mariotti, "Subjective Versus Objective Costs: How the Labor Theory of Value Almost Destroyed the World"] 06/20/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals will tend to obtain diminishing levels of satisfaction, or [[marginal utility]] from acquiring additional units of a good. They will initially prioritise obtaining the goods they most need, such as sufficient food, but once their need for food is satisfied up to a certain level, their desire for other goods will start to assume more relative importance, and they will seek to bring satisfaction of their need for food into satisfaction of their need for other goods.&lt;ref name="menger2"&gt;Menger, C. ''Principles of Economics''. [https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf p. 127]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[free market]], [[competition]] between individuals seeking to trade goods they possess and services they can provide for goods they perceive as being of higher value to them results in a [[market equilibrium]] set of prices emerging. 

[[Classical economists]] such as [[David Ricardo]] believed that individual people obtain different levels of utility or 'value in use' from a service, but did not effectively connect those with market prices, or 'value in exchange', seeing them as separately derived from the quantity of labour input and other production factors.&lt;ref name="stigler" /&gt;  
 
Carl Menger argued that production was simply another case of the theory of marginal utility.&lt;ref name="stigler" /&gt; Labourers' wage-earning potential is set by the value of their work to others rather than subsistence costs, and they work because they value remuneration more highly than inactivity.&lt;ref name="menger"&gt;Menger, C. ''Principles of Economics''. [https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf pp. 169–73]&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein disagreed saying, "The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of [society's] evil... The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the means of production, the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid, both measured in terms of real value. In so far as the labor contract is "free," what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists' requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Why Socialism?|date=2018-03-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Why_Socialism%3F&amp;oldid=829021928|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diamond-water paradox ==
{{main|Paradox of value}}
The development of the subjective theory of value was partly motivated by the need to solve the value-paradox which had puzzled many classical economists. This paradox, also referred to descriptively as the diamond-water paradox, arose when value was attributed to things such as the amount of labor that went into the production of a good or alternatively to an objective measure of the usefulness of a good. The theory that it was the amount of labor that went into producing a good that determined its value proved equally futile because someone could stumble upon the discovery of a diamond while out for a hike, for example, which would require minimal labor, but yet the diamond could still be valued higher than water.

The subjective theory of value was able to solve this paradox by realizing that value is not determined by individuals choosing between entire abstract classes of goods, such as all the water in the world versus all the diamonds in the world. Rather an acting individual is faced with the choice between definite quantities of goods, and the choice made by such an actor is determined by which good of a specified quantity will satisfy the individual's highest subjectively ranked preference, or most desired end.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, Gene. [https://mises.org/resources/2031/Economics-for-Real-People "Economics for Real People"], 2004, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The theory of symbolic self-completion''' is a [[psychological theory]] which holds that individuals seek to acquire and display [[symbols]] that are strongly related to what they perceive as the ideal self.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wicklund|first1=Robert A.|last2=Gollwitzer|first2=Peter M.|title=Symbolic self-completion.|date=1982|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates|isbn=0898592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, relatively effeminate boys who want to appear macho may use products associated with manliness—such as a strong cologne or a silver watch—in hopes of symbolically fulfilling their self-definitions, i.e. becoming manly. Such cases of symbolic self-completion are seen in internet communication, marketing and advertising, and consumer behavior.

== Origins ==

The theory of symbolic self-completion has its origins in the [[symbolic interactionist]] school of thought. As expressed by [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]] in ''Mind, Self and Society'', symbolic interactionism suggests that the self is defined by the way that society responds to the individual.&lt;ref name="Mind, Self and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=George|title=Mind, Self and Society|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226516684|url=http://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/bu000001.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2014|ref=Mind, Self and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea helped shape the central ideas put forth in the book ''Symbolic Self-Completion'', which states that individuals tend to define themselves using symbols of accomplishment and that they use symbols to communicate their self-definitions to society.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; Depending on the area of self-definition to which these symbols pertain, a different self-definition is thus exhibited.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt;

''Self-definitional symbols'' are the objects that individuals use to communicate their self-definitions to society. Symbols can be both material and non-material, including anything ranging from utterances, behaviors, and socially recognized markers such as material possessions and social status.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun|first1=Ottmar L.|last2=Wicklund|first2=Robert A.|title=Psychological Antecedents of Conspicuous Consumption|journal=Journal of Economic Psychology|date=1989|volume=10|pages=161–187|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0167487089900184/1-s2.0-0167487089900184-main.pdf?_tid=9e3083e6-6693-11e4-9494-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1415374672_671bec4cc3ce98724c19e02e8233bd89|accessdate=7 November 2014|doi=10.1016/0167-4870(89)90018-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are defined as "any facet of the person that has the potential to signal to others (who understand the symbol as related to the identity) that one possesses the identity in question."&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt; Because it is through these symbols that individuals build their self-definitions around and communicate them to society, symbols are “the building blocks of self-definition.”&lt;ref name="Gollwitzer"/&gt; Thus, symbols are meaningful to individuals only insofar as they adequately represent individuals’ self-definitions, regarding the status of accomplishment in the areas individuals believe are important to their self-definitions. When individuals lack symbols to express their self-definitions, they seek to “display alternative symbols of attainment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmon-Jones|first1=Cindy|last2=Schmeichel|first2=Brandon J.|last3=Harmon-Jones|first3=Eddie|title=Symbolic self-completion in academia: Evidence from department web pages and email signature files|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=2009|volume=39|pages=311–316|url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_schmeichel_hj_EJSP_symbolic_self_completion.pdf|doi=10.1002/ejsp.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that when individuals are deficient in any self-definitional area, this deficiency produces a state of tension and a sense of incompleteness in their self-definitions.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; Individuals are motivated to reduce this tension by using alternate symbols of accomplishment in the relevant self-definitional area.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; In the study “Symbolic Self-completion, Attempted Influence, and Self-Deprecation,” Robert Wicklund, [[Peter Gollwitzer]] and [[James Hilton (academic administrator)|James Hilton]] asked participants to 1) write an essay teaching people how to perform an activity important to them and then 2) indicate how many people should be required to revise their essays. Results of this study showed that the fewer the years of education or experience participants seemed to have in their respective activities, the higher the number of people participants thought should be required to revise their essays.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gollwitzer|first1=Peter|last2=Wicklund|first2=Robert|title=Symbolic Self-Completion, Attempted Influence, and Self-Depreciation|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=2|issue=2|pages=89–114|url=http://www.interruptions.net/literature/Wicklund-BASP81.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2014|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp0202_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher this number was, the more participants put themselves in a position to influence others; researchers interpreted this relationship as a means of symbolic compensation for lacking the relevant self-definitional area.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt;

An additional part of this study asked a group of men to make a statement about their ability in the self-definitional area. Results of this part of the study showed that the less education and experience the men had, the less willing they were to provide a negative evaluation of themselves.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; This behavior remained consistent, even when the men were told that the attractive female confederate preferred men who were critical of themselves.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; This finding shows people are willing to self-symbolize even when they know the self-symbolizing behavior will be negatively received by society.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; Such findings indicate that individuals are more concerned with whether their behaviors will be reflective of their self-definitions than with whether the behaviors induce positive or negative judgments from others. Altogether, these findings indicate that “influencing others, as well as positive self-descriptions, can further the individual’s sense of having a complete self-definition.”&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt;

===Self-definitional threats===
Individuals' self-definitions can change for purposes of self-esteem protection and maintenance. These changes are likely to occur in consideration of the "relative performance and the psychological
similarity (closeness) and dissimilarity (distance) of others."&lt;ref name=Tesser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tesser|first1=Abraham|last2=Campbell|first2=Jennifer|title=Self-Definition: The Impact of the Relative Performance and Similarity of Others|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=Sep 1980|volume=43|issue=3|pages=341–347|jstor=3033737|doi=10.2307/3033737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain dimensions of individuals' self-definitions can become "less self-definitional" when others who are psychologically similar to them outperforms them in those areas.&lt;ref name="Tesser"/&gt; As such, self-definitions lend themselves to change—however, individuals may opt to strengthen their self-definitions in the face of self-definitional threats. ''Self-definitional threat'' refers to a situation in which individuals feel their identities are uncertain or threatened or they feel insecure in an identity they are committed to.&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Dr. Simon|title=Symbolic Self Completion Theory|url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=292|website=Psychlopedia|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, individuals are more likely to value symbols that reinforce those identities.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The study “Reactions to self-discrepant feedback: Feminist attitude and symbolic self-completion” shows how a threat to one’s identity also motivates individuals to engage in symbolic self-completion as a means of reducing the tension it causes.&lt;ref name="feminist study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiffmann|first1=Rudolf|last2=Nelkenbrecher|first2=Doris|title=Reactions to self-discrepant feedback: Feminist attitude and symbolic self-completion|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=317–327|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420240209/abstract|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420240209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers Rudolf Schiffmann and Doris Nelkenbrecher asked a group of feminist participants to subscribe to a feminist journal after being given feedback on their feminist attitudes.&lt;ref name="feminist study" /&gt; The women who were described as less feminist were more likely to subscribe to the feminist journal as a means of symbolically “completing” their self-definition.&lt;ref name="feminist study" /&gt;

Related to this study is "Psychological Antecedents of Conspicuous Consumption" by Ottmar L. Braun and Wicklund. This study was conducted in six separate studies, the first of which involved interviews of law students and attorneys. This first part of the study found that law students were more likely than practicing attorneys to think that it is important to have the "outward manifestations of an attorney," supporting the idea that individuals "striving toward a particular identity" and are "more inexperienced in that identity realm" are more prone to claim that they "can be recognized as belonging to that identity."&lt;ref name=Braun /&gt;

==Applications==

===Symbolic self-completion in Internet communication===
More recent studies have shown how symbolic self-completion influences individuals' communication in online media platforms. For example, Cindy and Eddie Harmon-Jones and Brandon Schmeichel have shown how individuals’ need for self-definition affects whether they share symbols of self-definitional attainment online.&lt;ref name="internet study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmon-Jones|first1=Cindy|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=Eddie|last3=Brandon|first3=Schmeichel|title=Symbolic self-completion in academia: Evidence from department web pages and email signature files|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2008|volume=39|pages=311–316|url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_schmeichel_hj_EJSP_symbolic_self_completion.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.1002/ejsp.541}}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers examined academic web pages and email signature files to see what types of academic departments and professors were more likely to enlist professional titles.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt; The researchers found that the lower an academic department was ranked within National Research Council Rankings, the higher the number of professional titles the professors in that department displayed in their websites.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt; Similarly, the lower the annual rate of publications and citations professors seemed to have, the higher the number of professional titles they enlisted in their email signatures. These correlations suggest that the enlistment of professional titles online serve as alternate symbols of accomplishment in their self-definitional areas; the more they felt they were lacking in a certain area, the more likely they were to engage in symbolic self-completion online regarding that particular area.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt;

=== Symbolic self-completion in advertising ===
[[File:Old spice deodorant body spray.jpg|thumb|Old spice deodorant body spray]]
The theory of symbolic self-completion has direct application in the [[advertisement]] industry. The [[mass media|media]] leads consumers to equate advertised products targeting their feelings of “incompleteness” with self-definitional symbols to make up for that incompleteness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliott|first1=Richard|last2=Wattanasuwan|first2=Kritsadarat|title=Consumption and the Symbolic Project of the Self|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=11147|website=acrwebsite.org|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|accessdate=31 October 2014|ref=(10)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symbols that each consumer ascribes to may be different in every case, these symbols as a whole can nonetheless be used to improve the individual consumers' perception of themselves. The product-symbols give some consumers a sense of completeness, since “self-perceptions are influenced by product use/ownership when the product has a strong user image and the consumer does not have a well formed self-image.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Newell|last2=Claiborne|first2=C.|last3=Sirgy|first3=M.|title=The Effects of Product Symbolism on Consumer Self Concept|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=7315|website=acrwebsite.org|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|accessdate=31 October 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a deodorant advertisement may appeal to a male consumer's self-definitional need for masculinity, by suggesting that he will become more masculine if he uses the deodorant advertised.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; The Old Spice brand famously uses phrases such as "smell like a man, man" when advertising their products. The "Smell Like A Man, Man" campaign led to Old Spice becoming the number one brand of deodorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smell Like A Man, Man Campaign|url=https://www.pg.com/en_US/downloads/innovation/factsheet_OldSpice.pdf|website=P&amp;G|publisher=Procter and Gamble|accessdate=21 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By displaying these product-symbols, consumers improve their sense of self and feel more confident about how others might perceive them.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

=== Symbolic self-completion and materialism ===
Braun and Wicklund suggest that there is a "compensatory relation between person's security" and certain kinds of conspicuous consumption, but that these relations cannot exist without individuals' perceived "incompleteness [of]" and "commitment to the identity in question."&lt;ref name=Braun /&gt; Thus, much of what is colloquially referred to as the “mid-life crisis” can be explained by the theory of symbolic self-completion. A classic example of the mid-life crisis is a 40-year-old man buying a red sports car. The man is unsure as to whether he has made the right choices in his life and if he has been leading a successful career. The man then counters his insecurity by purchasing a material object that functions as a status symbol, something that both he and others will recognize as a mark of success.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The relationship between self-completion theory and materialism is further shown through individuals' tendency to externalize their concerns about their lives by acquiring symbol-objects that reinforce and improve their self-definitions.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; In terms of goods/objects as individuals' status symbols, greater emphasis is placed on tangible, material objects, as they can be recognized and understood as status symbols by a wider audience than are intangible and abstract ideas. In the same vein, materialism reinforces symbolic self-completion particularly in a societies that are structure in such a way that the consumption of prestigious objects is seen as the best remedy for insecurity. This reinforcement is due to the fact that in such societies, individuals see material wealth as the best source of comforting reassurance to counter insecurity&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The Circumplex Model is a graphical representation of emotional states. Fundamentally, it is a circle with pleasant on the left, unpleasant on the right, activation on the top, and deactivation on the bottom. All the other emotions are placed around the circle as combinations of these four basic states. It is based on the theory that people experience emotions as overlapping and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2367156|year=2005|author1=Posner|first1=J|title=The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=715–734|last2=Russell|first2=J. A.|last3=Peterson|first3=B. S.|doi=10.1017/S0954579405050340|pmid=16262989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics are the distinctive behaviors and attitudes observed by people in groups, and the study thereof. It is of most interest in the business world, the workforce, or any other setting where the performance of a group is important. [[Joseph E McGrath]] enlarged the circumplex model to include group dynamics, based on the work of Shaw, Carter, Hackman, Steiner, Shiflett, Taylor, Lorge, Davis, Laughlin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF GROUP TASK TYPES|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/mcgrath_groupinteractperfom_1984.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four quadrants in this model representing: generating a task, choosing correct procedure, conflict resolution, and execution, and again there are subtypes distributed around the circle. He used this model as a research tool to evaluate group task performance.

== Group dynamics ==
[[Group dynamics]] involve the influential actions, processes and changes that exist both within and between groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Group dynamics
| last = Forsyth
| first = D. R.
| publisher = Wadsworth
| year = 2009

| location = New York
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics also involve the scientific study of group processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through extensive research in the field of group dynamics, it is now well known that all groups, despite their innumerable differences, possess common properties and dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychological researchers have attempted to organize these commonalities, in order to further understand the genuine nature of group processes.

For instance, social psychological research indicates that there are numerous goal-related interactions and activities that groups of all sizes undertake . These interactions have been categorized by [[Robert F. Bales]], who spent his entire life attempting to find an answer to the question, "What do people do when they are in groups?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To simplify the understanding of group interactions, Bales concluded that all interactions within groups could be categorized as either a ''relationship interaction'' (or socioemotional interaction) or a ''task interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Bales
| first = R. F.
| publisher = Transaction
| year = 1999
| isbn = 
| location = New Brunswick, NJ
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Just as Bales was determined to identify the basic types of '''interactions''' involved in groups, [[Joseph E. McGrath]] was determined to identify the various '''goal-related activities''' that are regularly displayed by groups. McGrath contributed greatly to the understanding of group dynamics through the development of his '''circumplex model of group tasks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = McGrath
| first = J. E.
| publisher = Prentice Hall
| year = 1984
| isbn = 
| location = Upper Saddle River, NJ
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intended, McGrath's model effectively organizes all group-related activities by distinguishing between four basic group goals. These goals are referred to as the circumplex model of group task's four quadrants, which are categorized based on the dominant performance process involved in a group's task of interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

| first = Joseph E.

| first2 = David A.
| date = 1982

| doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.33.020182.001211
| pmid = 
| access-date = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown ===
The four quadrants are as follows: 
# '''''Generating''' ideas or plans''
# '''''Choosing''' a solution''
# '''''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict'' 
# '''''Executing''' a task''

To further differentiate the various goal-related group activities, McGrath further sub-divides these four categories, resulting in eight categories in total. The breakdown of these categories is as follows:

1. &lt;u&gt;'''''Generating''' ideas or plans''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 1&lt;/u&gt;''' – Planning tasks''
** E.g. Generating plans
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 2&lt;/u&gt;''' – Creativity tasks''
** E.g. Generating ideas
2. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Choosing''' a solution&lt;/u&gt;''
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 3&lt;/u&gt;''' – Intellective tasks''
** E.g. Solving problems with correct answers
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 4&lt;/u&gt;''' – Decision-making tasks''
** E.g. Deciding issues with no right answer
3. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 5&lt;/u&gt;''' – Cognitive conflict tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of viewpoints 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 6&lt;/u&gt;''' – Mixed-motive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of interest 
4. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Executing''' a task&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 7&lt;/u&gt;''' – Contests/battles/competitive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of power 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 8&lt;/u&gt;''' – Performance/psychomotor tasks''
** E.g. Executing performance tasks

=== Details ===
According to [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] and [[Kravitz]] (1982),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the four most commonly represented tasks in the group dynamics literature are intellective tasks, decision-making tasks, cognitive conflict tasks and mixed-motive tasks.

The circumplex model of group tasks takes the organization of goal-related activities a step further by distinguishing between tasks that involve cooperation between group members, cooperation tasks (Types 1, 2, 3 and 8) and tasks that often lead to conflict between group members, conflict tasks (Types 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, McGrath's circumplex model of group tasks also distinguishes between tasks that require action (behavioural tasks) and tasks that require conceptual review (conceptual tasks). 'Behavioural tasks' include Types 1, 6, 7 and 8, while 'conceptual tasks' include Types 2, 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Visual representation ==
The circumplex model of group tasks is, evidently, a very detailed and complex model. To allow for a more thorough understanding of its properties, a visual representation of the model has been developed. (Need a diagram of the model)

== Further explanation ==
Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Straus
| first = Susan G.
| last2 = McGrath
| first2 = Joseph E.
| date = 1994
| title = Does the medium matter? The interaction of task type and technology on group performance and member reactions
| url = 
| journal = Journal of Applied Psychology
| doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.79.1.87
| pmid = 
| access-date = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four quadrants and the various task types with which they contain all relate to one another within a two-dimensional space. More specifically, [[Susan G. Stratus|Stratus]] and [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] (1994)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; states that the horizontal dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflect the extent to which a task entails cognitive versus behavioural performance requirements. Likewise, the vertical dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflects the extent and form of interdependence among members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Whitelisting''' is the practice of identifying entities that are provided a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition.  Entities on the list will be accepted, approved and/or recognized. Whitelisting is the reverse of [[blacklist]]ing, the practice of identifying entities that are denied, unrecognised, or ostracised.

==Email whitelists==

[[Spam filter]]s that come with [[email client]]s have both whitelists and blacklists of senders and [[Index term|keyword]]s to look for in emails. If a [[spamming|spam]] filter keeps a whitelist, mail from the listed [[email address]]es, [[domain name|domains]] email from being deleted or sent to the junk mail folder by the spam filter. Usually, only end-users would set a spam filter to delete all emails from sources not on the whitelist, not Internet service providers or email services.

Using whitelists and blacklists can assist in blocking unwanted messages and allowing wanted messages to get through, but they are not perfect. Email whitelists are used to reduce the incidence of [[Type I and type II errors|false positives]], often based on the assumption that most legitimate mail will be from a relatively small and fixed set of senders. To block a high percentage of spam, email filters have to be continuously updated as email spam senders create new email addresses to email from or new keywords to use in their email which allows the email to slip through.

[[Amazon.com]] uses whitelists to limit access to its [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-reader devices. Besides Amazon itself, only e-mail addresses whitelisted by the device's registered owner can send content ("personal documents") to that device.

===Non-commercial whitelists===
Non-commercial whitelists are operated by various non-profit organisations, ISPs and others interested in blocking spam. Rather than paying fees, the sender must pass a series of tests; for example, his email server must not be an [[open relay]] and have a [[static IP address]]. The operator of the whitelist may remove a server from the list if complaints are received.

===Commercial whitelists===
Commercial whitelists are a system by which an [[Internet service provider]] allows someone to bypass [[spam filter]]s when sending [[email]] messages to its subscribers, in return for a pre-paid fee, either an annual or a per-message fee. A sender can then be more confident that his messages have reached their recipients without being blocked, or having links or images stripped out of them, by spam filters. The purpose of commercial whitelists is to allow companies to reliably reach their customers by email.

Commercial providers include [[Return Path, Inc.|Return Path]] Certification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returnpath.net/commercialsender/certification/|title=Email Certification – Email Sender Certification – Return Path - Return Path|work=returnpath.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; eco's [[Certified Senders Alliance]], and the [[Spamhaus|Spamhaus Whitelist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spamhauswhitelist.com|title=The Spamhaus Whitelist|work=spamhauswhitelist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-publicized and controversial commercial whitelists services at present is ''CertifiedEmail'' by Goodmail Systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodmailsystems.com/|title=Good Mail Systems •|work=Good Mail Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has made headlines since February 2006 when [[AOL]] and [[Yahoo]] announced plans to implement it. AOL has stated that mail from senders who qualified as legitimate senders and who have prepaid 0.10 cents per message will be delivered directly to users' mailboxes without being subject to spam filters. AOL has announced that it will pay the fee for non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.com/AOL-to-pay-e-mail-tab-for-nonprofits/2100-1038_3-6045671.html | title=AOL to pay e-mail tab for nonprofits | publisher=[[CNET]] | first=Greg | last=Sandoval | date=March 3, 2006 | accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The messages will be clearly identified to the user as having come from a trusted source. These senders must pass a system of accreditation with Goodmail, and their messages must only be sent to people who have a pre-existing business relationship with the sender. If a sender sends a message to a user who has not previously agreed to receive it, AOL may entirely block the sender.

AOL asserts that free email on AOL's service will continue to work as it always has, and a user will continue to receive all messages from a sender whom he has whitelisted. AOL subscribers will not be charged for sending or receiving email, and senders who do not prepay AOL will have their messages subject to the same spam filters as before.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[MoveOn]] organized a protest of AOL's use of commercial whitelists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://civic.moveon.org/mediaaction/alerts/Stop_AOL_email_scheme.html | title=Stop AOL email scheme | publisher=[[MoveOn]] | date=February 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/emailtax.asp | title=An examination of MoveOn's claims | publisher=[[Urban Legends Reference Pages]] | date=February 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It characterizes the program as an "email tax", and claims that AOL is giving spammers a direct route into users' mailboxes, while attempting to move more people to paid email by causing a larger amount of legitimate unpaid email to be rejected by the spam filters.

CertifiedEmail has been adopted by seven of the top 10 ISPs in the USA: AOL, [[AT&amp;T]], [[Comcast]], Cox, Road Runner, [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

According to Comcast, Goodmail has ceased operations and as of February 4, 2011 Comcast will no longer use the service.&lt;ref&gt;http://security.comcast.net/certifiedemail/?cid=NET_33_1210&amp;fss=certified%20email&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising whitelists ==
A common form of whitelisting has emerged through internet advertisements and [[ad blocking|ad blockers]]. Many websites rely on ads as a source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adspeed.com/Blog/Pros-cons-relying-advertising-revenue-1808.html|title=Pros and cons of relying only on advertising revenue {{!}} AdSpeed AdServer|website=www.adspeed.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example of requiring an advertisement whitelist is Forbes. When clicking on an article from Forbes, if an ad-blocker is enabled on the browser, they require it to be disabled. In other words, Forbes requires readers to whitelist them via ad-blockers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/adblock/instructions/#18c6e42f2739|title=Adblock Instructions|website=Forbes|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LAN whitelists==
Another use for whitelists is [[local area network]] (LAN) security. Many network admins set up [[MAC address]] whitelists, or a MAC address filter, to control who is allowed on their networks. This is used when encryption is not a practical solution or in tandem with encryption. However, it's sometimes ineffective because a [[MAC spoofing|MAC address can be faked]].

Some firewalls can be configured to only allow data-traffic from/ to certain (ranges of) IP-addresses.

==Program whitelists==
If an organization keeps a whitelist of [[software]], only titles on the list will be accepted for use. The benefits of whitelisting in this instance are that the organization can ensure itself that users will not be able to download and/or use programs that have not been deemed appropriate for use.

==Application whitelists==
An emerging approach in combating viruses and malware is to whitelist software which is considered safe to run, blocking all others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/analysts_program/McAfee_09_App_Whitelisting.pdf|title=SANS Institute: Reading Room - Analyst Papers|website=www.sans.org|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was first implemented in a modern operating system by Dr. John Harrison, an American computer scientist.&lt;ref&gt;John Harrison, ''Enhancing Network Security By Preventing User-Initiated Malware Execution'', Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing (ITCC'05) (Wireless Ad Hoc/Sensor Networks and Network Security Track), Volume II - Volume 02; pages 597-602; IEEE Computer Society Washington, DC, USA 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some deem this superior to the standard signature-based, anti-virus approach of blocking/removing known harmful software (essentially blacklisting), as the standard approach generally means that exploits are already in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=160433|title=Dark Reading - Security - Protect The Business - Enable Access|work=Dark Reading}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Application-Whitelisting-Gains-Traction/|title=Application Whitelisting Gains Traction|work=eweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading providers of application whitelisting technology include [[Carbon Black (company)|Bit9]],[[Velox]],[[McAfee]], and [[Lumension Security|Lumension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://security-architect.blogspot.com/2014/02/lessons-learned-from-target-attack.html|title = Lessons Learned from Target Breach|date = February 8, 2014|accessdate = July 18, 2014|website = Security-Architect Blog|publisher = Dan Blum|last = Blum|first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These products may provide administrative control over program whitelists in addition to preventing introduction of new malware.&lt;ref&gt;

Among Unix Operating system variants, HP-UX has introduced a feature called "'''HP-UX Whitelisting'''" on 11iv3 version. HP-UX Whitelisting (WLI) offers file and system resource protection based on RSA encryption technology. WLI is complementary to the traditional UNIX discretionary access controls (DAC) based on user, group, and file permissions. The more granular DAC access control list (ACL) permissions available on VxFS and HFS file systems are likewise not affected.

Among Windows Operating systems, Microsoft has introduced a new feature in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 called "'''[[AppLocker|Windows AppLocker]]'''". Windows AppLocker allows administrators to control which executable files are denied or allowed to execute.  With AppLocker, administrators are able to create rules based on file names, publishers or file location that will allow certain files to execute.  Rules can apply to individuals or groups.  Policies are used to group users into different enforcement levels.  For example, some users can be added to report only policy that will allow administrators to understand the impact before moving that user to a higher enforcement level.

However, application level whitelisting is still vulnerable to a variety of attacks including those that make use of PowerShell or cross site scripting to launch scripts or inject malicious .DLLs onto an endpoint.  Lower level whitelisting approaches that can monitor the specific processes and API calls are the deepest and strongest whitelist based cybersecurity solutions available today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17030">'''Writing assessment''' refers to an area of study that contains theories and practices that guide the evaluation of a writer's performance or potential through a writing task. Writing assessment can be considered a combination of scholarship from [[composition studies]] and measurement theory within [[educational assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. "Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States" ''Assessing Writing'' 16 (2011) 189-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing assessment can also refer to the [[technologies]] and practices used to evaluate student writing and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Huot, B. &amp; Neal, M. (2006). Writing assessment: A techno-history. In C. A. MacArthur, S. Graham, &amp; J. Fitzgerald (Eds.), Handbook of Writing Research (pp. 417-432). New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==

Writing assessment began as a classroom practice during the first two decades of the 20th century, though [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes]] and [[Standardized testing|standardized tests]] also emerged during this time.&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia"&gt;Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. "Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States" ''Assessing Writing'' 16 (2011) 189-211&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, [[College Board]] shifted from using direct writing assessment to indirect assessment because these tests were more cost-effective and were believed to be more reliable.&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia" /&gt; Starting in the 1950s, more students from diverse backgrounds were attending colleges and universities, so administrators made use of standardized testing to decide where these students should be placed, what and how to teach them, and how to measure that they learned what they needed to learn.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen"&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act." ''College Composition and Communication''. 50.3 (1999): 483-503. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The large-scale statewide writing assessments that developed during this time combined direct writing assessment with [[Multiple choice|multiple-choice]] items, a practice that remains dominant today across U.S. large scale testing programs, such as the [[SAT]] and [[GRE]].&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia" /&gt; These assessments usually take place outside of the classroom, at the state and national level. However, as more and more students were placed into courses based on their standardized testing scores, writing teachers began to notice a conflict between what students were being tested on—[[grammar]], [[usage]], and [[vocabulary]]—and what the teachers were actually teaching—[[writing process]] and revision.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Because of this divide, educators began pushing for writing assessments that were designed and implemented at the local, programmatic and classroom levels.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huot, Brian. ''(Re)Articulating Writing Assessment for Teaching and Learning.'' Logan, Utah: Utah State UP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; As writing teachers began designing local assessments, the methods of assessment began to diversify, resulting in timed essay tests, locally designed rubrics, and portfolios. In addition to the classroom and programmatic levels, writing assessment is also hugely influential on [[Writing center|writing centers]] for [[writing center assessment]], and similar academic support centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Hard Questions Are Asked: Evaluating Writing Centers.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED416479|language = en|first = James H.|last = Bell|journal = The Writing Center Journal|volume = 21.1|pages = 7–28|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Because writing assessment is used in multiple [[Context (language use)|contexts]], the history of writing assessment can be traced through examining specific concepts and [[rhetorical situation|situation]]s that prompt major shifts in theories and practices. Writing assessment [[scholars]] do not always agree about the origin of writing assessment.

In "Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act," [[Kathleen Blake Yancey]] offers a history of writing assessment by tracing three major shifts in [[Methodology|methods]] used in assessing writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; She describes the three major shifts through the [[metaphor]] of overlapping [[wave|waves]]: "with one wave feeding into another but without completely displacing waves that came before". In other words, the theories and practices from each wave are still present in some current contexts, but each wave marks the prominent theories and practices of the time.

The first wave of writing assessment (1950-1970) sought [[objective test]]s with indirect measures of assessment. The second wave (1970-1986) focused on [[holistic grading|holistically scored tests]] where the students' actual writing began to be assessed. And the third wave (since 1986) shifted toward assessing a collection of student work (i.e. portfolio assessment) and programmatic assessment.

Bob Broad in ''What We Really Value''&lt;ref&gt;Broad, Bob. ''What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing''. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; points to the publication of ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability'' in 1961 by Diederich, French, and Carlton as the birth of modern writing assessment. Diederich, French, and Carlton based much of their book on research conducted through the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) for the previous decade. This book is an attempt to [[standardization|standardize]] the assessment of writing and, according to Broad, created a base of research in writing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability. Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major concepts==

===Validity and reliability===
Yancey traces the major shifts in writing assessment by pointing toward each wave's swing toward or away from the concepts of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]].&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking Back as We Look Forward"&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy O'Neill, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot explain in ''A Guide To College Writing Assessment'' that reliability and validity are the most important terms in discussing best practices in writing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Peggy, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot. A Guide to College Writing Assessment. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first wave of writing assessment, the emphasis is on [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking back as We Look Forward"&lt;/ref&gt; reliability confronts questions over the consistency of a test. In this wave, the central concern was to assess writing with the best predictability with the least amount of cost and work.

The shift toward the second wave marked a move toward considering principles of [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Validity confronts questions over a test's appropriateness and effectiveness for the given purpose. Methods in this wave were more concerned with a test's [[construct validity]]: whether the material prompted from a test is an appropriate measure of what the test purports to measure. Teachers began to see an incongruence between the material being prompted to measure writing and the material teachers were asking students to write. [[holistic grading|Holistic scoring]], championed by Edward M. White, emerged in this wave. It is one method of assessment where students' writing is prompted to measure their writing ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Holisticism." ''College Composition and Communication,'' 35 (December, 1984): 400-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third wave of writing assessment emerges with continued interest in the validity of assessment methods. This wave began to consider an expanded definition of validity that includes how portfolio assessment contributes to learning and teaching. In this wave, portfolio assessment emerges to emphasize theories and practices in [[Composition studies|Composition and Writing Studies]] such as [[revision (writing)|revision]], drafting, and [[writing process|process]].

===Direct and indirect assessment===
Indirect writing assessments typically consist of multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Examples include [[High stakes testing|high-stakes]] standardized tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], [[SAT]], and [[GRE]], which are most often used by colleges and universities for [[College admissions|admissions]] purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass and [[Accuplacer#Accuplacer|Accuplacer]], are used to [[Placement testing|place]] students into [[Remedial education|remedial]] or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like the timed essay test, require at least one sample of student writing and
are viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual samples of writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces of student writing written over the course of a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple samples of student writing that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple samples of student writing and multiple drafts of a single essay.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;

===As technology===

==Methods==
Methods of writing assessment vary depending on the context and type of assessment. The following is an incomplete list of writing assessments frequently administered:

===Portfolio===
Portfolio assessment is typically used to assess what students have learned at the end of a course or over a period of several years. Course portfolios consist of multiple samples of student writing and a reflective letter or essay in which students describe their writing and work for the course.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Kimberly. "Rethinking Genres of Reflection: Student Portfolio Cover Letters and the Narrative of Progress." ''Composition Studies'' 31.1 (2003): 43-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NealMichael"&gt;Neal, Michael. ''Writing Assessment and the Revolution in Digital Texts and Technologies.'' NY: Teachers College, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Edward. "The Scoring of Writing Portfolios: Phase 2." ''College Composition and Communication'' 56.4 (2005): 581-599.&lt;/ref&gt; "Showcase portfolios" contain final drafts of student writing, and "process portfolios" contain multiple drafts of each piece of writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen_a"&gt;Yancey, Kathleen. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios: Theoretical Issues in the Representation of Student Work." ''ePortfolio Performance Support Systems: Constructing, Presenting, and Assessing Portfolios.'' Eds Katherine V. Wills and Rich Rice. Fort Collins, Colorado: WAC Clearinghouse. Web. 16 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Both print and electronic portfolios can be either showcase or process portfolios, though electronic portfolios typically contain [[hyperlink]]s from the [[Reflective writing|reflective essay]] or letter to samples of student work and, sometimes, outside sources.&lt;ref name="NealMichael" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen_a" /&gt;

===Timed-essay===
[[Test (assessment)#Essay|Timed essay tests]] were developed as an alternative to multiple choice, indirect writing assessments. Timed essay tests are often used to place students into writing courses appropriate for their skill level. These tests are usually [[proctor]]ed, meaning that testing takes place in a specific location in which students are given a prompt to write in response to within a set time limit. The SAT and GRE both contain timed essay portions.

===Rubric===
A [[rubric]] is a [[tool]] used in writing assessment that can be used in several writing contexts. A rubric consists of a set of criteria or descriptions that guides a rater to [[Test score|score]] or [[grading (education)|grade]] a writer. The origins of rubrics can be traced to early attempts in education to [[standardization|standardize]] and scale writing in the early 20th century. Ernest C Noyes argues in November 1912 for a shift toward assessment practices that were more science-based. One of the original scales used in education was developed by Milo B. Hillegas in ''A Scale for the Measurement of Quality in English Composition by Young People''. This scale is commonly referred to as the Hillegas Scale. The Hillegas Scale and other scales used in education were used by administrators to compare the progress of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. "On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate" ''The English Journal'' Vol 97. No. 4. (Mar. 2008) pp 87-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Diederich, French, and Carlton from the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) publish Factors in Judgments for Writing Ability a rubric compiled from a series of raters whose comments were categorized and condensed into a five-factor rubric:&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ideas'': relevance, clarity, quantity, development, persuasiveness
*''Form'': Organization and analysis
*''Flavor'': style, interest, sincerity
*''Mechanics'': specific errors in [[punctuation]], [[grammar]], etc. 
*''Wording'': choice and arrangement of words

As rubrics began to be used in the classroom, teachers began to advocate for criteria to be negotiated with students to have students stake a claim in the how they would be assessed. Scholars such as Chris Gallagher and Eric Turley,&lt;ref&gt;Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. "On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate"&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Broad,&lt;ref&gt;Broad, Bob. ''What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing''&lt;/ref&gt; and Asao Inoue&lt;ref&gt;Inoue, Asao B. "Community-based Assessment Pedagogy." Assessing Writing. 9 (2005): 208-38. Web. 23 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (among many) have advocated that effective use of rubrics comes from local, contextual, and negotiated criteria.

===Multiple-choice test===
[[Multiple choice|Multiple-choice]] tests contain questions about [[usage]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]]. Standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are typically used for college or graduate school admission. Other tests, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are typically used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses.

===Automated essay scoring===

[[Automated essay scoring]] (AES) is the use of non-human, computer-assisted assessment practices to rate, score, or grade writing tasks.

==Race==
Some scholars in writing assessment focus their research on the influence of [[race (human classification)|race]] on the performance on writing assessments. Scholarship in race and writing assessment seek to study how categories of race and perceptions of race continues to shape writing assessment outcomes. However, scholars in writing assessment recognize that [[color blindness (race)|racism in the 21st century is no longer explicit]],&lt;ref&gt;Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. ''Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; LittleField Publishers, Inc., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but point out that writing assessment practices are silently racist. Nicholas Behm and Keith D. Miller in "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-Blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;Behm, Nicholas, and Keith D. Miller. "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship." Race and Writing Assessment. Asao B. Inoue, and Mya Poe, eds. NYC: Peter Lang Publishing, 2012. 127-38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; advocate for the recognition of another wave after the three that Yancey offers. Behm and Miller advocate for a wave where the intersections of race and writing assessment are brought to the forefront of assessment practices. As the authors explain, [[racism|racial inequalities]] in writing assessment are typically justified with non-racial reasons.
