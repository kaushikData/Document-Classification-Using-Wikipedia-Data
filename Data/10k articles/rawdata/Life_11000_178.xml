[[Image:Miskolc Kocsonyafesztival 10.jpg|thumb|right|Fish in aspic. Vegetables and fish stocks need gelatin to create a mold]]
'''Aspic''' is a dish in which ingredients are set into a [[gelatin]] made from  a [[meat]] [[stock (food)|stock]] or [[consommé]].  Non-[[Umami|savory]] dishes, often made with commercial gelatin mixes without stock or consommé, are usually called [[jello salad]]s in the United States or gelatin salads elsewhere.

When cooled, stock that is made from meat congeals because of the natural gelatin found in the meat. The stock can be clarified with [[egg white]]s, and then filled and flavored just before the aspic sets. Almost any type of food can be set into aspics. Most common are meat pieces, [[fruit]]s, or [[vegetable]]s. Aspics are usually served on cold plates so that the gel will not melt before being eaten. A meat jelly that includes [[cream]] is called a '''''chaud-froid'''''.

Almost any meat, poultry, or fish can be used to make gelatin. The aspic may need additional gelatin in order to set properly. Veal stock provides a great deal of gelatin; in making stock, veal is often included with other meat for that reason. Fish consommés usually have too little natural gelatin, so the fish stock may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth.

Vegetables and fish stocks need gelatin to maintain a molded shape.&lt;ref name="kitchenbook"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ruhlman|first=Michael|authorlink = |author2=Anthony Bourdain|title=The Elements of Cooking: Translating the Chef's Craft for Every Kitchen|publisher =Simon and Schuster|date=November 2007|location=New York, New York|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-7432-9978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Historically, meat aspics were made before fruit- and vegetable-flavored aspics or 'jellies' (UK) and 'gelatins' (North America). By the [[Middle Ages]] at the latest, cooks had discovered that a thickened meat broth could be made into a jelly. A detailed recipe for aspic is found in ''[[Le Viandier]]'', written in or around 1375.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Scully|first=Terence|authorlink=|title=The viandier of Taillevent: an edition of all extant manuscripts|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|date=January 1, 1988|location=Ottawa, Ontario|pages=270|url=|doi =|id=|isbn=978-0-7766-0174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, [[Marie-Antoine Carême]] created ''chaud froid'' in France. ''Chaud froid'' means "hot cold" in French, referring to foods that were prepared hot and served cold. Aspic was used as a ''chaud froid'' sauce in many cold fish and poultry meals. The sauce added moisture and flavor to the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardemanger.com/chaudfroid.html |title=Chaud Froid: Clarifying an Opaque Subject |publisher=Garde Manger |accessdate=October 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203162734/http://www.gardemanger.com/chaudfroid.html |archivedate=December 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carême invented various types of aspic and ways of preparing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardemanger.com/aspic2.html|title=Aspic: An Evolution of Use and Abuse|publisher=Garde Manger|accessdate=October 10, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113151335/http://www.gardemanger.com/aspic2.html|archivedate=13 November 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aspic, when used to hold meats, prevents them from becoming spoiled. The gelatin keeps out [[air]] and [[bacteria]], keeping the cooked meat fresh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/apr/30/aspic|title=Aspic Aspirations|publisher=The Guardian (U.K.)|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspic came into prominence in America in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="oxfordbook"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Smith| first = Andrew| authorlink = | title = The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = March 2007| location =New York, New York| pages = 514, 292| url =| doi =| id =| isbn =0-19-530796-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|514}} By the 1950s, meat aspic was a popular dinner staple throughout the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/magazine/09food.html|title=The Way We Eat: Salad Daze |publisher=The New York Times|date=July 9, 2006|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were other gelatin-based dishes such as tomato aspic.&lt;ref name="oxfordbook"/&gt;{{rp|292}} Cooks used to show off aesthetic skills by creating inventive aspics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Allen|first=Gary|authorlink=|author2=Ken Albala|title=The Business of Food: Encyclopedia of the Food and Drink Industries|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=October 30, 2007|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=177|url=|doi =10.1336/031333725X|id=|isbn=0-313-33725-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Aspic can also be referred as ''aspic gelée'' or ''aspic jelly''. Aspic jelly may be colorless (white aspic) or contain various shades of amber. Aspic can be used to protect food from the air, to give food more flavor, or as a decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gisslen|first=Wayne|authorlink=|title=Professional Cooking, 6th edition|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|date=March 2006|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=849|url=|doi =|id=|isbn=978-0-471-66376-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of aspic: delicate, sliceable, and inedible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardemanger.com/aspic3.html|title=Aspic:Textures and Facts|publisher=Garde Manger|accessdate=October 10, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113151342/http://www.gardemanger.com/aspic3.html|archivedate=13 November 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delicate aspic is soft. The sliceable aspic must be made in a [[Terrine (food)|terrine]] or in an aspic mold. It is firmer than the delicate aspic. The inedible aspic is never for consumption. It is usually for decoration. Aspic is often used to glaze food pieces in food competitions to make the food glisten and make it more appealing to the eye. Foods dipped in aspic have a lacquered finish for a fancy presentation.&lt;ref name="kitchenbook"/&gt; Aspic can be cut into various shapes and be used as a garnish for deli meats or pâtés.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Nenes|first=Michael|authorlink=|title=American Regional Cuisine, 2nd edition|publisher=Art Institute|date=March 2006|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=547|url=|doi =|id=|isbn=978-0-471-68294-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pork jelly''' is an aspic made from low-grade cuts of pig meat, such as [[Pig's trotters|trotters]], containing a significant proportion of connective tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/14038/why-do-they-put-the-jelly-like-substance-in-pork-pies |title=food preservation - Why do they put the jelly-like substance in pork pies? - Seasoned Advice |publisher=Cooking.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pork jelly is a popular [[appetizer]] and, nowadays, is sometimes prepared in a more modern version using lean [[meat]], with or without pig leftovers which are substituted with store-bought [[gelatin]]. It is very popular in [[Croatia]] (especially in the northwest where it's called "hladetina" or "hladnetina"), [[Serbia]] (where it is called "пихтије/pihtije"), [[Poland]] (where it is called ''galareta''), in [[Romania]] and Moldova (''piftie'', ''răcitură''), in [[Estonia]] (''sült''), in [[Latvia]] (''aukstā gaļa''), in [[Lithuania]] ("šaltiena"), in [[Slovakia]] (''huspenina'', ''studeno''), in [[Hungary]] (''kocsonya''; can also refer to aspic of other meats), in [[Greece]] (where it is called ''pichti''), in [[Ukraine]] originally хішкаi(hishkay) or studinats but since 1930's the russian word was forced to be used except in the worldwide diaspora community. In [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] (''kholodets'', ''kholodne'') during Christmas or Easter, in Russia &lt;nowiki&gt;''kholodets''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a traditional winter and especially New Years dish which is eaten with mustard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thatswhatshehad.com/russian-kholodets-recipe/|title=The Weird Wobbly Meat Jello That Is Russian Kholodets {{!}} That’s What She Had|website=thatswhatshehad.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vietnam]] ("thịt nấu đông") during [[Lunar New Year]]. The meat in [[pork pie]]s is preserved using pork jelly.

===Preparation===
The preparation of pork jelly includes placing lean pork meat, trotters, rind, ears and snout in a pot of cold water, and letting it cook over a slow fire for three hours. The broth is allowed to cool, while also removing any undesirable fat. Subsequently, white vinegar and the juice of half an orange or lemon can be added to the meat so that it is covered. The entire mixture is then allowed to cool and gel. Bay leaves or chili can be added to the broth for added taste (the Romanian variety is based on garlic and includes no vinegar, orange, lemon, chili, bay leaves, etc.). However, there are many alternate ways of preparing pork jelly, such as the usage of [[celery]], [[beef]] and even pig [[bone]]s. [[Poultry]] jellies are made the same way as making pork jelly, but less water is added to compensate for lower natural gelatin content.

==Pihtije==
[[File:Pihtije Lettuce Vlasotince Bogojavljenje.JPG|thumb|right|Pihtije on lettuce with eggs]]
[[File:Pihtije Cubes Vlasotince Bogojavljenje.JPG|thumb|right|Pihtije cubes]]
'''Pihtije''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: пихтије), '''pivtija''' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: пивтија), '''pača''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: пача), '''piftie''' or '''răcitură''' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is an aspic-like dish, generally made from low-cost pork meat, such as the head, shank and/or hock made into a semi-consistent gelatinous cake-like form. In some varieties, chicken is used instead of pork. Some recipes also include smoked meat.

Pihtije is commonly just one component of the traditional meal (or an appetizer), although it can be served as a main dish. It is usually accompanied by cold [[rakija]] (strong [[šljivovica]] or apricot brandy is common, but quince brandy is sometimes used) and [[Tursu|turšija]] (cold pickled vegetables, usually horse-radish, bell peppers, hot peppers, green tomatoes and cabbage/sauerkraut).

The recipe calls for the meat to be cleaned, washed and then boiled for a short time, no longer than 5–10 minutes. Then the water is changed, and vegetables and spices are added (usually pepper, bay leaves, onion, carrots, celery). This is cooked until the meat begins to separate from the bones by itself; then, the bones are removed, the meat stock is filtered and the meat and stock are poured into shallow bowls.

Garlic is added, as well as thin slices of carrots or green peppers, or something similar for decoration. It is left to sit in a cold spot, such as a fridge or outside if the weather is cold enough (this is a traditional winter dish). It congeals into jelly and can be cut into cubes (it is often said that good pihtijas are "cut like glass"). These cubes can be sprinkled with dried ground red paprika ( [[aleva paprika]] ), as desired, before serving.

Pihtije is usually cut and served in equal sized cubes.

Pihtije are frequently used in [[slava]]s and other celebratory occasions with Serbs.

=== Romanian and Moldovan piftie === 
[[File:Racitura Meat Jelly Moldavian Cuisine.JPG|thumb|Moldovan chicken ''răcitură'']]
[[Romanian cuisine|Romanian]] and [[Moldovan cuisine|Moldovan]] piftie (răcitură) is usually made with pork [[offal]], boiled with garlic and bay leaves. Piftie has a different method of preparation. Usually the pig's trotters are boiled to make a soup; the trotters are used because they contain a lot more gelatin than any other part of the pig. The mixture is then cooled to become a jelly. Usually garlic is added. Piftie is traditionally served for [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

==International variants==
=== Asia ===
==== Korea ====
''[[Jokpyeon]]'' ({{Korean|hangul=족편|labels=no}}) is a dish prepared by boiling [[cow's trotters]] and/or other cuts with high [[collagen]] content, such as cow's head, skin, [[Oxtail|tail]] and pig's head in water for a long time, so that the stewing liquid sets to form a jelly-like substance when cooled.&lt;ref name="SKLD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stdweb2.korean.go.kr/search/View.jsp?idx=484622|title=jokpyeon|website=[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]|publisher=[[National Institute of Korean Language]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:족편|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodinkorea.org/eng_food/tradition/tradition4_1.jsp|title=Kinds of Korean Food|website=Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414053422/http://www.foodinkorea.org/eng_food/tradition/tradition4_1.jsp|archive-date=14 April 2009|access-date=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nepal ====
Among the [[Newars]] of [[Kathmandu Valley]] in [[Nepal]], buffalo meat jelly--known as "Ta khaa" --is a major component of the winter festivity gourmet. It is eaten in combination with fish aspic ("Sanyaa Khunna"), which is made from dried fish and buffalo meat stock, soured, and contains a heavy mix of spices and condiments.

=== Europe, Russia ===

==== Eastern Europe ====
[[File:Holodez s hrenom.JPG|thumb|Russian aspic - kholodets with chopped horseradish (khren)]]
In Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian cuisine, a meat aspic dish is called ''kholodets'' (Russian: холодец, Belarusian: халадзец, Ukrainian: холодець) derived from the word ''kholod'' meaning "cold." In some parts of Russia it is called ''studen''' (студень), derived from another root with a similar meaning. The dish is mostly part of winter holiday festive meals, although modern refrigerators allow to cook it all year round, and it is not surprising to see kholodets on a Russian table in summer. However, ''kholodets'' is still considered as a traditional New Year's dish in Russia and is usually eaten with mustard. In Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, aspic often takes the form of pork jelly, and it is popular around the [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] Holidays. A Georgian version is called [[mujuji]] (მუჟუჟი). In Poland certain meats, fish and vegetables are set in aspic, creating a dish called "galareta".

''Kholodets'' are usually made by boiling the bones and meat for about 5-8 hours to produce a fatty broth, mixed with salt, pepper and other spices. After boiling, the meat is separated from the bones and minced into small pieces, then returned into the broth and cooled down until solidifying into a jelly.
==== Croatia ====
The Croatian version of this dish is called ''hladetina'' (''hladno'' meaning cold). Variants range from one served in a dish with lot or rather delicate gelatin, to ''tlačenica'' more resembling German ''Sülze'', a kind of [[head cheese]].

==== Slovenia ====
In Slovenia, aspic is known as ''žolca'', and is traditionally served for [[Easter]]. The word comes from the German ''Sülze'', which originally means [[head cheese]] (otherwise known as ''tlačenka'' in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]).

==== Denmark ====
In Denmark aspic is called ''sky'' and is mainly used as a topping in open sandwiches, it is made from meat juices and gelatin, sometimes with mushrooms in. Sky is almost solely used in the danish open faced sandwiches, [[smørrebrød]], where is it a topping for [[cold cuts]]. It is in particular important in [[Dyrlægens natmad]] (The Veterinarian's Midnight Snack), where it is used with [[leverpostej]], sliced salt beef and onions. It is also used on top of [[rullepølse]]. Sky, with and without mushrooms, is an easy-to-find product in all supermarkets.

&lt;/ref&gt; that extends the [[Axiomatic design]]&lt;ref&gt;Suh (1990). ''The Principles of Design'', Oxford University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-504345-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (AD) method. APDL covers the whole [[Product_lifecycle_management#Phases_of_product_lifecycle_and_corresponding_technologies|product lifecycle]] including early factors that affect the entire cycle such as development testing, input constraints and system components.

APDL provides an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative and incremental]] way for a team of transdisciplinary members to approach [[Holism|holistic]] product development. A practical outcome includes capturing and managing product [[design knowledge]]. The APDL model addresses some weak [[Design pattern|patterns]] experienced in previous development models regarding quality of the design, [[requirements management]], [[change management]], [[project management]], and communication between [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. Practicing APDL may reduce development time and [[Project cost management|project cost]].

== Overview ==
APDL adds the Test [[Problem domain|domain]] and four new characteristics to Axiomatic design (AD): Input Constraints in the Functional Domain; Systems Components in the Physical Domain; Process Variables tied to System Components instead of Design Parameters; and Customer Needs mapped to Functional Requirements and Input Constraints.

APDL proposes a V-shaped process to develop the Design Parameters and System Components (detailed design). Start top-down with Process Variables (PV) and Component Test Cases (CTC) to complete the PV, CTC, and Functional Test Cases (FTC); And after build, test the product with a bottom-up approach.

== APDL Domains ==
;Customer domain
[[Voice of the customer|Customer Needs]] (CN) are elements that the customer seeks in a product or system.

;Functional domain
[[Functional requirement|Functional Requirements]] (FR) completely characterize the minimum performance to be met by the design solution, product etc. FR are documented in requirement specifications (RS).

Input [[Constraint (mathematics)|Constraints]] (IC) are included in the functional domain along with the FR. IC are specific to overall design goals and are imposed externally by CN, product users or conditions of use, such as regulations. IC are derived from CN and then revised based on other constraints that the product has to comply with but not mentioned in the Customer Domain.

;Physical domain
The Design Parameters (DP) are the elements of the design solution in the physical domain that are chosen to satisfy the specified FRs. DPs can be conceptual design solutions, subsystems, components, or component attributes.

System Components (SC) provide a categorical design solution in the DP, where the categories represent physical parts in the Physical Domain.  The SC hierarchy represents the physical [[system architecture]] or product tree. The method for categorizing varies. [[Steven D. Eppinger|Eppinger]] portrays general categories as system, subsystem, and component Eppinger (2001). NASA  uses system, segment, element, subsystem, assembly, subassembly, and part (NASA, 1995).

SC makes it possible to perform [[Design structure matrix|Design Structure Matrixes]] (DSM), change management, component-based cost management and impact analysis, and provides framework for capturing structural information and requirement traceability.

;Process domain
[[Process variable|Process Variables]] (PV) identify and describe the controls and processes to produce SC.

;Test domain
A functional test consists of a set of Functional Test Cases (FTC). FTC are [[System testing|system tests]] used to verify that FR are satisfied by the system. [[Black-box testing]] is the software analog to FTC. At the end of the system development, a functional test verifies that the requirements of the system are met.

Component Test Cases (CTC) are a physical analog to [[White-box testing]]. CTC verify that components satisfy the allocated FRs and ICs. Each system component is tested before it is integrated into the system to make sure that the requirements and constraints allocated to that component are all satisfied.

Proteins of the '''Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter''' ('''BCCT''') '''family''' are found in [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The BCCT family is a member a large group of secondary transporters, the [[APC Superfamily|APC superfamily]]. Their common functional feature is that they all transport molecules with a quaternary ammonium group [R-N (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. The BCCT family proteins vary in length between 481 and 706 amino [[acyl]] residues and possess 12 putative [[Transmembrane segment|transmembrane α-helical spanners]] (TMSs).  The x-ray structures reveal two 5 TMS repeats with the total number of TMSs being 10. These porters catalyze bidirectional [[uniport]] or are energized by [[Proton-motive force|pmf-driven]] or smf-driven proton or sodium ion [[symport]], respectively, or else by substrate:substrate [[antiport]]. Some of these permeases exhibit osmosensory and osmoregulatory properties inherent to their polypeptide chains.&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH Jr.|title=2.A.15 The Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter (BCCT) Family|url=http://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.15|website=Transporter Classification Database|publisher=Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from ''Proteus mirabilis'' (PmCaiT) ({{PDB2|4M8J}}) and from ''E. coli'' (EcCaiT)({{PDB2|3HFX}}) were determined.&lt;ref name=Schulze&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulze|first1=S|last2=Köster|first2=S|last3=Geldmacher|first3=U|last4=Terwisscha van Scheltinga|first4=AC|last5=Kühlbrandt|first5=W|title=Structural basis of Na(+)-independent and cooperative substrate/product antiport in CaiT.|journal=Nature|date=September 9, 2010|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=233–6|doi=10.1038/nature09310|pmid=20829798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most members of the BCCT family are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent, whereas EcCaiT is a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent substrate:product antiporter. The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent transporters [http://www.tcdb.org/search/index.php?query=LeuT&amp;type=system LeuT] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.15.1.10 BetP], but in CaiT, a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; independence. Both CaiT structures ({{PDB2|SWSW}}, {{PDB2|4M8J}}) show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. EcCaiT ({{PDB2|SWSX}}, {{PDB2|3HFX}}) contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with [[Hill coefficient]]s of up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. Schulze et al. (2010) proposed a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.&lt;ref name=Schulze/&gt; Glycine betaine transporters have been found to contain a conserved region with four tryptophans in their central region.&lt;ref name="PUB00002302"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempf B, Bremer E, Kappes RM |title=Three transport systems for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine operate in Bacillus subtilis: characterization of OpuD |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=178 |issue=17 |pages=5071–5079 |year=1996 |pmid=8752321 |pmc=178300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Most secondary-active transporters transport their substrates using an [[electrochemical ion gradient]], but the carnitine transporter (CaiT) is an ion-independent, L-carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter. Crystal structures of CaiT from ''E. coli'' and ''Proteus mirabilis'' revealed the inverted five-transmembrane-helix repeat similar to that in the amino acid/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symporter, LeuT. Kalayil et al. (2013) showed that mutations of arginine 262 (R262) made CaiT Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent with increased transport activity in the presence of a membrane potential, in agreement with substrate/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cotransport. R262 also plays a role in substrate binding by stabilizing the partly unwound TM1' helix.&lt;ref name=Kalayil&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalayil|first1=S|last2=Schulze|first2=S|last3=Kühlbrandt|first3=W|title=Arginine oscillation explains Na+ independence in the substrate/product antiporter CaiT.|date=October 22, 2013|volume=110|issue=43|pages=17296–301|doi=10.1073/pnas.1309071110|pmid=24101465|pmc=3808595|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeling CaiT from ''P. mirabilis'' in the outward-open and closed states on the corresponding structures of the related symporter BetP revealed alternating orientations of the buried R262 side chain, which mimic sodium binding and unbinding in the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled substrate symporters. A similar mechanism may be operative in other Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent transporters, in which a positively charged amino acid replaces the cotransported cation. The oscillation of the R262 side chain in CaiT indicates how a positive charge triggers the change between outward-open and inward-open conformations.&lt;ref name=Kalayil /&gt;

==Transport reactions==
The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by members of the BCCT family are:&lt;ref name=TCDB /&gt;

::Substrate (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Substrate (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

::Substrate (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Substrate (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

::Substrate-1 (out) + Substrate-2 (in) → Substrate-1 (in) + Substrate-2 (out)

::Substrate (out) ⇌ Substrate (in)

:::Substrate = a quaternary amine

==Other betaine transporters==
The mammalian betaine transporter (BGT1; '''SLC6A12''' is predominantly expressed in the liver (hepatocytes).&lt;ref name="Zhou et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhou Y, Holmseth S, Hua R, Lehre AC, Olofsson AM, Poblete-Naredo I, Kempson SA, Danbolt NC | title = The betaine-GABA transporter (BGT1, slc6a12) is predominantly expressed in the liver and at lower levels in the kidneys and at the brain surface | journal = Am J Physiol Renal Physiol | volume = 302 | issue = 3 | pages = F316-28 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22071246 | doi = 10.1152/ajprenal.00464.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also expressed in the kidney&lt;ref name="Zhou et al. 2012"/&gt; where it is regulated by [[NFAT5#Osmotic stress|NFAT5]] during a response to osmotic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, BGT1 is also present in the leptomeninges surrounding the brain.&lt;ref name="Zhou et al. 2012"/&gt; Deletion of the BGT1 gene in mice did not appear to have any impact on the tendency to develop epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Lehre et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lehre AC, Rowley NM, Zhou Y, Holmseth S, Guo C, Holen T, Hua R, Laake P, Olofsson AM, Poblete-Naredo I, Rusakov DA, Madsen KK, Clausen RP, Schousboe A, White HS, Danbolt NC | title = Deletion of the betaine-GABA transporter (BGT1; slc6a12) gene does not affect seizure thresholds of adult mice | journal = Epilepsy Res | volume = 95 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 70–81 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21459558 | doi = 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2011.02.014 | pmc=3376448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to be expected considering that BGT1 is expressed at far lower levels than GAT1 and also has lower affinity for GABA. This implies that it is not likely to contribute significantly to the inactivation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.&lt;ref name="Lehre et al. 2011"/&gt;

'''Biogen Inc.''' (previously known as '''Biogen Idec''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[biotechnology]] company based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of [[neurodegenerative]], [[hematologic]], and [[autoimmune diseases]] to patients worldwide.

== History ==
Biogen was founded in 1978 in [[Geneva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url        = https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/12/04/biogen-idec-biotechs-comeback-kid/ |title      = Biotech's Comeback Kid |publisher  = Forbes |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several prominent biologists, including [[Kenneth Murray (biologist)|Kenneth Murray]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Phillip Allen Sharp]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Walter Gilbert]] of [[Harvard]] (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), [[Heinz Schaller]], [[University of Heidelberg]] and [[Charles Weissmann]], [[University of Zurich]] (who contributed the first product [[interferon alpha]]). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with [[Nobel Prize]]s: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in understanding [[DNA sequencing]], while Sharp received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1993 for his discovery of [[split gene]]s.

In 2003, Biogen merged with [[San Diego, California]]-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1985 by [[Ivor Royston]], [[Howard Birndorf]] and others) and adopted the name Biogen Idec.&lt;ref name="Exhibit"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biogen and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Announce Merger To Create a New Biotechnology Industry Leader |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875045/000104746903021993/a2113458zex-99_1.htm|quote="IDEC — Founded in 1985 to develop monoclonal antibodies. Founders include Ivor Royston, Howard Birndorf, Richard Miller and Brook Byers" |website=Exhibit 99.1 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/business/idec-to-merge-with-biogen-in-6.8-billion-deal.html|title      = Idec to Merge With Biogen in $6.8 Billion Deal|publisher  = New York Times |accessdate=2003-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen has focused its R&amp;D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.

Investigational MS medicines:

* Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with [[Abbvie]], Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
   |accessdate=2013-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) ([[Opicinumab]]): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/2013/05/lingo-promising-remyelination-target-in.html
   |title      = Lingo: a promising remyelination target in MS
   |publisher  = Multiple Sclerosis Research
   |accessdate=2014-06-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

* Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule ([[Opicinumab]]) in acute optic neuritis
* Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
* Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
* Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013 
* Phase 3:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |title      = Aducanumab Reduces Amyloid Plaques in Early Alzheimer's

   }}&lt;/ref&gt; BIIB037 ([[Aducanumab]]), Biogen's first clinical study in Alzheimer's disease
* Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1&lt;sub&gt;Rx&lt;/sub&gt;) for [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/top-20-biotech-licensing-deals-h1-2012/isis-pharmaceuticals-and-biogen-idec

   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with [[Samsung]], creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen's expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |accessdate=2013-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer's disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |title      = Isis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec
   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen also has since 2015 an agreement with AGTC for the development of gene therapy for ophthalmologic diseases such as X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) and X-linked  Retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), and up to three other genetic diseases. To this aim, Biogen paid AGTC $124 million, including an equity investment of $30 millions, and up to 1,1 billion in future milestones.&lt;ref&gt;Biogen Offers Up To $1 Billion for AGTC’s Ophthalmology Gene Therapy, Xconomy Boston, David Holley, July 2nd, 2015, http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/07/02/biogen-offers-up-to-1-billion-for-agtcs-ophthalmology-gene-therapy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Computer vision is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from [[digital image]]s or [[video]]s. From the perspective of [[engineering]], it seeks to automate tasks that the [[human visual system]] can do.&lt;ref name="Ballard-Brown-1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonka-Hlavac-Boyle-2008" /&gt; "Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images.

==History==
In the late 1960s, computer vision began at universities that were pioneering [[artificial intelligence]]. It was meant to mimic the [[human visual system]], as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior.&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt; In 1966, it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it "describe what it saw".&lt;ref name="Seymour1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boden2006" /&gt;

What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of [[digital image processing]] at that time was a desire to extract [[three-dimensional]] structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision [[Algorithm|algorithms]] that exist today, including [[Edge detection|extraction of edges]] from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and [[Polyhedron model|polyhedral modeling]], representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, [[optical flow]], and [[motion estimation]].&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt;

The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of [[Scale space|scale-space]], the inference of shape from various cues such as [[shading]], texture and focus, and [[Active contour model|contour models known as snakes]]. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] and [[Markov random field]]s.&lt;ref name="Kanade20122"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0jtBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191|title=Three-Dimensional Machine Vision|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-1981-8|author=Takeo Kanade}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in [[Projective geometry|projective]] [[3D reconstruction|3-D reconstructions]] led to better understanding of [[Camera resectioning|camera calibration]]. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in [[bundle adjustment]] theory from the field of [[photogrammetry]]. This led to methods for sparse [[3D reconstruction from multiple images|3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images]]. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, [[Graph cuts in computer vision|variations of graph cut]] were used to solve [[image segmentation]]. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see [[Eigenface]]). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, [[Morphing|image morphing]], view interpolation, [[Image stitching|panoramic image stitching]] and early [[Light field|light-field rendering]].&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt;

Recent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks.&lt;ref name="Sebe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicu Sebe|author2=Ira Cohen|author3=Ashutosh Garg|author4=Thomas S.

==Related fields==

===Artificial Intelligence===
Areas of [[artificial intelligence]] deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotical systems to [[robotic navigation|navigate through an environment]]. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot.

Artificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as [[pattern recognition]] and learning techniques. Consequently, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.

===Information Engineering===
Computer vision is often considered to be part of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering|title=Information Engineering {{!}} Department of Engineering|website=www.eng.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/|title=Information Engineering Main/Home Page|website=www.robots.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state Physics===

[[Solid-state physics]] is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on [[image sensors]], which detect [[electromagnetic radiation]], which is typically in the form of either [[visible light|visible]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[quantum physics]]. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of [[optics]] which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated [[image sensors]] even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process.&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt; Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.

===Neurobiology===

A third field which plays an important role is [[neurobiology]], specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how "real" vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (''e.g.'' [[Artificial neural network|neural net]] and [[deep learning]] based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in biology.

Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of [[biological vision]] – indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.&lt;ref name="TextbookP1" /&gt;

===Signal Processing===

Yet another field related to computer vision is [[signal processing]]. Many methods for processing of one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision which have no counterpart in processing of one-variable signals. Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.

===Other fields===

Beside the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on [[statistics]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] or [[geometry]]. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer Vision is also used in Fashion Ecommerce, Inventory Management, Patent Search, Furniture, Beauty Industry as well.

===Distinctions===

The fields most closely related to computer vision are [[image processing]], [[image analysis]] and [[machine vision]]. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented.

[[Computer graphics]] produces image data from 3D models, computer vision often produces 3D models from image data &lt;ref name="3DVAE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Amir-Arsalan/Synthesize3DviaDepthOrSil|title=Soltani, A. A., Huang, H., Wu, J., Kulkarni, T. D., &amp; Tenenbaum, J. B. Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-View Depth Maps and Silhouettes With Deep Generative Networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 1511-1519).|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, ''e.g.'', as explored in [[augmented reality]].

The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:

* [[Image processing]] and [[image analysis]] tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, ''e.g.'', by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.
* Computer vision includes 3D analysis from 2D images. This analyzes the 3D scene projected onto one or several images, ''e.g.'', how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.
* [[Machine vision]] is the process of applying a range of technologies &amp; methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance&lt;ref name="NASAarticle"/&gt; in industrial applications.&lt;ref name="TextbookP1"/&gt; Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, ''e.g.'', vision based robots and systems for vision based inspection, measurement, or picking (such as [[bin picking]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.robots.com/blog/viewing/the-future-of-automated-random-bin-picking&lt;/ref&gt;). This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.
* There is also a field called [[imaging science|imaging]] which primarily focus on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, [[medical imaging]] includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.
* Finally, [[pattern recognition]] is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and [[artificial neural networks]]. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.

[[Photogrammetry]] also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., [[stereophotogrammetry]] vs. [[computer stereo vision]].

==Applications==
Applications range from tasks such as industrial [[machine vision]] systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:

[[File:Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-View Depth Maps and Silhouettes With Deep Generative Networks.png|thumb|Learning 3D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in [[deep learning]] has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct 3D shapes from single or multi-view depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently &lt;ref name="3DVAE" /&gt;]]

* Automatic inspection, ''e.g.'', in manufacturing applications;
* Assisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a [[Automated species identification|species identification]] system;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wäldchen|first=Jana|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|date=2017-01-07|title=Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|language=en|pages=1–37|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controlling processes, ''e.g.'', an [[industrial robots|industrial robot]];
* [[Activity recognition|Detecting events]], ''e.g.'', for visual surveillance or [[people counter|people counting]];
* Interaction, ''e.g.'', as the input to a device for [[computer-human interaction]];
* Modeling objects or environments, ''e.g.'', medical image analysis or topographical modeling;
* Navigation, ''e.g.'', by an [[autonomous vehicle]] or [[mobile robot]]; and
* Organizing information, ''e.g.'', for indexing databases of images and image sequences.

[[File:DARPA Visual Media Reasoning Concept Video.ogv|thumb|[[DARPA]]'s Visual Media Reasoning concept video]]
One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to [[Computer-assisted diagnosis|diagnose a patient]]. An example of this is detection of [[tumour]]s, [[arteriosclerosis]] or other malign changes; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information: ''e.g.'', about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or X-ray images for example—to reduce the influence of noise.

A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called [[machine vision]], where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a manufacturing process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called [[optical sorting]].&lt;ref name="Davies-2005" /&gt;

Military applications are probably one of the largest areas for computer vision. The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and [[missile guidance]]. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as "battlefield awareness", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Artist's concept of a [[Mars Exploration Rover]], an example of an unmanned land-based vehicle. Notice the [[stereo cameras]] mounted on top of the rover.]]
One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include [[submersible]]s, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment ([[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]]) and for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, ''e.g.'', a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for [[Driverless car|autonomous driving of cars]], but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, ''e.g.'', NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] and ESA's [[ExoMars]] Rover.

Other application areas include:

* Support of [[visual effects]] creation for cinema and broadcast, ''e.g.'', [[camera tracking]] (matchmoving).
* [[Surveillance]].
* Tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences &lt;ref name="BruijningVisser2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruijning|first1=Marjolein|last2=Visser|first2=Marco D.|last3=Hallmann|first3=Caspar A.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=Golding|first5=Nick|title=trackdem: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and size distributions from videos in r |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|issn=2041210X|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical tasks==
Each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.

Computer vision tasks include methods for [[image sensor|acquiring]], [[Image processing|processing]], [[Image analysis|analyzing]] and understanding digital images, and extraction of [[high-dimensional]] data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, ''e.g.'', in the forms of decisions.&lt;ref name="Klette-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro-Stockman-2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jahne-Haussecker-2000" /&gt; Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.&lt;ref name="Forsyth-Ponce-2003" /&gt;

===Recognition===
The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and [[machine vision]] is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

* '''[[Object recognition]]''' (also called '''object classification'''){{spaced ndash}}one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene. Blippar, [[Google Goggles]] and LikeThat provide stand-alone programs that illustrate this functionality.
* '''Identification'''{{spaced ndash}}an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of [[MNIST database|handwritten digits]], or identification of a specific vehicle.
* '''[[Object detection|Detection]]'''{{spaced ndash}}the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.

Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on [[convolutional neural network]]s. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the [[ImageNet#ImageNet Challenge|ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]]; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and hundreds of object classes. Performance of convolutional neural networks, on the ImageNet tests, is now close to that of humans.&lt;ref&gt;O. Russakovsky et al., "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras). By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.

Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:

* '''[[Content-based image retrieval]]'''{{spaced ndash}}finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contains many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them).
[[File:SRT Shape Recognition Technology.png|thumb|Computer vision for [[people counter]] purposes in public places, malls, shopping centres ]]
* '''[[Pose (computer vision)|Pose estimation]]'''{{spaced ndash}}estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an [[assembly line]] situation or picking parts from a bin.
* '''[[Optical character recognition]]''' (OCR){{spaced ndash}}identifying [[Character (computing)|characters]] in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or [[Search index|indexing]] (''e.g.'' [[ASCII]]).
* '''2D Code reading''' Reading of 2D codes such as [[Data Matrix|data matrix]] and [[QR code|QR]] codes.
* '''[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]]'''
* ''' [[Pattern recognition|Shape Recognition Technology]]''' (SRT) in [[people counter]] systems differentiating human beings (head and shoulder patterns) from objects

===Motion analysis===
Several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images . Examples of such tasks are:

* '''[[Egomotion]]'''{{spaced ndash}}determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.
* '''[[video tracking|Tracking]]'''{{spaced ndash}}following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (''e.g.'', vehicles, humans or other organisms &lt;ref name="BruijningVisser2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruijning|first1=Marjolein|last2=Visser|first2=Marco D.|last3=Hallmann|first3=Caspar A.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=Golding|first5=Nick|title=trackdem: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and size distributions from videos in r |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|issn=2041210X|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12975}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the image sequence.
* '''[[Optical flow]]'''{{spaced ndash}}to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.

===Scene reconstruction===
Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at [[3D reconstruction|computing a 3D model]] of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model. The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models &lt;ref name='3DVAE' /&gt;.

===Image restoration===
The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.

An example in this field is [[inpainting]].

==System methods==
The organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.

* '''Image acquisition''' – A digital image is produced by one or several [[image sensor]]s, which, besides various types of light-sensitive cameras, include [[rangefinder|range sensors]], tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images), but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt;
* '''Pre-processing''' – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples are
** Re-sampling in order to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.
** Noise reduction in order to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.
** Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.
** [[Scale space]] representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.
* '''[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature extraction]]''' – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data.&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; Typical examples of such features are
** Lines, [[edge detection|edges]] and [[ridge detection|ridges]].
** Localized [[interest point detection|interest points]] such as [[corner detection|corners]], [[blob detection|blobs]] or points.
:More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.
* '''Detection/segmentation''' – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing.&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; Examples are
** Selection of a specific set of interest points
** Segmentation of one or multiple image regions which contain a specific object of interest.
** Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprised foreground, object groups, single objects or [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] object parts (also referred to as spatial-taxon scene hierarchy)&lt;ref&gt;Barghout, Lauren. "[http://www.lirmm.fr/~lafourcade/pub/IPMU2014/papers/0443/04430163.pdf Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions]." Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Springer International Publishing, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;, while the [[Salience (neuroscience)|visual salience]] is often implemented as [[Visual spatial attention|spatial]] and [[Visual temporal attention|temporal attention]]. 
** Segmentation or [[Object Co-segmentation|co-segmentation]] of one or multiple videos into a series of per-frame foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity&lt;ref name="Liu Wang Hua Zhang 2018 pp. 5840–5853"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liu | first=Ziyi | last2=Wang | first2=Le | last3=Hua | first3=Gang | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin | last5=Niu | first5=Zhenxing | last6=Wu | first6=Ying | last7=Zheng | first7=Nanning | title=Joint Video Object Discovery and Segmentation by Coupled Dynamic Markov Networks | journal=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing | volume=27 | issue=12 | year=2018 | issn=1057-7149 | doi=10.1109/tip.2018.2859622 | pages=5840–5853 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/Joint_Video_Object_Discovery_and_Segmentation_by_Coupled_Dynamic_Markov_Networks.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Le | last2=Duan | first2=Xuhuan | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Niu | first4=Zhenxing | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=Segment-Tube: Spatio-Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos with Per-Frame Segmentation | journal=Sensors | publisher=MDPI AG | volume=18 | issue=5 | date=2018-05-22 | issn=1424-8220 | doi=10.3390/s18051657 | page=1657 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/Segment-Tube_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization_in_Untrimmed_Videos_with_Per-Frame_Segmentation.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
* '''High-level processing''' – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object.&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; The remaining processing deals with, for example:
** Verification that the data satisfy model-based and application specific assumptions.
** Estimation of application specific parameters, such as object pose or object size.
** [[Image recognition]] – classifying a detected object into different categories.
** [[Image registration]] – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.
* '''Decision making''' Making the final decision required for the application,&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; for example:
** Pass/fail on automatic inspection applications
** Match / no-match in recognition applications
** Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications

===Image-understanding systems===
Image-understanding systems (IUS) include three levels of abstraction as follows: Low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions; intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are really topics for further research.

The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.

While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, Volume 1|last = Shapiro|first = Stuart C.|publisher = John WIley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year = 1992|isbn = 0-471-50306-1|location = New York|pages = 643–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
There are many kinds of computer vision systems, nevertheless all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (i.e. camera, ccd, etc.), a processor as well as control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism. In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system. Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment. Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories like camera supports, cables and connectors.

Most computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).

A few computer vision systems use image acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both.
For example, a [[structured-light 3D scanner]], a [[thermographic camera]], a [[hyperspectral imager]], [[radar imaging]], a [[lidar]] scanner, a [[magnetic resonance image]], a [[side-scan sonar]], a [[synthetic aperture sonar]], or etc.
Such hardware captures "images" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.

While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in [[digital signal processing]] and [[Graphics processing unit|consumer graphics hardware]] has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second. For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms. When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kagami|first1=Shingo|title=High-speed vision systems and projectors for real-time perception of the world|journal=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition - Workshops|date=2010|volume=2010|pages=100–107|doi=10.1109/CVPRW.2010.5543776|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=5543776|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egocentric vision]] systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective. 

As of 2016, [[vision processing unit]]s are emerging as a new class of processor, to complement CPUs and [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs) in this role.&lt;ref name="the rise of VPUs"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third Type Of Processor For VR/AR: Movidius' Myriad 2 VPU |website=www.tomshardware.com |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/movidiud-myriad2-vpu-vision-processing-vr,30850.html |author=Seth Colaner |date=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital autopsy''' is a non-invasive [[autopsy]] in which digital imaging technology, such as with [[CT scan|Computerized Tomography]] (CT) or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) scans, is used to develop three-dimensional images for a virtual exploration of a human body.

Digital autopsy, simply, means conducting autopsy in computerized environment by digital tools. The first step of digitizing starts with the medical imaging modalities that provide the raw data images from the deceased. The most common modalities are [[CT scan|Computerized Tomography]] (CT scan) and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI)  scanner. Three dimensional medical visualization  is the technical process that provide the digital environment for exploration of the 3D body and conducting the digital autopsy.

The term cannot be found before 1985 in the literature. However, there are many other similar terms like: Postmortem CT scanning for individual organs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Törő|first1 = Klara|title = Medicolegal evaluation of environmental-related mortality|journal = Edorium J Forensic Sci|date = 2015|volume = 1|pages = 4–8|url = http://www.edoriumjournalofforensicscience.com/archive/2015-archive/100002F02KT2015-toro/100002F02KT2015-toro.pdf|accessdate = 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; volumetric radiologic scanning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Thali|first1 = Michael J.|last2 = Braun|first2 = Marcel|last3 = Kneubuehl|first3 = Beat P.|last4 = Brueschweiler|first4 = Walter|last5 = Vock|first5 = Peter|last6 = Dirnhofer|first6 = Richard|title = Improved vision in forensic documentation: forensic 3D/CAD-supported photogrammetry of bodily injury external surfaces combined with volumetric radiologic scanning of bodily injury internal structures provides more investigative leads and stronger forensic evidence|journal = Proc.

== History ==
One of the first documented Digital Autopsy studies was conducted at the department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Mainz, Germany in the year 1980, where in 105 specimens of human stillborn and live-birth infants, ranging in age from gestational week 13 to postnatal month 18 were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Flodmark|first1 = O|last2 = Becker|first2 = LE|last3 = Harwood-Nash|first3 = DC|last4 = Fitzhardinge|first4 = PM|last5 = Fitz|first5 = CR|last6 = Chuang|first6 = SH|title = Correlation between computed tomography and autopsy in premature and full-term neonates that have suffered perinatal asphyxia|journal = Radiology|date = 1980|volume = 137|issue = 1|pages = 93–103|doi = 10.1148/radiology.137.1.7422867|pmid=7422867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the arena of 2D CT scan images has gradually evolved to present day technologies of Multi-planar reconstructions (MPR) and real to life high definition 3D rendering. In the year 1998 various aspects of human and animal anatomy and pathology were successfully studied by Digital 3D examination on the ancient mummified specimens at the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam. Similar studies have also since then been done at the British Museum. The digital 3D analysis of data obtained from CT scanning the mummies has helped in visualization of the faces of some of the mummies, including that of chanters from the Temple of Karnak. This technology has also given vast information about the embalming and burial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Clark|first1 = Nick|title = British Museum uses CT scans to show mummies' faces after thousands of years|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/mummy-dearest-british-museum-uses-ct-scans-to-show-mummies-faces-after-thousands-of-years-9248965.html|accessdate = 6 December 2015|publisher = INDEPENDENT|date = 10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the year, 2009 CT scanning and digital analysis of DICOM data was successfully used by the VIFM, Australia during the phase 2 of the DVI process for the Victorian bushfires. All dead bodies and scattered remains were CT scanned in their body bags using specific protocols and analyzed. Digital examination helped not only in separating the presence of non-human remains, but also was useful at the time of autopsy to capture and analyze the identifying features in cases of severe disfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = O’Donnell|first1 = C.|last2 = Iino|first2 = M.|last3 = Mansharan|first3 = K.|last4 = Leditsc|first4 = J.|last5 = Woodford|first5 = N.|title = Contribution of postmortem multidetector CT scanning to identification of the deceased in a mass disaster: Experience gained from the 2009 Victorian bushfires|journal = Forensic Science International|date = February 2011|volume = 205|issue = 1–3|pages = 15–28|doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.05.026|url = http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(10)00280-X/abstract|pmid=20691550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently digital autopsy is being successfully used in many countries like Switzerland, The United States of America, The United Kingdom, Malaysia, and Japan. Radiologists may call it Post-mortem Computed Tomography (PMCT) that does not provide colourful 3D views. In Switzerland, it is called Virtopsy (virtual autopsy). Pathologists (Forensic pathologists) know this procedure as Digital Autopsy.

== Concept ==
In a forensic [[autopsy]] or Post-mortem examination, body of deceased is examined to acquire information on the cause of death inclusive but not limited to manner of death in people dying sudden, unexpected, violent, drug-related, or otherwise suspicious deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Dolinak|first1 = David|last2 = Matshes|first2 = Evan|last3 = Lew|first3 = Emma O.|title = Forensic Pathology: Principles and Practice|date = 2005|publisher = Academic Press|isbn = 9780080470665|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JdtgE0eHTL4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Autopsy tries to answer the same investigative questions without actual dissection as in a conventional autopsy.

The main concept of Digital Autopsy came into existence to overcome some problems during conventional autopsies without losing the objectivity of post-mortem examination. The main problems in conventional autopsy are:
 
* It is impossible to preserve the body after dissection and gather the findings with non-destructive and contamination-free procedures. 
* Data acquisition in some body regions are difficult to somehow impossible, particularly in cases of decomposition.
* Observer-independent documentation of the evidence is not available
* Data acquisition of the body with respect for the deceased, next of kin and religious obligations
* Slow and incomplete data acquisition in disasters

[[File:Mona Ant Muscle.jpg|thumb|upright|framed|left|Showing only the muscles of the three dimensional body (This picture is created by iDASS and copyrighted to iGene Sdn. Bhd.)]]
[[File:Mona Anterior-LE.png|thumb|upright|framed|right|Showing only the bony skeleton of the three dimensional body(This picture is created by iDASS and copyrighted to iGene Sdn. Bhd.)]]
'''Digital Autopsy''' would be a technical solution for above mentioned problems. Employing medical imaging modalities like CT or MRI scanners is the first step in order to examine the deceased visually without any destructive, contaminating and non-preservative procedures like dissection. Moreover, using these images with software processing in visualization is the second step toward acquiring data from difficult regions from anatomical perspective and dignity of the body. Digital bodies in the system can be examined multiple times and reported not only in text but also in variety of available media (photo, movie, etc.). In addition, quick evaluation of bodies and body parts in massive disasters is available in comparison to time-consuming procedure of conventional autopsy.

However, there are few limitations in Digital Autopsy. The main constraint is the data that is provided by medical imaging modalities are based on X-Ray and Magnetic fields (CT and MRI) that limits the view to what can be recorded by these technologies. A very obvious difference is the real colour of internal body organs and their changes in the deceased, in comparison to what is simulated in the visualization software. The novelty of this technological solution has not given enough time for studies on the consistency of reports among different professionals on the same cases. Moreover, there are few articles about validity of Digital Autopsy in action.

== Technology==
Computed tomography and MRI scanning are the most common imaging modalities employed for this Digital Autopsy. Furthermore, CT Angiography has been used to provide the imaging data for analysing the deceased. The work output of these modalities are standard image files ([[DICOM]] files). Each image may have a thickness of 5mm, which means after whole body scan (human average height of 175&amp;nbsp;cm) it would produce 3500 images (slices) of human body. Using [[volume rendering]] these two dimensional images are assembled to make a 3D projection of human body. The 3D model is painted through RGBA transfer function to a colourful model. 
All visualization and image processing features for manipulating and navigating this 3D model make digital tools for conducting a Digital Autopsy. These features enable pathologist to explore the entire body and examine interested regions and organs from different angles. Image processing algorithms help them to virtually remove layers of body tissues like skin, muscle and bones. Moreover, low density objects like air and high density objects like metallic foreign bodies can be marked and viewed in the three dimensional body. For instance, organs with air (inside) like sinuses or intestines can be separated from other parts or any remnants of bullet in body due to gunshot injuries.

== Conducting an autopsy ==
The process starts with registration of the case with all corresponding meta-data in a Digital Autopsy Facility. The best place for these facilities are in neighbourhood of mortuaries because of considerations about security, carriage and body condition. The body would be scanned according to the schedule with proper adjustments for deceased body. It means there are different configuration for emitting the ray in deceased in comparison to live bodies. This step may take 5 – 10 minutes depends on the abilities of scanner. The output is aforementioned DICOM files (around 3500 files for whole body scan) that would be sent for visualization process. The end result is a colourful 3D body that can be explored and examined for positive or negative findings with the digital tools. 
The process is not finished with 3D exploration. The findings would be reported digitally in a multimedia report. This report includes all textual results accompanied by images and recorded movie of Digital Autopsy during examination. This report is not only for common submission to the court but also to be displayed in the court for attendance.

== Acceptance ==
There are not many justice systems around the world who have accepted the Digital Autopsy as their legal procedures of forensic investigations. While Switzerland is pioneering in the acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Nissan|first1 = Ephraim|title = Computer applications for handling legal evidence, police investigation and case argumentation|date = 2010|publisher = Springer|location = Dordrecht|isbn = 9789048189908}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries like Israel with strong religious background does not accept forensic imaging as a substitute or in conjunction with autopsy report. This might be due to lack of cases and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Tal|first1 = S|last2 = Berkovitz|first2 = N|last3 = Gottlieb|first3 = P|last4 = Zaitsev|first4 = K|title = Acceptance of forensic imaging in Israel.|journal = Isr Med Assoc J.|date = March 2015|volume = 17|issue = 3|pages = 141–4|url = https://www.ima.org.il/FilesUpload/IMAJ/0/109/54550.pdf|accessdate = 7 December 2015|pmid = 25946763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers tried to evaluate the reliability of Digital Autopsy in comparison with conventional (standard) autopsy that reveals totally 68% accuracy of Digital Autopsy regarding the pathogenetic  mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Westphal|first1 = Saskia E.|last2 = Apitzsch|first2 = Jonas|last3 = Penzkofer|first3 = Tobias|last4 = Mahnken|first4 = Andreas H.|last5 = Knüchel|first5 = Ruth|title = Virtual CT autopsy in clinical pathology: feasibility in clinical autopsies|journal = Virchows Archiv|date = 23 June 2012|volume = 461|issue = 2|pages = 211–219|doi = 10.1007/s00428-012-1257-4|pmid = 22729140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In UK, the Department of Health is currently considering recommendations for an integrated national cross-sectional autopsy imaging service, based on a regional service provided by mortuary-based imaging centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE USE OF POST-MORTEM IMAGING (ADULTS)|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/coroners/guidance/guidance-no1-use-of-port-mortem-imaging.pdf|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Pathologists prepared a document to standardize medico-legal post-mortem cross-sectional imaging in adults in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCR/RCPath statement on standards for medico-legal post-mortem cross-sectional imaging in adults|url=https://www.rcr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publication/FINALDOCUMENT_PMImaging_Oct12.pdf|website=The Royal College of Radiologists|publisher=The Royal College of Radiologists|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimitris Liantinis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|iː|ə|n|ˈ|t|iː|n|ɪ|s}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Δημήτρης Λιαντίνης {{IPA-el|ʎa(n)ˈdinis}}; born 23 July 1942, disappeared 1 June 1998) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]]. He was Associate Professor at the Department of Pedagogy of the Faculty of Philosophy, Pedagogy and Psychology of the [[University of Athens]], teaching the course "Philosophy of Education and Teaching of Greek Language and Literature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liantinis.org/content.php?category=45 Biography at Liantinis.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He has written nine books. His last and most seminal work ''[[Gemma (book)|Gemma]]'' (''Γκέμμα'') has been translated into several languages.

A great lover of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture, he devoted his life in studying and reinterpreting their cultural heritage. He wrote on various philosophical issues, including education, morality and death. He emphasised the need of incorporating the Ancient Greek ideas and morals into the modern Greek education system and also held explicit views on the decline of Western culture.

He has achieved popularity in [[Greece]] because of his strange and unexplained disappearance in the morning of 1 June 1998 at the age of 55 years. It is thought that he committed suicide in 1998 on the mountains of [[Taygetos]]. His last university [[lecture]] was delivered on 27 May 1998. In his letter to his family he wrote "I go away by my own will.  I disappear standing, strong, and proud."&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;[http://www.liantinis.org/%CE%B7-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BE%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85/ The Last letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

An online resource (Liantinis.gr) written and managed by his wife Professor Nikolitsa Georgopoulou contains letters to her, manuscripts, un-edited texts and critical comments for his books.

== Life and work ==

Liantinis was born in the [[Laconia]]n village of Liantina (Λιαντίνα) as Demetrios Nikolakakos (Νικολακάκος). He later changed his name to Liantinis to honour his village. He graduated in 1966 from the University of Athens curriculum of Philosophy and worked as a teacher. He moved to [[Munich]] in 1970 to study the German language, where he remained until 1972 while at the same time teaching at the Greek school of Otto Gesellschaft. In 1977 he completed his PhD thesis (titled "The Presence of the Greek Spirit in ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Η παρουσία του ελληνικού πνεύματος στις ελεγείες του Duino του Ράινερ Μαρία Ρίλκε" in Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;) under the supervision of Evangelos Moutsopoulos.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt; From 1975 to 1988 he was a lecturer and later professor in the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|National and Kapodestrian University of Athens]].

He was the author of nine books, principally on philosophy and education and has translated Friedrich Nietzsche's ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' in the Greek language.

In 1973 he married philosophy professor Nicolitsa Georgopoulou, with whom he had a daughter, Diotima, who is currently a professor at the faculty of Social Theology of the Theological School of the University of Athens.

== Core philosophical views ==

Liantinis' system of ideas was greatly influenced by the philosophy of Ancient Greece as well as the ideals of the [[Romantic movement]] and the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He made numerous references to the scientific achievements of his time, especially in the realm of [[cosmology]], and he attempted to formulate a connection between it and questions concerning the existence and nature of God. He wrote extensively about education (παιδεία ''[[paideia]]'') which was his own field of work, and some of his writings focus on what he saw as the moral and intellectual decline of modern Greeks as contrasted with their ancestors. To establish his position further, he devotes a part of his work in an effort to define exactly ''what'' the real the value of Ancient Greece was as well as the true world-view that they proposed. He argues against the notion that Ancient Greece, although ahead of its time for most of antiquity and perhaps the Middle Ages, was eventually superseded by the advancements in Renaissance Europe. In contrast, he believed that the Greeks possessed a ''complete'' culture, a kind of super-set for all Western cultures, past and present. As an example, in his book ''Gemma'' he argued that "The Greeks did not need [[psychoanalysis]] because they had [[Tragedy]]". This period of intellectual brilliance was to be short lived and Liantinis wrote that "it would be a sign of honesty if the Greeks where to stop philosophizing right after [[Aristotle]]" [''Πολυχρόνιο'' 2005]. In contrast, today, Greeks are completely unknown as "...for the Europeans [...]  we, the 'New-Greeks', are but a faceless bunch, something of a Balko-Turkish Arab. We are the '''Ortodox''' [intentionally misspelled] with the Russian-like writing [...] and the domes on our village houses" [''Gemma'' 1997].

On this topic, he often touched upon the highly controversial issue of the alleged superiority of Greek to Jewish culture, the former being expressed through the ancient philosophers and folk mythology and the latter through the great Judaic religions of Judaism, Islam and most importantly Christianity.

Death was also central to his work and (as he claimed) that of the Ancient Greeks. He denied the notion of Greece as a culture of playful joyfulness and argued that the Greeks had instead presented us with a world of infinite [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], an idea that is consistent with that of [[Pessimism#Ancient Greeks|Nietzsche's]] whom he greatly admired. Their philosophy was a study of death and their conclusions were absolute and hard to accept since they saw death as a final end, with no afterlife or moral rewards for the life lived on earth. Liadinis adhered to that notion and once again contrasted it to the less heroic view held in the Judaic religions. This could shed new light on his alleged suicide, by potentially infusing it with great moral courage as he ponders on the distance that separates the man who "honours the natural knowledge that once dead he will vanish [...] and the one who is taught to believe that once dead, he will migrate in some heavenly America" [''Τα Ελληνικά'' 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;126].

=== Classicism and Romanticism ===
Liantinis believed that [[Romanticism]] and [[Classicism]] are the only "valid" world-views that constitute both an artistic style and a way of life. He believed these two to be antithetical in nature, as the former is an expression of pure emotions while the latter of logic. In his view, the poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|J. W. Goethe]] tried to marry the two and his failed experiment was recorded in the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part of Faust]], appropriately called "The Quest for Helen". There, Faust, representing the [[romantic hero]] lies in bed with [[Helen of Troy]] only to produce a still-born child. Although the story symbolises the impossibility of a task it was deemed so important that many others, like Greece's national poet [[Dionysios Solomos]], took it upon themselves to complete.

=== Views on education ===

Education was central to what he saw as the long struggle of humanity to rise above the animal level and into something so elaborate that it could in turn explain the Universe that created it, a view that is consistent with the [[Anthropic principle|Anthropic Principle]] to which he has made reference. Education is the carrier of this monumental effort and contains the living memories of its People in the forms of language and poetry. These views are expressed mainly in ''Homo educandus'' [1984] and ''Τα Ελληνικά'' [1992] (roughly translated as 'The Greek Language'), where he blamed a part of the moral decline of his contemporaries on the shallowness and rigidity with which modern day teachers transmit knowledge, focusing on form rather than content. Instead he argued for a qualitative understanding of literature and poetry as for example in the need to distinguish between the different value levels of various Greek intellectuals, rather than presenting them as the single entity of "the Great Men of Greek letters". He also spoke about the great difficulty in understanding and teaching poetry within this rigid framework in which formal explanations are valued over deep understanding of meaning.

He advocated for a total separation of Church and State, especially in matters of education since he considers Christianity to be antithetical to Greek thought and one must choose one or the other. Following this stance, he warned against the increasing influence of the then [[Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens]] for his involvement in Greek politics.

=== Greek vs Jewish culture ===

This is a vast and highly controversial issue. Liantinis thought of Christianity as the main vessel of Jewish culture in the West and to understand his position better we might want to look at medieval Greek history and the [[Byzantine Empire]], when the church, aligned with the Emperors destroyed what remained of Ancient Greek alongside other Pagan religions, often through [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I|brutal means]].

Liantinis' argument, however, is not historical. He claims that the Greeks were morally superior, as they had the courage to create a morality that reflected the finite nature of existence rather than  imposing it as the divine law of an imaginary God who guarantees eternal life in the heavens. "The sorrowful longing of death, for the Greeks, gave birth to art. Where the fear of death for other people gave birth to religions" [''Τα Ελληνικά'' 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;127]. This harshly realistic view proved hard to maintain and in ''Gemma'' [1997] he writes that "the Jews cultivated the land of faith. The Greeks cultivated the land of knowledge [...] the Jews were executioners, the Greeks were judges ... that is why the Jews won". {{anchor|Giant Jews of science}}This alleged defeat of Greek culture is featured frequently in his work and is illustrated with a thought experiment found in the same book, where contemporary Europeans are asked about [[Empedocles]], [[Anaximander]], [[Leucippus]] and other somewhat lesser known yet important philosophers. He presumes that few if any will answer with conviction, yet the same sample would immediately recognise the biblical figures of [[Moses]], [[Abraham]] and [[Noah]]. He extends these thoughts to seminal thinkers like [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Karl Marx]], the "giant Jews of science" as he called them [''Gemma'' 1997], while contemporary Greeks are totally unable to offer anyone of equivalent importance.

=== Views on death ===

According to Liadinis, the notion of death occupied the ancients to such a degree that one could see their whole culture as arising from the radical views they held on the subject. They saw death as an unchanging cosmic law, much like today's notion of [[entropy]], and did not associate whatever [[afterlife]] they had conceived with a moral system of reward and punishment (like the ones found in the great Judaic religions). Although individual myths, like that of [[Sisyphus]] who was condemned to eternal punishment in the realms of [[Hades]], ''did'' exist, they were largely exceptions to the rule and never developed into a proper system of beliefs about life after death. In one of his lectures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=dukephilip|title=Liantinis, Zoi meta thanaton, YouTube video|date=2008-07-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRftd7Px_ho|accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liantinis says that Homer describes a scene where the hero, before engaging him in battle, says to his opponent: "the race of men is related to that of leaves" ("οἵη περ φύλλων γενεὴ τοίη δὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν"), as we momentarily stand fresh on the tree branch, then quickly surrender to the wind and rain. The lyric poet [[Pindar]] also questions in his works: "What are we [men] but dreams of shadows..." ("σκιᾶς ὄναρ ἄνθρωπος"), "...not even shadows proper" as Liantinis points out.

The only form of immortality that Liantinis (and the Greeks according to him) believed in was what he called "intra-world immortality" (ενδοκοσμική αθανασία), which comes from the memories a man leaves behind him, through his deeds and life example. This is indeed in accordance to the immense value the ancient Greeks placed on posthumous reputation (υστεροφημία).

On the same subject, he also emphasised the Greek hero's individualism (opposite to the Eastern dissolution of the self inside the Great Universe) even to the point of choosing his own death. In ''Gemma'', he writes poetically: "I will die, Death, when I want and not when you want.  In this last act, your desire is not going to be realised, it is my desire which will be realised.  I fight against your will.  I fight your power.  I fight all of your entity.  I will enter into the earth when I decide, not when you decide." [''Gemma'' 1997].

==Disappearance and death==

Liantinis disappeared on 1 June 1998. A taxi driver claimed that he drove the professor on the same day near [[Sparta (modern)|Sparti]] (near Taygetos) and that he was wearing a blue shirt and white footwear.

Liantinis had instructed his cousin to reveal to his daughter, after seven years, the location of the crypt where his remains could be found. His cousin did so. In July 2005 human bones were found in the area of the mountain Taygetos; forensic examinations verified that it was the body of Liantinis. No lethal substances were found to determine the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liantinis.org/english/ Dimitris Liantinis - Short Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filosofia.gr/liantinis.html Biography at Philosophia.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe that Liantinis took his own life as a protest against what he saw as the lack of values in modern Greek society.  In his last letter to his daughter he wrote: "My last act has the meaning of protest for the evil that we, the adults, prepare for the innocent new generations that are coming.  We live our life eating their flesh.  A very bad evil.  My unhappiness for this crime kills me."&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;

'''Edith Borella''' (died March 6, 1974) was an [[United States|American]] [[silent film]] [[actress]] of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] descent. She starred in films such as the 1913 film ''[[Through the Neighbor's Window]]'' with [[Charlotte Burton]] which was her debut. Her career only lasted two years between 1913 and 1915 but in that period of time she starred in 46 films. She married popular English-American actor [[Edward Coxen]] in 1914.

The '''Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011''' (c. 7) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] altering the rules on inheritance in England and Wales.

Under the forfeiture rule of English Law, a person may not inherit from someone whom he or she has unlawfully killed. In 2000 the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] used that rule to disinherit not only a murderer but also the murderer’s descendants. The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] published a consultation paper covering the issue in October 2003 followed by a final report on 27 July 2005. Their recommendations became the basis for this Act.&lt;ref name ="LC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/forfeiture-and-the-law-of-succession/ |title=Forfeiture and the Law of Succession |publisher=Law Commission |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Act, if a person loses their right to inheritance through the forfeiture rule, or through disclaiming it, that person is to be treated (for purposes of determining inheritance) as having died immediately prior to the [[testator]] or the [[intestacy|intestate]]. The Act amends the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]] and [[Wills Act 1837]] accordingly.

The Act received its Royal Assent on 12 July 2011, and came into force on 1 February 2012.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1363">In '''''Geldenhuys v Borman''''', an important case in the [[South Africa]]n [[inheritance|law of succession]], the [[testator]] had executed a total of three [[Will and testament|wills]], each revoking the previous one. For about three years the testator was a patient in [[Fort England Psychiatric Hospital|Fort England]], but he was released at a later stage. At the time the last will was executed, and although the testator was declared incapable of managing his affairs, there was no declaration that the testator was mentally incapable. Geldenhuys approached the court to declare all three wills invalid. The court noted that there is a [[informed consent#Competency of the patient|presumption of competency]], so that the onus of proof is on the person alleging [[Capacity (law)|incapacity]]. The court held that Geldenhuys had not discharged this onus, as incapacity to manage one’s affairs is not the same as mental incapacity. The wills were accordingly declared valid.

'''George William Biswell''' (1 September 1904 — September 1981) was an English professional footballer. He played for [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] before moving to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], where he spent the majority of his career. He also played for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] between his two spells with 'The Addicks'.&lt;ref name="stamford-bridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stamford-bridge.com/player.php?id=45&amp;surname=Biswell&amp;firstname=George#matches|title=George Biswell &amp;#124; Chelsea Player Profile &amp;#124; Stamford-Bridge.com The History of Chelsea FC|publisher=stamford-bridge.com|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Playing career ==
Biswell began his career as an amateur footballer at St Albans City&lt;ref name="hertsmemories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/page_id__1246.aspx|title=The glory days continue &amp;#124; A history of senior football in St Albans - Part 5 &amp;#124; St Albans Football &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; Sports &amp;#124; Leisure &amp;#124; Herts Memories|publisher=hertsmemories.org.uk|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left after a short time to join Watford, before turning professional with Charlton Athletic. He stayed with the [[London]] club until January 1928, when he made the journey across the capital to sign for Chelsea.

=== Chelsea ===
Making his debut for the Blues in a 1–0 win against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]], Biswell went on to play a further four games in his first season, scoring on 5 May 1928 when [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] overcame the Pensioners 2–1 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. The forward started the 1928–29 season brightly, netting two goals in as many games as the Blues beat [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] and [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]], respectively. Biswell then notched a brace in a 3–0 defeat of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 29 September 1928, not scoring again until almost two months later on 24 November 1928, when Chelsea drew 3–3 at home with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]. He finished the season with 8 goals in 19 appearances across all competitions after scoring his final goal - and the winner - for the club against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 9 March 1929. He only appeared once for Chelsea in the 1929–30 season, in a 1–0 defeat at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at the end of the year, before returning to Charlton Athletic.&lt;ref name="friardale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bounder.friardale.co.uk/Players%20Opps/GW%20Biswell.htm|title=George Biswell against opposition|publisher=bounder.friardale.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26807">The cells that give rise to the [[gametes]] are often set aside during [[Cleavage (embryo)|embryonic cleavage]]. During development, these cells will differentiate into [[primordial germ cells]], migrate to the location of the gonad, and form the [[Germline|germ line]] of the animal.

==Creation of germ plasm and primordial germ cells==
Cleavage in most animals segregates cells containing [[germ plasm]] from other cells. The germ plasm effectively turns off gene expression to render the genome of the cell inert. Cells expressing germ plasm become [[primordial germ cells]] (PGCs) which will then give rise to the [[gametes]]. The germ line development in mammals, on the other hand, occurs by induction and not by an endogenous germ plasm.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Germ plasm in fruit fly===
Germ plasm has been studied in detail in Drosophila. The posterior pole of the embryo contains necessary materials for the fertility of the fly. This cytoplasm, pole plasm, contains specialized materials called polar granules and the [[pole cell]]s are the precursors to primordial germ cells.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Pole plasm is organized by and contains the proteins and mRNA of the posterior group genes (such as [[oskar]], [[nanos gene]], Tudor, vasa, and Valois). These genes play a role in germ line development to localize nanos mRNA to the posterior and localize germ cell determinants. Drosophila progeny with mutations in these genes fail to produce pole cells and are thus sterile, giving these mutations the name 'grandchildless'. The genes [[Oskar]], nanos and germ cell-less (gcl) have important roles. Oskar is sufficient to recruit the other genes to form functional germ plasm. Nanos is required to prevent mitosis and somatic differentiation and for the pole cells to migrate to function as PGCs (see next section). Gcl is necessary (but not sufficient) for pole cell formation. In addition to these genes, Pgc polar granule component blocks phosphorylation and consequently activation of RNA polymerase II and shuts down transcription.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Germ plasm in amphibians===
Similar germ plasm has been identified in Amphibians in the polar cytoplasm at the vegetal pole. This cytoplasm moves to the bottom of the blastocoel and eventually ends up as its own subset of endodermal cells. These cells eventually become PGCs. The presence of homologs of nanos and vasa also implicate this germ plasm as germ-determining.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Migration of primordial germ cells==

===Fruit flies===
The first phase of migration in Drosophila occurs when the pole cells move passively and infold into the midgut invagination. Active migration occurs through repellents and attractants. The expression of wunen in the endoderm repels the PGCs out. The expression of columbus and hedgehog attracts the PGCs to the mesodermal precursors of the gonad. Nanos is required during migration. Regardless of PGC injection site, PGCs are able to correctly migrate to their target sites.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Zebrafish===
In zebrafish, the PGCs express two CXCR4 transmembrane receptor proteins. The signaling system involving this protein and its ligand, Sdf1, is necessary and sufficient to direct PGC migration in fish.

===Frogs===
In frogs, the PGCs migrate along the mesentery to the gonadal mesoderm facilitated by orientated extracellular matrix with fibronectin. There is also evidence for the CXCR4/Sdf1 system in frogs.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Birds===
In birds, the PGCs arise from the epiblast and migrate to anteriorly of the primitive streak to the germinal ridge. From there, they use blood vessels to find their way to the gonad. It is possible that the CXCR4/Sdf1 system is used.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Mammals===

In the mouse, [[Germ cell|primordial germ cells (PGCs)]] arise in the posterior [[primitive streak]] of the embryo&lt;ref name=pmid20027186&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson BE, Lehmann R |title=Mechanisms guiding primordial germ cell migration: strategies from different organisms |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20027186 |doi=10.1038/nrm2815|pmc=4521894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and start to migrate around 6.25 days after conception.

==Generation of mammalian PGCs in vitro==
With the vast knowledge about in-vivo PGC specification collected over the last few decades, several attempts to generate in-vitro PGCs from post-implantation epiblast were made. Various groups were able to successfully generate PGCs, cultured in the presences of BMP4 and various cytokines.&lt;ref name="pmid10049358"/&gt; The efficiency of this process was later enhanced by the addition of stem cell factor (SCF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and BMP8B.&lt;ref name=pmid19410550&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohinata Y, Ohta H, Shigeta M, Yamanaka K, Wakayama T, Saitou M |title=A signaling principle for the specification of the germ cell lineage in mice |journal=Cell |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=571–84 |date=May 2009  |pmid=19410550 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGCs generated using this method can be transplanted to give viable gametes and offspring in vivo.&lt;ref name=pmid19410550/&gt; PGCs can also be generated from naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that are cultured for two days in the presence of FGF and Activin-A to adopt an epiblast-like state.

==Differentiation of primordial germ cells==
Prior to their occupation of the genital ridge, there is no known difference between XX and XY PGCs.&lt;ref name=pmid20027186/&gt; However, once migration is complete, male and female PGCs begin to differentiate differently.

===Early male differentiation===

Male PGCs become known as [[gonocytes]] once they cease migration and undergo mitosis.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237&gt;{{cite journal |author=Culty M |title=Gonocytes, from the fifties to the present: is there a reason to change the name? |journal=Biology of Reproduction |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=46 |date=August 2013  |pmid=23843237 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.113.110544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gonocyte is generally used to describe all stages post PGC until the gonocytes differentiate into spermatogonia.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; Anatomically, gonocytes can be identified as large, euchromatic cells that often have two nucleoli in the nucleus.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt;

In the male genital ridge, transient [[Testis determining factor|Sry]] expression causes supporting cells to differentiate into [[Sertoli cells]] which then act as the organizing center for testis differentiation. Point mutations or deletions in the human or mouse [[Testis determining factor|Sry]] coding region can lead to female development in XY individuals.&lt;ref name=pmid22964823&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sekido R, Lovell-Badge R |title=Genetic control of testis development |journal=Sexual Development |volume=7 |issue=1–3 |pages=21–32 |year=2013 |pmid=22964823 |doi=10.1159/000342221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sertoli cells also act to prevent gonocytes from differentiating prematurely.&lt;ref name=pmid24324457&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossi P, Dolci S |title=Paracrine Mechanisms Involved in the Control of Early Stages of Mammalian Spermatogenesis |journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology |volume=4 |issue= |pages=181 |year=2013 |pmid=24324457 |pmc=3840353 |doi=10.3389/fendo.2013.00181}}&lt;/ref&gt; They produce the enzyme CYP26B1 to counteract surrounding [[retinoic acid]]. Retinoic acid acts as a signal to the gonocytes to enter [[meiosis]].&lt;ref name=pmid24324457/&gt; The gonocyte and Sertoli cells have been shown to form [[Gap junctions|gap and desmosomelike junctions]] as well as adherins junctions composed of [[cadherin]]s and [[connexin]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; To differentiate into spermatogonia, the gonocytes must lose their junctions to Sertoli cells and become migratory once again.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; They migrate to the basement membrane of the seminiferous cord&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; and differentiate.

===Late differentiation===

In the gonads, the germ cells undergo either spermatogenesis or oogenesis depending on whether the sex is male or female respectively.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Spermatogenesis===
{{Main|Spermatogenesis}}
Mitotic germ stem cells, [[spermatogonia]], divide by mitosis to produce [[spermatocytes]] committed to meiosis. The spermatocytes divide by meiosis to form [[spermatids]]. The post-meiotic spermatids differentiate through [[spermiogenesis]] to become mature and functional [[spermatozoa]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} [[Spermatogenesis|Spermatogenic cells]] at different stages of development in the mouse have a frequency of [[mutation]] that is 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequency in [[somatic cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

===Oogenesis===
{{Main|Oogenesis}}
Mitotic germ stem cells, [[oogonia]], divide by mitosis to produce primary [[oocytes]] committed to meiosis. Unlike sperm production, oocyte production is not continuous. These primary oocytes begin meiosis but pause in [[diplotene]] of [[meiosis I]] while in the embryo. All of the oogonia and many primary oocytes die before birth. After puberty in primates, small groups of oocytes and follicles prepare for ovulation by advancing to metaphase II. Only after fertilization is meiosis completed. Meiosis is asymmetric producing polar bodies and oocytes with large amounts of material for embryonic development.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The mutation frequency of female mouse germ line cells, like male germ line cells, is also lower than that of somatic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey P, McLean DJ, McMahan CA, Walter CA, McCarrey JR |title=Enhanced genetic integrity in mouse germ cells |journal=Biol.

Enhanced genetic integrity may be a fundamental characteristic of germ line development.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21520">{{About|the philosophical concept described by Nietzsche}}
"'''God is Dead'''" ([[German language|German]]: {{Audio|De-Gott ist tot.ogg|{{lang|de|„Gott ist tot“|nocat=y}}}}; also known as '''the Death of God''') is a widely quoted statement by [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Nietzsche used the phrase in a figurative sense, to express the idea that [[the Enlightenment]] had "killed" the possibility of belief in [[God]] or any [[gods]] having ever existed. Others, such as proponents of the strongest form of the [[Death of God theology]] have used the phrase in a literal sense, meaning that the Christian God who existed at one point, has ceased to exist. 

The phrase first appeared in Nietzsche's 1882 collection ''[[The Gay Science]]'' ({{lang|de|Die fröhliche Wissenschaft}}, also translated as "The Joyful Pursuit of Knowledge and Understanding").&lt;ref name="gayScience"&gt;in sections 108 (New Struggles), 125 (The Madman), and for a third time in section 343 (The Meaning of our Cheerfulness).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is most famously associated with Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang|de|Also sprach Zarathustra}}), which is most responsible for making the phrase popular.  Other philosophers had previously discussed the concept, 
including [[Philipp Mainländer]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

==Discussion by Hegel==
Discourses of a "death of God" in German culture appear as early as the 17th century and originally referred to [[Lutheran]] theories of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. The phrase "God is dead" appears in the hymn "Ein Trauriger Grabgesang" ("A mournful dirge) by [[Johann von Rist]]. Contemporary historians believe that 19th-century [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosophers, especially those associated with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], are responsible for removing the specifically Christian resonance of the phrase and associating it with secular philosophical and sociological theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 67-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the statement and its meaning are attributed to Nietzsche, Hegel had discussed the concept of the death of God, in his ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' where he considers the death of God to "Not be seen as anything but an easily recognized part of the usual Christian cycle of redemption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eric |last1=von der Luft |title=Sources of Nietzsche's "God is Dead!" and its Meaning for Heidegger |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |date=Apr–Jun 1984 |issue=2 |pages=263–276}} See page 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Hegel writes about the great pain of knowing that God is dead "The pure concept, however, or infinity, as the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks, must characterize the infinite pain, which previously was only in culture historically and as the feeling on which rests modern religion, the feeling that God Himself is dead, (the feeling which was uttered by Pascal, though only empirically, in his saying: Nature is such that it marks everywhere, both in and outside of man, a lost God), purely as a phase, but also as no more than just a phase, of the highest idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hegel |first1=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich |title=Philosophische Abhandlungen |date=1845 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's student [[Richard Rothe]], in his 1837 theological text ''Die Anfänge der christlichen Kirche und ihrer Verfassung'', appears to be one of the first philosophers to associate the idea of a death of God with the sociological theory of [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), pp. 75–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the philosophy of Philipp Mainländer==
Before Nietzsche, the concept was popularized in philosophy by the German philosopher [[Philipp Mainländer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900.|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0198768710|location=Oxford|pages=202|quote=Batz introduces a very modern and redolent theme: the death of God. He popularized the theme before Nietzsche.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while reading Mainländer, that Nietzsche explicitly writes to have parted ways with [[Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's Philosophical Context: An Intellectual Biography|last=Brobjer|first=Thomas H.|publisher=University Of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=9780252032455|location=|pages=149|quote=Decher emphasizes the importance of the fact that Mainländer reinterpreted Schopenhauer's metaphysical and single will to a multiplicity of wills (always in struggle) and the importance of this for Nietzsche's will to power. It was in a letter to Cosima Wagner, december 19, 1876, that is, while reading Mainländer, that Nietzsche for the first time explicitly claimed to have parted ways with Schopenhauer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mainländer’s more than 200 pages long criticism of Schopenhauer’s metaphysics, he argues against one cosmic unity behind the world, and champions a real multiplicity of wills struggling with each other for existence. Yet, the interconnection and the unitary movement of the world, which are the reasons that lead philosophers to [[pantheism]], are undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophie der Erlösung. Zweiter Band.

It is therefore declared to be dead.

But this basic unity ''is of the past''; it no longer ''is''. It has, by changing its being, totally and completely shattered itself. ''God has died and his death was the life of the world. ''{{#tag:ref|"{{lang|de|Jetzt haben wir auch das Recht, diesem Wesen den bekannten Namen zu geben, der von jeher Das bezeichnete, was keine Vorstellungskraft, kein Flug der kühnsten Phantasie, kein abstraktes noch so tiefes Denken, kein gesammeltes, andachtsvolles Gemüth, kein entzückter, erdentrückter Geist je erreicht hat: '''Gott'''. Sie hat sich, ihr Wesen verändernd, voll und ganz zu einer Welt der Vielheit zersplittert. Aber diese einfache Einheit '''ist gewesen'''; sie '''ist''' nicht mehr. Gott ist gestorben und sein Tod war das Leben der Welt.
}}"&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Mainländer: '' Die Philosophie der Erlösung. Erster Band.'' Berlin 1876.
&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}|Mainländer, ''Die Philosophie der Erlösung''}}

==Nietzsche's formulation==
The idea is stated in "The Madman" as follows:

{{quotation|God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?|Nietzsche, ''The Gay Science'', Section 125|tr. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]&lt;ref name="gayScience"/&gt;}}

But the best known passage is at the end of part 2 of ''Zarathustra's Prolog'', where after beginning his allegorical journey Zarathustra encounters an aged ascetic who expresses [[misanthropy]] and love of God:

{{quotation|
When Zarathustra heard these words, he saluted the saint and said "What should I have to give you! But let me go quickly that I take nothing from you!" And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing as two boys laugh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: "Could it be possible! This old saint has not heard in his forest that ''God is dead''!"|Nietzsche, "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" |tr. [[R.J. Hollingdale]]&lt;ref&gt;Penguin Classics Edition 1969 reprint p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Als Zarathustra aber allein war, sprach er also zu seinem Herzen: "Sollte es denn möglich sein! Dieser alte Heilige hat in seinem Walde noch nichts gehört, daß '''Gott tot ist!'''.}} Reclam edition 1969 p 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Explanation==

Nietzsche used the phrase to sum up the effect and consequence that the [[Age of Enlightenment]] had had on the centrality of the concept of God within [[Western culture|Western European civilization]], which had been essentially [[Christian]] in character since the later Roman Empire. The Enlightenment had brought about the triumph of scientific rationality over sacred revelation; the rise of [[philosophical materialism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] that to all intents and purposes had dispensed with the belief in or role of God in human affairs and the destiny of the world.

Nietzsche recognized the crisis that this "Death of God" represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief. "When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to [[Christian morality]] out from under one's feet. This [[morality]] is by no means self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of [[Christianity]], the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands."&lt;ref&gt;trans. Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale; ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', Expeditions of an Untimely Man, sect. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This is why in "The Madman", a passage which primarily addresses [[nontheists]] (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] in the absence of a divine order.

The Enlightenment's conclusion of the "Death of God" gave rise to the proposition that humans - and [[Western Civilization]] as a whole - could no longer believe in a divinely ordained moral order. This death of God will lead, Nietzsche said, not only to the rejection of a belief of cosmic or physical order but also to a rejection of absolute values themselves — to the rejection of belief in an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[morality|moral law]], binding upon all individuals. In this manner, the loss of an absolute basis for morality leads to [[nihilism]]. This nihilism is that for which Nietzsche worked to find a solution by re-evaluating the foundations of human values.

Nietzsche believed that the majority of people did not recognize this death out of the deepest-seated fear or [[angst]]. Therefore, when the death did begin to become widely acknowledged, people would despair and nihilism would become rampant.

===Nietzsche and Heidegger===

[[Martin Heidegger]] understood this part of Nietzsche's philosophy by looking at it as death of [[metaphysics]]. In his view, Nietzsche's words can only be understood as referring not to a particular [[theology|theological]] or [[anthropology|anthropological]] view but rather to the end of philosophy itself. Philosophy has, in Heidegger's words, reached its maximum potential as metaphysics and Nietzsche's words warn of its demise and that of any metaphysical world view. If metaphysics is dead, Heidegger warns, that is because from its inception that was its [[wiktionary:fate|fate]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgan Muller-Lauter, {{lang|de|Heidegger und Nietzsche: Nietzsche-Interpretationen III}}, Walter de Gruyter 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzsche and others===
[[Paul Tillich]] as well as [[Richard Schacht]] were influenced by the writings of Nietzsche and especially of his phrase "God is dead."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj3AntBLBQY ''Richard Schacht, After the Death of God: Friedrich Nietzsche and Paul Tillich''] You Tube&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]] wrote the following about Nietzsche's view: {{Quotation|For the most part Altizer prefers mystical to ethical language in solving the problem of the death of God, or, as he puts it, in mapping out the way from the profane to the sacred. This combination of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] makes rather rough reading, but his position at the end is a relatively simple one. Here is an important summary statement of his views: If theology must now accept a dialectical vocation, it must learn the full meaning of Yes-saying and No-saying; it must sense the possibility of a Yes which can become a No, and of a No which can become a Yes; in short, it must look forward to a [[dialectical]] {{lang|la|coincidentia oppositorum}}. Let theology rejoice that faith is once again a "scandal," and not simply a moral scandal, an offense to man’s pride and righteousness, but, far more deeply, an ontological scandal; for eschatological faith is directed against the deepest reality of what we know as history and the cosmos. Through Nietzsche’s vision of Eternal Recurrence we can sense the ecstatic liberation that can be occasioned by the collapse of the transcendence of Being, by the death of God ... and, from Nietzsche’s portrait of Jesus, theology must learn of the power of an eschatological faith that can liberate the believer from what to the contemporary sensibility is the inescapable reality of history. But liberation must finally be effected by affirmation. ... ( See "Theology and the Death of God," in this volume, pp. 95-111.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=537&amp;C=587 ''The Death of God Theologies Today by William Hamilton''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201041352/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=537&amp;C=587 |date=2015-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New possibilities===
Nietzsche believed there could be positive possibilities for humans without God. Relinquishing the belief in God opens the way for human creative abilities to fully develop. The Christian God, he wrote, would no longer stand in the way, so human beings might stop turning their eyes toward a [[supernatural]] realm and begin to acknowledge the value of this world.

Nietzsche uses the [[metaphor]] of an open sea, which can be both exhilarating and terrifying. The people who eventually learn to create their lives anew will represent a new stage in human existence, the {{lang|de|[[Übermensch]]}} — i.e. the personal [[archetype]] who, through the conquest of their own nihilism, themselves become a sort of mythical [[hero]]. The "death of God" is the motivation for Nietzsche's last (uncompleted) philosophical project, the "revaluation of all values".

===Nietzsche's voice===
Although Nietzsche puts the statement "God is Dead" into the mouth of a "madman"&lt;ref&gt;Read the whole section here from Thomas Common's translation [https://archive.org/stream/completenietasch10nietuoft#page/166/mode/2up ''The Madman''] Section 125&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Gay Science'', he also uses the phrase in his own voice in sections 108 and 343 of the same book. In the madman's passage, the man is described as running through a marketplace shouting, "I seek God! I seek God!" He arouses some amusement; no one takes him seriously. Maybe he took an ocean voyage? Lost his way like a little child? Maybe he's afraid of us (non-believers) and is hiding? — much laughter. Frustrated, the madman smashes his lantern on the ground, crying out that "God is dead, and we have killed him, you and I!" "But I have come too soon," he immediately realizes, as his detractors of a minute before stare in astonishment: people cannot yet see that they have killed God. He goes on to say:

{{quote|This prodigious event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars — and yet they have done it themselves.|trans. Walter Kaufmann|''The Gay Science'', sect. 125}}

Earlier in the book (section 108), Nietzsche wrote "God is Dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we — we still have to vanquish his shadow, too." The protagonist in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' also speaks the words, commenting to himself after visiting a hermit who, every day, sings songs and lives to glorify his god as noted above.

What is more, Zarathustra later refers not only to the death of God, but states: "Dead are all the Gods". It is not just one morality that has died, but all of them, to be replaced by the life of the {{lang|de|Übermensch}}, the new man:

{{quote|'DEAD ARE ALL THE GODS: NOW DO WE DESIRE THE OVERMAN TO LIVE.'|trans. [[Thomas Common]]|Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part I, Section XXII,3}}
&lt;!--
Coming across in a hymn of [[Martin Luther]] what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] described as ''the cruel words'', ''the harsh utterance'', namely, ''God is dead'', the latter was perhaps the first great philosopher to develop the theme of God's death according to whom, to one form of experience, God is dead. Commenting on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s first ''Critique'', [[Heinrich Heine]] spoke of ''a dying God''. Heine influenced Nietzsche. Since Heine and Nietzsche the phrase ''Death of God'' became popular. (K Satchidananda Murty, ''The Realm of Between'', IIAS,1973)--&gt;

==Death of God theological movement==
{{main|Death of God theology}}
The cover of the April 8, 1966 edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and the accompanying article concerned a movement in American theology that arose in the 1960s known as the "death of God". Although theologians since Nietzsche had occasionally used the phrase "God is dead" to reflect increasing [[nontheism|unbelief in God]], the concept rose to prominence in the late 1950s and 1960s, before waning again.&lt;ref&gt;Gundry, S.N. "Death of God Theology" in ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', ed. Walter A. Elwell, Grand Rapids: Baker (2001), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The main proponents of this [[theology]] included the Christian theologians [[Gabriel Vahanian]], [[Paul van Buren]], [[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]], [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]], [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] and [[John D. Caputo]], and the [[rabbi]] [[Richard L. Rubenstein]].

[[Image:Odin rides to Hel.jpg|thumb|"Odin Rides to Hel" (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]].]]
	
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Hel''' (occasionally Helheim in secondary sources), the location, shares a name with [[Hel (being)|Hel]], a being who rules over the location. In late [[Iceland]]ic sources, varying descriptions of Hel are given and various figures are described as being buried with items that will facilitate their journey to Hel after their death. In the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', [[Brynhildr]]'s trip to Hel after her death is described and [[Odin]], while alive, also visits Hel upon his horse [[Sleipnir]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Prose Edda]]'', [[Baldr]] goes to Hel on his death and subsequently [[Hermóðr]] uses Sleipnir to attempt to retrieve him.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse feminine proper noun ''Hel'' is identical to the name of the entity that presides over the realm, Old Norse ''Hel''. The word has [[cognate]]s in all branches of the [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old English]] ''hell'' (and thus Modern English ''hell''), [[Old Frisian]] ''helle'', [[Old Saxon]] ''hellia'', [[Old High German]] ''hella'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''halja''. All forms ultimately derive from the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] feminine noun *''xaljō'' ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the [[Indo-European ablaut|o-grade form]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''kel-'', *''kol''-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.&lt;ref name="HEL-NOUN"&gt;For discussion and analysis, see Orel (2003:156) and Watkins (2000:38).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is etymologically related to Modern English ''hall'' and therefore also ''[[Valhalla]]'', an afterlife 'hall of the slain' in Norse Mythology. ''Hall'' and its numerous Germanic cognates derive from Proto-Germanic *''hallō'' 'covered place, hall', from Proto-Indo-European *''kol-''.&lt;ref name="HELL-HALL"&gt;This is highlighted in Watkins (2000:38).&lt;/ref&gt;

Related early Germanic terms and concepts include Proto-Germanic *''xalja-rūnō(n)'', a feminine compound noun, and *''xalja-wītjan'', a neutral compound noun. This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun *''[[haliurunnae]]'' (attested by [[Jordanes]]; according to philologist [[Vladimir Orel]], meaning '[[witchcraft|witches]]'), Old English ''helle-rúne'' ('sorceress, [[necromancer]]', according to Orel), and Old High German ''helli-rūna'' 'magic'. The compound is composed of two elements: *''xaljō'' (*''haljō'') and *''rūnō'', the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English ''[[runic alphabet|rune]]''.&lt;ref name="HELL-RUNE"&gt;See discussion at Orel (2003:155-156 &amp; 310).&lt;/ref&gt; The second element in the Gothic ''haliurunnae'' may however instead be an agent noun from the verb ''rinnan'' ("to run, go"), which would make its literal meaning "one who travels to the netherworld".&lt;ref&gt;Scardigli, Piergiuseppe, Die Goten: Sprache und Kultur (1973) pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Winfred, A Gothic Etymological Dictionary (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Germanic *''xalja-wītjan'' (or *''halja-wītjan'') is reconstructed from Old Norse ''hel-víti'' 'hell', Old English ''helle-wíte'' 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon ''helli-wīti'' 'hell', and the Middle High German feminine noun ''helle-wīze''. The compound is a compound of *''xaljō'' (discussed above) and *''wītjan'' (reconstructed from forms such as Old English ''witt'' 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon ''gewit'' 'understanding', and Gothic ''un-witi'' 'foolishness, understanding').&lt;ref name="HELVÍTI"&gt;Orel (2003:156 &amp; 464).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==
===''Poetic Edda''===
In reference to Hel, in the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', a [[völva]] states that Hel will play an important role in [[Ragnarök]]. The Völva states that a crowing "sooty-red cock from the halls of Hel" is one of three cocks that will signal one of the beginning events of Ragnarök. The other two are Fjalar in [[Jotunheim]] and Gullunkambi in [[Valhalla]].&lt;ref&gt;The name of this rooster is nowhere stated. In ''[[Völuspá]]'', it is only referred to as a "sooty-red cock in the halls of Hel" that "crows down below the earth" (Larrington translation).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Grímnismál]]'' stanza 31, Hel is listed as existing beneath one of the three roots of the world tree [[Yggdrasil]]. One of the other two leads to the [[Jötunn|frost jötnar]] and the third to Mankind. In ''[[Guðrúnarkviða I]]'', as Herborg tells of her grief in having prepared funeral arrangements for various members of her family, her children and her husbands, described it as "arranging their journey to Hel".&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON&gt;Larrington (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short poem ''[[Helreið Brynhildar]]'', Hel is directly referenced as a location in the title, translating to "Brynhild's Hel-Ride". While riding along a road on the border of Hel in a lavish cart (the cart her corpse was burnt within), [[Brynhildr]] encounters a dead giantess at a [[burial mound]] belonging to her. This results in a heated exchange, during which Brynhildr tells of her life.

In ''[[Baldrs draumar]]'', [[Odin]] rides to the edge of Hel to investigate nightmares that [[Baldr]] has had. He uses a spell to bring to life the corpse of a [[Völva]]. Odin introduces himself under a false name and pretense and asks for information from the völva relating to Baldr's dreams. The völva reluctantly proceeds to produce prophecies regarding the events of [[Ragnarök]].

The poem gives some information regarding the geographic location of Hel in parallel to the description in the Prose Edda, which may be related to the fact that it was not included in the Codex Regius but is instead a later addition.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON/&gt; [[Niflhel]] is mentioned as being just outside Hel. The bloody [[Garmr]] makes an appearance, encountering Odin on Odin's ride to Hel. Odin continues down the road and approaches Hel, which is described as the "high hall of Hel."&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON/&gt; There he proceeds to the grave of the Völva near the eastern doors where the descriptions of Hel end.

===''Prose Edda''===
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', more detailed information is given about the location, including a detailed account of a venture to the region after the death of the god [[Baldr]]. [[Snorri Sturluson|Snorri]]'s descriptions of Hel in the ''Prose Edda'' are not corroborated outside ''[[Baldrs draumar]]'', which does not appear in the original [[Codex Regius]] but is a later addition often included with modern editions of the ''Poetic Edda''.

====''Gylfaginning''====
In the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Hel is introduced in chapter 3 as a location where "evil men" go upon death, and into [[Niflhel]]. The chapter further details that Hel is in the ninth of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]].&lt;ref name=BYOCK12&gt;Byock (2006:12).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 34, [[Hel (being)|Hel, the being]] is introduced. [[Snorri]] writes that Hel was cast down into Hel by Odin who "made her ruler over Nine Worlds". Snorri further writes that there Hel is located in [[Niflheim]]. Here it is related that she could give out lodging and items to those sent to her that have died of disease or old age. A very large dwelling is described as existing in Niflheim owned by Hel with huge walls and gates. The hall is called - or inside of this huge hall there is a hall belonging to Hel called - [[Éljúðnir]]. Within this hall, Hel is described as having a servant, a slave and various possessions.&lt;ref name=BYOCK39&gt;Byock (2006:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of chapter 49, the death of Baldr and [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] is described. [[Hermóðr]], described as Baldr's brother in this source, sets out for Hel on horseback to retrieve the deceased Baldr.&lt;ref name=BYOCK67-69/&gt; To enter Hel, Hermóðr rides for [[Numbers in Norse mythology|nine nights]] through "valleys so deep and dark that he saw nothing" until he arrives at the river [[Gjöll]] ("Noisy") and the [[Gjallarbrú|Gjöll bridge]]. The bridge is described as having a roof made of shining gold. Hermóðr then proceeds to cross it. Hermóðr encounters [[Móðguð]], who is the guard of the bridge ("Furious Battler").&lt;ref name=BYOCK67-69&gt;Byock (2006:67-69).&lt;/ref&gt;

Móðguð speaks to Hermóðr and comments that the bridge echoes beneath him more than the entire party of five people who had just passed. This is a reference to Baldr, Nanna and those that were burnt in their funeral pyre passing over the bridge on death. Móðguð also says that the dead in Hel appear as a different color than the living and tells him that to get to Hel he must go "down and to the North" where he would find the Road to Hel.&lt;ref name=BYOCK67-69/&gt;

Continuing along the Road to Hel, Hermóðr encounters the Gates of Hel. Hermóðr remounts, spurs Sleipnir, and the two bound far over it. Hermóðr proceeds further beyond the gates for some distance before arriving at the hall, dismounting and entering. There Hermóðr sees Baldr sitting in a "seat of honor" and Hermóðr spends a night in Hel. The following day, Hermóðr presses Hel, the being, to allow Baldr to leave. Hel gives him an offer and then Baldr leads him out of the hall. Baldr then gives Hermóðr various gifts from Nanna and himself to bring from Hel to the living Æsir. Hermóðr then retraces his path back to the land of the living. Hel's offer fails and in chapter 50, [[Loki]] is blamed for Baldr remaining in Hel.&lt;ref name=BYOCK67-69/&gt;

In chapter 53, Hel is mentioned a final time in the ''Prose Edda''.&lt;ref name=BYOCK77&gt;Byock (2006:77).&lt;/ref&gt; Here, [[Höðr]] and Baldr are mentioned as returning from Hel in a post-[[Ragnarök]] world:

===''Gesta Danorum''===
Book I of ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' contains an account of what has often been interpreted as a trip to Hel. While having dinner, King [[Hadingus]] is visited by a woman bearing stalks of [[Conium|hemlock]] who asks him if he knows where such fresh herbs grow in winter. Hadingus wants to know; so the woman muffles him with her cloak, pulls him into the ground, and they vanish. Saxo reasons that the gods wished for Hadingus to visit in the flesh where he will go when he dies.&lt;ref name=FISHER30-31&gt;Davidson (1998:30-31).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two penetrate a dark and misty cloud, and then continue along a path worn from heavy use over the ages. The two see men wearing rich-looking robes, and nobles wearing purple. Passing them, they finally reach sunny regions where the herbs the woman presented Hadingus grow.&lt;ref name=FISHER30-31/&gt;

Hadingus and the woman continue until they arrived at a river of blue-black water that is fast-moving, full of rapids, and filled with various weapons. They cross the bridge, and see two "strongly-matched" armies meeting. Hadingus asks the woman about their identity, and she responds that they are men that have met their death by sword, and that they present an everlasting display of their destruction while attempting to equal the activity of their past lives.&lt;ref name=FISHER30-31/&gt;

Moving forward, the two encounter a wall that they cannot find a way over. The woman attempts to leap over it, but despite her slender and wrinkled body, cannot. The woman removes the head of a cock that she was carrying and throws it over the wall. The bird immediately crows; it has returned to life. Hadingus returns to his wife, and foils a threat by pirates.&lt;ref name=FISHER30-31/&gt;

==Theories==
[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing on Snorri's unique description of Hel in his Prose Edda, states that "it seems likely that Snorri's account of the underworld is chiefly his own work" and that the idea that the dead entering Hel who have died of sickness and old age may have been an attempt on Snorri's part to reconcile the tradition with his description of [[Valhalla]], citing that "the one detailed account of Hel" that Snorri gives is that of Baldr entering Hel without dying of old age or sickness. Davidson writes that Snorri was potentially using a "rich source" unknown to us for his description of Hel, though it may not have told him very much about the location beyond that it was a hall and that Snorri's description of Hel may at times be influenced by [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings about the after-life.&lt;ref name=HRROADTO&gt;Davidson (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hester Lynch Thrale''' (born '''Hester Lynch Salusbury''' and after her second marriage becoming '''Hester Lynch Piozzi''', 27 January 1741 [NS] – 2 May 1821) was a Welsh-born [[list of diarists|diarist]], author, and patron of the arts. Her diaries and correspondence are an important source of information about [[Samuel Johnson]] and 18th-century English life.

==Early years==
Hester Lynch Salusbury was born at Bodvel Hall, [[Caernarvonshire]], Wales, the only daughter of Hester Lynch Cotton and [[John Salusbury (diarist)|Sir John Salusbury]]. As a member of the powerful [[Salusbury Family]], she belonged to one of the most illustrious Welsh land-owning dynasties of the Georgian era. Through her father's line, she was a direct descendant of [[Katheryn of Berain]].

==Career==
[[File:Hester Lynch Thrale (Mrs Piozzi) 02185.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving of a ''Portrait of Mrs. Thrale at the age of 40'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]
[[File:thralehouse.jpg|thumb|upright|Streatham Park]]

After her father had gone bankrupt in an attempt to invest in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Canada, she married the rich brewer [[Henry Thrale]] on 11 October 1763, at St. Anne's Chapel, [[Soho]], London. They had 12 children and lived at [[Streatham|Streatham Park]]. The marriage often was strained, however: her husband frequently felt slighted by members of the court and may well have married to improve his social status. The Thrales' eldest daughter, [[Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith|Hester]], became a viscountess.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

After her marriage, Mrs. Thrale was liberated and free to associate with whom she pleased. Due to her husband's financial status, she was able to enter London society, as a result of which she met [[Samuel Johnson]], [[James Boswell]], Bishop [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and other literary figures, including the young [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]], whom she took with her to [[Gay Street, Bath|Gay Street]], [[Bath, England|Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 45–56.&lt;/ref&gt;


In July 1774 Johnson visited Wales in Mrs. Thrale's company,{{sfn|Boswell|1851|page=185}} during which time they visited Hester's uncle [[Sir Lynch Cotton, 4th Baronet|Sir Lynch Cotton]] at [[Combermere Abbey|Combermere]] in Denbighshire.{{sfn|Broadley|1909|page=176}} Frances, the wife of Sir Lynch's son [[Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, 5th Baronet|Robert]] "found Johnson, despite his rudeness, at times delightful, having a manner peculiar to himself in relating anecdotes that could not fail to attract old and young. Her impression was that Mrs. Thrale was very vexatious in wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much."{{sfn|Stapleton Cotton|Stapleton Cotton|Knollys|1866|page=22}}

Johnson wrote two verses for Hester Thrale in 1775, the first [https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214121/http://www.thrale.com/mrs_thrale_35_verses in celebration of her 35th birthday], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214609/http://www.thrale.com/latin_ode_hester_thrale another in Latin] to honour her.

Fanny Burney, in her diary, describes the conversations at several of Mrs. Thrale's [[Party#Soir.C3.A9es|soirées]], including one in 1779 about a young woman named Miss Sophy Streatfeild (1755–1835),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45505&lt;/ref&gt; who was a favourite of both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thrale, rather to the chagrin of Hester, who commented that Sophy "had a power of captivation that was irresistible... her beauty joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her tearful eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the heart of any man she thought worth attacking."&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The touch of understandable spite hereby revealed in Mrs. Thrale's nature is tempered by her wry humour in remarking (after another of her male guests had professed devotion to Sophy and the desire to "soothe" her): "I would ensure her power of crying herself into any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how beautiful she looked in tears" and (on being rebuked about this) "Oh but she liked it... Miss Burney would have run away but she came forward on purpose to show herself. Sophy Streatfeild is never happier than when tears trickle down from her fine eyes in company."&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thrales were in Bath in 1780 at the time of the [[Gordon Riots]], when a Roman Catholic chapel was set on fire,&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; although the greater worry was whether Mr. Thrale's brewery in Southwark would escape being ransacked, which it narrowly did.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanny records Hester's distress on losing her husband (4 April 1781), referring to her as "sweet Mrs. Thrale" and sympathising with the "agitation" she was under in having to sell the brewery and wind up his affairs. Fanny was there to congratulate and cheer Hester when the business was concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ensuing years, Hester fell in love with Gabriel Mario Piozzi, an Italian music teacher, and married him on 25 July 1784. She complained: "I see the English newspapers are full of gross Insolence towards me," with one commenting how Thrale could not have imagined "his wife's disgrace, by eventually raising an obscure and penniless Fiddler into sudden Wealth."{{sfn|Gopnik|2008}} This caused a rift with Johnson, which was only perfunctorily mended shortly before his death. The levelling marriage also earned her the disapproval of Fanny (who would herself marry in 1793 the impoverished, Catholic émigré Alexandre D'Arblay) and her cousins the [[Viscount Combermere|Cottons]]. With her second husband, Hester retired to [[Brynbella]], a specially built [[country house]] on her Bach y Graig estate in the [[Vale of Clwyd]], near [[Tremeirchion]] village in north Wales. During this time she began to reflect heavily on her ancestry, and for a time became obsessed with the idea of reclaiming her father's Canadian lands in [[Herring Cove]], an enclave of [[Nova Scotia]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

After Johnson's death, she published ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson]]'' (1786) and their letters to each other (1788).&lt;ref name="ODNB page" &gt;Michael J. Franklin, "Piozzi , Hester Lynch (1741–1821)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22309 Retrieved 25 April 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Burney, who considered both Johnson and Hester to be among her dearest friends, read the unpublished manuscript with much interest, but disapproved of the decision to publish, noting, "She has given all – every word – and thinks that, perhaps, a justice to Dr. Johnson, which, in fact, is the greatest injury to his memory."&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Hester Thrale's diaries, which were known as ''[[Thraliana]]'', and were not published until 1949, these sources help to fill out the biased picture of Johnson often presented in Boswell's ''Life''. Johnson often stayed with the Thrale household and had his own room above the library at Streatham, in which he worked. Hester's papers provide more insight into his composition process.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Her ''Retrospection: or a review of the most striking and important events, characters, situations, and their consequences which the last eighteen hundred years have presented to the view of mankind''&lt;ref&gt;Hester Thrale Piozzi, 2 vols, London: John Stockdale, 1801&lt;/ref&gt; was an attempt at a popular history of that period, but it was not received well by critics, some of whom patently resented female intrusion into the male preserve of history. Posterity has been kinder. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', "it has since been seen as a [[feminist history]], concerned to show changes in manners and mores in so far as they affected women; it has also been judged to anticipate Marxian history in its keen apprehension of reification: 'machines imitated mortals to unhoped perfection, and men found out they were themselves machines'."&lt;ref name="ODNB page" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hester Piozzi died at No. 10 (now 20) Sion Row, [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]], Bristol, of complications after a fall, and was buried on 16 May 1821 near Brynbella in the churchyard of Corpus Christi Church, [[Tremeirchion]], next to Piozzi.&lt;ref name="ODNB page" /&gt; A marble inside the church was erected in 1909 inscribed with the words
&lt;blockquote&gt;Near this place are interred the remains of&lt;br /&gt;
Hester Lynch Piozzi.&lt;br /&gt;

Fanny Burney eulogised her, going so far as to make a comparison with [[Germaine de Staël]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay''. Ed. [[Joyce Hemlow]] et al., 12 vols. (London: OUP, 1972–84), IX, pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of her death to nearly the present, she was referred to by scholars as Johnson had referred to her as "Mrs. Thrale" or "Hester Thrale."  However, she is now often referred to as either "Hester Lynch Piozzi" or "Mrs. Piozzi."

[[Samuel Beckett]] would draw on Thrale's diaries and ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson|Anecdotes]]'' to dramatize her and Samuel Johnson's relationship in one of his earliest plays, ''[[Disjecta (Beckett)#Part IV: Human Wishes|Human Wishes]]''. The play was abandoned after the completion of the first act.

Author Lillian de la Torre featured Mrs. Thrale in the story "The Stolen Christmas Box," part of her series featuring [[Samuel Johnson]] as a detective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6604">'''Impurity after childbirth''' is a form of impurity, primarily found in Abrahamic religions, that begins after a woman has given birth.

== Biblical law on impurity after childbirth ==
According to [[Leviticus]] 12, a woman who gives birth to a son remains impure for a week, and afterwards immerses in a body of water to purify herself. In rabbinical interpretation of Leviticus 12 any subsequent blood she sees over the next 33 days would be considered ''dam tohar'' (דַּם טׂוהַר – ritually clean blood), and that blood does not prohibit her from sexual relations with her husband. The law for a woman who gives birth to a daughter is the same, however, the durations are doubled. The mother becomes impure for 2 weeks, and after immersion, any blood she sees over the next 66 days is ''dam tohar''.

== Jewish law and practices ==
Within the realm of Biblical law and post-Biblical Jewish religious discourse surrounding [[tumah and taharah]], the impurity is called in Hebrew ''tumat yoledet''. The biblical laws of postpartum impurity no longer apply, according to rabbinic law,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and a ''yoledet'' is considered impure until her flow of blood ends. Hence, [[Halakhah]] treats a ''yoledet'' (woman who gives birth) similarly to any woman with [[niddah]] status. Nonetheless, in some Jewish communities, ceremonies and a degree of seclusion were applied to postparturient women. For example, there was a Sana Yemenite custom of women visiting the mother during 4–6 weeks after childbirth. The mother would be visited in a special room in her home and she would sit in a decorated triangle box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Jewish passages: cycles of Jewish life|last = Goldberg|first = Harvey|publisher = Univ. of California|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian practices ==
Some early churches followed the Jewish custom of restricting women from worship after giving birth until the purification ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Susan K. Roll, "The Old Rite of Churching Women after Childbirth, in {{cite book|editor1-last=De Troyer|editor1-first=Kristin|title=Wholly woman, holy blood: a feminist critique of purity and impurity|date=2003|publisher=Trinity Press International|location=Harrisburg, PA|isbn=9781563384004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newell, Rachel C. "The thanksgiving of women after childbirth: a blessing in disguise." ''Exploring the Dirty Side of Women’s Health. London, New York'' (2007): 44-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many Christians commemorate [[Candlemas]], the feast of the purification of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Some continue to celebrate a [[Churching of Women]] ceremony, derived from the Jewish tradition but not necessarily implicating ritual impurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cressy|first1=David|title=Purification, Thanksgiving and the Churching of Women in Post-Reformation England|journal=Past and Present|date=1993|volume=141|issue=1|pages=106–146|doi=10.1093/past/141.1.106|jstor=651031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Natalie&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knödel |first1=Natalie|title=Reconsidering an Obsolete Rite: The Churching of Women and Feminist Liturgical Theology|journal=Feminist Theology|date= 1997 |volume=5|issue=14|pages=106–125|doi=10.1177/096673509700001406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly explanation ==
There is no scholarly consensus for the Biblical law, including the difference between the birth of sons and daughters. [[Tikva Frymer-Kensky]] suggested that "like the person who touched death, the person who has experienced birth has been at the boundaries of life/non-life...."&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;401&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rationales include moments of crisis or danger, fear of demons, health, and a lack of wholeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society |author=Milgrom, Jacob |title=The rationale for biblical impurity |year=1993 |volume=22 |issue=1 |url=https://janes.scholasticahq.com/article/2391.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an attempt at a scientific explanation (re: toxicity of post-puerperal blood) at the duration of the impurity, with attention to related impurity practices in other cultures with differential treatment by newborn gender (e.g., Cich Indians and aboriginal groups in Egypt and Central Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |author=Macht, David I. |title=A scientific appreciation of Leviticus 12: 1-5 |year=1933 |pages=253–260 |jstor=3259207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hinduism and Sikhism ==

'''Sūtak''' are [[Hindu]] rules of [[Ritual purification|impurity]] to be followed after the birth of a child (vṛddhi sūtak).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.douban.com/group/topic/2081128/&lt;/ref&gt; Sūtak involves the practice of keeping socially isolated from relatives and community by abstention of mealtaking with family, engaging in customary religious activities, and leaving the home.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/sutak&lt;/ref&gt;

A mother must practice sūtak for 10 to 30 days, depending upon her caste, while the father may become purified immediately after the birth of his child by [[ritual purification]] (ritualistic bathing).&lt;ref&gt;Textbook of the 'University of Spirituality', Volume 61, ''Death and Post-Death Rites'', by Parātpar Guru (Dr) Athavale and H.H. (Mrs.) Anjali http://sanatanshop.com/shop/en/booklets/383-death-and-post-death-rites.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhism does not believe in sūtak, there are many references in Gurbani against this practice and refer to purity in regards to higher living, not just washing the body or refraining from eating with others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Sutak&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{Flag|Caribbean Community}}&amp;nbsp;– CARICOM Chairman [[Denzil L. Douglas]] said Gaddafi's death "marks the end of a painful and tumultuous chapter for the people of Libya who have endured a protracted conflict in that country over the past eight months". He called for the NTC, NATO, and the UN Security Council to oversee the establishment of a lasting peace and a democratic civil state. Douglas also expressed concern over "the widespread reports of violations of human rights against former members of the Libyan government and minority groups, including migrants from Sub-Saharan countries" on behalf of CARICOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2011/pres387_11.jsp|agency=Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat|title=`LAY DOWN ARMS IN PEACE’ – CARICOM CHAIRMAN URGES PEOPLE OF LIBYA|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106214205/http://caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2011/pres387_11.jsp|archivedate=6 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Flag|European Union}}&amp;nbsp;– [[President of the European Council]] [[Herman Van Rompuy]] said, "The death of Gaddafi marks the end of an era of despotism. That Gaddafi died in a raid in Sirte means an end also to the repression from which the Libyan people have suffered for too long."&lt;ref name="aj-reaction" /&gt;

==== NATO ====
The top officer of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Admiral [[James G. Stavridis]], [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]], announced that he will recommend that the alliance's Libya air campaign be brought to an end.&lt;ref name=Stavridis&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-20123633/nato-commander-to-recommend-libya-mission-end/ NATO commander to recommend Libya mission end]" (21 October 2011). Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials have said the alliance would likely continue its air patrols over Libya for several more days and then be gradually phased out.&lt;ref name=Stavridis/&gt;

NATO Secretary-General [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] said in a statement that "NATO and our partners have successfully implemented the historic mandate of the United Nations to protect the people of Libya. We will terminate our mission in co-ordination with the United Nations and the National Transitional Council. With the reported fall of Bani Walid and Sirte, that moment has now moved much closer." The [[North Atlantic Council]], the governing body of NATO, will meet on 21 October to officially terminate the seven-month campaign.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;David S. Cloud." [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/10/libya-nato-airstrikes.html NATO commander expected to recommend ending Libya airstrikes]" (20 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO defense ministers, meeting in [[Brussels]] earlier in October, decided not to halt air operations. However, following Gaddafi's death and the NTC's taking of Sirt, the last city under Gaddafi's control, NATO is likely to officially end the campaign. And the [[Intergovernmental organization|inter-governmental military alliance]] is now expected to bring the campaign to an end. While only suspending airstrikes and beginning a monitoring period was considered, a NATO officer speaking to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on condition of anonymity stated that the sentiment within NATO is to end the campaign entirely, including the enforcement of the [[no-fly zone]] and the [[arms embargo]] enforced by naval ships.&lt;ref name=Stavridis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cloud/&gt;

The death of Gaddafi and end of the campaign was viewed as a "rare clear-cut victory" for NATO after long operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Piracy in Somalia|anti-piracy patrols off Somalia]]. According to Michael Clarke, director of the London-based [[Royal United Services Institute]] [[think tank]], "NATO can say unambiguously this was a military and political success. That's why today is a good day for NATO, and NATO has not had many good days in the last several years."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/end-of-libyan-aerial-campaign-is-rare-victory-for-embattled-nato/2011/10/20/gIQADFQM1L_story.html End of Libyan aerial campaign is rare victory for embattled NATO]" (20 October 2011).

==== United Nations ====
[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] stated that "This day marks a historic transition for Libya. In the coming days, we will witness scenes of celebration as well as grief for those who lost so much. Now is the time for all Libyans to come together. Libyans can only realise the promise of the future for national unity and reconciliation. Combatants on all sides must lay down their arms in peace. This is the time for healing and rebuilding, for generosity of spirit, not for revenge."&lt;ref name="aj-reaction" /&gt;

Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a briefing: "As you are aware, there are at least two cell-phone videos, one showing him alive and one showing him dead. Taken together, these videos are very disturbing. We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11520&amp;LangID=E Briefing note on Libya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christof Heyns]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, called for an international investigation into Gaddafi's death, stating that his killing may have been a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN calls for probe into Gaddafi's death|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111021235116164421.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
*[[Amnesty International]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[London]]-based [[human rights]] group immediately called for "a full, independent and impartial inquiry" into Gaddafi's death and said other former regime members and fighters should be treated "humanely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-20123505/amnesty-inquiry-needed-into-qaddafis-death/|agency=CBS News|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|title=Amnesty: Inquiry needed into Qaddafi's death}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[File:Hrw logo.svg|20px]] [[Human Rights Watch]]&amp;nbsp;– The group reviewed documentary materials of Gaddafi's capture and corpse and concluded that he and others "might have been executed after being detained". The organisation called for an investigation, with official [[Sarah Leah Whitson]] saying, "Finding out how they died matters."&lt;ref name="harding"/&gt;

== Regional ramifications ==

In its immediate aftermath, the killing of Gaddafi was thought to have significant implications in North Africa and the Middle East, as a critical part of the "[[Arab Spring]]". Pundits speculated that the death would intensify protesting in [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name="Daily Beast Next"/&gt; and French officials stated that because of this they were "watching the Algerian situation".&lt;ref name="Daily Beast Next"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/20/qaddafi-s-death-send-clear-message-to-middle-east-dictators-run-will-algiers-be-next.html "Which Middle East Dictator Is Going Down Next?"] World News – ''The Daily Beast -'' 20 October 2011 – 20 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Anthony Sullivan''' (August 13, 1940 &amp;ndash; disappeared March 6, 1975) was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and guitarist who released two albums before he disappeared without a trace in [[New Mexico]].

==Life==
Sullivan grew up in the [[Linda Vista, San Diego|Linda Vista]] area of [[San Diego, California]], where his [[Irish-American]] parents had moved from [[Nebraska]] to work in the defense industry. A tall man, he was a [[high school]] [[quarterback]].   According to self-written [[liner notes]] on his first [[LP record|LP]], he "grew up in a government housing project with a bunch of other Okies and Arkies," and decided to play music after listening to local [[blues]] groups.  He married, and played guitar in a local rock band, the Survivors, with his sister-in-law Kathie Doran.  He and a friend bought a bar near to their college, but it lost money, and in 1968 he moved with his wife Barbara and young son to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=winfree&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/underappreciatedrockartists/home/uara-articles/jim-sullivan  Martin Winfree, "Jim Sullivan", ''Underappreciated Rock Artists'', October 2011]. Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=waxi&gt;[http://waxidermy.com/jim-sullivan-ufo/  "Jim Sullivan: U.F.O.", ''Waxidermy.com'', January 27, 2006]. Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

While his wife worked at [[Capitol Records]], Sullivan wrote songs and performed in increasingly prestigious clubs in the Los Angeles area.  In particular, he became established at the Raft club in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where he became friends with [[Hollywood]] figures including [[Lee Majors]], [[Lee Marvin]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].  He appeared as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in the movie ''[[Easy Rider]]'', and performed on the [[José Feliciano]] television show.  His friends contributed the funding that allowed him to record an album of his songs with leading Los Angeles [[session musician]]s, keyboard player [[Don Randi]], drummer [[Earl Palmer]], and [[double bass|bass]] player [[Jimmy Bond (musician)|Jimmy Bond]], who was also the record's [[arrangement|arranger]] and co-[[record producer|producer]].&lt;ref name=waxi/&gt;  After [[Nick Venet]] at Capitol turned down the opportunity to release the record, it was issued by Sullivan's friend Al Dobbs on a small [[record label]], Monnie, a label he set up for that purpose.  The album, ''U.F.O.'', was released in 1969, and featured Sullivan's songs in a style blending [[folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[country music|country]] that has been compared with [[Fred Neil]], [[Tim Hardin]], [[Gene Clark]] and [[Joe South]], with arrangements in the style of [[David Axelrod (musician)|David Axelrod]].&lt;ref name=winfree/&gt;&lt;ref name=ultimate&gt;[http://ultimateclassicrock.com/missing-ufo-singer-songwriter/  Frank Mastropolo, "Rock’s Unsolved UFO Mystery: The Night Jim Sullivan Vanished Into Thin Air", ''Ultimate Classic Rock'', July 2, 2014].

The album was remixed and reissued by Century City Records in 1970,&lt;ref name=ultimate/&gt; and the track "Rosey" was issued as a [[single (music)|single]], but they made little impact at the time.  Sullivan continued to perform in clubs.  In 1972, he recorded a second album, ''Jim Sullivan'', arranged by [[Jim Hughart]], produced by Lee Burch and released by [[Playboy Records]].  Again, however, the record was unsuccessful.  As Sullivan increasingly turned to [[alcohol]] and his marriage began to disintegrate, he decided in 1975 to travel to [[Nashville]], where Kathie Doran was working as a singer and songwriter, and try to find success there.&lt;ref name=winfree/&gt;&lt;ref name=aquarium/&gt;

Sullivan left Los Angeles on March 4, 1975, to drive to Nashville alone in his [[Volkswagen Beetle]].  The next day, after being cautioned by a [[highway patrol]] over his driving, he checked into the La Mesa Motel in [[Santa Rosa, New Mexico]].  Later reports suggest he did not sleep there, and left his key inside the room, but bought vodka at the town store.  He was seen the following day about {{convert|26|mi}} away, at a remote ranch owned by the Gennetti family.  His car was later found abandoned at the ranch, and he was reportedly last seen walking away from it.  The car contained Sullivan's money, papers, guitar, clothes, and a box of his unsold records.&lt;ref name=aquarium&gt;[http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2010/11/10/the-strange-tale-of-jim-sullivans-u-f-o/  "The Strange Tale of Jim Sullivan’s U.F.O.", ''AquariumDrunkard'', November 10, 2010]. Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusicufo&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/ufo-mw0002053150  James Allen, Review of ''U.F.O.'', ''Allmusic.com]. Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He was never seen again, and reports have variously attributed his disappearance to being murdered, becoming disoriented and lost, or, particularly in the light of the title of his first album, [[alien abduction]].  Search parties failed to find any trace of him.  A decomposed body resembling Sullivan was later found in a remote area several miles away, but was determined not to be his.&lt;ref name=aquarium/&gt;

==Legacy==
Sullivan's records, especially ''U.F.O.'', developed a [[cult following]] in later years, partly because of their rarity and obscurity.  In 2010, Matt Sullivan (no relation), the founder of [[Light in the Attic Records]], decided to reissue ''U.F.O.'', and made serious attempts to uncover the mystery of Sullivan's disappearance, interviewing many of those who knew him and those involved in his recordings, but revealing little new information.&lt;ref name=aquarium/&gt;  The album was issued on [[CD]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=winfree/&gt;

'''John Arnold''', widely known as '''John Arnold of Monmouthshire''' ({{circa|1635}}–1702), was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Protestant]] politician and [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]. He was one of the most prominent people in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] in the late 17th century. A stark anti-[[Papist]], he was a notable figure during the [[Popish plot]] and the suppression of Catholicism in the country. Arnold represented the constituencies around [[Monmouth]] (known as the [[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth Boroughs]]) and [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in the 1680s and 1690s. His strong anti-Papist beliefs and insurgences against [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]]s made him an unpopular and controversial figure amongst his peers and in his native Monmouthshire. Amongst his associates were [[Titus Oates]] and [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]].

==Earlier life==
[[File:Llanvihangel Court from the north-east - geograph.org.uk - 1054441.jpg|thumb|right|[[Llanvihangel Court]], seat of John Arnold of Monmouthshire]]
Arnold was born in [[Southwark]], around 1635, the first son of [[Nicholas Arnold (MP for Monmouthshire)|Nicholas Arnold]] of [[Llanvihangel Crucorney]] and the maternal grandson of Sir Edward Moore of [[Drogheda]], [[County Louth]]. The Arnold family had their seat in [[Llanthony Priory]] by the end of the 16th century but had to lease it to the Hoptons owing to financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="Henning"&gt;{{cite web|author=Henning, B. D.|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/arnold-john-1635-1702|title=''The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1660–1690''|year=1983|publisher=Boydell and Brewer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Llanvihangel Court]] became the family seat and John succeeded his father in 1665. Educated in Southwark, he became Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1669.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewyaslacy.org.uk/doc.php?d=gc_lva_3001|title=A History of Llanvihangel Court and its Owners|publisher=Ewyaslacy.org.uk|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold was made a deputy lieutenant, captain of the county troops, and [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1677 by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester]]. However, Worcester formed a strong dislike for Arnold, and a lifelong feud began between them when Worcester had him "turned out of the commission of the peace for opposing his candidate at a by-election and generally 'affronting' him."&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt; Arnold, who was starting to exhibit signs of [[paranoia]], blamed [[Edward Colman]], secretary to the future King [[James II of England|James II]], and went up to London to challenge him to a [[duel]]. In fact Colman, who has been described as "the typical courtier and man about town", had no interest in events on the remote Welsh border, and it is most unlikely that he was to blame.

==Popish Plot period==
Arnold's popularity declined further in March 1678 when he raided the [[Cwm, Llanrothal|Cwm]] Jesuit college in [[Llanrothal]], Herefordshire with Border Protestants such as [[Herbert Croft (bishop)|Herbert Croft]] and [[Charles Price (Protestant)|Charles Price]] during the [[Popish plot]].&lt;ref name="Britain1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catholic Record Society (Great Britain)|title=Recusant history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24cjAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 March 2012|year=1982|publisher=Catholic Record Society|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=B8484418F58CEEB575C8523F5B6DEB58.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3337696|title=Anti-popery on the Welsh Marches in the Seventeenth Century|journal=The Historical Journal|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1 June 1980 |volume =23|issue= 02  |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold reportedly gave some of his harshest criticism to its steward, [[Henry Milbourne]], describing him as an  "undoubted Papist" who only "held lands worth £100 per annum in one county, but is made justice of the peace in four".&lt;ref name="UnderdownAmussen1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cylchgronaucymru.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1277425/llgc-id:1287682/llgc-id:1287752/getText|title=Wales and the Order of the Royal Oak|journal=National Library of Wales journal|volume=24|issue= 3 |date=Summer 1986|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced Milbourne in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] but with little success; several MPs believed Arnold's report was poorly constructed and some believed that the lord-lieutenant was a Catholic activist in south Wales.&lt;ref name="UnderdownAmussen1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underdown|first1=David|last2=Amussen|first2=Susan Dwyer|last3=Kishlansky|first3=Mark A.|title=Political Culture and Cultural Politics in Early Modern England: Essays presented to David Underdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWG7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=13 March 2012|year=1995|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|isbn=978-0-7190-4695-7|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 1678, Arnold also captured Father [[David Lewis (martyr)|David Lewis]], also known as Charles Baker, at [[St Michael's Church, Llantarnam|St Michael's Church]] in [[Llantarnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1108?docPos=3|contribution=David Lewis|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=online|accessdate=14 March 2012}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father Lewis spent the night "in an upper room under John Arnold's roof" at Llanvihangel Court.&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt; He was then taken to [[Monmouth Gaol]] and was executed on 27 August 1679 after a trial at [[Usk]]. He was a much loved figure locally and his execution caused widespread dismay.&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt;

In the winter of 1678–9, Arnold was restored to the bench at the request of Worcester's son, [[Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester|Lord Herbert]]. Arnold, Lord Herbert, [[William Morgan (of Machen and Tredegar)|William Morgan]], and the [[Bishop of Llandaff]], began hunting down Roman Catholics in Monmouthshire, with Arnold offering a personal bounty of £200 to anybody who would capture a Catholic priest and send them to him. Amongst those brought to him was  the Jesuit David Lewis, and the college of Jesuits at the Cwm was also attacked. In the second general election of 1679, Arnold stood for [[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] but lost to Lord Herbert and was admitted to the [[Green Ribbon Club]] in November of that year. The election result was overturned on petition in 1680, and Arnold was seated for Monmouth instead of Lord Herbert. He continued to fight the Catholics and complained in parliament about the iMonmouthshire justices failing to enforce the [[Penal Laws]].&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt; Arnold fell into disrepute with the Catholic Herberts of [[Coldbrook]] around this time.&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt; Arnold was also responsible for prosecuting and executing [[Philip Evans and John Lloyd|Philip Evans]] on the testimony of three witnesses he found.

Arnold was again at the centre of controversy in April 1680 when he was apparently victim of an attack by a Catholic, John Giles, who (Arnold alleged)  tried to stab him to death in [[Bell Yard]], off [[Fleet Street]], London, avenging the execution of the priests in Monmouthshire. Although Giles was found guilty and fined £500, some believed that Herbert of Coldbrook was the culprit and many believed (as do most  historians) that Arnold invented the affair as an attempt to revive the Popish plot, and make himself a popular hero.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt; He became known to his enemies thereafter as "cut-throat Arnold". Later than year, in October 1680, Arnold gave evidence in the House of Lords against the former Portuguese Jewish ambassador to London, [[Francesco de Feria]], who was alleged to have been involved in a plot to kill the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[Titus Oates]], [[William Bedloe]] and Arnold. In November, Arnold and [[John Dutton Colt]] were described by [[Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury|Thomas Bruce]] as "the most noisy, impudent and ignorant" Members of the Parliament.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;

In January 1681, Arnold supported the case for removing the [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]] and [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Laurence Hyde]] from the King's counsels. At this time he was given a large armed guard to protect him during his travels to [[Oxford]] against Papist attacks. In September 1681, Feria claimed that Arnold had offered him £300 to testify that he had seen the Marquess of Worcester at mass at the Portuguese Embassy and alleged that Arnold had called the king a Papist.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt; His sanity was increasingly questioned, and it was said he would attack complete strangers in the street, accusing them of being Papists. He was infuriated by the decision to create his arch-enemy Worcester Duke of Beaufort, which he took as a personal insult.

==Court case and fall==
In 1682, he reportedly said "the Marquess of Worcester is a Papist and as deeply concerned in the Popish Plot and as guilty of endeavouring to introduce Popery and the subversion of the Protestant religion as any of the Jesuits that justly suffered for it, and I doubt not but to make the said Marquess and his crooked-back son to suffer for it in time." For this, he was brought to trial in the [[Court of King's Bench|King's Bench]], along with [[Sir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet|Sir Trevor Williams]], for [[Scandalum Magnatum]] by the Marquess of Worcester, newly created Duke of Beaufort, whom he had also accused of harbouring Papists in [[Chepstow]].&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt; He was fined £10,000, an exorbitant figure at that time.&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt; Unable to pay, Arnold was imprisoned until 1686.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt;

==Later life==
In the general election of 1689, Arnold stood for Southwark and formed an electoral alliance with the Tory, [[Peter Rich|Sir Peter Rich]].&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt; From 1695–98 he was again MP for Monmouth but he continued to be very unpopular due to his extreme views.&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt; Under [[William III of England|William III]], Arnold remained a court Whig and was replaced by his son after his death in 1702 during the Monmouthshire taxation commission. Arnold's estates were sold in 1726.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;

==Family==
He married Margaret, the daughter of William Cooke of Highnam, Gloucestershire and had 3 sons and 2 daughters. They lived at [[Llanvihangel Court]], which was sold by his successor in 1726.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/arnold-john-1635-1702| title= ARNOLD, John (c.1635–1702), of Llanvihangel Crucorney, Mon.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate = 3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lake monster''' is a lake-dwelling entity of mythic origin.  A well-known example is the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Lake monsters' depictions are often similar to [[sea monster]]s.

According to the Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjögren (1980), the present-day lake monsters are variations of older legends of [[kelpie|water kelpies]].{{R|"Sjögren"}} Sjögren claims that the accounts of lake-monsters have changed during history, as do others.{{R|"hill"}} Older reports often talk about horse-like appearances, but more modern reports often have more reptile and dinosaur-like appearances, he concludes that the legendary kelpies evolved into the present day [[saurian]] lake-monsters since the discovery of [[dinosaur]]s and giant aquatic reptiles and the popularization of them in both scientific and fictional writings and art.{{R|"Sjögren"}}{{R|"dinsdale"}}

The stories cut across cultures, existing in some variation in many countries.{{R|"Baraniuk"}}{{R|"meurger"}}{{R|"sharpe"}} They've undergone what Michel Meurger calls concretizing (The process of turning items, drawings, general beliefs and stories into a plausible whole) and naturalization over time as humanity's view of the world has changed.{{R|"hill"}}

In many of these areas, especially around [[Loch Ness]], [[Lake Champlain]] and the [[Okanagan Valley]], these lake monsters have become important tourist draws.

== Alternative explanations ==

In [[Ben Radford]] and [[Joe Nickell]]'s book ''Lake Monster Mysteries'',{{R|"RadfordNickell"}} the authors attribute a vast number of sightings to [[otter]] misidentifications. Ed Grabianowski plotted the distribution of North American lake monster sightings. Then he overlaid the distribution of the common otter and found a near perfect match. It turns out that three or four otters swimming in a line look remarkably like a serpentine, humped creature undulating through the water. It is very easy to mistake for a single creature if you see them from a distance. "This isn't speculation. I'm not making this up," Nickell said. "I've spoken to people who saw what they thought was a lake monster, got closer and discovered it was actually a line of otters. That really happens."{{R|"nickell2007"}} Clearly, not every lake monster sighting can be accounted for with otters, but it's an excellent example of how our perceptions can be fooled.{{R|"Grabianowski"}}

Paul Barrett and [[Darren Naish]] note that the existence of any large animals in isolation (i.e., in a situation where no breeding population exists) is highly unlikely. Naish also observes that the stories are likely remnants of tales meant to keep children safely away from the water.{{R|"Baraniuk"}}{{R|"sharpe"}}

There have been many purported sightings of lake monsters, and even some photographs, but each time these have either been shown to be deliberate deceptions, such as the Lake George Monster Hoax,{{R|"nickell2004"}} or serious doubts about the veracity and verifiability have arisen, as with the famous Mansi photograph of [[Champ (folklore)|Champ]].{{R|"bartholomew"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">A '''Melfan''' ([[Sector General#Sector General's physiological classification system|physiological classification]] '''ELNT''') is one of about seventy known intelligent species in the fictional [[Sector General]] universe, and one of the most common species in Sector 12 General Hospital itself.  Overall, a Melfan resembles a 6-foot-long crab.  Compared with most other races, they are very emotional and passionate people.&lt;ref name="melfan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvwood.org/Gurps/SectorGeneral/Melfans.html|title=GURPS Sector General races|date=2002|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, like the majority of races in the Sector General universe, wear no clothing or body ornaments.

==Physical Summary==

===Requirements===
Melfans are amphibious, being comfortable in water or on land.  They eat every ten hours, and sleep for four hours in between. Their favourite dishes include swamp nuts and live crottled greeps, although at Sector General they have to make do with moving electrically charged substitutes.&lt;ref name="melfan"/&gt;

===Physiology===
The Melfan head has large, vertically lidded eyes, enormous mandibles, and pincers projecting forward from the place where ears would otherwise be. There are also two long, thin, fragile, flexible feelers growing from the sides of the mouth, which feel like soft, furry feathers to the touch. When angry they click their pincers together rapidly; a slow clicking indicates a desire for attention. Projecting from slits where the bony carapace and underside join are six thin, bony, tubular, multijointed limbs, all of which are capable of manipulation but lack a sense of touch.&lt;ref name="melfan"/&gt;  They are immobilised if they get turned onto their backs.

'''Mike Breen''' (born 13 June 1958) is an English church leader, [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[author]] and [[entrepreneur]]. Breen has been an innovator in leading [[missional church]]es throughout Europe and the United States.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Breen recalls never having read a book at age 16, due to [[dyslexia]]. To enable him to partake in classroom discussions, his school teacher and returned missionary, Mrs. Dearmest, handed him a ''[[Living Bible]]'' to read. He read it all and his life changed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Breen2010a|Breen, Mike (2010) p. xiii]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and ministry===
Breen holds a degree from [[Cranmer Hall, Durham]], a [[Church of England]] [[theological college]] and is an ordained minister in the Church of England. He started out as a [[Curate#Anglican Communion|curate]] in [[Cambridge]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Breen2010b|Breen (2010b) p. 16]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1987, he served as parish priest in [[Brixton]] in the inner city of [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#BreenKallestad2005b|Breen &amp; Kallestad (2005b) p. 212]]&lt;/ref&gt; — a "tough parish in the east end of London. Brixton is like south-central Los-Angeles in many ways".&lt;ref&gt;[[#GibbsBolger2005|Mal Calladine in Gibbs &amp; Bolger (2005) p. 251]]&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Brixton, Breen pioneered [[missional community|missional communities]] as a ministry model.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HopkinsBreen2007|Hopkins &amp; Breen (2007) p. 14]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Breen family lived in [[Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]] from 1991 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HopkinsBreen2007|Hopkins &amp; Breen (2007) p. 10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Breen moved to [[Sheffield]], following [[Robert Warren (minister)|Robert Warren]] as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|senior rector]] of [[St. Thomas' Church, Crookes]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#HopkinsBreen2007|Hopkins &amp; Breen (2007) p. 15]]&lt;/ref&gt; an Anglican-Baptist local ecumenical partnership. As team leader, Breen led St Thomas' to become England's largest church by attendance by the turn of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brierley2000|Brierley (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While at St Thomas', Breen begun The Order of Mission, a Protestant, Charismatic and Evangelical monastic order. As vicar, Breen became the order's "Senior Guardian of ''The Order of Mission''" (TOM).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Percy2005|Percy (2005) p. 6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Breen moved to [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Arizona]], to serve as a pastor of the Community Church of Joy and taught at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#BreenKallestad2005a|Breen &amp; Kallestad (2005a) cover inside back flap]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Leadership Network]] approached Breen to lead an initiative into church planting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Breen2010a|Breen (2010), cover inside back flap]]&lt;/ref&gt; The European Church Planting Network was established in 2007 with Breen as a senior leader. The ECPN Leadership Community gathered church leaders from all over Europe, with a stated goal of seeing 500 new churches planted across Eastern and Western Europe by the end of 2011. The result of 1,137 significantly exceeded this goal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leadnet|http://leadnet.org/page/ecpn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008 to 2014, Breen lived at [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina]], where he serves as the leader for 3D Movements, an "organic movement of biblical discipleship and missional church"&lt;ref&gt;[[#BreenBlog|http://mikebreen.wordpress.com/]]&lt;/ref&gt; helping established churches and church planters move into a discipling and missional way of being church.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Breen2010|Breen (2010) cover inside back flap]]&lt;/ref&gt; 3DM decentralized in 2014, with Jo Saxton eventually becoming Chair of the Board as of June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.josaxton.com/about-me/|title=About Me – Jo Saxton|website=www.josaxton.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breen moved to Greenville, South Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.3dmpublishing.com/our-story|title=Our Story|website=3DM Publishing|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began working on his Ph.D. at Trinity Seminary. Breen continued writing for 3DM Publishing, releasing updated editions of ''Building a Discipling Culture'' and ''Family on Mission'' (with his wife Sally), among others.

In January 2014 Breen spoke in a leadership event to the multi-thousand member North Heights Lutheran Church, which sparked concerns leading to the April, 2014 decision of the elder board to remove 3DM completely from the church, and publishing at length the reasons for their decision. Among those reasons attributed to 3DM were that, "worship attendance has dropped off dramatically," and a corresponding drop in giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlc.org/about/what-we-believe/3dm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816152311/http://www.nhlc.org/about/what-we-believe/3dm |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other churches experienced success through 3DM partnerships, for example Billabong Uniting Church in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journeyonline.com.au/queensland-synod-news/discipleship-moves-third-dimension/|title=Discipleship moves in to the third dimension - JourneyOnline|website=journeyonline.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
Breen is married to Sally Breen. The couple have three children, Beccy, Libby and Sam.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BreenBlog|http://mikebreen.wordpress.com/about/]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monroe Salisbury''' (May 8, 1876 &amp;ndash; August 7, 1935) was an American actor. He appeared on the [[theatre|stage]] for several years and then became an early film star.

Salisbury was a [[matinee idol]]. He began his [[acting]] career on the stage in 1898, appearing in numerous romantic leads. He also appeared in five [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. He was in 42 [[silent film|silent movies]] between 1914 and 1922, working frequently with director [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. Salisbury, who appeared in several [[western (genre)|western]] films, also appeared in two [[sound film|talkies]], in 1929 and 1930.

After his career was at an end, Salisbury died at a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] from a fractured skull sustained during a fall.

==Early life==
He was born '''Orange Salisbury Cash''' in [[Angola, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;1880 Erie Co., NY, U.S. Federal Census, Evans, July 14, Enumeration Dist. 91, Sheet 18, Page 347 B, Line 33, David Cash; Line 34, Ellen Cash; Line 37, Orange Cash, White, Male, 4, Son, Single, '''NY''', NY, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of David Cash (c. 1840–?) and Ellen Louise Salisbury (1842–1929). Orr's two elder sisters were Adelaide Mary Cash (1864–1956), who married John Casper Bosche (1861–1929), and Anna Louise Cash (1868–1951), who married Edward Clarke.

His mother had a younger brother named Orange James Salisbury (1844–1907). She also had an elder brother named Monroe Salisbury (1835–1905), a government contractor and well-known [[horse racing|turfman]] who bred racehorses.

==Stage career==
Orr took the name Monroe Salisbury as his stage name. He appeared behind the footlights with such notables as [[Richard Mansfield]], [[Eleonora Duse]], [[John Drew, Jr.|John Drew]], [[Nance O'Neil]], [[Mrs. Fiske|Minnie Maddern Fiske]], and [[Kathryn Kidder]].

While he was performing in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], in June 1900, Salisbury and his mother were staying in a hotel on Weybosset Street when the [[United States Census|U.S. Federal Census]] was taken.&lt;ref&gt;1900 Providence Co., RI, U.S. Federal Census, Providence, Ward 4, 205 Weybosset St., June 5, Enumeration Dist. 37, Sheet 2 A, Page 297 A, Line 22, O.S.

Cash.&lt;/ref&gt; His debut on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] was in the play ''Marta of the Lowlands'' (1903).

==Film career==
[[File:Hungry Eyes 1918.jpg|thumb|''Hungry Eyes'' (1918)]]
Salisbury's film debut was in the uncredited role as Sir Henry, Earl of Kerhill, in [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). He also worked for DeMille in such movies as ''[[Brewster's Millions (1914 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'', ''[[The Master Mind]]'', ''[[The Virginian (1914 film)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Rose of the Rancho]]'', which were all released in 1914. He also appeared alongside [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in ''[[The Lamb (1915 film)|The Lamb]]'' and ''[[Double Trouble (1915 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (both [1915).

Salisbury scored his greatest success when he starred as Alessandro in ''[[Ramona (1916 film)|Ramona]]'' (1916) opposite [[Adda Gleason]] in the title role. He then signed with [[Universal Studios]], where he was among the top movie stars for several years.

When he registered for the draft of [[World War I]], in late 1918, Salisbury and his mother were living in the Mountain View Inn at 5956 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;World War I Draft Registration Card, Serial No. 2410, Order No. 901, Name: Orange Salisbury Cash, Address: 5956 Hollywood Bl., Hwd., Los Angeles Co., Age in Years: 42, Date of Birth: May 8, 1876, Race: White, Citizenship: Native Born, Present Occupation: Actor, Employer's Name: Universal Film Co., Employer Location: Universal City, Los Angeles Co., Cal., Nearest Relative: Mrs. Ellen Louise Cash 5956 Hollywood Bl., Hwd., Los Angeles Co., Signed: Orange Salisbury Cash (signature below: Monroe Salisbury), Registrar's Report: Description of Registrant: Height: Tall, Build: Medium, Color of Eyes: Hazel, Color of Hair: Dark Brown, Any physical problems: No, Registrar Note: "Professionally known only as "Monroe Salisbury."

In the late 1910s he bought a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} citrus ranch near [[Hemet, California|Hemet]], and, between pictures, it was his habit to drive out and drop in unexpectedly on the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] overseer and his family who lived on the place and worked in the groves.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', October 24, 1919, "Droll Stories --- No Proof There," p. II 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 Salisbury and his mother were still living at the Mountain View Inn on Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;1920 Los Angeles Co., CA, U.S. Federal Census, Los Angeles, Precinct 403, Mountain View Inn, 5956 Hollywood Blvd., January 9, Enumeration Dist. 169, Sheet 6 B, Page 215 B, Line 57, Monroe Salisbury, Boarder, Male, White, 42, Single, Y, Y, '''NY''', NY, NY, Y, Actor, Motion Pictures; Line 58, Ellen Louise Cash.&lt;/ref&gt; He formed his own [[production company]], that same year, and [[filmmaking|produced]] and starred in ''[[The Barbarian (1920 film)|The Barbarian]]'' (1920). His final starring role was in the [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Great Alone]]'' (1922), in which he played a half-Native American college student and football player, a character presumably half his age. He then retired from the screen.

In June 1928, he returned to the U.S. at the Port of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], from [[Kobe|Kobe, Japan]], aboard the S.S. Taiyo Maru, and gave his U.S. address as Hemet, California.&lt;ref&gt;California Passenger and Crew Lists, List of United States Citizens (For the Immigration Authorities), No. 108, S.S.

==Comeback==
With the advent of sound in the late 1920s, Salisbury returned to the screen in two talkies. He appeared in a [[Christie Film Company|Christie]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[short subject|short]], ''[[Her Husband's Woman]]'' (1929). He then played John Lamar in Universal's 10 chapter [[serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Jade Box]]'' (1930).

''The Jade Box'' serial was Salisbury's final movie appearances. In 1930, he was living at the Warner Kelton Hotel at 6326 Lexington Avenue, just west of Vine Street, in Hollywood,&lt;ref&gt;1930 Los Angeles Co., CA, U.S. Federal Census, Los Angeles, Assembly Dist. 55, Warner Kelton Hotel, 6326 Lexington Ave., April 14, Enumeration Dist. 47, Sheet 23 B, Page 157 B, Line 84, Monroe Salisbury, Head, Rented, $60, Male, White, 49 [sic], Single, N, Y, '''NY''', NY, NY, Y, Actor, Theatrical, Wages, Y, (Vet.?)

In February 1932, he returned to [[Southern California]], at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]], from [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada, Mexico]], aboard the S.S. Ruth Alexander, and gave his U.S. address as 6326 Lexington Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;California Passenger and Crew Lists, List of United States Citizens (For the Immigration Authorities), No. 1562, S.S.

May 8, 1877 [sic], Address in U.S.: 6326 Lexington Hollywood.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
On July 2, 1935, Salisbury entered [[Patton State Hospital]], a [[psychiatric hospital|mental facility]] near [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], as a patient. He may have been admitted under his real name, Orr Cash. His occupation was given as hotel clerk. A month later, he suffered a bad fall at the institution and was fatally injured.

Monroe Salisbury died at age 59 from a fractured skull sustained in his fall at the institution.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', August 9, 1935, "End Tragic --- Ex-Film Idol Dies In Fall --- Body of Monroe Salisbury, Long Unidentified, Held in San Bernardino," p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 9, 1935, from San Bernardino, Calif., Aug 8, "Monroe Salisbury --- Former Star of Films, 59, Was Injured Fatally in Fall," p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He was at a local mortuary for a day before his true identity was discovered.

==Criminal proceedings==
Palmer's foster father, Rick Thorburn, was a person of interest to police from the earliest days of the investigation. The Thorburns fostered no more children after Palmer's disappearance, but continued to run a daycare service from their home until April 2016 when the state's education and child safety departments were advised by police that Rick Thorburn was facing nine serious charges unrelated to Palmer, and the family's daycare approval was revoked and their foster care approval was suspended.&lt;ref name=Oz&gt;{{cite web|work=The Weekend Australian|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=16 April 2017|author=Geoff Chambers|title=Rick Thorburn kept foster care licence|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/rick-thorburn-kept-foster-care-licence/news-story/b2b6260d8d2c0dc319cdc665450e0bc1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 a car formerly owned by Rick Thorburn was seized by police for forensic examination and, on 20&amp;nbsp;September 2016, Palmer's foster parents and their two sons were taken into police custody for questioning. Rick Thorburn was charged with Palmer's murder and with interfering with a corpse. He collapsed shortly after his arrest and was subsequently placed in an induced coma for several days, missing a scheduled court appearance the next day. Police are looking into whether he took pills just before or after his arrest, in a suicide attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-22/tiahleigh-palmer-foster-father-coma-pills-ethical-standards/7867046|title=Ethical standards investigate collapse of Tia's accused killer|date=21 September 2016|work=abc.net.au|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer's 19-year-old foster brother, Trent, was charged with two counts of perjury and one count each of attempting to pervert the course of justice and incest, and was denied bail.&lt;ref name="ABC200916"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiahleigh Palmer death: Foster father Rick Thorburn charged with murder|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-20/tiahleigh-palmer-foster-father-charged-with-murder/7860530|website=ABC News|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branco|first1=Jorge|title=Tiahleigh Palmer murder investigation: Foster father charged with murder|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/tiahleigh-palmer-murder-investigation-foster-father-to-be-charged-with-murder-20160920-grk4zc.html|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=Brisbane Times|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her foster mother, Julene, and older foster brother, Joshua, were both charged with perjury and attempting to pervert the course of justice and released on bail.

Palmer's grandmother has told reporters that, months before she died, Palmer had declined an option to move in with her mother because she had a crush on Trent, and because she loved the horses on the Thorburn property. In a court hearing on 21 September 2016 prosecutors said that, two days before her death, Trent confessed to a cousin that he had had sex with Palmer on the previous Monday, and that she had told his mother about it.&lt;ref name="BT210916"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branco|first1=Jorge|title=Tiahleigh Palmer's foster brother 'told cousin he had sex with her', court hears|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/tiahleigh-palmers-foster-father-in-coma-wont-appear-in-court-20160921-grkwvf.html|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=Brisbane times|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="News220916"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Liz|title=Toxic relationship between murdered Tiahleigh Palmer and brother revealed|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/crime/toxic-relationship-between-murdered-tiahleigh-palmer-and-brother-revealed/news-story/d6275a57ca4d7149cdb3fdd566375147|website=News.com.au|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also heard that, shortly before her death, Palmer had told a friend that Trent would have sex with her when Mrs Thorburn went out, and she had told her foster mother about the abuse.

'''Pachomius I''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Παχώμιος Α΄}}}}), (? – 1513) was [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 1503 to 1513, except for a short period in 1504.{{r|Kiminas}}

==Life==
Before his election as Patriarch of Constantinople, Pachomius was Metropolitan of [[Nea Zichni|Zichna]]. When Patriarch [[Patriarch Joachim I of Constantinople|Joachim I]] was deposed in 1502, the [[Ruler of Wallachia|rulers of Wallachia]], quite influential on the affairs of the [[Church of Constantinople]], sponsored the election of the old [[Patriarch Nephon II of Constantinople|Nephon II]], who refused. Thus they transferred their support to Pachomius, who was elected in early 1503.{{r|Runciman|page1=198}} His first reign lasted only about one year, because in early 1504 Joachim I returned to the throne after a payment of 3500 gold pieces to the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]].{{r|Janin}}

Joachim died shortly later during a travel in [[Wallachia]] and so in autumn 1504 Pachomius, always supported by the rulers of Wallachia, returned to the throne.{{r|Runciman}} The second reign of Pachomius lasted about nine years, a long period in comparison with the reigns of the patriarchs in the 15th century.

The main issue during Pachomius' patriarchate was the case of the [[Cretan]] scholar [[Arsenius Apostolius]]. In 1506{{r|Bietenholz}} the [[Roman Curia]] appointed Arsenius as [[Byzantine Rite|Eastern Rite]] bishop of [[Monemvasia]], at that time part of the [[stato da Mar|overseas domains]] of the [[Venetian Republic]]. Arsenius declared himself in [[full communion|communion]] both with the Patriarch of Constantinople and with the [[Catholic Church]].{{r|Janin}}  This position was untenable for the Church of Constantinople and Pachomius invited Arsenius to abdicate. The issue went on for more than two years until June 1509 when Pachomius [[excommunicate]]d Arsenius, who retired to Venice.{{r|Fedalto2}}

During the last year of his patriarchate, Pachomius visited [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. On the way back, already in [[Silivri|Selymbria]], Pachomius was poisoned{{r|EP}} by Theodolus, a monk at his service.{{r|HC}} Pachomius died immediately, in early 1513.{{r|Kiminas}}

'''''Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void''''' is a non-fiction work by science author [[Mary Roach]].

Published in August 2010, ''Packing for Mars'' was recognized in "Amazon's Best Books" of that month, it quickly became a #6 ''New York Times'' bestseller,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction | work = | publisher = The New York Times | date = 22 August 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-22/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html | accessdate = 16 March 2011 | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was chosen as the book of the year for the 7th annual [[One City One Book]]: San Francisco Reads literary event program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One City One Book 2011|url=http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000255701|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=San Francisco Public Library|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Packing for Mars'', Mary [[Mary Roach|Roach]] searches for answers to questions about the gross, the bizarre, and the uncomfortable aspects of space travel. The book's 16 chapters cover the entire comedic spectrum of all things space-related, and also include some study of the scientific side of space travel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/mary-roach/packing-for-mars/&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters discussing the various bodily functions of astronauts in space (going to the bathroom, having sex, vomiting&lt;ref name=MaryRoachUSAToday&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2010-08-17-roachrev17_ST_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Craig | last=Wilson | title=Packing for Mars'?

Mary Roach, the author of ''Packing for Mars'', was raised in Etna, New Hampshire and spent several years working as a freelance copy editor and investigating unpopular topics.&lt;ref name=MaryRoachSite&gt;{{cite web|last=Roach|first=Mary|title=Mary Roach|url=http://www.maryroach.net/maryroach.html|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roach explores lots of questions such as what happens after we die, what sex is all about, and what secrets human cadavers hold. However, in ''Packing for Mars'', she turns her mind toward space and examines the logistics of space travel.&lt;ref name=MaryRoachUSAToday /&gt; In an interview, she describes her book to be about all the surreal physical and physiological challenges of living in space as a human being. Roach explains that in addition to these problems, human beings are not in the slightest equipped or prepared to confront these challenges. Although most of her other books have one-word titles, Mary Roach claims that it was especially difficult to come up with a one-word title for this specific book.&lt;ref name=RoachInterview&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams, Kirtley|first=John, David|title=Interview: Mary Roach|url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/feature-interview-mary-roach/|publisher=Light Speed Magazine|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics covered==
The book covers 12 topics:

* The psychological specifications for being considered for a space mission
* The psychological effects of being in space
* Initial precautions of going to space
* Testing procedures
* Cadavers used for anatomically precise testing
* Animal testing
* Simulation procedures
* Space hygiene

Ischemic placental disease leads to the attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall to become under-perfused, causing uteroplacental ischemia. Where the term overarches the pathology associated with preeclampsia, placental abruptions and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).&lt;ref name="pmid 24836824"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Parker S, Werler M |year=2014 |title= Epidemiology of ischemic placental disease: A focus on preterm gestations. |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=133–138 |pmid=24836824 |pmc=4824536 |doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2014.03.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are known to be the primary pathophysiology cause placental disease. Which is considered to be associated with more than half of premature births.&lt;ref name="pmid18280875 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ananth C, Vintzileos A |year=2008 |title=Medically Indicated Preterm Birth: Recognizing the Importance of the Problem |journal=Clin Perinatol |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=53–67 |pmid=18280875 |doi=10.1016/j.clp.2007.11.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities present within the spiral arteries lead to higher velocities in blood, in turn causes the maternal villi to shred.&lt;ref name="pmid24836825"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Roberts J |year=2014 |title= Pathophysiology of ischemic placental disease |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=139–145 |pmid=24836825 |pmc=4040272 |doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2014.03.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which trigger pro-coagulator molecules to be released into the blood stream causing action of the coagulator cascade, eventually leading to placental infarction.&lt;ref name="pmid24836825"/&gt; Risk factors such as diabetes, chronic blood pressure and multiple pregnancies can increase the risk of developing placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid 24836824"/&gt; Also, exposure to sudden trauma can increase the risk of placental abruption which coincides with placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid24836826 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adam T, Yeh C, Bennett-Kunzier N, Kinzler W |year=2014 |title= Long-term maternal morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic placental disease |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=146–150 |pmid=24836826 |doi= 10.1053/j.semperi.2014.03.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no target treatment available for placental disease. Associative prevention mechanisms can be a method of minimising the risk of developing the disease, within early stages of pregnancy.

==Pathophysiology==

===Signs and symptoms===

The abnormal spiral arteries lead decreased level of oxygen diffusion through the placental villus,&lt;ref name="pmid24836825"/&gt; which cause chronic hypoxia. The abnormal trophoblast invasion,&lt;ref name="pmid24836825"/&gt; lead to overall uteroplacental insufficiencies and uteroplacental underperfusion. It is due to the decreased vascularisation, there are reduced levels of nutrient delivery to the foetus.&lt;ref name="pmid15058904"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baschat A, Hechert K |year=2004 |title=Fetal Growth Restriction due to Placental Disease |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=67–80 |pmid=15058904|doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, cases of still births can be associated with placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid19782960 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verspyck E, Borg J, Roman H, Thobois B, Pia P, Marpeau L |year=2010 |title=Hereditary thrombophilia and recurrence of ischemic placental disease |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=2002 |issue=1 |pages=54e1 - 54e5 |pmid=19782960 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2009.08.019 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
Preeclampsia is considered to be linked with Placental Disease, as well as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and placental abruptions are risk factors that lead to placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21839575"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ananth C, Vintzileos A |year=2011 |title=Ischemic placental disease: epidemiology and risk factors |journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology |volume=159 |issue=1 |pages=77–82 |doi= 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2011.07.025 |pmid=21839575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially when these symptoms are evident at early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="pmid 24836824"/&gt; The abnormal invasion of the trophoblast cells, lack of important growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), has an association with the onset of placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid24836830 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman A, Cleary K |year=2014 |title= Prediction and prevention of ischemic placental disease |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=177–182 |pmid=24836830 |doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2014.03.002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism&lt;ref name="pmid24836825"/&gt;===
In placental disease, there’s abnormalities present within the spiral arties of the uterus, where the terminal part of the spinal arteries does not dilate. This leads to decrease oxygen carried past the maternal villi into the intervillus space. The lack of terminal dilation and inclining blood velocity causes shredding of the villi into the maternal blood, releasing blood coagulants activating the coagulation cascade. Which then leads to blocking of the blood vessels causing placental infarction.

===Risk Factors ===
Risk factors associated with placental disease are as follows:&lt;ref name="pmid 24836824"/&gt;

*	Smoking cigarettes and use other forms of drugs such as cocaine. 
*	Diabetes mellitus 
*	Maternal age less than 20 years or over the age of 35
*	Multiple pregnancies 
*	Chronic high blood pressure 
*	Being underweight or obese

Also, chronic renal disease, collagen vascular disease and thrombophilia, increases the risk of developing placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid15058904"/&gt; Moreover, being exposed to severe trauma within the pregnancy period, rapid acceleration and deceleration and uterine compression increase the risk of placental abruption, in turn leading to placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid24836826 "/&gt;

===Diagnosis&lt;ref name="pmid15058904"/&gt;===
Placental Disease can be diagnosed through technologies such as, Prenatal ultrasound evaluation and invasive foetal testing. The size of the foetus is taken into account through ultrasonography in terms of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In conjunction with taking into account the maternal history.

===Treatment===
Treatment of placental disease would require a premature birth, in order to avoid a still birth.

===Epidemiology===
Placental disease is more common in preterm gestation than with full term.&lt;ref name="pmid21839575"/&gt;  Which leads to serious injuries to both the mother and the new-born.&lt;ref name="pmid24836830 "/&gt; Women who endured placental disease within the first pregnancy has an increased risk of the disease progressing within future pregnancies.&lt;ref name="pmid17601907 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ananth C, Peltier M, Chavez M, Kirby R, Getahun D, Vintzileos A |year=2017 |title=Recurrence of Ischemic Placental Disease |journal= American College of Obstetricians and gynaecologists |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |pmid=17601907 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000266983.77458.71 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of the disease within the first trimester leads to preterm delivery of a premature baby.&lt;ref name="pmid24836828 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vintzileos A, Ananth, C |year=2014 |title=First trimester prediction of ischemic placental disease |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=159–166 |pmid=24836828 |doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2014.03.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preeclampsia is diagnosed in 3-5% of pregnancies that place them at risk of developing placental disease.&lt;ref name="pmid24836826 "/&gt; Ischemic placental disease is linked with approximately more than half of premature births.&lt;ref name="pmid18280875 "/&gt;

===Prevention&lt;ref name="pmid24836830 "/&gt;===
The following factors can be linked with reducing the likelihood of developing placental disease:
*Use of aspirin, can reduce the risks associated with preeclampsia
*Low calcium intake can reduce the risk of preeclampsia
*Reducing oxidative stress present within the body
*Intake of prenatal multivitamins

{{Individualism sidebar}}
'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

'''Wernicke's aphasia''', also known as '''receptive aphasia''',&lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351–1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y|pmc=5405238}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''sensory aphasia''', or '''posterior aphasia''', is a type of [[aphasia]] in which individuals have difficulty understanding written and spoken language.&lt;ref name="Brookshire"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brookshire|first1=Robert|title=Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders|date=2007|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, MO|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with Wernicke's aphasia demonstrate fluent speech, which is characterized by typical speech rate, intact syntactic abilities, and effortless speech output.&lt;ref name="Damasio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Damasio|first1=A.R.|title=Aphasia|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=1992|volume=326|issue=8|pages=531–539|doi=10.1056/nejm199202203260806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning. In most cases, motor deficits (i.e. hemiparesis) do not occur in individuals with Wernicke's aphasia.&lt;ref name="Murdoch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=B.E.|title=Acquired Speech and Language Disorders: A Neuroanatomical and Functional Neurological Approach|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning. Wernicke's aphasia was named after [[Carl Wernicke]] who is credited with discovering the area of the brain responsible for language comprehension.&lt;ref name="NAA1" /&gt; Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are typically unaware of their errors in speech and do not realize their speech may lack meaning.&lt;ref name="Chart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Classifications of Aphasia|url=https://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically remain unaware of even their most profound language deficits.

Like many acquired language disorders, Wernicke's aphasia can be experienced in many different ways and to many different degrees. Patients diagnosed with Wernicke's aphasia can show severe language comprehension deficits; however, this is dependent on the severity and extent of the lesion.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt; Severity levels may range from being unable to understand even the simplest spoken and/or written information to missing minor details of a conversation.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt; Many diagnosed with Wernicke's aphasia have difficulty with repetition in words and sentences, and or working memory.&lt;ref name="Chart" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The following are common symptoms seen in patients with Wernicke's aphasia:

'''Impaired Comprehension''': deficits in understanding (receptive) written and spoken language.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt; This is because Wernicke's area is responsible for assigning meaning to the language that is heard, so if it is damaged, the brain cannot comprehend the information that is being received.

'''Poor Word Retrieval''': ability to retrieve target words is impaired.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt; This is also referred to as Anomia.

'''Fluent Speech''': individuals with Wernicke's aphasia do not have difficulty with producing connected speech that flows.&lt;ref name="NAA1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wernicke's (Receptive) Aphasia|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/wernickes-aphasia/|website=National Aphasia Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the connection of the words may be appropriate, the words they are using may not belong together or make sense (see Production of Jargon below).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Aphasia|url=http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/LifeAfterStroke/RegainingIndependence/CommunicationChallenges/Types-of-Aphasia_UCM_310096_Article.jsp#.WgM4XbpFw2w|website=American Stroke Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Production of Jargon''': speech that lacks content, consists of typical intonation, and is structurally intact.&lt;ref name="Jargon"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHA Glossary|url=https://www.asha.org/Glossary/Jargon/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jargon can consist of a string of neologisms, as well as a combination of real words that do not make sense together in context. May include [[word salad]]s.

'''Awareness''': Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are often not aware of their incorrect productions, which would further explain why they do not correct themselves when they produce jargon, paraphasias, or neologisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aphasia Definitions|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-definitions/|website=National Aphasia Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paraphasias''':&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Damasio" /&gt;
* '''Phonemic (Literal) Paraphasias''': involves the substitution, addition, or rearrangement of sounds so that an error can be defined as sounding like the target word. Often, half of the word is still intact which allows for easy comparison to the appropriate, original word.
** Ex: "bap" for "map"
* '''Semantic (Verbal) Paraphasias''': saying a word that is related to the target word in meaning or category; frequently observed in Wernicke's aphasia.
** Ex: "jet" for "airplane" or "knife" for "fork"
'''Neologisms''': nonwords that have no relation to the target word.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;
* Ex: "dorflur" for "shoe"
'''Circumlocution''': talking around the target word.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;
* Ex: "uhhh it's white...it's flat...you write on it…" (when referencing paper)
'''Press of speech''': run-on speech.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;  
* If a clinician asks, "what do you do at a supermarket?" And the individual responds with "Well, the supermarket is a place. It is a place with a lot of food. My favorite food is italian food. At a supermarket, I buy different kinds of food. There are carts and baskets. Supermarkets have lots of customers, and workers…."
'''Lack of Hemiparesis''': typically, no motor deficits are seen with a localized lesion in Wernicke's area.&lt;ref name="Murdoch" /&gt;

'''Reduced Retention Span''': reduced ability to retain information for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;

'''Impairments in reading and writing''': impairments can be seen in both reading and writing with differing severity levels.&lt;ref name="NAA1" /&gt;

'''How to Differentiate from Other Types of Aphasia'''.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;

* '''Expressive Aphasia (non-fluent Broca's Aphasia):''' individuals have great difficulty forming complete sentences with generally only basic content words (leaving out words like "is" and "the").
* '''Global Aphasia''': individuals have extreme difficulties with both expressive (producing language) and receptive (understanding language).
* '''Anomic Aphasia''': the biggest hallmark is an individuals poor word finding abilities; their speech is fluent and appropriate, but full of circumlocutions (evident in both writing and speech).
* '''Conduction Aphasia''': individual can comprehend what is being said and is fluent in spontaneous speech, but they cannot repeat what is being said to them.

==Causes==

The most common cause of Wernicke's aphasia is stroke. Strokes may occur when blood flow to the brain is completely interrupted or severely reduced. This has a direct effect on the amount of oxygen and nutrients being able to supply the brain, which causes brain cells to die within minutes. The primary classifications of stroke are hemorrhagic (ruptured blood vessel), or ischemic (blood clot reduces or completely stops blood flow). Two of the most common types of hemorrhagic stroke are subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is when an artery near the surface of the brain bursts causing blood to leak into the space between the brain and skull. Meanwhile intracerebral hemorrhage occurs when a blood vessel inside the brain bursts, causing spillage into surrounding brain tissue. Three main causes of these hemorrhagic strokes are hypertension (uncontrolled high blood pressure), aneurisms (weak spots in blood vessel walls), and arteriovenous malformations (rupture of abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels). As previously noted the other major classification for a stroke is an ischemic stroke. The ischemic strokes, which are the most common form of stroke, are further broken down and can be classified as embolic or thrombotic. Embolic strokes occur when a blood clot forms away from the brain, typically in the heart. A small portion of this clot breaks away and travels through the blood vessels until eventually reaching a small enough vessel in the brain that it can no longer pass through, causing a blockage. Thrombotic strokes on the other hand are due to the formation of a blood clot directly formed in one of the arteries that supply the brain. In general, stroke is the number one leading cause of disability worldwide.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stroke|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|accessdate=11/8/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The middle cerebral arteries supply blood to the cortical areas involved in speech, language and swallowing. The left middle cerebral artery provides Broca's area, Wernicke's area, Heschl's gyrus, and the angular gyrus with blood".&lt;ref name="McCaffrey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaffrey|first1=P.|title=Medical aspects: Blood supply in the brain|url=https://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in patients with Wernicke's aphasia, there is typically an occlusion to the left middle cerebral artery.

As a result of the occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery, Wernicke's aphasia is most commonly caused by a lesion in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area).&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt; This area is posterior to the primary auditory cortex (PAC) which is responsible for decoding individual speech sounds. Wernicke's primary responsibility is to assign meaning to these speech sounds. The extent of the lesion will determine the severity of the patients deficits related to language. Damage to the surrounding areas (perisylvian region) may also result in Wernicke's aphasia symptoms due to variation in individual neuroanatomical structure and any co-occurring damage in adjacent areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==

"Aphasia is usually first recognized by the physician who treats the person for his or her brain injury. Most individuals will undergo a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) or [[computed tomography]] (CT) scan to confirm the presence of a brain injury and to identify its precise location."&lt;ref name="NIDCD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aphasia|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In circumstances where a person is showing possible signs of aphasia, the physician will refer him or her to a [[speech-language pathologist]] (SLP) for a comprehensive speech and language evaluation. SLPs will examine the individual's ability to express him or herself through speech, understand language in written and spoken forms, write independently, and perform socially.&lt;ref name="NIDCD" /&gt;

The [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association|American Speech, Language, Hearing Association]] (ASHA) states a comprehensive assessment should be conducted in order to analyze the patient's communication functioning on multiple levels; as well as the effect of possible communication deficits on activities of daily living. Typical components of an aphasia assessment include: case history, self report, oral-motor examination, language skills, identification of environmental and personal factors, and the assessment results. A comprehensive aphasia assessment includes both formal and informal measures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aphasia: Roles and responsibilities|url=https://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&amp;section=Roles_and_Responsibilities|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal assessments:
* [[Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination]] (BDAE): diagnoses the presence and type of aphasia, focusing on location of lesion and the underlying linguistic processes.&lt;ref name="Goodglass"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodglass|first1=H.|last2=Kaplan|first2=E.|last3=Barresi|first3=B.|title=Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination|date=2001|publisher=PRO-ED, Inc.|location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;
* [[Western Aphasia Battery]] - Revised (WAB): determines the presence, severity, and type of aphasia; and can also determine baseline abilities of patient.&lt;ref name="WAB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kereesz|first1=A.|title=Western Aphasia Battery|date=2006|publisher=Pearson|location=San Antonio, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communication Activities of Daily Living - Second Edition (CADL-2): measures functional communication abilities; focuses on reading, writing, social interactions, and varying levels of communication.&lt;ref name="CADL"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holland|first1=A.L.|last2=Fromm|first2=D.|last3=Wozniak|first3=L.|title=Communication Activities in Daily Living (CADL-3)|date=2018|publisher=Brijan Resources|location=Alberta, Canada|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Revised Token Test (RTT): assess receptive language and auditory comprehension; focuses on patient's ability to follow directions.&lt;ref name="RTT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeil|first1=M.M.|last2=Prescott|first2=T.E.|title=Revised Token Test|date=1978|publisher=PRO-ED, Inc.|location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Informal Assessments:

Informal assessments aide in the diagnosis of patients with suspected aphasia.&lt;ref name="Assessment Tools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment Tools, Techniques, and Data Sources|url=https://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Late-Language-Emergence/Assessment-Tools-Techniques-and-Data-Sources/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conversational Speech and Language Sample&lt;ref name="Assessment Tools" /&gt;
* Family Interview&lt;ref name="Assessment Tools" /&gt;
* Case History or Medical Chart Review&lt;ref name="Assessment Tools" /&gt;
* Behavioral Observations&lt;ref name="Assessment Tools" /&gt;

Diagnostic information should be scored and analyzed appropriately. Treatment plans and individual goals should be developed based on diagnostic information, as well as patient and caregiver needs, desires, and priorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Treatment==

According to Bates et al. (2005), "the primary goal of rehabilitation is to prevent complications, minimize impairments, and maximize function". The topics of intensity and timing of intervention are widely debated across various fields.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=B.|last2=Choi|first2=J.|last3=Duncan|first3=P.W.|last4=Glasberg|first4=J.J.|last5=Graham|first5=G.D.|last6=Katz|first6=R.C....|last7=Zorowitz|first7=R.|title=Veterans affairs/department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of adult stroke rehabilitation care|journal=Stroke|date=2005|volume=36|pages=2049–2056|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000180432.73724.AD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results are contradictory: some studies indicate better outcomes with early intervention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhogal|first1=S.K.|last2=Teasell|first2=R.|last3=Speechley|first3=M.|title=Intensity of aphasia therapy, impact on recovery|journal=Stroke|date=2003|volume=34|pages=987–993|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000062343.64383.D0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies indicate starting therapy too early may be detrimental to the patient's recovery.&lt;ref name="Nouwens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nouwens|first1=F.|last2=Visch-Brink|first2=E.G.|last3=Van de Sandt-Koenderman|first3=M.M.E.|last4=Dippeo|first4=D.W.J|last5=Kaudstaal|first5=P.J.|last6=de Law|first6=L.M.L.|title=Optimal timing for speech and language therapy after stroke: More evidence needed|journal=Neurotherapeutic|date=2015|volume=15|issue=8|pages=885–893|doi=10.1586/14737175.2015.1058161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests, that therapy be functional and  focus on communication goals that are appropriate for the patient's individual lifestyle.&lt;ref name="LPAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Participation Approach to Aphasia: A Statement of Values for the Future|url=https://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/LPAA/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific treatment considerations for working with individuals with Wernicke's aphasia (or those who exhibit deficits in auditory comprehension) include using familiar materials,using shorter and slower utterances when speaking, giving direct instructions, and using repetition as needed.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;

Neuroplasticity: Role in Recovery

[[Neuroplasticity]] is defined as the brain's ability to reorganize itself, lay new pathways, and rearrange existing ones, as a result of experience.&lt;ref name="Bayles"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bayles|first1=K.A.|last2=Tomodea|first2=C.K.|title=Neuroplasticity: Implications for treating cognitive communication disorders|journal=ASHA National Convention|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuronal changes after damage to the brain such as collateral sprouting, increased activation of the homologous areas, and map extension demonstrate the brain's neuroplastic abilities. According to Thomson, "Portions of the right hemisphere, extended left brain sites, or both have been shown to be recruited to perform language functions after brain damage.&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=C.K.|title=Neuroplasticity: Evidence from aphasia|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=2000|volume=33|issue=4|pages=357–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the neuronal changes recruit areas not originally or directly responsible for large portions of linguistic processing.&lt;ref name="Raymer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raymer|first1=A.M.|last2=Beeson|first2=P.|last3=Holland|first3=A.|last4=Kendall|first4=D.|last5=Maher|first5=L.M.|last6=Martin|first6=M.|last7=Gonzolez Rothi|first7=L.J.|title=Transitional research in aphasia: From neuroscience to neurorehabilitation|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=2008|volume=51|pages=259–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principles of neuroplasticity have been proven effective in neurorehabilitation after damage to the brain. These principles include: incorporating multiple modalities into treatment to create stronger neural connections, using stimuli that evoke positive emotion, linking concepts with simultaneous and related presentations, and finding the appropriate intensity and duration of treatment for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;

=== Auditory comprehension treatment ===
Auditory comprehension is a primary focus in treatment for Wernicke's aphasia, as it is the main deficit related to this diagnosis. Therapy activities may include:
* Single-word comprehension: A common treatment method used to support single-word comprehension skills is known as a pointing drill. Through this method, clinicians lay out a variety of images in front of a patient. The patient is asked to point to the image that corresponds to the word provided by the clinician.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;
* Understanding Spoken Sentences: "Treatment to improve comprehension of spoken sentences typically consists of drills in which patients answer questions, follow directions or verify the meaning of sentences".&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;
* Understanding Conversation: An effective treatment method to support comprehension of discourse includes providing a patient with a conversational sample and asking him or her questions about that sample. Individuals with less severe deficits in auditory comprehension may also be able to retell aspects of the conversation.&lt;ref name="Brookshire" /&gt;

=== Word retrieval ===
Anomia is consistently seen in aphasia, so many treatment techniques aim to help patients with word finding problems. One example of a semantic approach is referred to as semantic feature analyses. The process includes naming the target object shown in the picture and producing words that are semantically related to the target. Through production of semantically similar features, participants develop more skilled in naming stimuli due to the increase in lexical activation.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=M.|last2=Coelho|first2=C.A.|title=Semantic feature analysis treatment for anomia in two fluent aphasia syndromes|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|date=2004|volume=13|pages=236–249|doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2004/025)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social approach to treatment===
The social approach involves a collaborative effort on behalf of patients and clinicians to determine goals and outcomes for therapy that could improve the patient's quality of life. A conversational approach is thought to provide opportunities for development and the use of strategies to overcome barriers to communication.The main goals of this treatment method are to improve the patient's conversational confidence and skills in natural contexts using conversational coaching, supported conversations, and partner training.&lt;ref name="LaPointe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaPointe|first1=L.|title=Aphasia and Related Neurogenic Language Disorders|date=2005|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers Inc.|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conversational coaching involves patients with aphasia and their speech language pathologists, who serve as a "coach" discussing strategies to approach various communicative scenarios. The "coach" will help the patient develop a script for a scenario (such as ordering food at a restaurant), and help the patient practice and perform the scenario in and out of the clinic while evaluating the outcome.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=G.A.|title=Aphasia Therapy Guide|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/aphasia-therapy-guide/|website=National Aphasia Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Supported conversation also involves using a communicative partner who supports the patient's learning by providing contextual cues, slowing their own rate of speech, and increasing their message's redundancy to promote the patient's comprehension.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;
Additionally, it is important to include the families of patients with aphasia in treatment programs. Clinicians can teach family members how to support one another, and how to adjust their speaking patterns to facilitate their loved one's treatment and rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="LaPointe" /&gt;

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is strongly dependent on the location and extent of the lesion (damage) to the brain. Many personal factors also influence how a person will recover, which include age, previous medical history, level of education, gender, and motivation.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt; All of these factors influence the brain's ability to adapt to change, restore previous skills, and learn new skills. It is important to remember that all the presentations of Receptive Aphasia may vary. The presentation of symptoms and prognosis are both dependent on personal components related to the individual's neural organization before the stroke, the extent of the damage, and the influence of environmental and behavioral factors after the damage occurs.&lt;ref name="Keefe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keefe|first1=K.A.|title=Applying basic neuroscience to aphasia therapy: What the animals are telling us|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|date=1995|volume=4|pages=88–93|doi=10.1044/1058-0360.0404.88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quicker a diagnosis of a stroke is made by a medical team, the more positive the patient's recovery may be. A medical team will work to control the signs and symptoms of the stroke and rehabilitation therapy will begin to manage and recover lost skills. The rehabilitation team may consist of a certified Speech-Language Pathologist, Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, and the family/caregivers.&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt; The length of therapy will be different for everyone, but research suggests that intense therapy over a short amount of time can improve outcomes of speech and language therapy for patients with aphasia. Research is not suggesting the only way therapy should be administered, but gives insight on how therapy affects the patient's prognosis.&lt;ref name="Nouwens" /&gt;

The '''simple church''' is an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Christian Church|Christian]] movement that reinterprets the nature and practice of [[Church service|church]].

==Simple==
A simple church may meet anywhere with or without trained leaders, formal [[liturgy]], programs or structures.&lt;ref&gt;House2House Magazine Website, "[http://www.house2house.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 What Do We Mean By Simple Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161450/http://www.house2house.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate relationship, discipleship (spiritual formation), multiplication, mobility, and member ownership, a simple church is usually a [[Cell group|small group]] of no more than 20-25 persons. Most Church "programs" privately meet during some days of the week and discuss troubles that they are having with their faith, and personal life. Church "programs" are virtually nonexistent and small group participation is essential. The process of moving from worship to small group, small group to mission work, and mission work to worship is a primary focus.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Authors Tony and Felicity Dale, founders of ''House2House Ministries'', have promoted the term "simple church" in their book "Simply Church".&lt;ref&gt;Dale, T. and Dale, F. (2000) ''Simply Church''. Karis Books, {{ISBN|0-9718040-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://metrosoul.org/whatwedo.shtml What We Do: Planting Simple Churches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002242/http://metrosoul.org/whatwedo.shtml |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used interchangeably with other terms like organic church,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, N. (2005) ''Organic Church: Growing faith where life happens''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-7879-8129-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential church, primitive church, bodylife, relational church, and micro-church.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Kreider, "[http://www.dcfi.org/House_Church_Sem_One_Day.htm House Churches &amp; Micro Churches]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" (Accessed September 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twenty-first century a number of established Christian denominations and mission organizations have officially supported efforts to develop [[house church]] networks. These include the [[Free Methodist Church in Canada]], the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel#North America|Foursquare Gospel Church of Canada]], the [[Evangelical Fellowship of Canada]], the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]], Partners in Harvest, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], Dove Christian Fellowship International, DAWN Ministries (Discipling a Whole Nation), [[Youth With A Mission]] (YWAM), and [[Eternal Grace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arnold|first1=Lori|title=Displaced pastor finds grass is greener on the outside|url=http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar01%20/Art_displacedpastor.html|accessdate=May 1, 2017|agency=Christian Times|date=January 19, 2000|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.li/20061022140647/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar01%20/Art_displacedpastor.html|archivedate=October 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
Many in the simple church movement point to the [[New Testament]], especially the [[Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and the writings of the [[Apostle Paul]] for justification of their model (see [[House church#Scriptural basis|House Church, Scriptural Basis]]). Historically speaking, simple gatherings of Christians were the norm of [[Early Christianity]]. Between 100AD and 300AD, Christianity grew from 25,000 to 20 million people in the [[Roman Empire]]. In fact, much of the New Testament was written to people who met in house churches.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgotten Ways (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christian house churches were patterned after house [[synagogue]]s which were numerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplechurchathome.com/Bible.html Simple Church at Home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823041937/http://www.simplechurchathome.com/Bible.html |date=August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians took a low-cost and easy-to-multiply model and adapted it to their new Christian context. In addition, the [[Eucharist|Communion]] service, sometimes called the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], was uniquely Christian (though modeled on the [[Passover]]). Since it did not apply to Jews and therefore did not fit in the Jewish synagogues, it had to be celebrated somewhere else. House churches were the natural place for communion to be shared. As time went on, Christians were banned from Jewish synagogues as persecution intensified (see [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]). Although house churches flourished in times of persecution, they were well-established before them.

In the West, simple church can be traced back to the house church movement. In North America and the UK particularly, the house church movement is often viewed as a development and logical extension of the 'Brethren' or [[Plymouth Brethren]] movement, where many individuals and assemblies have adopted new approaches to worship and governance, while others recognise a relationship to the [[Anabaptists]], [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], [[Mennonites]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]], and the much earlier [[Waldenses]] and [[Priscillianists]]. Another perspective sees the house church movement as a re-emergence of the movement of the [[Holy Spirit]] during the [[Jesus Movement]] of the 1970s in the USA or the worldwide [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic Renewal]] of the late 1960s and 1970s. Others see it as a return to a New Testament church [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] paradigm and a restoration of God's eternal purpose and the natural expression of Christ on the earth, urging Christians to return from hierarchy and rank to practices described and encouraged in Scripture.

Simple church has also been influenced by overseas missions and the growth of [[church planting]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;See David Garrison, "Church Planting Movements" (International Missionary Board Southern Baptist Convention, 2004); and Rad Zdero, "The Global House Church Movement" (William Carey Library Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|0-87808-342-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Church planting movements are spontaneously growing church multiplication efforts.

The [[missional]] Movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendofmissional.org/ Friend of Missional]&lt;/ref&gt; has also influenced simple church.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Thoman, "[http://sojourner.typepad.com/house_church_blog/2004/03/house_church_ba.html House Church Basics Pt. 3: Missional Church] (Accessed September 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

SIMPLE-CHURCH IN THE U.K.
SimpleChurch movement has begun to emerge in the Unoted Kingdon. House Churches have existed for some years in places where traditional churches have closed, or not met the needs of evangelicals  (or charismatics). Due in some cases to the Church of England being perceived to have moved away from biblical doctrines.
A website promoting Simple Church in the U.K. is at simplechurch.org.uk

==Values==
As in any decentralized, spontaneous movement, a variety of values are expressed in simple church.  Due to the influence of some key groups and Acts 2:42-47, three overarching values have emerged in many circles. Adherents Paul Kaak (who began ministry in one of the largest and most systematized [[megachurch|mega-churches]] in [[United States|America]]) and Neil Cole originally articulated these values using the letters DNA. According to him:
* '''D - Divine Truth''': Truth is the foundation for everything.&lt;ref&gt;A recent variation refers to the "D" as "Divine Connection" and views the Word of God and prayer as two primary means of maintaining that connection with God. The DNA metaphor is thus extended to include four overarching values instead of only three.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''N - Nurturing Relationships''' : Healthy relationships are what make up a family. Love for one another is to be a constant pursuit of the family of God.
* '''A - Apostolic Mission''' : Apostolic means, simply, “sent.”&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cole and Paul Kaak, ''Organic Church Planters Greenhouse: The First Story'' [http://www.cmaresources.org CMA Resources]. Long Beach, 2004) pg. 1-6. Also published in ''Organic Church'' by Neil Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

These values have since been promoted by House2House Ministries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house2house.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 What Do We Mean By Simple Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161450/http://www.house2house.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 |date=2007-09-27 }} (Accessed September 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and DAWN North America, and have been adopted by various groups such as New York's [[MetroSoul]]&lt;ref&gt;MetroSoul Website, "[http://metrosoul.org/whatwedo.shtml What We Do: Planting Simple Churches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002242/http://metrosoul.org/whatwedo.shtml |date=September 27, 2007 }} (Accessed September 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
Adherents George Barna and Frank Viola's book ''Pagan Christianity'' points out a number of reforms that organic churches often advocate.
* The belief that modern [[clergy]] is a vestige of Roman [[pagan]] religion that was absent from the early church and is largely at odds with the true [[priesthood of all believers]]. The movement sees the institution of the clergy at odds with passages like Matthew 20, Matthew 23, 3rd John, and the message in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] regarding the deeds of the [[Nicolaism|Nicolaitans]] (Greek-literally those who triumph over the people). [[1 Corinthians]] 12-14 paints a picture of an every-member functioning church meeting entirely at odds with the modern religious service which is performed by professionals for an audience. However, some believe this view does not take into account the Jewish and synagogue based nature of the ekklesia, which explains the talk of elders and deacons found in the New Testament. In reply, many simple churches do recognize elders and deacons according to the biblical standards laid out in TImothy and Titus but believe these people emerge over time as their character becomes descriptive of these roles.  In an environment where people are free to express their gifts, such people can emerge. Also, being an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] or [[deacon]] does not mean this person dominates the meeting. [[3 John]] rebukes [[Diotrephes]] the elder who had to be first and was dominating.  The simple church largely believes the idea that an elder or deacon is not a license for some to minister and others to be passive.
* Valuing the Lord's Supper occurring as a regular, recurring full meal celebration rather than a short religious ritual. The early integration of the home based ritual into the public synagogue-like meeting functioned to reduce the symbolic nature of the act to a private moment, replacing its symbolism of fellowship and dedication to the Lord. This was complete by the time of Constantine, when home based [[agape feast]]s were banned. However, this history does not in itself devalue the need for the larger synagogue-like meeting for prayer, ministry of the word and singing. Simple church adherents also enjoy occasional and even monthly larger gatherings that do this very thing, though they emphasize the smaller meeting of the ekklesia as the environment for spiritual growth.
* Organic churches tend to place less emphasis on the building or meeting place.  To this end, Neil Cole, an adherent of simple church, states that "buildings, budgets, and big shots," tend to do more to contain Christianity than allow it to spread.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, N. ''Organic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this statement against larger sized churches does nothing to substantiate its claim.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Media and popular attention==
In the early twenty–first century the growth of the movement has had increased news media coverage:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/03/AR2006060300225.html|title = Going to Church by Staying at Home: Clergy-Less Living Room Services Seen as a Growing Trend|last = Chandler and Aryanpur|first = Michael Alison and Arianne|date = June 4, 2006|work = |accessdate = September 30, 2006|publisher = Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1146606640344&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;col=968793972154&amp;t=TS_Home|title = Religion, but no church required|last = Laidlaw|first = Stuart|date = |work = |accessdate = September 30, 2006|publisher = Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1167737-1,00.html|title = There's No Pulpit Like Home|last = Van Biema and Healy|first = David and Rita|date = |work = |accessdate = September 30, 2006|publisher = Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many books have been written on the simple church movement, especially by insiders (see [[House church#Recommended Books|House Church, Recommended Books]]).  In the early twentyfirst century books began to appear by those studying the movement from a more objective view, including [[George Barna]]'s ''Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;Barna, G. (2005). ''Revolution''. Tyndale House. {{ISBN|1-4143-1016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barna says that "revolutionary" expressions such as simple church will soon account for one third of American spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Barna, G. (2005). ''Revolution''. Tyndale House. p. 49. {{ISBN|1-4143-1016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visibility of the movement also increased due to national and regional gatherings of various kinds.  The largest of these is the Annual House Church Conference held in Dallas, USA and occasionally at other locations by House2House.

==Criticism==
How the simple church movement relates to constructing a [[theology]] and [[ecclesiology]] is the subject of much debate, especially with critics of the movement.

Several prominent voices have serious concerns about simple church.  For example, J. Lee Grady (Charisma Online Editor) says such a movement wants to "reinvent the church without its biblical structure and New Testament order — and without the necessary people who are anointed and appointed by God to lead it. To follow this defective thesis to its logical conclusion would require us to fire all pastors, close all seminaries and Bible colleges, padlock our sanctuaries and send everybody home..."&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Grady, [http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/blogs/520-fire-in-my-bones/13063-barnas-dangerous-proposal Barna's Dangerous Proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005942/http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/blogs/520-fire-in-my-bones/13063-barnas-dangerous-proposal |date=2012-03-02 }}" (Accessed September 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Grady and other critics worry that the simple church movement could encourage people to leave more traditional forms of church, which could lead to further collapse or decline of Christendom.

'''Stunted growth''', also known as '''stunting''' and '''nutritional stunting''', is a reduced [[human height|growth rate]] in [[human development (biology)|human development]]. It is a primary manifestation of [[malnutrition]] (or more precisely undernutrition) and recurrent infections, such as [[diarrhea]] and [[helminthiasis]], in early [[childhood]] and even before birth, due to malnutrition during fetal development brought on by a malnourished mother. The definition of stunting according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is for the "height for age" value to be less than two standard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards median.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://apps.who.int/nutrition/landscape/help.aspx?menu=0&amp;helpid=391&amp;lang=EN|title = Nutrition Landscape Information System (NLiS)|date = |accessdate = 12 November 2014|website = |publisher = WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012 an estimated 162 million children under 5 years of age, or 25%, were stunted in 2012. More than 90% of the world's stunted children live in Africa and Asia, where respectively 36% and 56% of children are affected.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, The World Bank. UNICEFWHO- World Bank Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates. (http://data.unicef.org/resources/2013/webapps/nutrition)&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, stunting and its effects typically become permanent. Stunted children may never regain the height lost as a result of stunting, and most children will never gain the corresponding body weight. Living in an environment where many people [[open defecation|defecate in the open]] due to lack of [[sanitation]], is an important cause of stunted growth in children, for example in India.&lt;ref&gt;Spears, D. (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1795 How much international variation in child height can sanitation explain? - Policy research working paper]. The World Bank, Sustainable Development Network, Water and Sanitation Program&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
Stunted growth in children has the following public health impacts apart from the obvious impact of shorter stature of the person affected:
* greater risk for illness and premature death&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* may result in delayed mental development and therefore poorer school performance and later on reduced productivity in the work force&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* reduced cognitive capacity
* Women of shorter stature have a greater risk for complications during child birth due to their smaller pelvis, and are at risk of delivering a baby with low birth weight&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Stunted growth can even be passed on to the next generation (this is called the "intergenerational cycle of malnutrition")&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The impact of stunting on child development has been established in multiple studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Assembly Global Nutrition Targets 2025: Stunting Policy Brief, World Health Organization 2014|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/globaltargets_stunting_policybrief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child is stunted at age 2 they will have higher risk of poor cognitive and educational achievement in life, with subsequent socio-economic and inter-generational consequences.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Multi-country studies have also suggested that stunting is associated with reductions in schooling, decreased economic productivity and poverty.&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt;  Stunted children also display higher risk of developing chronic non-communicable conditions such as diabetes and obesity as adults.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; If a stunted child undergoes substantial weight gain after age 2, there is a higher chance of becoming obese. This is believed to be caused by metabolic changes produced by chronic malnutrition, that can produce metabolic imbalances if the individual is exposed to excessive or poor quality diets as an adult.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; This can lead to higher risk of developing other related non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome and stroke.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; 
At societal level, stunted individuals do not fulfill their physical and cognitive developmental potential and will not be able to contribute maximally to society. Stunting can therefore limit economic development and productivity, and it has been estimated that it can affect a country's GDP up to 3%.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt;

{{Further|Malnutrition in children}}
The causes for stunting are principally very similar if not the same as the causes for [[malnutrition in children]]. Most stunting happens during the 1,000-day period that spans from conception to a child's second birthday.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The''' '''three main causes of stunting in South Asia, and probably in most developing countries, are poor feeding practices, poor maternal nutrition, and poor sanitation.

=== Feeding practices ===
Inadequate complementary child feeding and a general lack of vital nutrients beside pure caloric intake is one cause for stunted growth. Children need to be fed diets which meet the minimum requirements in terms of frequency and diversity in order to prevent undernutrition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web |last1=A. Balalian |first1=Arin |last2=Simonyan |first2=Hambardzum |last3=Hekimian |first3=Kim |last4=Deckelbaum |first4=Richard J. |last5=Sargsyan |first5=Aelita |title=Prevalence and determinants of stunting in a conflict-ridden border region in Armenia - a cross-sectional study |url=https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-017-0204-9 |website=BMC Nutrition |language=En |doi=10.1186/s40795-017-0204-9 |date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal nutrition ===
Poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding can lead to stunted growth of their children. Women who are underweight or anemic during pregnancy, are more likely to have stunted children which perpetuates the inter-generational transmission of stunting. Children born with low birthweight are more at risk of stunting.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Sanitation ===
There is most likely a link between children's linear growth and household [[sanitation]] practices. The ingestion of high quantities of fecal bacteria by young children through putting soiled fingers or household items in the mouth leads to intestinal infections. This affect children's nutritional status by diminishing appetite, reducing nutrient absorption, and increasing nutrient losses.

The diseases recurrent [[diarrhoea]] and intestinal worm infections ([[helminthiasis]]) which are both linked to poor sanitation have been shown to contribute to child stunting. The evidence that a condition called [[environmental enteropathy]] also stunts children is not conclusively available yet, although the link is plausible and several studies are underway on this topic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Velleman, Y., Pugh, I. (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1794 Under-nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene - Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) play a fundamental role in improving nutritional outcomes. A successful global effort to tackle under-nutrition must include WASH.] Briefing Note by WaterAid and Share, UK&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental enteropathy is a syndrome causing changes in the small intestine of persons and can be brought on due to lacking basic sanitary facilities and being exposed to faecal contamination on a long-term basis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Research on a global level has found that the proportion of stunting that could be attributed to five or more episodes of diarrhoea before two years of age was 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Christa L Fischer|last2=Rudan|first2=Igor|last3=Liu|first3=Li|last4=Nair|first4=Harish|last5=Theodoratou|first5=Evropi|last6=Bhutta|first6=Zulfiqar A|last7=O'Brien|first7=Katherine L|last8=Campbell|first8=Harry|last9=Black|first9=Robert E|title=Global burden of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2013|volume=381|issue=9875|pages=1405–1416|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60222-6|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60222-6/fulltext#article_upsell|pmid=23582727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since diarrhoea is closely linked with water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]), this is a good indicator for the connection between WASH and stunted growth. To what extent improvements in drinking water safety, [[toilet]] use and good [[handwashing]] practices contribute to reduce stunting depends on the how bad these practices were prior to interventions.

== Diagnosis ==
Growth stunting is identified by comparing measurements of children's heights to the [[World Health Organization]] 2006 growth reference population: children who fall below the fifth [[percentile]] of the reference population in height for age are defined as stunted, regardless of the reason. The lower than fifth percentile corresponds to less than two standard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards median.

As an indicator of nutritional status, comparisons of children's measurements with growth reference curves may be used differently for populations of children than for individual children. The fact that an individual child falls below the fifth percentile for height for age on a growth reference curve may reflect normal variation in growth within a population: the individual child may be short simply because both parents carried [[gene]]s for shortness and not because of inadequate nutrition. However, if substantially more than 5% of an identified child population have height for age that is less than the fifth percentile on the reference curve, then the population is said to have a higher-than-expected prevalence of stunting, and malnutrition is generally the first cause considered.

== Prevention ==
Three main things are needed to reduce stunting:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-nutrition|title = The Lancet series on Maternal and Child Nutrition|date = 6 June 2013|accessdate = 8 November 2014|website = |publisher = The Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a kind of environment where political commitment can thrive (also called an "enabling environment")
* applying several nutritional modifications or changes in a population on a large scale which have a high benefit and a low cost
* a strong foundation that can drive change ([[food security]], [[empowerment]] of women and a supportive health environment through increasing access to safe water and sanitation). 
To prevent stunting, it is not just a matter of providing better nutrition but also access to clean water, improved [[sanitation]] (hygienic [[toilet]]s) and hand washing at critical times (summarised as "[[WASH]]").  Without provision of toilets, prevention of tropical intestinal diseases, which may affect almost all children in the developing world and lead to stunting will not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=JH|title=Child undernutrition, tropical enteropathy, toilets, and handwashing.|journal=Lancet|date=19 September 2009|volume=374|issue=9694|pages=1032–5|pmid=19766883|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1792|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have looked at ranking the underlying determinants in terms of their potency in reducing child stunting and found in the order of potency:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Smith, L. and Haddad, L. (2014) [https://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/reducing-child-undernutrition-past-drivers-and-priorities-for-the-post-mdg-era Reducing Child Undernutrition: Past Drivers and Priorities for the Post-MDG Era], IDS Working Paper 441, IDS (Institute for Development Studies), UK&lt;/ref&gt;
* percent of dietary energy from non-staples (greatest impact)
* access to sanitation and women's education 
* access to safe water
* women's empowerment as measured by the female-to-male life expectancy ratio
* per capita dietary energy supply 
Three of these determinants should receive attention in particular: access to sanitation, diversity of calorie sources from food supplies, and women's empowerment. A study by the [[Institute of Development Studies]] has stressed that: "The first two should be prioritized because they have strong impacts yet are farthest below their desired levels".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The goal of UN agencies, governments and NGO is now to optimise nutrition during the first 1000 days of a child's life, from pregnancy to the child's second birthday, in order to reduce the prevalence of stunting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Franck Flachenberg, Regine Kopplow (2014) [https://www.concern.net/resources/how-better-link-wash-and-nutrition-programmes How to better link WASH and nutrition programmes], Concern Worldwide Technical Briefing Note&lt;/ref&gt; The first 1000 days in a child's life are a crucial "window of opportunity" because the brain develops rapidly, laying the foundation for future cognitive and social ability. Furthermore, it is also the time when young children are the most at risk of infections that lead to diarrhoea. It is the time when they stop breast feeding (weaning process), begin to crawl, put things in their mouths and become exposed to faecal matter from [[open defecation]] and environmental enteropathies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pregnant and lactating mothers ===
Ensuring proper nutrition of pregnant and lactating mothers is essential.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Assembly Global Nutrition Targets 2025: Stunting Policy Brief, World Health Organization 2014|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/globaltargets_stunting_policybrief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving so by helping women of reproductive age be in good nutritional status at conception is an excellent preventive measure.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A focus on the pre-conception period has recently been introduced as a complement to the key phase of the 1000 days of pregnancy and first two years of life.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; An example of this is are attempts to control anemia in women of reproductive age.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A well-nourished mother is the first step of stunting prevention, decreasing chances of the baby being born of low birth-weight, which is the first risk factor for future malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

After birth, in terms of interventions for the child, early initiation of breastfeeding, together with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, are pillars of stunting prevention.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Introducing proper complementary feeding after 6 months of age together with breastfeeding until age 2 is the next step.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Policy interventions ===
In summary, key policy interventions for the prevention of stunting are: 
* Improvement in nutrition surveillance activities to identify rates and trends of stunting and other forms of malnutrition within countries.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This should be done with an equity perspective, as it is likely that stunting rates will vary greatly between different population groups. The most vulnerable should be prioritized. The same should be done for risk factors such as anemia, maternal under-nutrition, food insecurity, low birth-weight, breastfeeding practices etc. By collecting more detailed information, it is easier to ensure that policy interventions really address the root causes of stunting. 
* Political will to develop and implement national targets and strategies in line with evidence-based international guidelines as well as contextual factors.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Designing and implementing policies promoting nutritional and health well-being of mothers and women of reproductive age.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The main focus should be on the 1000 days of pregnancy and first two years of life, but the pre-conception period should not be neglected as it can play a significant role in ensuring the fetus and baby's nutrition. 
* Designing and implementing policies promoting proper breastfeeding and complementary feeding practice&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; (focusing on diet diversity for both macro and micronutrients). This can ensure optimal infant nutrition as well as protection from infections that can weaken the child's body. Labor policy ensuring mothers have the chance to breastfeed should be considered where necessary.
* Introducing interventions addressing social and other health determinants of stunting, such as poor sanitation and access to drinking water, early marriages, intestinal parasite infections, malaria and other childhood preventable disease&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; (referred to as “nutrition-sensitive interventions”), as well as the country's food security landscape. Interventions to keep adolescent girls in school can be effective at delaying marriage with subsequent nutritional benefits for both women and babies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Regulating milk substitutes is also very important to ensure that as many mothers as possible breastfeed their babies, unless a clear contraindication is present.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Broadly speaking, effective policies to reduce stunting require multisectoral approaches, strong political commitment, community involvement and integrated service delivery.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

According to the World Health organisation if less than 20% of the population is affected by stunting, this is regarded as&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"low prevalence" in terms of public health significance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Values of 40% or more are regarded as very high prevalence, and values in between as medium to high prevalence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

UNICEF has estimated that: "Globally, more than one quarter (26 per cent) of children under 5 years of age were stunted in 2011 – roughly 165 million children worldwide."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNICEF|title=Improving child nutrition : the achievable imperative for global progress|date=2013|publisher=United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), New York, USA|isbn=978-92-806-4686-3|url = http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_68661.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "In sub-Saharan Africa, 40 per cent of children under 5 years of age are stunted; in South Asia, 39 per cent are stunted."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The four countries with the highest prevalence are Timor-Leste, Burundi, Niger and Madagascar where more than half of children under 5 years old are stunted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Trends ===
As of 2015, it was estimated that there were 156 million stunted children under 5 in the world, 90% of them living in low and low-middle income countries.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Levels and trends in child malnutrition, UNICEF 2016|url=http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UNICEF-Joint-Malnutrition-brochure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 56% of these were in Asia, and 37% in Africa.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; It is possible that some of these children concurrently had other forms of malnutrition, including wasting and stunting, and overweight and stunting. No statistics are currently available for these combined conditions. Stunting has been on the decline for the past 15 years, but this decline has been too slow. As a comparison, there were 255 million stunted children in 1990, 224 in 1995, 198 in 2000, 182 in 2005, 169 in 2010, and 156 in 2016.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;
The decline is happening, but it is uneven geographically, it is unequal among different groups in society, and prevalence of stunting remains at unacceptably high numbers.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Too many children who are not able to fulfill their genetic physical and cognitive developmental potential.

Over the period 2000-2015, Asia reduced its stunting prevalence from 38 to 24%, Africa from 38 to 32%, and Latin America and the Caribbean from 18 to 11%.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This equates to a relative reduction of 36, 17 and 39% respectively, indicating that Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean have displayed much larger improvements than Africa, which needs to address this issue with much more effort if it is to win the battle against a problem that has been crippling its development for decades. Of these regions, Latin America and the Caribbean are on track to achieve global targets set with global initiatives such as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the World Health Assembly targets (see following section on global targets).&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

Sub-regional stunting rates are as follows: In Africa, the highest rates are observed in East Africa (37.5%).&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; All other Sub-Saharan sub-regions also have high rates, with 32.1% in West Africa, 31.2% in Central Africa, and 28.4% in Southern Africa.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; North Africa is at 18%, and the Middle East at 16.2%.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; In Asia, the highest rate is observed in South Asia at 34.4%.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; South-East Asia is at 26.3%. Pacific Islands also display a high rate at 38.2%. Central and South America are respectively at 15.6 and 9.9%.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; South Asia, given its very high population at over 1 billion and high prevalence rate of stunting, is the region currently hosting the highest absolute number of children with stunting&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; (60 million plus).

Looking at absolute numbers of children under 5 affected by stunting, it is obvious why current efforts and reductions are insufficient. The absolute number of stunted children has increased in Africa from 50.4 to 58.5 million in the time 2000-2015.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This is despite the reduction in percentage prevalence of stunting, and is due to the high rates of population growth. The data therefore indicate that the rate of reduction of stunting in Africa has not been able to counterbalance the increased number of growing children that fall into the trap of malnutrition, due to population growth in the region. This is also true in Oceania, unlike Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean where substantial absolute reductions in the number of stunted children have been observed&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; (for example, Asia reduced its number of stunted children from 133 million to 88 million between 2000 and 2015).

The reduction in stunting is closely linked to poverty reduction and the will and ability of governments to set up solid multisectoral approaches to reduce chronic malnutrition. Low income countries are the only group with more stunted children today than in the year 2000.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Conversely, all other countries (high-income, upper-middle income, lower-middle income) have achieved reductions in the numbers of stunted children.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This sadly perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty and malnutrition, whereby malnourished children are not able to maximally contribute to economic development as adults, and poverty increases chances of malnutrition.

==Research==
The [[Water and sanitation program|Water and Sanitation Program]] of the [[World Bank]] has investigated links between lack of sanitation and stunting in Vietnam and Lao PDR.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maria Quattri, Susanna Smets, and Viengsompasong Inthavong (2014) [https://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/WSP-LaoPDR-Stunting-Research-Brief.pdf Investing in the Next Generation - Children grow taller, and smarter, in rural, mountainous villages of Lao PDR where all community members use improved sanitation], WSP (Water and Sanitation Program), World Bank, USA&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Vietnam it was found that lack of sanitation in rural villages in mountainous regions of Vietnam led to five-year-old children being 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm shorter than healthy children living in villages with good access to sanitation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This difference in height is irreversible and matters a great deal for a child's cognitive development and future productive potential.

===Review articles===
[[The Lancet]] has published two comprehensive series on maternal and child nutrition, in 2008&lt;ref name=":60"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition (2008).|url=http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-undernutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013.&lt;ref name=":70"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lancet series on maternal and child nutrition (2013).|url=http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series review the epidemiology of global malnutrition and analyze the state of the evidence for cost-effective interventions that should be scaled-up to achieve impact and global targets. In the first of such series,&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; investigators define the importance of the 1000 day and identify child malnutrition as being responsible for one third of all child deaths worldwide. This finding is key in that it points at malnutrition as a key determinant of child mortality that is often overlooked. When a child dies of pneumonia, malaria or diarrhea (some of the causes of child mortality in the world), it may well be that malnutrition is a key contributing factor that prevents the body from successfully fighting the infection and recovering from the disease.&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; In the follow up series in 2013,&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt; the focus on undernutrition is expanded to the increasing burden of obesity in both high, middle and low income countries. Several countries with high levels of child stunting and undernutrition are starting to display worrisome increasing trends of child obesity concurrently, due to increased wealth and the persistence of significant inequalities.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt; The challenges these countries face are particularly difficult as they require intervening on two levels on what has come to be called “double burden of malnutrition”.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt; As an example, in India 30% of children under 5 years of age are stunted, and 20% are overweight. Neglecting these nutritional problems is not an option anymore if countries are to escape poverty traps and provide opportunities to their people to live fulfilling productive lives without stunting.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;

==Examples==
The 2012 [[World Health Assembly]], with its 194 member states, convened to discuss global issues of maternal, infant and young child nutrition, and developed a plan with 6 targets for 2025.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The first of such targets aims to reduce by 40% the number of children who are stunted in the world, by 2025. This would correspond to 100 million stunted children in 2025. At the current reduction rate, the predicted number in 2025 will be 127 million, indicating the need to scale-up and intensify efforts if the global community is to reach its goals.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The World Bank estimates that the extra cost to achieve the reduction goal will be $8.50 yearly per stunted child, for a total of $49.6 Billion for the next decade.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/460861439997767818/Stunting-Costing-and-Financing-Overview-Brief.pdf|title=World Bank Costing Analysis for Stunting Targets (2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stunting has been shown to be one of the most cost-effective global health problems to invest in, with an estimated return on investment of $18 for every dollar spent thanks to its impact on economic productivity.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Despite the evidence in favor of investing in the reduction of stunting, current investments are too low at about $2.9 billion per year, with $1.6 billion coming from Governments, $0.2 billion from donors, and $1.1 paid by individuals.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

=== Sustainable Development Goals ===
In 2015, the United Nations and its member states agreed on a new sustainable development agenda to promote prosperity and reduce poverty, putting forward 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030.&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?page=view&amp;nr=164&amp;type=230&amp;menu=2059|title=United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SDG 2 aims to “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”. Sub-goal 2.2. aims to “by 2030 end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving by 2025 the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons”.

The global community has recognized more and more the critical importance of stunting during the past decade. Investments to address it have increased but remain far from being sufficient to solve it and unleash the human potential that remains trapped in malnutrition.

The "Scaling Up Nutrition Movement (SUN)" movement is the main network of governments, non-governmental and international organizations, donors, private companies and academic institutions working together in pursuit of improved global nutrition and a world without hunger and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/|title=Scaling Up Nutrition Movement website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was launched at the UN General Assembly of 2010 and it calls for country-led multi-sectoral strategies to address child malnutrition by scaling-up evidence-based interventions in both nutrition specific and sensitive areas. As of 2016, 50 countries have joined the SUN Movement with strategies that are aligned with international frameworks of action.&lt;ref name=":50" /&gt;

===Brazil===
Brazil displayed a remarkable reduction in the rates of child stunting under age 5, from 37% in 1974, to 7.1% in 2007.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This happened in association with impressive social and economic development that reduced the numbers of Brazilians living in extreme poverty (less than $1.25 per day) from 25.6% in 1990 to 4.8% in 2008.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The successful reduction in child malnutrition in Brazil can be attributed to strong political commitment that led to improvements in the water and sanitation system, increased female schooling, scale-up of quality maternal and child health services, increased economic power at family level (including successful cash transfer programs), and improvements in food security throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Peru===
After a decade (1995–2005) in which stunting rates stagnated in the country, Peru designed and implemented a national strategy against child malnutrition called crecer ("grow"), which complemented a social development conditional cash-transfer program called juntos, which included a nutritional component.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The strategy was multisectoral in that it involved the health, education, water, sanitation and hygiene, agriculture and housing sectors and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It was led by the Government and the Prime Minister himself, and included non-governmental partners at both central, regional and community level. After the strategy was implemented, stunting went from 22.9% to 17.9% (2005–2010), with very significant improvements in rural areas where it had been more difficult to reduce stunting rates in the past.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===India (Maharashtra)===
The State of Maharashtra in Central-Western India has been able to produce an impressive reduction in stunting rates in children under 2 years of age from 44% to 22.8% in the 2005–2012 period.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is particularly remarkable given the immense challenges India has faced to address malnutrition, and that the country hosts almost half of all stunted children under 5 in the world.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This was achieved through integrated community-based programs that were designed by a central advisory body that promoted multisectoral collaboration, provided advice to policy-makers on evidence-based solutions, and advocated for the key role of the 1000 days (pregnancy and first two years of life).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The '''Sumatran rhinoceros''', also known as the '''hairy rhinoceros''' or '''Asian two-horned rhinoceros''' (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis''), is a rare member of the family [[Rhinocerotidae]] and one of five extant [[rhinoceros]]es. It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of the [[genus]] '''''Dicerorhinus'''''. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands {{convert|112|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.36|-|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|35|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The weight is reported to range from {{convert|500|to|1000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|700|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although there is a single record of a {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.

Members of the species once inhabited [[rainforests]], [[swamp]]s, and [[cloud forest]]s in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. In historical times, they lived in southwest China, particularly in [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Jan (1999) ''The Art of Rhinoceros Horn Carving in China''.

Berkeley and Los Angeles. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; They are now [[critically endangered]], with only five substantial populations in the wild: four on [[Sumatra]] and one on [[Borneo]]. Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100.&lt;ref name=savetherhino&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhino population figures|url=https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/rhino_population_figures|publisher=SaveTheRhino.org|year=2015|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pusparini2015&gt;Pusparini, W.

The Sumatran rhino is a mostly solitary animal except for courtship and offspring-rearing. It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking [[soil]] with its feet, twisting [[sapling]]s into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive [[Javan rhinoceros]], in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in ''ex situ'' breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon to be logged forest.&lt;ref&gt;Nardelli, F. 2014 The last chance for the Sumatran rhinoceros?.

== Taxonomy and naming ==
[[File:Dicerorhinus sumatrensis Bell 1793.jpg|thumb|left|First drawing of the first specimen known to Western science, by William Bell, 1793]]
The first documented Sumatran rhinoceros was shot {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside [[Fort Marlborough]], near the west coast of Sumatra, in 1793. Drawings of the animal, and a written description, were sent to the [[naturalist]] [[Joseph Banks]], then president of the [[Royal Society of London]], who published a paper on the specimen that year.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://archive.org/details/philtrans09059619 | title=Description of the Double Horned Rhinoceros of Sumatra.

The scientific name ''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] terms ''{{lang|grc-Latn|di}}'' ({{lang|grc|δι}}, meaning "two"), ''{{lang|grc-Latn|cero}}'' ({{lang|grc|κέρας}}, meaning "horn"), and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|rhinos}}'' ({{lang|grc|ρινος}}, meaning "[[nose]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell | first=Henry G.|authorlink=Henry Liddell|author2=Scott, Robert |authorlink2=Robert Scott (philologist) |year=1980|title=Greek-English Lexicon|edition=Abridged|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sumatrensis'' signifies "of Sumatra", the Indonesian island where the rhinos were first discovered.&lt;ref name="van Strien"&gt;{{cite book |last=van Strien |first=Nico |editor-last=Fulconis |editor-first=R. |title=Save the rhinos: EAZA Rhino Campaign 2005/6 |date=2005 |chapter=Sumatran rhinoceros |location=London |publisher=[[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] |pages=70–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] originally classified all rhinos in the genus, ''Rhinoceros''; therefore, the species was originally identified as ''Rhinoceros sumatrensis'' or ''sumatranus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=1876 |contribution=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Burmah|Burmah]] |title=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica, ''9th ed.'']] |volume=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Volume IV|Vol. IV]] |p=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Burmah|p. 552]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joshua Brookes]] considered the Sumatran rhinoceros, with its two horns, a distinct genus from the one-horned ''Rhinoceros'', and gave it the name ''Didermocerus'' in 1828. [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] proposed the name ''[[Dicerorhinus]]'' in 1841. In 1868, [[John Edward Gray]] proposed the name ''Ceratorhinus''. Normally, the oldest name would be used, but a 1977 ruling by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] established the proper genus name as ''Dicerorhinus''.&lt;ref name=Taxhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (1977).

Because of morphological similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros is believed to be closely related to the extinct [[woolly rhinoceros]] (''Coelodonta antiquitatis''). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the [[Upper Pleistocene]], it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last [[Ice Age]], but, like the [[woolly mammoth]], most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago.

== Description ==
[[File:SumatranRhino3 CincinnatiZoo.jpg|thumb|left|Sumatran rhinoceros at the Cincinnati Zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio]]
A mature Sumatran rhino stands about {{convert|120|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, has a body length of around {{convert|250|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, and weighs {{convert|500|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt; though the largest individuals in zoos have been known to weigh as much as {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Groves |first1=C.

The larger is the nasal horn, typically only {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, though the longest recorded specimen was much longer at {{convert|81|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt; The posterior horn is much smaller, usually less than {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and often little more than a knob. The larger nasal horn is also known as the anterior horn; the smaller posterior horn is known as the frontal horn.&lt;ref name=Groves1972&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groves |first1=Colin P. |last2=Kurt |first2=Fred |date=1972 |title=Dicerorhinus sumatrensis |journal=[[Mammalian Species]] |issue=21 |publisher=[[American Society of Mammalogists]] |doi=10.2307/3503818 |jstor=3503818 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horns are dark grey or black in color. The males have larger horns than the females, though the species is not otherwise [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. The Sumatran rhino lives an estimated 30–45 years in the wild, while the record time in captivity is a female ''D. lasiotis'', which lived for 32 years and 8 months before dying in the [[London Zoo]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=Groves1972/&gt;

Two thick folds of skin encircle the body behind the front legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, {{convert|10|-|16|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no [[subcutaneous fat]]. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair at the end of its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.&lt;ref name="van Strien"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Groves1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=LitStud&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dicerorhinus sumatrensis (Fischer), the Sumatran or two-horned rhinoceros: a study of literature |url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&amp;act=refs&amp;CODE=ref_detail&amp;id=1165239080 |last=van Strien |first=N.

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Chiang Saen 1867 Francis Garnier expedition.jpg|thumb|A rhinoceros roaming the ruined city of [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]], northern Thailand, in 1867]]
The Sumatran rhinoceros lives in both lowland and highland secondary [[rainforest]], swamps, and [[cloud forest]]s. It inhabits hilly areas close to water, particularly steep upper valleys with copious undergrowth. The Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited a continuous range as far north as [[Burma]], eastern [[India]], and [[Bangladesh]]. Unconfirmed reports also placed it in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]]. All known living animals occur in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the island of [[Sumatra]], and [[Sabah]], [[Borneo]]. Some conservationists hope Sumatran rhinos may still survive in Burma, though it is considered unlikely. Political turmoil in Burma has prevented any assessment or study of possible survivors.&lt;ref name=Foose&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foose |first1=Thomas J. |last2=van Strien |first2=Nico |date=1997 |title=Asian Rhinos – Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |publisher=IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK |isbn=2-8317-0336-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last reports of stray animals from Indian limits were in 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Choudhury |first=A.

The Sumatran rhino is widely scattered across its range, much more so than the other Asian rhinos, which has made it difficult for conservationists to protect members of the species effectively.&lt;ref name=Foose/&gt; Only five areas are known to contain Sumatran rhinoceros: [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]], [[Gunung Leuser National Park]], and [[Way Kambas National Park]] on Sumatra; [[Danum Valley]] in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]], on the island of Borneo, and on Indonesian Borneo west of Samarindah.&lt;ref name="Habitat loss"&gt;{{cite book | author = Dean, Cathy |author2=Tom Foose | year = 2005 | chapter = Habitat loss | pages = 96–98 | editor = Fulconis, R. | title = Save the rhinos: EAZA Rhino Campaign 2005/6 | location = London | publisher = [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kerinci Seblat National Park]], Sumatra's largest, was estimated to contain a population of around 500 rhinos in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120906034525/http://www.sosrhino.com/news/rhinonews121904.php "Rhino population at Indonesian reserve drops by 90 percent in 14 years"].

[[File:Cloud forest mount kinabalu.jpg|left|thumb|A [[cloud forest]] in [[Sabah]], Borneo]]
Genetic analysis of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages.&lt;ref name= Morales/&gt; The [[Strait of Malacca|channel between Sumatra and Malaysia]] was not as significant a barrier for the rhinos as the [[Barisan Mountains]] along the length of Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos on the other side of the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the [[Pleistocene]], when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that [[conservation genetics|conservation geneticists]] have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations.&lt;ref name= Morales/&gt; Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite loci]]. The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.&lt;ref name=Scott04&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=C. |last2=Foose |first2=T. |last3=Morales |first3=J.

Although the rhino had been thought to be extinct in Kalimantan since the 1990s, in March 2013 [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) announced that the team when monitoring [[orangutan]] activity found in [[West Kutai Regency]], [[East Kalimantan]], several fresh rhino foot trails, mud holes, traces of rhino-rubbed trees, traces of rhino horns on the walls of mud holes, and rhino bites on small branches. The team also identified that rhinos ate more than 30 species of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/29/traces-sumatran-rhino-found-kalimantan.html |title=Traces of Sumatran rhino found in Kalimantan |date=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401034748/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/29/traces-sumatran-rhino-found-kalimantan.html |archivedate=1 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2013, video images made with camera traps showing the Sumatran rhino in Kutai Barat, Kalimantan, were released by the World Wildlife Fund.

Sumatran rhinoceroses are solitary creatures except for pairing before [[mating]] and during offspring rearing. Individuals have home ranges; bulls have [[territory (animal)|territories]] as large as {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, whereas females' ranges are {{convert|10|-|15|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="van Strien"/&gt; The ranges of females appear to be spaced apart; males' ranges often overlap. No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting. [[territorial marking|Marking their territories]] is done by scraping soil with their feet, bending saplings into distinctive patterns, and leaving excrement. The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the [[rainy season]], they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range.&lt;ref name="van Strien"/&gt; When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from [[ectoparasite]]s and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, [[suppuration]]s, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80–300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.&lt;ref name=Wallows&gt;{{cite journal| title = Wallows and Wallow Utilization of the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis'') in a Natural Enclosure in Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia | year = 2001 | journal = Journal of Wildlife and Parks | volume = 19 | pages = 7–12 | last = Julia Ng | first = S.C. |author2=Z.

[[File:Sumatran Rhino 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sumatran rhinoceros wallowing]]
There has been little opportunity to study [[epidemiology]] in the Sumatran rhinoceros. [[Tick]]s and [[gyrostigma]] were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt; The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease [[surra]], which can be spread by [[horse-fly|horse-flies]] carrying parasitic [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease.&lt;ref name=Mohamad2006/&gt; The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. [[Tiger]]s and wild [[dog]]s may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, and the frequency of such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with [[Asian Elephant|elephants]] and [[Malayan Tapir|tapirs]], the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (''Elephas maximus'') and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.&lt;ref name="van Strien"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borner/&gt;

The Sumatran rhino maintains trails across its range. These trails fall into two types. Main trails will be used by generations of rhinos to travel between important areas in the rhino's range, such as between [[salt lick]]s, or in [[Wildlife corridor|corridors]] through inhospitable terrain that separates ranges. In feeding areas, the rhinos will make smaller trails, still covered by vegetation, to areas containing food the rhino eats. Sumatran rhino trails have been found that cross rivers deeper than {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The currents of these rivers are known to be strong, but the rhino is a strong swimmer.&lt;ref name=Groves1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt; A relative absence of wallows near rivers in the range of the Sumatran rhinoceros indicates they may occasionally bathe in rivers in lieu of wallowing.&lt;ref name=Borner/&gt;

Most feeding occurs just before nightfall and in the morning.

The largest portion of the diet is tree saplings with a trunk diameter of {{convert|1|–|6|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. The rhinoceros typically pushes these saplings over with its body, walking over the sapling without stepping on it, to eat the leaves. Many of the plant species the rhino consumes exist in only small portions, which indicates the rhino is frequently changing its diet and feeding in different locations.&lt;ref name=Borner/&gt; Among the most common plants the rhino eats are many species from the [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], and [[Melastomataceae]] families. The most common species the rhino consumes is ''[[Eugenia]]''.&lt;ref name=Biotropica/&gt;

The vegetal diet of the Sumatran rhinoceros is high in [[Dietary fiber|fiber]] and only moderate in [[Protein in nutrition|protein]].&lt;ref name=Dierenfeld06&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dierenfeld |first1=E.

The Sumatran rhinoceros is the most vocal of the rhinoceros species.&lt;ref name=Acoustical/&gt; Observations of the species in zoos show the animal almost constantly vocalizing, and it is known to do so in the wild, as well.&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt; The rhino makes three distinct noises: eeps, ''whales'', and whistle-blows. The eep, a short, one-second-long yelp, is the most common sound. The whale, named for its similarity to [[Whale sound|vocalizations]] of the [[humpback whale]], is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives.

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Sumatran rhinoceros four days old.jpg|thumb|right|Mother with four-day-old juvenile]]
Females become sexually mature at the age of six to seven years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The [[gestation period]] is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs {{convert|40|–|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.&lt;ref name="van Strien"/&gt;

The reproductive habits of the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.&lt;ref name=ZZ2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

The period of [[oestrus]] itself, when the female is receptive to the male, lasts about 24 hours, and observations have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days. Rhinos in the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] have been observed copulating for 30–50 minutes, similar in length to other rhinos; observations at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Malaysia have shown a briefer copulation cycle. As the Cincinnati Zoo has had successful pregnancies, and other rhinos also have lengthy copulatory periods, a lengthy rut may be the natural behavior.&lt;ref name=ZZ2005/&gt; Though researchers observed successful conceptions, all these pregnancies ended in failure for a variety of reasons until the first successful captive birth in 2001; studies of these failures at the Cincinnati Zoo discovered the Sumatran rhino's ovulation is induced by mating and it had unpredictable [[progesterone]] levels.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roth |first1=T.

[[Poaching]] of Sumatran rhinoceros is a cause for concern, as the price of its horn has been estimated as high as US$30,000 per kilogram.&lt;ref name=Dinerstein/&gt;{{rp|31}} This species has been overhunted for many centuries, leading to the current greatly reduced&amp;nbsp;– and still declining&amp;nbsp;– population.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The rhinos are difficult to observe and hunt directly (one field researcher spent seven weeks in a treehide near a salt lick without ever observing a rhino directly), so poachers make use of spear traps and pit traps. In the 1970s, uses of the rhinoceros's body parts among the local people of Sumatra were documented, such as the use of rhino horns in [[amulet]]s and a folk belief that the horns offer some protection against poison. Dried rhinoceros meat was used as medicine for [[diarrhea]], [[leprosy]], and [[tuberculosis]]. "Rhino oil", a concoction made from leaving a rhino's skull in [[coconut oil]] for several weeks, may be used to treat skin diseases.

[[File:Sumatran Rhino.jpg|upright|thumb|Adult with juvenile, Cincinnati Zoo]]
The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, which the Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for legal and [[illegal logging]] because of the desirability of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as [[merbau]], [[Shorea|meranti]] and [[Gutta-percha|semaram]] are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ($1,375&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;yd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near many of the same forests as the rhino. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami.&lt;ref name="Habitat loss"/&gt; However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;
Nevertheless, the main cause of drastic reduction of the species is likely caused by the Allee effect.&lt;ref&gt;Payne J. 2016. https://wildtech.mongabay.com/2016/01/reproductive-technology-and-understanding-of-experimental-psychology-needed-to-save-a-critically-endangered-rhino/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumatran rhinoceroses do not thrive outside of their ecosystem. The [[London Zoo]] acquired a male and female in 1872 that had been captured in [[Chittagong]] in 1868. The female named "Begum" survived until 1900, the record lifetime for a captive rhino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lydekker |first=Richard |date=1900 |title=The great and small game of India, Burma, and Tibet |publisher=Asian Educational Services |isbn=978-81-206-1162-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_eQA6LDdpiQC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begum was one of at least seven specimens of the extinct subspecies ''D. s. lasiotis'' that were held in zoos and circuses.&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt; In 1972, Subur, the only Sumatran rhino remaining in captivity, died at the [[Copenhagen Zoo]].&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt;

Despite the species' persistent lack of reproductive success, in the early 1980s, some conservation organizations began a captive-breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros. Between 1984 and 1996, this ''[[ex situ]]'' conservation program transported 40 Sumatran rhinos from their native habitats to zoos and reserves across the world. While hopes were initially high, and much research was conducted on the captive specimens, by the late 1990s, not a single rhino had been born in the program, and most of its proponents agreed the program had been a failure. In 1997, the [[IUCN]]'s Asian rhino specialist group, which once endorsed the program, declared it had failed "even maintaining the species within acceptable limits of mortality", noting that, in addition to the lack of births, 20 of the captured rhinos had died.&lt;ref name=Foose/&gt; In 2004, a [[surra]] outbreak at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre killed all the captive rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia, reducing the population of captive rhinos to eight.&lt;ref name=Mohamad2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohamad |first1=Aidi |last2=Vellayan |first2=S. |last3=Radcliffe |first3=Robin W. |last4=Lowenstine |first4=Linda J. |last5=Epstein |first5=Jon |last6=Reid |first6=Simon A. |last7=Paglia |first7=Donald E. |last8=Radcliffe |first8=Rolfe M. |last9=Roth |first9=Terri L. |last10=Foose |first10=Thomas J. |author11=Mohamad Khan bin Momin Khan |date=2006 |title=Trypanosomiasis (surra) in the captive Sumatran rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis'') in Peninsular Malaysia |journal=Proceedings of the Fourth Rhino Keepers workshop 2005 at Columbus, Ohio |url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/117/1175857689.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strien2001/&gt;

Seven of these captive rhinos were sent to the United States (the other was kept in Southeast Asia), but by 1997, their numbers had dwindled to three: a female in the [[Los Angeles Zoo]], a male in the [[Cincinnati Zoo]], and a female in the [[Bronx Zoo]]. In a final effort, the three rhinos were united in Cincinnati. After years of failed attempts, the female from Los Angeles, Emi, became pregnant for the sixth time, with the zoo's male Ipuh. All five of her previous pregnancies ended in failure. Reproductive physiologist at the Cincinnati Zoo, [[Terri Roth]], had learned from previous failures, though, and with the aid of special hormone treatments, Emi gave birth to a healthy male calf named Andalas (an [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] literary word for Sumatra) in September 2001.&lt;ref name=CincZoo1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cincinnatizoo.org/Conservation/GlobalConservation/SumatranRhino/BirthAnnouncement/Legacy/legacy.html | title = Andalas – A Living Legacy | work = [[Cincinnati Zoo]] | accessdate = 4 November 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117233421/http://www.cincinnatizoo.org/Conservation/GlobalConservation/SumatranRhino/BirthAnnouncement/Legacy/legacy.html |archivedate = 17 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andalas's birth was the first successful captive birth of a Sumatran rhino in 112 years.

Despite the recent successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has remained controversial. Proponents argue that the zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group.&lt;ref&gt;Nardelli F. 2016.

Aside from those few individuals kept in zoos and pictured in books, the Sumatran rhinoceros has remained little known, overshadowed by the more common Indian, black and white rhinos. Recently, however, video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries. Extensive footage can be found in an Asia Geographic documentary ''The Littlest Rhino''. [[Natural History New Zealand]] showed footage of a Sumatran rhino, shot by freelance Indonesian-based cameraman Alain Compost, in the 2001 documentary ''The Forgotten Rhino'', which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos.&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web |title=The Littlest Rhino |work=Asia Geographic |url=http://www.asiageographic.com/html/lilrhino.htm |accessdate=6 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009210441/http://www.asiageographic.com/html/lilrhino.htm |archivedate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Forgotten Rhino |work=[[NHNZ]] |url=http://www.nhnz.tv/cat/forgottenrhino.html |accessdate=6 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001224056/http://www.nhnz.tv/cat/forgottenrhino.html |archivedate=1 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they were documented by droppings and tracks, pictures of the Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in [[Malaysian Borneo]].&lt;ref name=NST7-2&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New Straits Times]] (Malaysia) | date = 2 July 2006 | title = Rhinos alive and well in the final frontier }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2007, it was announced that cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, peering through jungle foliage, and sniffing the film equipment.

A number of folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were collected by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.&lt;ref name=LitStud/&gt;

'''''The Face of Love''''' is a 2013 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[Romance film|romantic]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Arie Posin]] and co-written by Matthew McDuffie. The film stars [[Annette Bening]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Amy Brenneman]], [[Jess Weixler]] and [[Linda Park]]. It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="TIFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/festival/2013/faceoflove |title=The Face of Love |accessdate=2013-08-15 |work=TIFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Plot==
Nikki ([[Annette Bening|Bening]]) is a recent widow whose husband, Garret ([[Ed Harris]]), died in a drowning accident and who has not yet gotten over it. Objects, people and situations that remind Nikki of the love of her life still haunt her. Resigned to life alone, Nikki visits an art gallery she often frequented with Garret and sees a man ([[Ed Harris|Harris in a dual role]]) whose resemblance to her husband stuns her.  She returns to the gallery several more times, hoping to see him.  Eventually, Nikki identifies him as a professor at a small local college.  She finds "Tom" on the internet and visits an art class he is teaching; but she is emotionally overwhelmed and flees.  Eventually, Nikki calms down and invites Tom to give her private, at home,  tutoring in painting.  She doesn't disclose to him his physical resemblance to her late husband.

Nikki and Tom become lovers, to the emotional distress of her neighbor ([[Robin Williams]]), who has hoped to attract her interest romantically since the death of Garret, his friend.  The strain of keeping Tom a secret from her friends and family, who would immediately recognize the uncanny resemblance, begins to wear on Nikki, Tom, and the relationship.  Nikki is not alone in keeping secrets in the relationship.  Tom, who is divorced for 10 years from his ex-wife yet still maintains a close friendship with her, does not tell Nikki he suffers from a severe heart ailment.   When Nikki’s adult daughter Summer visits unexpectedly, finding Tom at the house, she flies into a rage repulsed by Tom’s appearance.  Tom believes her outrage is triggered simply by his presence.   
Tom, puzzled by the daughter's reaction, accepts when Nikki asks him to fly off to Mexico with her. At a resort often visited by Garret and Nikki when they were married, Tom discovers a photo of Nikki and her husband by the bar, notices the resemblance and also realizes that a psychologically imbalanced Nikki has brought him to the very place her husband died.  Tom confronts her with the resemblance and Nikki runs off into the raging surf, perhaps to commit suicide.  She is rescued by Tom and they later hold one another in bed with the knowledge the relationship isn't based in anything more than his physical similarities to Garret and is doomed.

A year later, Summer finds an art gallery card in Nikki's mail that turns out to be an invitation to a memorial display of Tom's art.  Tom has died of his heart condition but produced an outpouring of art in his last year.  Nikki attends the reception hosted by Tom's ex-wife and tearfully sees Tom's painting of the two of them titled "The Face of Love".

'''Thulsa Doom''' is a [[fictional character]] first appearing in the [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] short story "Delcardes' Cat" by [[Robert E. Howard]].  He has since appeared in comic books and film as the nemesis of Kull and, later, one of Howard's other creations, [[Conan the Barbarian]]. Thulsa Doom is the prototype for many of the future undead evil wizards, such as Tsotha-Lanti (in the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] saga) and Kathulos (in the Skull Face novelette); other living or revenant Howardian practitioners of magic such as [[Thoth-Amon|Thoth Amon]], [[Thugra Khotan]], [[Skull-Face|Kathulos]] and [[Xaltotun]] bear some psychological similitudes to Thulsa Doom even if their outward appearance is vastly different.

==In pulp magazines==
Thulsa Doom first appeared (as Thulses Doom) at the end of the short story "[[Delcardes' Cat]]" by [[Robert E. Howard]], which featured the character [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] as the [[protagonist]].  Howard later edited the text to include foreshadowing and references to Thulsa Doom (as he had been rechristened) throughout the story and changed the title to ''The Cat and the Skull'' to reflect this. Editor Patrice Louinet speculated that this was because Howard had originally intended Kuthulos (whom Doom impersonates in the story) to be the actual villain before coming up with Thulsa Doom near the story's completion.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Robert E., 2006 "Kull - Exile of Atlantis" pp 298&lt;/ref&gt; This version was submitted to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rehupa.com/?page_id=170 |title=Robert E. Howard Fiction and Verse Timeline |accessdate=11 November 2008 |work=REHupa |last=Burke |first=Rusty }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not accepted.  The story did not see print until 1967 in the [[paperback]] ''King Kull'' published by [[Lancer Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howardworks.com/storyd.htm#delc |title=Delcardes' Cat |accessdate=11 November 2008 |work=HowardWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thulsa Doom is described by Howard in "The Cat and the Skull" as having face "like a bare white skull, in whose eye sockets flamed livid fire."  He is seemingly invulnerable, boasting after being run through by one of Kull's comrades that he feels "only a slight coldness" when being injured and will only "pass to some other sphere when [his] time comes."&lt;ref&gt;See Howard, Robert E., 2006 "Kull - Exile of Atlantis" pp 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

As Thulsa Doom's original story was not published in Howard's lifetime he reused the character, as "Kathulos of Atlantis", in his 1929 story [[Skull-Face]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Robert E., 2006 "Kull - Exile of Atlantis" pp 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==In comic books==
&lt;!-- [[Thulsa Doom (comics)]] redirects here --&gt;
A powerful [[necromancer]], Thulsa Doom is primary foe of Kull's comics version.&lt;ref&gt;''Monsters on the Prowl'' #16 (Marvel Comics, April 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; He was often a featured foe in the Marvel Kull comics (for instance, ''Kull the Conqueror'' #3 and #7). Thulsa Doom returns in ''Kull the Conqueror'' #11, "By This Axe I Rule", based on an original story by Robert E. Howard. Posing as the nobleman Ardyon, he forms an alliance with four rebels within Valusia: the dwarfish Ducalon, the soldier Enaros, Baron Kanuub, and the minstrel Ridondo, who actually dethroned the hero, and set him on a quest to regain his lost kingdom, in the pages of his own comic, until it gets cancelled. Kull resumes his quest in the pages of ''Kull and the Barbarians'', a black-and-white Marvel magazine format (published under the [[Curtis Magazines]] imprint). Thulsa Doom sent members of the Black Legion to ambush Kull and Brule, though they won the fight. Thulsa observed the battle through a magic crystal. Kull and Brule's ship was later attacked by a sea serpent, with which Thulsa may or may not have had anything to do.&lt;ref&gt;''Kull and the Barbarians'' #2 (Curtis Magazines, July 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kull and the Barbarians'' lasted three issues until it was cancelled. In the return of ''Kull the Destroyer'',&lt;ref&gt;''Kull the Destroyer'' #29 (Marvel Comics, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Thulsa Doom/Ardyon learned of the curse of Torranna (essentially, if a scarred man wore the crown and sat the throne, he'd be unable to ever leave the throne), which he determined to bestow upon Kull. To this end, he took on the aspect of the god of Torranna and advised its inhabitants how best to bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;''Kull the Destroyer'' #22-27 (Marvel, 1977&amp;ndash;1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Thulsa Doom manipulated Garn-Nak, Karr-Lo-Zann, and Norra of Torranna. They drew Kull into Torranna and had him undergo a series of trials to gain the crown of Torranna. Kull sought the crown because he believed he could use the army of Torranna to help him retake the crown of Valusia from Thulsa Doom.

In ''Kull the Destroyer'' #28, Kull successfully completed the last of the trials, but before he could don the crown, Norra warned him of the curse of Torranna. Thulsa Doom allowed Norra's age to catch up with her, turning her into a shriveled corpse, and then revealed himself to Kull, challenging him to one final battle. In the next issue (also the final issue of the ''Kull the destroyer'' title), Thulsa Doom pulled Kull into a pocket dimension for their final battle. Kull managed to slash Thulsa Doom's face with his sword, but ultimately was overpowered by the necromancer. Thulsa Doom returned them both to Torranna, but Kull rallied long enough to push Thulsa Doom onto the throne and place the crown on his head. His face scarred by Kull, Thulsa fulfilled the prophecy and fell victim to the curse himself. Thulsa's power drained by the curse, the city of Torranna collapsed, seemingly crushing him. Kull, luckily, escaped, and then returned to Valusia to retake his own throne.

He would face Thulsa Doom at least one more time, in the pages of ''Marvel Preview #19'' (summer 1979 issue). The script for that issue was an adaptation of the prose tale "Riders beyond the sunrise", itself the completion by writer [[Lin Carter]] of an untitled fragment written by R. E. Howard. Thulsa Doom appears to finally perish at the climax of this story, but he would eventually return as a Conan villain in the pages of ''[[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan]]'' and a few issues of Conan's black-and-white magazine, ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' (issues #190-193).  He is apparently immortal and is visualized as a skull-headed sorcerer, or as an albino when taking on the illusory appearance of a living man.  A similar concept of an undead sorcerer can also be found in the [[lich]] from ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and other works of fantasy fiction, such as ''[[The Sword and the Sorcerer]]''.

American company [[Dynamite Entertainment]] published a ''Thulsa Doom'' mini-series written by [[Arvid Nelson]], with art by Lui Antonio, for a total of four issues in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=25086 |title=Series page at comicbookdb|accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Against Cormac mac Art==
Thulsa Doom later becomes an enemy of the [[Celt]]ic hero [[Tigers of the Sea|Cormac mac Art]], another Howard character further expanded by [[Andrew J. Offutt]].

Set in the time of [[King Arthur]] (though Arthur himself does not appear onstage) Thulsa Doom comes back to life after 18,000 years on a sinister deserted island. Recognizing Cormac mac Art - an Irish adventurer who joined a band of Danish Vikings - as a reincarnation of his old enemy [[King Kull]], Thulsa Doom immediately resumes his old vendetta and relentlessly seeks to kill mac Art.

As depicted by Offutt, Thulsa Doom possess remarkable [[shape-changing]] powers, being able to take not only the form but also the precise mannerisms of  Cormac mac Art's close friends. This includes also a perfect [[sex change]] ability. On one occasion Thulsa Doom is able to perfectly imitate Cormac mac Art's girlfriend, speak convincing words of love to a man who knows her well and is in love with her, and engage in full-fledged sex - with the intention of taking Mac Art by surprise and suddenly drawing steel. However, at the moment of attack Thulsa Doom show his true skull face, enabling Mac Art to realize the deception and save himself at the last moment.

Thulsa Doom is also seen as controlling the elements and being able to call up a storm out of a calm sea.

While Thulsa Doom cannot be killed - even when pierced by a sword or thrown from a great height - he is vulnerable to steel being driven through his body, such steel acting to imprison him and prevent him from getting away.

==Skull-Face==
Howard's 1929 novella ''[[Skull-Face]]'' features a resuscitated [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] necromancer appearing in the present-day world and seeking to take it over. This villain is very similar to Thulsa Doom, but is named "Kathulos of Atlantis".

==In films==
[[Image:Conan6.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[James Earl Jones]] as Thulsa Doom in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.]]
A character of the same name is the main [[antagonist]] in the 1982 movie ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Played by [[James Earl Jones]], the cinematic Thulsa Doom is considerably different from the literary one, who is described as having a skull-like face. Pre-production drawings showed this version of Thulsa Doom with the skull-like face, but as filmed, he is essentially the classic Conan villain [[Thoth-Amon]], servant of the serpent-god [[Set (serpent god)|Set]]. As such, he appears as an ordinary human in the film, though one said to have lived for a thousand years and with the power to transform into an enormous snake.

In July 2008, [[Dynamite Entertainment]] announced that [[Djimon Hounsou]] signed to co-produce and star as Thulsa Doom in a film version based on the comic books, rather than Robert E. Howard's original incarnation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brady|first1=Matt|title=Djimon Hounsou To Star, Produce Thulsa Doom Film|url=http://www.newsarama.com/480-djimon-hounsou-to-star-produce-thulsa-doom-film.html|website=Newsarama.com|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the film has not been made yet.

'''Walter Tyeson''' "'''Tye'''" '''Fields''' (born February 8, 1975) is an American former [[professional boxer]] who held the [[International Boxing Federation|USBA]] [[heavyweight]] title.

==Boxing career==
Tye Fields grew up in [[Beaverton, Oregon]]. Fields played college basketball and was a starter at forward for [[San Diego State University]]. Fields never was an amateur. Standing at 6 feet and 8&amp;nbsp;inches and weighing around 275&amp;nbsp;lbs (125&amp;nbsp;kg), the [[southpaw]] Fields was considered large even for the heavyweight division.

In his professional career he has beaten some notable opponents such as Andy Sample, [[Saul Montana]], [[Bruce Seldon]], Sedreck Fields, [[Sherman Williams (boxer)|Sherman Williams]], [[Maurice Harris]], [[Konstantin Airich]], [[Raphael Butler]] and [[Michael Sprott]]. He started his career with a streak of 17 consecutive KO victories (16 of them coming in the first round) before he suffered his first loss to Jeff Ford via a 1st-round KO. He would later avenge this defeat by knocking out Ford in a rematch, also in the 1st round. In total Fields has 26 first-round knockouts among his 49 professional victories. He has won 4 regional titles.

On June 28, 2008, Fields faced off against [[Monte Barrett]] on the [[Manny Pacquiao]] – [[David Díaz (boxer)|David Díaz]] undercard at the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino|Mandalay Bay]] in Las Vegas. Fields suffered the second defeat of his career losing via knockout after just 57 seconds of the first round when Barrett (34-6, 20 KOs) delivered a series of accurate right hands, knocking Fields down and leaving him unable to beat the referee's count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3465748|title=Luevano retains crown with split draw; DQ costs Soto|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondsout.com/USA/news.cfm?ccs=229&amp;cs=25788|title=Luevano Held To Draw, Soto Shock, Barrett Wins|work=SecondsOut Boxing News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat to Barrett Fields rebounded with 4 straight KO victories over lowly regarded opposition before taking another step up and challenging former heavyweight title challenger [[Michael Grant (boxer)|Michael Grant]]. The fight took place on March 11, 2011 at the [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. As with his previous step up in opposition Fields came up short when he was knocked out with a single punch from Grant in the third round.

Fields took part in the [[Prizefighter series|Prizefighter]] 'International heavyweights' tournament held at [[Alexandra Palace]] in London on 7 May 2011. After winning his opening 2 bouts against [[Michael Sprott]] and [[Konstantin Airich]] he matched up against the undefeated former Cuban amateur star [[Ismaikel Pérez|Mike Pérez]]. Perez won the tournament and the £32,00 prize money when he knocked Fields out in the first round.

On October 7, 2011, Fields defeated a strong puncher [[Raphael Butler]] (35-10, 28 KOs) from [[Minnesota]] in the 6th round via technical knockout in 10-round main event on KO Boxing's Show of Force card at the [[Shaw Conference Centre]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada.

On March 24, 2012, Fields faced the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] International titleholder, #8 [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] ranked undefeated [[Mariusz Wach]] (26-0, 14 KO) from Poland. The fight was set at the [[Resorts Casino Hotel|Resorts Hotel &amp; Casino]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] and got coverage form [[ESPN]]'s [[Friday Night Fights]]. Fields lost by TKO in the 6th round. After that loss Fields retired from boxing.

'''Yaguine Koïta''' (born September 25, 1984) and '''Fodé Tounkara''' (born April 6, 1985) were [[stowaway]]s who froze to death on a [[Sabena|Sabena Airlines]] [[Airbus A330]] (Flight 520) flying from [[Conakry]], Guinea, to [[Brussels]], Belgium, on July 28, 1999.  Their bodies were discovered on August 2 in the airplane's rear right-hand wheel bay at [[Brussels Airport|Brussels International Airport]], after having made at least three return trips between Conakry and Brussels.  The boys were carrying plastic bags with birth certificates, school report cards, family photographs and a letter.  This letter, written in imperfect French, was widely published in the world media. Several associations commemorate each year Yaguine et Fodé on August 2nd at Brussels Airport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtl.be/info/belgique/societe/ceremonie-d-hommage-pour-le-dixieme-anniversaire-de-la-mort-de-yaguine-et-fode-121663.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Their story was made into a film - ''[[Early in the Morning (film)|Early in the Morning]]'' ({{lang-fr|Un matin bonne heure}}) in 2006.&lt;ref name="fipresci"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fipresci.org/festivals/archive/2006/rotterdam/rdam_almeida.htm |title=Rotterdam 2006 |accessdate=2013-07-15 |work=FIPRESCI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotterdam"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/films/un-matin-bonne-heure/ |title=Un matin bonne heure |accessdate=2013-07-15 |work=Rotterdam Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translation of the letter==
Excellencies, Messrs. members and officials of Europe,

We have the honorable pleasure and the great confidence in you to write this letter to speak to you about the objective of our journey and the suffering of us, the children and young people of Africa.

But first of all, we present to you life's most delicious, charming and respected greetings.  To this effect, be our support and our assistance.  You are for us, in Africa, those to whom it is necessary to request relief.  We implore you, for the love of your continent, for the feeling that you have towards your people and especially for the affinity and love that you have for your children whom you love for a lifetime.  Furthermore, for the love and meekness of our creator God the omnipotent one who gave you all the good experiences, wealth and ability to well construct and well organize your continent to become the most beautiful one and most admirable among the others.

Messrs. members and officials of Europe, we call out for your solidarity and your kindness for the relief of Africa.  Do help us, we suffer enormously in Africa, we have problems and some shortcomings regarding the rights of the child.

In terms of problems, we have war, disease, malnutrition, etc.  As for the rights of the child in Africa, and especially in [[Guinea]], we have too many schools but a great lack of education and training.  Only in the private schools can one have a good education and good training, but it takes a great sum of money.  Now, our parents are poor and it is necessary for them to feed us.  Furthermore, we have no sports schools where we could practice soccer, basketball or tennis.

This is the reason, we, African children and youth, ask you to create a big efficient organization for Africa to allow us to progress.

Therefore, if you see that we have sacrificed ourselves and risked our lives, this is because we suffer too much in Africa and that we need you to fight against poverty and to put an end to the war in Africa.  Nevertheless, we want to learn, and we ask you to help us in Africa learn to be like you.

Finally, we appeal to you to excuse us very, very much for daring to write this letter to you, the great personages to whom we owe much respect.  And do not forget it is to you whom we must lament about the weakness of our abilities in Africa.

Written by two Guinean children, Yaguine Koita and Fodé Tounkara.

==Original French text==
Excellences, Messieurs les membres et responsables d'Europe,

Nous avons l'honorable plaisir et la grande confiance de vous écrire cette lettre pour vous parler de l'objectif de notre voyage et de la souffrance de nous, les enfants et jeunes d'Afrique.

Mais tout d'abord, nous vous présentons les salutations les plus délicieuses, adorables et respectées dans la vie. A cet effet, soyez notre appui et notre aide. Vous êtes pour nous, en Afrique, ceux à qui il faut demander au secours. Nous vous en supplions, pour l'amour de votre continent, pour le sentiment que vous avez envers votre peuple et surtout pour l'affinité et l'amour que vous avez pour vos enfants que vous aimez pour la vie. En plus, pour l'amour et la timidité de notre créateur Dieu le tout-puissant qui vous a donné toutes les bonnes expériences, richesses et pouvoirs de bien construire et bien organiser votre continent à devenir le plus beau et admirable parmi les autres.

Messieurs les membres et responsables d'Europe, c'est de votre solidarité et votre gentillesse que nous vous crions au secours en Afrique. Aidez-nous, nous souffrons énormément en Afrique, nous avons des problèmes et quelques manques au niveau des droits de l'enfant.

Au niveau des problèmes, nous avons la guerre, la maladie, le manque de nourriture, etc. Quant aux droits de l'enfant, c'est en Afrique, et surtout en Guinée nous avons trop d'écoles mais un grand manque d'éducation et d'enseignement. Sauf dans les écoles privées où l'on peut avoir une bonne éducation et un bon enseignement, mais il faut une forte somme d'argent. Or, nos parents sont pauvres et il leur faut nous nourrir. Ensuite, nous n'avons pas non plus d'écoles sportives où nous pourrions pratiquer le football, le basket ou le tennis.

C'est pourquoi, nous, les enfants et jeunes Africains, vous demandons de faire une grande organisation efficace pour l'Afrique pour nous permettre de progresser.

Donc, si vous voyez que nous nous sacrifions et exposons notre vie, c'est parce qu'on souffre trop en Afrique et qu'on a besoin de vous pour lutter contre la pauvreté et pour mettre fin à la guerre en Afrique. Néanmoins, nous voulons étudier, et nous vous demandons de nous aider à étudier pour être comme vous en Afrique.

Enfin, nous vous supplions de nous excuser très très fort d'oser vous écrire cette lettre en tant que Vous, les grands personages à qui nous devons beaucoup de respect. Et n'oubliez pas que c'est à vous que nous devons nous plaindre de la faiblesse de notre force en Afrique.

Ecrit par deux enfants guinéens, Yaguine Koita et Fodé Tounkara.
