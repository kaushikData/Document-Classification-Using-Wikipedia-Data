'''Albert von Kölliker''' (born ''Rudolf Albert Kölliker;'' 6 July 1817{{snd}}2 November 1905) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[anatomist]], [[physiologist]], and [[Histology|histologist]].

==Biography==
Albert Kölliker was born in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].  His early education was carried on in Zurich, and he entered the university there in 1836. After two years, however, he moved to the [[University of Bonn]], and later to that of [[Berlin]], becoming a pupil of noted physiologists [[Johannes Peter Müller]] and of [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle]]. He graduated in [[philosophy]] at Zurich in 1841, and in medicine at [[Heidelberg]] in 1842. The first academic post which he held was that of [[prosector]] of [[anatomy]] under Henle, but his tenure of this office was brief{{snd}}in 1844 he returned to Zurich University to occupy a chair as professor extraordinary of [[physiology]] and [[comparative anatomy]]. His stay here was also brief; in 1847 the [[University of Würzburg]], attracted by his rising fame, offered him the post of professor of physiology and of microscopical and comparative anatomy. He accepted the appointment, and at Würzburg he remained thenceforth, refusing all offers tempting him to leave the quiet academic life of the [[Bavaria]]n town, where he died.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=889}}

At Zurich, and afterwards at Würzburg, the title of the chair which Kölliker held laid upon him the duty of teaching comparative anatomy. Many of the numerous memoirs which he published, (including the very first paper he wrote) and which appeared in 1841, before he graduated, were on the structure of animals of the most varied kinds. Notable among these were his papers on the ''[[Medusae]]'' and allied creatures. His activity in this direction led him to make [[zoology|zoological]] excursions to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the coasts of [[Scotland]], as well as to undertake, conjointly with his friend [[Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold]], the editorship of the ''Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Zoologie'', which, founded in 1848, continued under his hands to be one of the most important zoological periodicals.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

His hand was one of the first to be x-rayed, by his friend [[Wilhelm Roentgen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/rontgen-wilhelm-conrad-ueber-eine-neue-5084328-details.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Kölliker made contributions to the study of [[zoology]]. His earlier efforts were directed to the [[invertebrates]], and his memoir on the development of [[cephalopod]]s (which appeared in 1844) is considered a classical work.  He soon passed on to the [[vertebrates]], and studied the [[amphibia]]ns and [[mammal]]ian [[embryo]]s. He was among the first, if not the very first, to introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer [[microscopy|microscopic technique]] – the methods of hardening, sectioning and [[staining (biology)|staining]]. By doing so, not only was he enabled to make rapid progress himself, but he also placed in the hands of others the means of a similar advancement. The remarkable strides forward which [[embryology]] made during the middle and latter half of the 19th century will always be associated with his name. His ''Lectures on Development'', published in 1861, at once became a standard work.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

But neither zoology nor embryology furnished Kölliker's chief claim to fame. If he did much for these branches of science, he did still more for [[histology]], the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal [[Biological tissue|tissues]]. Among his earlier results was the demonstration in 1847 that [[smooth muscle|smooth]] or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of nucleated muscle cells. In this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master Henle. A few years before this, there was doubt whether [[arteries]] had muscle in their walls – in addition, no solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the [[nervous system]] on the [[circulatory system|circulation]], which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on the progress of physiology.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

Kölliker's contributions to histology were widespread; [[smooth muscle]], [[striated muscle]], [[skin]], [[bone]], [[teeth]], [[blood vessel]]s and [[viscera]] were all investigated by Kölliker, and he touched none of them without discovering new truths. The results at which he arrived were recorded partly in separate memoirs, partly in his great textbook on microscopical anatomy, which first saw the light in 1850, and by which he advanced histology no less than by his own researches.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

[[Albert L. Lehninger]] asserted that Kölliker was among the first to notice the arrangement of granules in the [[sarcoplasm]] of striated muscle over a period of years beginning around 1850. These granules were later called sarcosomes by [[Gustaf Retzius|Retzius]] in 1890. These sarcosomes have come to be known as the [[mitochondria]]-the power houses of the cell. In the words of Lehninger, "Kölliker should also be credited with the first separation of mitochondria from cell structure. In 1888 he teased these granules from insect muscle, in which they are very profuse, found them to swell in water, and showed them to possess a [[Inner nuclear membrane|membrane]]."{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the case of almost every tissue, our present knowledge contains information first discovered by Kölliker – it is for his work on the [[nervous system]] that his name is most remembered. As early as 1845, while still at Zurich, he supplied the clear proof that [[nerve fiber]]s are continuous with [[nerve cells]], and so furnished the absolutely necessary basis for all sound speculations as to the actions of the [[central nervous system]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

From that time onward he continually laboured at the histology of the nervous system, and more especially at the difficult problems presented by the intricate patterns in which [[nerve fiber]]s and [[neuron]]s are woven together in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].  From his early days a master of method, he saw at a glance the value of the new [[Golgi's method|Golgi staining method]] for the investigation of the central nervous system, and, to the great benefit of science, took up once more in his old age, with the aid of a new means, the studies for which he had done so much in his youth. Kölliker contributed greatly to knowledge of the inner structure of the [[brain]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/handbuchdergeweb02kl ''Handbuch der Gewebelehre des Menschen'', t. 2, Leipzig, 1896.] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

Kölliker was ennobled by [[Prince Regent]] [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold of Bavaria]] in 1897 and thus permitted to add the predicate "[[von]]" to his surname.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} He was made a member of the learned societies of many countries; in [[England]], which he visited more than once, and where he became well known, the [[Royal Society]] made him a fellow in 1860, and in 1897 gave him its highest token of esteem, the [[Copley medal]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

==Heterogenesis==
{{further|Saltationism}}

In 1864 Kölliker revived [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]'s theory that [[evolution]] proceeds by large steps ([[saltationism]]), under the name of heterogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Sewall Wright |first=Sewall |last=Wright |year=1984 |title=Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations |volume=1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=10 |isbn=0226910490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kölliker was a critic of [[Darwinism]] and rejected a [[universal common ancestor]], instead he supported a theory of [[common descent]] along separate lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mario A. |last=Di Gregorio |year=2005 |title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |page=303 |isbn=3525569726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexander Vucinich]] the non-Darwinian evolution theory of Kölliker tied "organic transformism to three general ideas, all contrary to Darwin's view: the multiple origin of living forms, the internal causes of variation, and "sudden leaps" (heterogenesis) in the evolutionary process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Vucinich |year=1988 |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |publisher=University of California Press |page=137 |isbn=0520062833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kölliker claimed that heterogenesis functioned according to a general law of evolutionary progress, [[orthogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Thomas F.

[[File:Impact event.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Artist's impression of a major impact event. The collision between Earth and an asteroid a few kilometres in diameter would release as much energy as the simultaneous detonation of several million nuclear weapons.]]

'''Asteroid impact avoidance''' comprises a number of methods by which [[near-Earth object]]s (NEO) could be diverted, preventing destructive [[impact event]]s.  A sufficiently large impact by an [[asteroid]] or other NEOs would cause, depending on its impact location, massive [[tsunamis]], multiple [[firestorm]]s and an [[impact winter]] caused by the sunlight-blocking effect of placing large quantities of pulverized rock dust, and other debris, into the [[stratosphere]].

A collision between the Earth and an approximately {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=off}}-wide object 66 million years ago is thought to have produced the [[Chicxulub crater]] and the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], widely held responsible for the extinction of most [[dinosaur]]s.

While the chances of a major collision are low in the near term, there is a high probability that one will happen eventually unless defensive actions are taken. Recent astronomical events—such as the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on Jupiter]] and the [[Chelyabinsk meteor|2013 Chelyabinsk meteor]], along with the growing number of objects on the [[Sentry Risk Table]]—have drawn renewed attention to such threats. [[NASA]] warns that the Earth is unprepared for such an event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/13/space-asteroid-comet-nasa-rocket Earth woefully unprepared for surprise comet or asteroid, Nasa scientist warns] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deflection efforts ==
[[File:Asteroids-KnownNearEarthObjects-Animation-UpTo20180101.gif|thumb|center|600px|&lt;center&gt;Known [[Near-Earth objects]] – as of January 2018&lt;br&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfvo-Ujb_qk Video (0:55; July 23, 2018)]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Most deflection efforts for a large object require from a year to decades of warning, allowing time to prepare and carry out a collision avoidance project, as no known planetary defense hardware has yet been developed. It has been estimated that a velocity change of just {{nowrap|3.5/t &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; m·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (where t is the number of years until potential impact) is needed to successfully deflect a body on a direct collision trajectory.

It was then determined that a deflection from this potential return trajectory, several years before the swing-by, could be achieved with a velocity change on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Edward T. and Stanley G.

An impact by a {{convert|10|km}} asteroid on the Earth has historically caused an [[extinction-level event]] due to catastrophic damage to the [[biosphere]]. There is also the threat from [[comet]]s entering the inner Solar System. The impact speed of a long-period comet would likely be several times greater than that of a [[near-Earth asteroid]], making its impact much more destructive; in addition, the warning time is unlikely to be more than a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nss.org/resources/library/planetarydefense/2000-ReportOfTheTaskForceOnPotentiallyHazardousNearEarthObjects-UK.pdf | title=Report of the Task Force on potentially hazardous Near Earth Objects | publisher=British National Space Center |accessdate=2008-10-21}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Impacts from objects as small as {{convert|50|m}} in diameter, which are far more common, are historically extremely destructive regionally (see [[Barringer crater]]).

Finding out the material composition of the object is also helpful before deciding which strategy is appropriate. Missions like the 2005 ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' probe have provided valuable information on what to expect.

=== History of government mandates ===

The 1992 NASA-sponsored Near-Earth-Object Interception Workshop hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory evaluated issues involved in intercepting celestial objects that could hit Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canavan|first=G. H.|last2=Solem|first2=J. C.|last3=Rather|first3=D.

This survey was expected to discover 90% of these objects larger than one kilometer within 25 years. Three years later, another NASA report&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, E.M., 1995, ''Report of the Near-Earth Objects Survey Working Group'', NASA Office of Space Science, Solar System Exploration Office&lt;/ref&gt; recommended search surveys that would discover 60–70% of short-period, near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer within ten years and obtain 90% completeness within five more years.

In 1998, NASA formally embraced the goal of finding and cataloging, by 2008, 90% of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) with diameters of 1&amp;nbsp;km or larger that could represent a collision risk to Earth. The 1&amp;nbsp;km diameter metric was chosen after considerable study indicated that an impact of an object smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;km could cause significant local or regional damage but is unlikely to cause a worldwide catastrophe.&lt;ref name="morrison_1992"/&gt; The impact of an object much larger than 1&amp;nbsp;km diameter could well result in worldwide damage up to, and potentially including, [[Human extinction|extinction of the human species]]. The NASA commitment has resulted in the funding of a number of NEO search efforts, which made considerable progress toward the 90% goal by 2008.  However the 2009 discovery of several NEOs approximately 2 to 3 kilometers in diameter (e.g. {{mp|2009 CR|2}}, {{mp|2009 HC|82}}, {{mp|2009 KJ}}, {{mp|2009 MS}} and {{mp|2009 OG}}) demonstrated there were still large objects to be detected.

United States Representative [[George Brown, Jr.|George E. Brown, Jr.]] (D-CA) was quoted as voicing his support for planetary defense projects in ''Air &amp; Space Power Chronicles'', saying "If some day in the future we discover well in advance that an asteroid that is big enough to cause a mass extinction is going to hit the Earth, and then we alter the course of that asteroid so that it does not hit us, it will be one of the most important accomplishments in all of human history."

Because of Congressman Brown's long-standing commitment to planetary defense, a U.S. House of Representatives' bill, H.R. 1022, was named in his honor: The George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act. This bill "to provide for a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize certain near-Earth asteroids and comets" was introduced in March 2005 by Rep. [[Dana Rohrabacher]] (R-CA).&lt;ref&gt;[[National Academy of Sciences]]. 2010.Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies: Final Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The U.S. Congress has declared that the general welfare and security of the United States require that the unique competence of NASA be directed to detecting, tracking, cataloguing, and characterizing near-Earth asteroids and comets in order to provide warning and mitigation of the potential hazard of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. The NASA Administrator shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near- Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90% completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act. The NASA Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act an initial report that provides the following: (A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions. (B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option. (C) Analysis of possible alternatives that NASA could employ to divert an object on a likely collision course with Earth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The result of this directive was a report presented to Congress in early March 2007. This was an [[Analysis of Alternatives]] (AoA) study led by NASA's Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&amp;E) office with support from outside consultants, the Aerospace Corporation, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), and SAIC (amongst others).

The [[Minor Planet Center]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] has been cataloging the orbits of asteroids and comets since 1947. It has recently been joined by surveys which specialize in locating the [[near-Earth object]]s (NEO), many (as of early 2007) funded by NASA's Near Earth Object program office as part of their Spaceguard program. One of the best-known is [[LINEAR]] that began in 1996. By 2004 LINEAR was discovering tens of thousands of objects each year and accounting for 65% of all new asteroid detections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first = Stokes, G.|last = Stokes|author2 = J.

[[Spacewatch]], which uses a 90 centimeter telescope sited at the [[Kitt Peak Observatory]] in Arizona, updated with automatic pointing, imaging, and analysis equipment to search the skies for intruders, was set up in 1980 by [[Tom Gehrels]] and [[Robert S. McMillan (astronomer)|Robert S. McMillan]] of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson, and is now being operated by McMillan. The Spacewatch project has acquired a 1.8 meter telescope, also at Kitt Peak, to hunt for NEOs, and has provided the old 90 centimeter telescope with an improved electronic imaging system with much greater resolution, improving its search capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/index.html|title = The Spacewatch Project|accessdate = 2007-10-23|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110211071733/http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/index.html|archivedate = 2011-02-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other near-Earth object tracking programs include [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT), [[Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS), [[Catalina Sky Survey]], [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey]] (CINEOS), [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]], and [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/|title = Near-Earth Objects Search Program|publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration|date = 23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pan-STARRS]] completed telescope construction in 2010, and it is now actively observing.

The [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]], now in operation, conducts frequent scans of the sky with a view to later-stage detection on the collision stretch of the asteroid orbit. Those would be much too late for deflection, but still in time for evacuation and preparation of the affected Earth region.

Another project, supported by the [[European Union]], is '''NEOShield''',&lt;ref name="neoshield.net|title=NEOShield"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoshield.net|title=NEOShield – Near Earth Object – Asteroid Impact Prevention|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which analyses realistic options for preventing the collision of a NEO with Earth. Their aim is to provide test mission designs for feasible NEO mitigation concepts.The project particularly emphasises on two aspects.&lt;ref name="neoshield.net|title=NEOShield"/&gt;

# The first one is the focus on technological development on essential techniques and instruments needed for guidance, navigation and control (GNC) in close vicinity of asteroids and comets. This will, for example, allow hitting such bodies with a high-velocity kinetic impactor spacecraft and observing them before, during and after a mitigation attempt, e.g., for orbit determination and monitoring.
# The second one focuses on refining Near Earth Object (NEO) characterisation. Moreover, NEOShield-2 will carry out astronomical observations of NEOs, to improve the understanding of their physical properties, concentrating on the smaller sizes of most concern for mitigation purposes, and to identify further objects suitable for missions for physical characterisation and NEO deflection demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.neoshield.net/science-technology-asteroid-impact/|title = NEOShield Project|publisher = European Union Consortium|date = 17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Spaceguard]]" is the name for these loosely affiliated programs, some of which receive NASA funding to meet a U.S. Congressional requirement to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1&amp;nbsp;km diameter by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report.html|title = NASA Releases Near-Earth Object Search Report|publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate = 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 NASA study of a follow-on program suggests spending US$250–450 million to detect 90% of all near-Earth asteroids 140 meters and larger by 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/news_detail.cfm?ID=168|title = NASA NEO Workshop|author = David Morrison|publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080122123731/http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/news_detail.cfm?ID=168|archivedate = 2008-01-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sentinel Mission ====
{{Main|B612 Foundation|Sentinel Space Telescope}}

The [[B612 Foundation]] is a private [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Private foundation (United States)|foundation]] with headquarters in the United States, dedicated to protecting the Earth from [[Impact event|asteroid strikes]]. It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Southwest Research Institute]], [[Stanford University]], [[NASA]] and the [[space industry]].

As a [[non-governmental organization]] it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. The foundation's current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding [[Space observatory|space telescope]], [[Sentinel (space telescope)|Sentinel]], to be launched in 2017–2018. The Sentinel's infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of [[Venus]], will help identify threatening NEOs by cataloging 90% of those with diameters larger than {{convert|140|m}}, as well as surveying smaller Solar System objects.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09"&gt;Powell, Corey S.

===Detection from space===
On November 8, 2007, the [[House Committee on Science and Technology]]'s [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Space|Subcommittee on Space]] and Aeronautics held a hearing to examine the status of NASA's Near-Earth Object survey program. The prospect of using the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] was proposed by NASA officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.ca/news/viewsr.html?pid=25960 Hearing Charter: Near-Earth Objects: Status of the Survey Program and Review of NASA's 2007 Report to Congress | SpaceRef Canada – Your Daily Source of Canadian Space News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WISE surveyed the sky in the infrared band at a very high sensitivity. Asteroids that absorb solar radiation can be observed through the infrared band. It was used to detect NEOs, in addition to performing its science goals. It is projected that WISE could detect 400 NEOs (roughly two percent of the estimated NEO population of interest) within the one-year mission.

=== Deep Impact ===

Research published in the March 26, 2009 issue of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', describes how scientists were able to identify an asteroid in space before it entered Earth's atmosphere, enabling computers to determine its area of origin in the Solar System as well as predict the arrival time and location on Earth of its shattered surviving parts. The four-meter-diameter asteroid, called [[2008 TC3|2008 TC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], was initially sighted by the automated [[Catalina Sky Survey]] telescope, on October 6, 2008. Computations correctly predicted that it would impact 19 hours after discovery and in the [[Nubian Desert]] of northern Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/550468/ We Saw It Coming: Asteroid Monitored from Outer Space to Ground Impact] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201008/http://newswise.com/articles/view/550468/ |date=March 3, 2016 }} Newswise, Retrieved on March 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of potential threats have been identified, such as [[99942 Apophis]] (previously known by its [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2004&amp;nbsp;MN|4}}), which in 2009 temporarily had an impact probability of about 3% for the year 2029. Additional observations revised this probability down to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/apophis/ Predicting Apophis' Earth Encounters in 2029 and 2036&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029211543/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/apophis/ |date=October 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact probability calculation pattern ==
[[Image:AsteroidImpactProb.png|thumb|Why asteroid impact probability goes up, then down.]]

The ellipses in the diagram at right show the likely asteroid position at closest Earth approach.  At first, with only a few asteroid observations, the error ellipse is very large and includes the Earth.  Further observations shrink the error ellipse, but it still includes the Earth.  This raises the predicted impact probability, since the Earth now covers a larger fraction of the error region.  Finally, yet more observations (often radar observations, or discovery of a previous sighting of the same asteroid on archival images) shrink the ellipse until the Earth is outside the error region, and the impact probability returns to near zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceguarduk.com/scares.htm |title=Why we have Asteroid "Scares" |publisher=Spaceguard UK |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222114100/http://www.spaceguarduk.com/scares.htm |archivedate=December 22, 2007 |df= }} (Original Site is no longer available, see Archived Site at )&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collision avoidance strategies ==

Various collision avoidance techniques have different trade-offs with respect to metrics such as overall performance, cost, operations, and technology readiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canavan|first=G.

Strategies fall into two basic sets: destruction and {{Anchor|delay2016-01-26}}delay.&lt;ref name="HallRoss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J.

Delay exploits the fact that both the Earth and the impactor are in orbit. An impact occurs when both reach the same point in space at the same time, or more correctly when some point on Earth's surface intersects the impactor's orbit when the impactor arrives. Since the [[Earth]] is approximately 12,750&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and moves at approx. 30&amp;nbsp;km per second in its orbit, it travels a distance of one planetary diameter in about 425 seconds, or slightly over seven minutes. Delaying, or advancing the impactor's arrival by times of this magnitude can, depending on the exact geometry of the impact, cause it to miss the Earth.&lt;ref name="RossParkPorter"&gt;Ross, I. M., Park, S.-Y. and Porter, S. E., "Gravitational Effects of Earth in Optimizing Delta-V for Deflecting Earth-Crossing Asteroids," ''Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets,'' Vol. 38, No. 5, 2001, pp. 759–764.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collision avoidance strategies can also be seen as either direct, or indirect and in how rapidly they transfer energy to the object. The direct methods, such as nuclear explosives, or kinetic impactors, rapidly intercept the bolide's path. Direct methods are preferred because they are generally less costly in time and money. Their effects may be immediate, thus saving precious time. These methods would work for short-notice, and long-notice threats, and are most effective against solid objects that can be directly pushed, but in the case of kinetic impactors, they are not very effective against large loosely aggregated rubble piles. The indirect methods, such as [[gravity tractor]]s, attaching rockets or mass drivers, are much slower and require traveling to the object, time to change course up to 180 degrees to fly alongside it, and then take much more time to change the asteroid's path just enough so it will miss Earth.

Many NEOs are thought to be "flying [[rubble pile]]s" only loosely held together by gravity, and a typical spacecraft sized kinetic-impactor deflection attempt might just break up the object or fragment it without sufficiently adjusting its course.&lt;ref name="spacesailing.net"&gt;[http://www.spacesailing.net/paper/200703_Washington_DachwaldKahleWie.pdf Planetary Defense Conference 2007, Washington D.C.

Tracking the thousands of [[buckshot]]-like fragments that could result from such an explosion would be a very daunting task, although fragmentation would be preferable to doing nothing and allowing the originally larger rubble body, which is analogous to a [[Shotgun slug#Wax slugs|shot and wax slug]], to impact the Earth.

In [[Cielo (supercomputer)|Cielo]] simulations conducted in 2011–2012, in which the rate and quantity of energy delivery were sufficiently high and matched to the size of the rubble pile, such as following a tailored nuclear explosion, results indicated that any asteroid fragments, created after the pulse of energy is delivered, would not pose a threat of re-[[coalescence (physics)|coalescing]] (including for those with the shape of asteroid [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]]) but instead would rapidly achieve [[escape velocity]] from their parent body (which for Itokawa is about 0.2&amp;nbsp;m/s) and therefore move out of an earth-impact trajectory.&lt;ref name="Dillow"&gt;{{cite news| last =Dillow| first =Clay| title =How it Would Work: Destroying an Incoming Killer Asteroid With a Nuclear Blast| newspaper =Popular Science| publisher =Bonnier| date =9 April 2012| url =http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-04/how-it-would-work-destroying-incoming-killer-asteroid-nuclear-blast| accessdate = 6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info%3Alanl-repo%2Flareport%2FLA-UR-11-03124 |title=RAGE Hydrocode Modeling of Asteroid Mitigation:Surface and Subsurface Explosions in Porous PHO Objects.

====Stand-off approach====
If the object is very large but is still a loosely held together rubble pile, a solution is to detonate one or a series of nuclear explosive devices alongside the asteroid, at a 20-meter or greater stand-off height above its surface, so as not to fracture the potentially loosely held together object. Providing this [[proximity fuze|stand-off]] strategy was done far enough in advance, the force from a sufficient number of nuclear blasts would be enough to alter the object's trajectory to avoid an impact, according to computer simulations and experimental evidence from [[meteorite]]s exposed to the thermal X-ray pulses of the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z-machine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2015/march/15-how-to-stop-a-killer-asteroid How to Stop a Killer Asteroid When a civilization-ending space rock bears down on us, this nuclear option might just save our species. 2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827112933/http://discovermagazine.com/2015/march/15-how-to-stop-a-killer-asteroid |date=August 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, graduate students under Professor Paul Sandorff at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] were tasked with designing a method to prevent a hypothetical 18 month distant impact on Earth by the 1.4 [[kilometer]] wide asteroid [[1566 Icarus]], an object which makes regular close approaches to Earth, sometimes as close as 16 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Goldstein |first1=R.

A [[NASA]] analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated:&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html |title=NEO Survey and Deflection Analysis and Alternatives |accessdate=2015-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305101217/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }} Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives Report to Congress March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear standoff explosions are assessed to be 10–100 times more effective than the non-nuclear alternatives analyzed in this study. Other techniques involving the surface or subsurface use of nuclear explosives may be more efficient, but they run an increased risk of fracturing the target NEO. They also carry higher development and operations risks.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same year NASA released a study where the asteroid [[99942 Apophis|Apophis]] (with a diameter ~300 m) was assumed to have a much lower rubble pile density (1,500&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and therefore mass than is now known, and in the study, it is assumed to be on an impact trajectory with Earth for the year 2029. Under these hypothetical conditions, the report determines that a "Cradle spacecraft" would be sufficient to deflect it from Earth impact. This conceptual spacecraft contains six [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]] physics packages, each set for their maximum 1.2 megatonne yield&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/03/215924/nasa-plans-armageddon-spacecraft-to-blast-asteroid.html "NASA plans 'Armageddon' spacecraft to blast asteroid"] article at Flightglobal.com&lt;/ref&gt; that are bundled together and lofted by an [[Ares V]] vehicle sometime in the 2020s, with each B83 being [[proximity fuze|fuzed]] to detonate over the asteroid's surface at a height of 100 m ("1/3 of the objects diameter" as its stand-off), one after the other, with hour long intervals between each successive detonation.

====Surface and subsurface use====
The director of the Asteroid Deflection Research Center at [[Iowa State University]], Wie, who had published kinetic impactor deflection studies in the past,&lt;ref name="spacesailing.net"/&gt; began in 2011 to study strategies that could deal with 50 to 500 meter diameter objects when the time to Earth impact was under a year or so. He concluded that to provide the required energy, a nuclear explosion or other events that could deliver the same power, are the only methods that can work against a very large asteroid within these time constraints.

This work resulted in the creation of a conceptual [[Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle]] (HAIV), which combines a [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|kinetic impactor]] to create an initial [[Impact crater|crater]] for a follow-up subsurface nuclear detonation within that initial crater, which would generate a high degree of efficiency in the conversion of the nuclear energy that is released in the detonation into propulsion energy to the asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21333-asteroid-nuke-spacecraft-mission.html |title=Nuking Dangerous Asteroids Might be the Best Protection, Expert Says |accessdate=2013-07-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401213420/http://www.space.com/21333-asteroid-nuke-spacecraft-mission.html |archivedate=2016-04-01 |df= }} Nuking Dangerous Asteroids Might Be the Best Protection, Expert Says.

Another proposed approach along similar lines is the use of a surface detonating nuclear device, in place of the prior mentioned kinetic impactor, in order to create the initial crater, with the resulting crater that forms then again being used as a [[rocket nozzle]] to channel succeeding nuclear detonations.

At the 2014 [[NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) conference, Wie and his colleagues stated that, "We have the solution, using our baseline concept, to be able to mitigate the asteroid-impact threat, with any range of warning." For example, according to their computer models, with a warning time of 30 days a 1,000-foot-wide (300 m) asteroid would be neutralized by using a single HAIV, with less than 0.1 percent of the destroyed object's mass potentially striking Earth, which by comparison would be more than acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/24696-asteroid-strike-nuclear-bombs.html |title=How Nuclear Bombs Could Save Earth from Killer Asteroids |author= Mike Wall|date= February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eadproject.com/files/An-Innovative-Solution-to-NASAs-NEO-Impact.pdf An Innovative Solution to NASA's NEO Impact Threat Mitigation Grand Challenge and Flight Validation Mission Architecture Development, 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304234304/http://eadproject.com/files/An-Innovative-Solution-to-NASAs-NEO-Impact.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015 Wie has collaborated with the Danish [[Emergency Asteroid Defence Project]] (EADP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://eadproject.com/partners/bong-wie/ EADP partners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025023222/http://eadproject.com/partners/bong-wie/ |date=October 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which ultimately intends to [[crowdsource]] sufficient funds to design, build and store a non-nuclear HAIV spacecraft as planetary insurance. For threatening asteroids too large and/or too close to Earth impact to effectively be deflected by the non-nuclear HAIV approach, nuclear explosive devices with 5% of the explosive yield in this configuration than when compared to the stand-off strategy are intended to be swapped-in, under international oversight, when conditions arise that necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150505181554/http://asteroiddefence.com/ Asteroid Defence, Emergency Asteroid Defence Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comet deflection possibility====
Following the 1994 [[Shoemaker-Levy 9]] comet impacts with Jupiter, [[Edward Teller]] proposed to a collective of U.S. and Russian ex-[[Cold War]] weapons designers in a 1995 planetary defense workshop meeting at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), that they collaborate to design a [[Nuclear weapon design#Arbitrarily large multi-staged devices|1 gigaton nuclear explosive device]], which would be equivalent to the kinetic energy of a 1&amp;nbsp;km diameter asteroid.&lt;ref name="e-reports-ext.llnl.gov"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150909023233/https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/232015.pdf Planetary defense workshop LLNL 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jason Mick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Russia+US+Eye+Teamup+to+Build+Massive+Nuke+to+Save+Planet+from+an+Asteroid/article33569.htm#sthash.rQvVzS6m.dpuf|title=The mother of all bombs would sit in wait in an orbitary platform|date=October 17, 2013|author=Jason Mick|access-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009190305/http://www.dailytech.com/Russia+US+Eye+Teamup+to+Build+Massive+Nuke+to+Save+Planet+from+an+Asteroid/article33569.htm#sthash.rQvVzS6m.dpuf|archive-date=October 9, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="publicintegrity.org"&gt;[http://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/10/16/13547/new-use-nuclear-weapons-hunting-rogue-asteroids A new use for nuclear weapons: hunting rogue asteroids A persistent campaign by weapons designers to develop a nuclear defense against extraterrestrial rocks slowly wins government support 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320055111/http://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/10/16/13547/new-use-nuclear-weapons-hunting-rogue-asteroids |date=March 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical 1 Gt device would weigh about 25–30 tons, light enough to be lifted on the [[Energia]] rocket and it could be used to instantaneously vaporize a 1&amp;nbsp;km asteroid, divert the paths of [[K/T impact|extinction event class asteroids]] (greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) within a few months of short notice, while with 1-year notice, at an interception location no closer than [[Jupiter]], it would also be capable of dealing with the even rarer [[List of periodic comets|short period comets]] which can come out of the [[Kuiper belt]] and transit past Earth orbit within 2 years.

====Law====
The use of nuclear explosive devices is an international issue and will need to be addressed by the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. The 1996 [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] technically bans nuclear weapons in space. However it is unlikely that a nuclear explosive device, fuzed to be detonated only upon interception with a threatening celestial object,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21333-asteroid-nuke-spacecraft-mission.html |title=Nuking Dangerous Asteroids Might be the Best Protection, Expert Says |accessdate=2013-07-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401213420/http://www.space.com/21333-asteroid-nuke-spacecraft-mission.html |archivedate=2016-04-01 |df= }} Nuking Dangerous Asteroids Might Be the Best Protection, Expert Says.

The impact of a massive object, such as a spacecraft or even another near-Earth object, is another possible solution to a pending NEO impact. An object with a high mass close to the Earth could be sent out into a collision course with the asteroid, knocking it off course.

When the asteroid is still far from the Earth, a means of deflecting the asteroid is to directly alter its [[momentum]] by colliding a spacecraft with the asteroid.

A [[NASA]] analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated:&lt;ref name="nasa" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Non-nuclear kinetic impactors are the [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|most mature approach]] and could be used in some deflection/mitigation scenarios, especially for NEOs that consist of a single small, solid body.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) is studying the preliminary design of two space missions for ~2020, named [[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]] (formerly [[Don Quijote (space probe)|Don Quijote]]), and if flown, they would be the first intentional asteroid deflection mission ever designed. ESA's [[Advanced Concepts Team]] has also demonstrated theoretically that a deflection of [[99942 Apophis]] could be achieved by sending a simple spacecraft{{when|date=August 2014}} weighing less than one ton to impact against the asteroid. During a trade-off study one of the leading researchers{{who|date=May 2013}} argued that a strategy called 'kinetic impactor deflection' was more efficient than others.{{dubious|date=May 2013}}

The European Union's NEOShield-2 Mission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoshield.net/mitigation-measures-kinetic-impactor-gravity/kinetic-impactor-asteroid-deflection-spacecraft/|title=Kinetic impactor -|publisher=|date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also primarily studying the Kinetic Impactor mitigation method. The principle of the kinetic impactor mitigation method is that the NEO or Asteroid is deflected following an impact from an impactor spacecraft. The principle of momentum transfer is used, as the impactor crashes into the NEO at a very high velocity of 10&amp;nbsp;km/s or more. The mass and velocity of the impactor (the momentum) are transferred to the NEO, causing a change in velocity and therefore making it deviate from its course slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.neoshield.net/mitigation-measures-kinetic-impactor-gravity/kinetic-impactor-asteroid-deflection-spacecraft/|title = NEOShield Project|publisher = European Union Consortium|date = 17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid-2018, the [[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]] mission has been partly approved. The NASA [[Double Asteroid Redirection Test]] (''DART'') kinetic impactor spacecraft has entered phase C (detailed definition). The goal os to impact the 180-m asteroidal moon of Near-Earth Asteroid [[65803 Didymos]], nicknamed ''Didymoon''.  The impact will occur in October 2022 when Didymos is relatively close to Earth, allowing Earth-based telescopes and planetary radar to observe the event. The result of the impact will be to change the orbital velocity and hence orbital period of Didymoon, by a large enough amount that it can be measured from Earth. This will show for the first time that it is possible to change the orbit of a small ~200m diameter asteroid, around the size most likely to require active mitigation in the future.  The second part of the [[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]] mission -  the ESA [[HERA (mission)|HERA]] spacecraft -  has entered phase B (Preliminary Definition) and requires approval by ESA member states in October 2019. If approved, it would reach the  Didymos system in 2024 and measure both the mass of ''Didymoon'' and the precise effect of the impact on that body, allowing much better extrapolation of the [[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]] mission to other targets.

=== Asteroid gravity tractor  ===
{{main|Gravity tractor}}

One more alternative to explosive deflection is to move the asteroid slowly over a time. Tiny constant thrust accumulates to deviate an object sufficiently from its predicted course. [[Edward T. Lu]] and [[Stanley G. Love]] have proposed using a large heavy unmanned spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the latter into a non-threatening orbit. The spacecraft and the asteroid mutually attract one another. If the spacecraft counters the force towards the asteroid by, e.g., an [[nuclear electric rocket|ion thruster]], the net effect is that the asteroid is accelerated towards the spacecraft and thus slightly deflected from its orbit. While slow, this method has the advantage of working irrespective of the asteroid composition or spin rate – [[rubble pile]] asteroids would be difficult to deflect by means of nuclear detonations while a pushing device would be hard or inefficient to mount on a fast rotating asteroid. A gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years beside the asteroid to be effective.

A [[NASA]] analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated:&lt;ref name="nasa" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Slow push" mitigation techniques are the most expensive, have the lowest level of technical readiness, and their ability to both travel to and divert a threatening NEO would be limited unless mission durations of many years to decades are possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{wide image|NASA-Animation-ARM-opt-800-20150325.gif|800px|align-cap=center|The [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] vehicle was to demonstrate the "[[gravity tractor]]" planetary defense technique on a hazardous-size asteroid. The gravity tractor method leverages the mass of the spacecraft to impart a gravitational force on the asteroid, slowly altering the asteroid's trajectory.}}

=== Ion beam shepherd ===
{{main|Ion Beam Shepherd}}

Another "contactless" asteroid deflection technique has been recently proposed by C.Bombardelli and J.Peláez from the [[Technical University of Madrid]]. The method involves the use of a low divergence ion thruster pointed at the asteroid from a nearby hovering spacecraft. The momentum transmitted by the ions reaching the asteroid surface produces a slow but continuous force that can deflect the asteroid in a similar way as done by the gravity tractor but with a lighter spacecraft.

=== Use of focused solar energy ===
[[Image:Solarsail msfc.jpg|thumb|NASA study of a [[solar sail]]. The sail would be 0.5 km wide.]]

[[H. Jay Melosh]] proposed deflecting an asteroid or comet by focusing [[solar energy]] onto its surface to create thrust from the resulting vaporization of material, or to amplify the [[Yarkovsky effect]]. Over a span of months or years enough [[solar radiation]] can be directed onto the object to deflect it.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

This method would first require the construction of a space station with a system of gigantic [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]. Then the station would be transported toward the Sun.

=== Mass driver ===

A [[mass driver]] is an (automated) system on the asteroid to eject material into space thus giving the object a slow steady push and decreasing its mass. A mass driver is designed to work as a very low [[specific impulse]] system, which in general uses a lot of propellant, but very little power.

The idea is that when using local material as propellant, the amount of propellant is not as important as the amount of power, which is likely to be limited.

Another possibility is to use a mass driver on the Moon aimed at the NEO to take advantage of the Moon's orbital velocity and inexhaustible supply of "rock bullets". {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Conventional rocket engine ===

Attaching any [[spacecraft propulsion]] device would have a similar effect of giving a push, possibly forcing the asteroid onto a trajectory that takes it away from Earth. An in-space rocket engine that is capable of imparting an impulse of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; N·s (E.g. adding 1&amp;nbsp;km/s to a 1000&amp;nbsp;kg vehicle), will have a relatively small effect on a relatively small asteroid that has a mass of roughly a million times more. Chapman, Durda, and Gold's white paper&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Clark R. and Daniel D. Durda. [http://www.internationalspace.com/pdf/NEOwp_Chapman-Durda-Gold.pdf The Comet/Asteroid Impact Hazard: A Systems Approach] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002442/http://www.internationalspace.com/pdf/NEOwp_Chapman-Durda-Gold.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}, Boulder, CO: Office of Space Studies, Southwest Research Institute, Space Engineering and Technology Branch, [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]].&lt;/ref&gt; calculates deflections using existing chemical rockets delivered to the asteroid.

Such direct force rocket engines are typically proposed to use highly-efficient [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], such as [[ion thruster]]s or [[VASIMR]].

=== Asteroid laser ablation ===
[[File:Asteroid Capture.jpg|thumb|This early [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] artist's impression is suggestive of another method of changing a large threatening celestial body's orbit by [[asteroid capture|capturing]] relatively smaller celestial objects and using those, and not the usually proposed small bits of spacecraft, as the means of creating a powerful [[kinetic energy|kinetic impact]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/19541/1/98-0965.pdf DISRUPTION OF KILOMETER-SIZED ASTEROIDS BY ENERGETIC COLLISIONS Asphaug et al. 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306071546/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/19541/1/98-0965.pdf |date=March 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, a stronger faster acting [[gravitational tractor]], as some low-density asteroids such as [[253 Mathilde]] can [[crumple zone|dissipate impact energy]].]]
{{main|Asteroid laser ablation}}

Similar to the effects of a nuclear device, it is thought possible to focus sufficient laser energy on the surface of an asteroid to cause flash vaporization / ablation to create either in impulse or to ablate away the asteroid mass.  This concept, called [[asteroid laser ablation]] was articulated in the 1995 SpaceCast 2020&lt;ref name="af.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csat.au.af.mil|title=Center for Strategy and Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; white paper "Preparing for Planetary Defense",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/planetarydefense/1994-DetectionAndInterceptionOfAsteroidsOnCollisionCourseWithEarth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1996 Air Force 2025&lt;ref name="af.mil"/&gt; white paper "Planetary Defense: Catastrophic Health Insurance for Planet Earth".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/planetarydefense/1996-PlanetaryDefense-CatstrophicHealthInsuranceForPlanetEarth-Urias.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Early publications include C. R. Phipps "ORION" concept from 1996, Colonel Jonathan W. Campbell's 2000 monograph "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/planetarydefense/2000-LaserOrbitalDebrisRemovalAndAsteroidDeflection-Campbell.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and NASA's 2005 concept Comet Asteroid Protection System (CAPS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/planetarydefense/2005-CometAsteroidProtectionSystem(CAPS)-NASA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically such systems require a significant amount of power, such as would be available from a [[Space-based solar power|Space-Based Solar Power Satellite]].

Another proposal is the Phillip Lubin's DE-STAR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/projects/directed-energy-planetary-defense|title=DE-STAR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposal.

The design calls for the array to eventually be approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km squared in size, with the modular design meaning that it could be launched in increments and assembled in space. In its early stages as a small array it could deal with smaller targets, assist [[solar sail]] probes and would also be useful in cleaning up [[space debris]].

== Deflection technology concerns ==

[[Carl Sagan]], in his book [[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]], expressed concern about deflection technology that any method capable of deflecting impactors ''away'' from Earth could also be abused to divert non-threatening bodies ''toward'' the planet. Considering the history of genocidal political leaders and the possibility of the bureaucratic obscuring of any such project's true goals to most of its scientific participants, he judged the Earth at greater risk from a man-made impact than a natural one. Sagan instead suggested that deflection technology be developed only in an actual emergency situation.

All low-energy delivery deflection technologies have inherent fine control and steering capability, making it possible to add just the right amount of energy to steer [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth|an asteroid originally destined for a mere close approach]] toward a specific Earth target.

According to [[Rusty Schweickart]], the [[gravitational tractor]] method is controversial because, during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory, the point on the Earth where it could most likely hit would be slowly shifted across different countries. Thus, the threat for the entire planet would be minimized at the cost of some specific states' security. In Schweickart's opinion, choosing the way the asteroid should be "dragged" would be a tough diplomatic decision.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/12/saving-earth-from-an-asteroid/ | title=Saving Earth From an Asteroid Will Take Diplomats, Not Heroes | last=Madrigal | first=Alexis | date=16 December 2009 | publisher=WIRED | accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the uncertainty involved in nuclear deflection shows that the ability to protect the planet does not imply the ability to target the planet. A nuclear explosion that changes an asteroid's velocity by 10 meters/second (plus or minus 20%) would be adequate to push it out of an Earth-impacting orbit. However, if the uncertainty of the velocity change was more than a few percent, there would be no chance of directing the asteroid to a particular target.

== Planetary defense timeline ==

* In their 1964 book, ''Islands in Space,'' [[Dandridge M. Cole]] and Donald W. Cox noted the dangers of planetoid impacts, both those occurring naturally and those that might be brought about with hostile intent.  They argued for cataloging the minor planets and developing the technologies to land on, deflect, or even capture planetoids.&lt;ref&gt;''Islands in Space,'' [[Dandridge M. Cole]] and Donald W. Cox, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1967, students in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at MIT did a design study, "Project Icarus," of a mission to prevent a hypothetical impact on Earth by asteroid 1566 Icarus.&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt; The design project was later published in a book by the MIT Press&lt;ref name="Icarus" /&gt; and received considerable publicity, for the first time bringing asteroid impact into the public eye.&lt;ref name="Time1967" /&gt; 
* In the 1980s NASA studied evidence of past strikes on planet Earth, and the risk of this happening at the current level of civilization.  This led to a program that maps which objects in the Solar System both cross Earth's orbit and are large enough to cause serious damage if they ever hit.
* In the 1990s, US Congress held hearings to consider the risks and what needed to be done about them.  This led to a US$3 million annual budget for programs like [[Spaceguard]] and the [[near-Earth object]] program, as managed by [[NASA]] and [[USAF]].
* In 2005 a number of astronauts published an open letter through the [[Association of Space Explorers]] calling for a united push to develop strategies to protect Earth from the risk of a cosmic collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Astronauts push for strategies, spacecraft to prevent calamitous asteroid strike | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05332/613441.stm|accessdate=2008-01-18 | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=November 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSS discovered over 1150 NEOs in years 2005 to 2007. In doing this survey they discovered on November 20, 2007, an asteroid, designated [[2007 WD5|{{mp|2007 WD|5}}]], which initially was estimated to have a chance of hitting [[Mars]] on January 30, 2008, but further observations during the following weeks allowed NASA to rule out an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Catalina Sky Survey Discovers Space Rock That Could Hit Mars|url=http://uanews.org/node/17415|accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA estimated a near miss by {{convert|26,000|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Recently Discovered Asteroid Could Hit Mars in January | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news151.html | accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==

=== Inception ===
athenahealth began in 1997 as Athena Women's Health, a women's health and birthing center in San Diego, California. Cofounders [[Jonathan S. Bush|Jonathan Bush]] and [[Todd Park]] set out to create a comfortable and comprehensive center, where mothers could receive "a warm and supportive environment, personal attention, better care, and superior results" while the back-end business was "a ruthlessly efficient operation, with a laser focus on costs."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where Does It Hurt?: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Fixing Health Care|last=Bush|first=Jonathan|publisher=Portfolio/Penguin|year=2014|isbn=1591846773|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birthing center excelled at delivering healthy babies: Only 10% of babies were delivered by [[Caesarean section|C-section]], one third of the national average, and 90% of mothers were able to breastfeed their newborns, beating the national average of 67% at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Yet while quality increased, costs followed in suit, and Bush and Park eventually closed their birthing center and started a medical data company called athenahealth on the heels of the [[Internet]] boom of 1999.

=== athenahealth ===
In 1998, venture funder Mark Wilson offered to buy athenahealth’s software for $11 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bush and Park turned down the offer but followed Wilson’s instinct, transitioning from a business model from birthing centers to a vision of building the healthcare internet. They transformed Athena Women’s Health to athenahealth, Inc., pulling in Ed Park, Park’s younger brother and engineer, to develop a practice management system.&lt;ref name="fuhrmans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s.wsj.net/public/article/SB117141549626107896-search.html?KEYWORDS=athenahealth+Fights+Over+Health+Claims+Spawn+a+New+Arms+Race+-+Insurers+and+Doctors+Try+for+Upper+Hand+Firms+Help+Both+Sides+&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month|title=Fights Over Health Claims Spawn a New Arms Race - Insurers and Doctors Try for Upper Hand; Firms Help Both Sides|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving clinical work in the hands of capable providers, their new business endeavor aimed to “let doctors be doctors” and remove incessant and burdensome paperwork off doctors’ desks.

The start of 2000 saw two important moments in time: athenahealth’s first client, Anchor Medical Associates, went live on athenaCollector; and in February, its first electronic claim was submitted. While its first office opened its doors in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] in 2002, athenahealth moved to Watertown, Massachusetts in 2005 and is still headquartered there today.

=== Growth ===
athenahealth announced an [[initial public offering]] of its common stock on June 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="businesswire2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_August_29/ai_n26969643|title=athenahealth Named One of America's Fastest Growing Private Companies for the Second Straight Year|date=2006-08-29|accessdate=2006-08-29|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offering was completed on September 20, 2007, at a price of $18 per share. It trades on the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] exchange under the symbol ATHN.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2006/tc20060131_011101.htm|title=Health Care's Electronic Elixir?|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since moving its headquarters to Watertown in 2005, athenahealth has created campuses in: Chennai, India, in 2005; Belfast, Maine, in 2008; Princeton, New Jersey, in 2013; Atlanta, Georgia, and San Francisco, California, in 2014; Austin, Texas, in 2015; and Bangalore and Pune, India, in 2017.

=== Involvement of Elliott Management ===

In 2017-2018, under pressure from investor [[Elliott Management]], athenahealth undertook substantial cost-cutting measures, and Bush resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/paul-singer-doomsday-investor|title=Paul Singer, Doomsday Investor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenahealth has agreed to be acquired by a Veritas Capital and Evergreen Coast Capital affiliate for $5.7 billion, the companies announced Monday morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehrreviews.com/blog/athenahealth-will-sell-to-veritas-elliott-for-5-7-billion/|title=Athenahealth Will Sell to Veritas, Elliott for $5.7 Billion|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ehrreviews.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==

==== athenaCollector ====
athenahealth’s first product, athenaCollector, a cloud-based revenue cycle and practice management service, rolled out in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.athenahealth.com/practice/athenacollector/medical-billing|title=Medical Billing {{!}} athenaCollector {{!}} athenahealth|date=2017-04-18|work=Improve Clinical and Financial Results {{!}} athenahealth|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built by Ed Park, the revenue cycle management system formed the foundation of athenaNet, athenahealth’s web-based system at large. (Ed Park would go on to become athenahealth’s Chief Operating Officer and member of its board.)&lt;ref name="reingold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/96/health-care.html|title=The Bush Health-Care Solution|publisher=Fast Company|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713015640/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/96/health-care.html|archivedate=13 July 2005 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=2005-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== athenaClinicals ====
In 2006, the company launched athenaClinicals, reported as the "first economically sustainable, service-based" electronic medical records (EMR) system.&lt;ref name="businesswire"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_July_25/ai_n26934679|title=athenahealth Introduces Healthcare Industry's First Economically Sustainable, Service-Based EMR Offering for Medical Practices|date=2006-07-25|accessdate=2006-07-25|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.athenahealth.com/practice/athenaclinicals/emr|title=The EMR Designed By Doctors For Usability {{!}} athenahealth|date=2017-04-18|work=Improve Clinical and Financial Results {{!}} athenahealth|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; athenaClinicals has been ranked as leading the market in EHR usability, due to its productivity and ability to reduce providers’ work, effectiveness of delivering patient care, and intuitive user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clinical-innovation.com/topics/ehr-emr/klas-usability-report-puts-athenahealth-top|title=KLAS usability report puts athenahealth on top|work=Clinical Innovation + Technology|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== athenaCommunicator ====
In 2008, athenahealth introduced athenaCommunicator to manage phone calls.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/businesswire/feeds/businesswire/2008/08/04/businesswire20080804006081r1.html|title=athenahealth to Acquire MedicalMessaging.net Assets, Gaining New Patient Communications Service Capabilities|accessdate=2008-08-04|publisher=Forbes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the product has evolved into a suite of "patient engagement services," including a [[patient portal]], patient self-scheduling solution, and live operator service to better help patients to schedule appointments, reschedule appointments, and make payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.athenahealth.com/practice/athenacommunicator/patient-engagement|title=Patient Engagement {{!}} athenaCommunicator {{!}} athenahealth|date=2017-05-03|work=Improve Clinical and Financial Results {{!}} athenahealth|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epocrates ===
In 2013, the company purchased the [[Epocrates]] mobile brand, and continued to occupy Epocrates’s offices in Princeton, New Jersey and San Francisco, California. As an athenahealth service, Epocrates aggregates treatment information, including dosing and [[contraindication]]s, to provide clinical decision support in the prescribing moments of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-07/athenahealth-acquires-epocrates-the-angry-birds-of-healt|title=AthenaHealth Acquires Epocrates, the Angry Birds of Healt|last=Burrows|first=Peter|date=2013-01-07|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.athenahealth.com/practice/epocrates/clinical-decision-support|title=Clinical Decision Support {{!}} Epocrates Point of Care Medical App {{!}} athenahealth|date=2017-05-03|work=Improve Clinical and Financial Results {{!}} athenahealth|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epocrates drug monographs have also been embedded into the athenaClinicals EHR system to enhance productivity and reduce time not spent on patients.

== Partnerships and acquisitions ==

=== More Disruption Please ===
athenahealth's More Disruption Please (MDP) program was launched in 2011. The initiative is both a partner program and an incubator environment for independent companies to develop products and services connected to athenahealth's ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.innovationleader.com/how-athenahealth-created-a-community-around-disruptive-innovation/|title=Creating a disrupter ecosystem: How Athenahealth did it - Working With Startups - Innovation Leader|website=Innovation Leader|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, athenahealth created the More Disruption Please accelerator, an opportunity for young [[Startup company|startups]] still finding their legs to begin developing in athenahealth’s MDP space. “The goal of [the MDP accelerator] is to lower the barrier of entry for the best solutions to help us build the healthcare Internet,” said Mandira Singh, director of the More Disruption Please program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medcitynews.com/2016/03/athenahealths-more-disruption-please-accelerator/|title=athenahealth's More Disruption Please accelerator gives startups another way to shake up healthcare - MedCity News|website=medcitynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first full year, the accelerator added five companies to its portfolio.

In April 2016, athenahealth acquired Arsenal Health, which developed a Smart Scheduling service for healthcare providers. Arsenal Health was athenahealth's first MDP investment, in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/13530416/1/athenahealth-announces-acquisition-of-arsenal-health-formerly-known-as-smart-scheduling-inc.html|title=Athenahealth Announces Acquisition Of Arsenal Health, Formerly Known As Smart Scheduling, Inc.|website=TheStreet|language=en-US|date=2016-04-14|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

athenahealth launched MDP Labs in 2017. The program invites all entrepreneurs, from fledgling startups to mature companies, to innovate in healthcare and fix what’s broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.athenahealth.com/more-disruption-please/labs|title=MDP Labs|website=Athena Health|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; athenahealth’s MDP Labs offers workspace in its downtown San Francisco office, tailored programming, dedicated mentorship, opportunities for partnerships and funding, and exposure to potential clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitconsultant.net/2017/05/18/athenahealth-launches-mdp-labs-health-startups-accelerate-health-innovation/|title=athenahealth Launches MDP Labs for Health IT Startups to Accelerate Health Innovation|date=2017-05-18|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other acquisitions and collaborations ===
In January 2015, athenahealth announced the acquisition of RazorInsights, a "leader in cloud-based EHR and financial [[solution]]s" for rural, [[Critical Access Hospital|critical access]], and [[community hospital]]s. The purchase extended athenahealth’s established position in the outpatient market into the 50-bed and under [[inpatient care]] environment, which makes up nearly one third of the hospital market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/10115479.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120172845/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/10115479.htm|archivedate=January 20, 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, athenahealth announced that it had purchased webOMR, a web-based clinical applications and EHR platform developed by Boston’s [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]]. athenahealth collaborated with BIDMC on the development of athenahealth's acute care service offering, using Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, a 58-bed community hospital, as the alpha development site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/02/03/athenahealth-teaming-with-beth-israel-deaconess-offer-clinical-records-software-hospitals/nGMHHyXDhYlvcl91JWXJBN/story.html|title=Athenahealth teaming with Beth Israel Deaconess to offer clinical records software to hospitals - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}

'''Attachment therapy''' is a controversial category of alternative child mental health interventions intended to treat [[attachment disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=tfr83/&gt; The term generally includes accompanying parenting techniques. Other names or particular techniques include "the Evergreen model", "holding time", "rage-reduction", "compression therapy", "rebirthing", "corrective attachment therapy" and Coercive Restraint Therapy.&lt;ref name=tfr83/&gt; It is found primarily in the United States, and much of it is centered in about a dozen clinics in [[Evergreen, Colorado]], where Foster Cline, one of the founders, established his clinic in the 1970s. This article describes this particular set of interventions although in clinical literature the term "attachment therapy" is sometimes used loosely to mean any intervention based on [[attachment theory]], particularly outside the US. Attachment therapy as described in this article should not be confused with [[Attachment-based therapy|other schools of therapy]] which are more empirically based and which aim to address problems stemming from disrupted [[attachment theory|attachment to caregivers]].&lt;ref&gt;Dozier M and Rutter M (2008). "Challenges to the Development of Attachment Relationships Faced by Young Children in Foster and Adoptive Care". In Cassidy J and Shaver PR. Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications (2nd ed.). New York: London: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-60623-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been described as a potentially abusive and [[pseudoscientific]] intervention that has resulted in adverse outcomes for children, including at least six documented child fatalities.&lt;ref name="Berlin et al."&gt;{{citation |author=Berlin LJ |year=2005 |contribution=Preface |title=Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |series=Duke series in child development and public policy |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=1-59385-470-6 |pages=xvii |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s there have been a number of prosecutions for deaths or serious maltreatment of children at the hands of "attachment therapists" or parents following their instructions. Two of the most well-known cases are those of '''[[Candace Newmaker]]''' in 2000 and the [[Michael and Sharen Gravelle|'''Gravelles''']] in 2003. Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by the publication of a Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Task Force Report, Chaffin et al."&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, ATTACh, an organization originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting, promoting instead newer techniques of attunement, sensitivity and [[emotional dysregulation|regulation]].&lt;ref name="attach07" /&gt; Some leading attachment therapists have also specifically moved away from coercive practices.

== Theory ==
Attachment therapy is a treatment used primarily with [[foster care|fostered]] or [[adopted]] children who have behavioral difficulties, sometimes severe, but including disobedience and perceived lack of gratitude or affection for their caregivers. The children's problems are ascribed to an inability to attach to their new parents, because of suppressed rage due to past [[maltreatment]] and abandonment. The common form of attachment therapy is ''holding'' therapy, in which a child is firmly held (or lain upon) by therapists or parents. Through this process of restraint and confrontation, therapists seek to produce in the child a range of responses such as [[rage (emotion)|rage]] and despair with the goal of achieving [[catharsis#Therapeutic uses|catharsis]]. In theory, when the child's resistance is overcome and the rage is released, the child is reduced to an infantile state in which he or she can be "re-parented" by methods such as cradling, rocking, bottle feeding and enforced [[eye contact]]. The aim is to promote attachment with the new caregivers. Control over the children is usually considered essential, and the therapy is often accompanied by parenting techniques which emphasize obedience. These accompanying parenting techniques are based on the belief that a properly attached child should comply with parental demands "fast, snappy and right the first time" and should be "fun to be around".&lt;ref name="tfr79" /&gt; These techniques have been implicated in several child deaths and other harmful effects.&lt;ref name="tfr77"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of "[[therapy]]", including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is not scientifically validated, nor is it considered to be part of mainstream [[psychology]]. It is, despite its name, not based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Zeanah CH |title= Attachment disorders: assessment strategies and treatment approaches |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12944216 |doi= 10.1080/14616730310001593974 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974&amp;magic=pubmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{citation |author=Ziv Y |year=2005 |contribution=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research |title=Enhancing Early Attachments.

Zaslow, [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Tinbergen]], Martha Welch and other early proponents used it as a treatment for [[autism]], based on the now discredited belief that autism was the result of failures in the attachment relationship with the mother.

This form of treatment differs significantly from evidence-based [[attachment-based therapy (children)|attachment-based therapies]], talking psychotherapies such as [[attachment-based psychotherapy]] and [[relational psychoanalysis]] or the form of [[attachment parenting]] advocated by the pediatrician [[William Sears (physician)|William Sears]]. Further, the form of rebirthing sometimes used within attachment therapy differs from the unrelated breathing therapy known as [[Rebirthing (breathwork)|Rebirthing]].

==Treatment characteristics==
The controversy, as outlined in the 2006 [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC) Task Force Report,&lt;ref name="Task Force Report, Chaffin et al."/&gt; has broadly centered around "holding therapy"&lt;ref name="Welch"&gt;{{citation |author=Welch MG |others=foreword by Niko Tinbergen |title=Holding Time: How to Eliminate Conflict, Temper Tantrums, and Sibling Rivalry and Raise Happy, Loving, Successful Children |date=September 1989 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-68878-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[coercion|coercive]], [[wikt:restrain|restraining]], or [[aversives|aversive]] procedures. These include [[deep tissue massage]], aversive tickling, punishments related to food and water intake, enforced eye contact, requiring children to submit totally to adult control over all their needs, barring normal social relationships outside the primary caretaker, encouraging children to [[age regression in therapy|regress]] to [[infant]] status, [[reparenting]], attachment parenting, or techniques designed to provoke [[Catharsis#Therapeutic uses|cathartic emotional discharge]]. Variants of these treatments have carried various labels that change frequently. They may be known as "rebirthing therapy", "compression therapy", "corrective attachment therapy", "the Evergreen model", "holding time", "rage-reduction therapy"&lt;ref name=tfr83&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "prolonged parent-child embrace therapy".&lt;ref name="Welsh et al."&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Welch MG, Northrup RS, Welch-Horan TB, Ludwig RJ, Austin CL, Jacobson JS |title=Outcomes of Prolonged Parent-Child Embrace Therapy among 102 children with behavioral disorders |journal=Complement Ther Clin Pract |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=3–12 |year=2006 |pmid=16401524 |doi= 10.1016/j.ctcp.2005.09.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1744-3881(05)00097-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors critical of this therapeutic approach have used the term Coercive Restraint Therapy.&lt;ref name="Mercer2"&gt;{{citation |author=Mercer J |year=2005 |title=Coercive Restraint Therapies: A dangerous alternative mental health intervention |journal=Medscape General Medicine |volume=7 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this form of treatment for attachment difficulties or disorders which is popularly known as "attachment therapy".&lt;ref name=tfr83/&gt; [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]], a group that [[advocacy|campaigns against]] attachment therapy, give a list of therapies they state are attachment therapy by another name.&lt;ref name="ACTwhatis"&gt;{{Citation |last=Advocates for Children in therapy |title=What is Attachment Therapy |url=http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/cline.html |quote=''Z-therapy, rage-reduction therapy, Theraplay, holding therapy, attachment holding therapy, attachment disorder therapy, holding time, cuddle time, gentle containment, holding-nurturing process, emotional shuttling, direct synchronous bonding, breakthrough synchronous bonding, therapeutic parenting, dynamic attachment therapy, humanistic attachment therapy, corrective attachment therapy, developmental attachment therapy, dyadic attachment therapy, dyadic developmental psychotherapy, dyadic support environment, affective attunement'' |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide a list of additional therapies used by attachment therapists which they consider to be unvalidated.&lt;ref name="ACTwhatis2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Advocates for Children in therapy |title=What is Attachment Therapy |url=http://www.childrenintherapy.org/essays/index.html |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Matthew Speltz of the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]] describes a typical treatment taken from The Center's material (apparently a replication of the program at the Attachment Center, Evergreen) as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Like Welsh (''sic'')(1984, 1989), The Center induces rage by physically restraining the child and forcing eye contact with the therapist (the child must lie across the laps of two therapists, looking up at one of them). In a workshop handout prepared by two therapists at The Center, the following sequence of events is described: (1) therapist 'forces control' by holding (which produces child 'rage'); (2) rage leads to child 'capitulation' to the therapist, as indicated by the child breaking down emotionally ('sobbing'); (3) the therapist takes advantage of the child's capitulation by showing nurturance and warmth; (4) this new trust allows the child to accept 'control' by the therapist and eventually the parent. According to The Center's treatment protocol, if the child 'shuts down' (''i.e.'', refuses to comply), he or she may be threatened with detainment for the day at the clinic or forced placement in a temporary [[foster home]]; this is explained to the child as a consequence of not choosing to be a '[[family]] boy or girl.' If the child is actually placed in foster care, the child is then required to 'earn the way back to therapy' and a chance to resume living with the adoptive family."&lt;ref name="Speltz"&gt;{{citation|author=Speltz ML |year=2002 |title=Description, History and Critique of Corrective Attachment Therapy |journal=The APSAC Advisor |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=4–8 |url=http://www.kidscomefirst.info/Speltz.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414011820/http://www.kidscomefirst.info/Speltz.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the APSAC Task Force,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A central feature of many of these therapies is the use of psychological, physical, or aggressive means to provoke the child to catharsis, ventilation of rage, or other sorts of acute emotional discharge. To do this, a variety of coercive techniques are used, including scheduled holding, binding, rib cage stimulation (e.g., tickling, pinching, knuckling), and/or licking. Children may be held down, may have several adults lie on top of them, or their faces may be held so they can be forced to engage in prolonged eye contact. Sessions may last from 3 to 5 hours, with some sessions reportedly lasting longer... Similar but less physically coercive approaches may involve holding the child and psychologically encouraging the child to vent anger toward her or his biological parent."&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The APSAC Task Force describes how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal [[pathology]] and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current [[social environment|environment]]. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of a problem in the current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's [[psychological resistance|resistance]] to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt;

Coercive techniques, such as scheduled or enforced holding, may also serve the intended purpose of demonstrating dominance over the child. Establishing total adult control, demonstrating to the child that he or she has no control, and demonstrating that all of the child's needs are met through the adult, is a central tenet of many controversial attachment therapies. Similarly, many controversial treatments hold that children described as attachment–disordered must be pushed to revisit and relive early [[psychological trauma|trauma]]. Children may be encouraged to regress to an earlier age where trauma was experienced or be reparented through holding sessions.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt; Other features of attachment therapy are the "two week intensive" course of therapy, and the use of "therapeutic foster parents" with whom the child stays whilst undergoing therapy. According to O'Connor and Zeanah, the "holding" approach would be viewed as intrusive and therefore non-sensitive and [[therapeutic|countertherapeutic]], in contrast with accepted theories of attachment.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"/&gt;

According to Advocates for Children in Therapy,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Attachment Therapy almost always involves extremely confrontational, often hostile confrontation of a child by a therapist or parent (sometimes both). Restraint of the child by more powerful adult(s) is considered an essential part of the confrontation." The purported correction is described as "...&amp;nbsp;to force the children into loving (attaching to) their parents; ... there is a hands-on treatment involving physical restraint and discomfort. Attachment Therapy is the imposition of boundary violations – most often coercive restraint – and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hours at a time; ... Typically, the child is put in a lap hold with the arms pinned down, or alternatively an adult lies on top of a child lying prone on the floor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Advocates for Children in therapy |title=Abusive Techniques |url=http://www.childrenintherapy.org/essays/abuses.html |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Bruce D. Perry|Bruce Perry]] cites the use of holding therapy techniques by caseworkers and foster parents investigating a [[Satanic Ritual Abuse]] case in the late 1980s, early 1990s, as instrumental in obtaining lengthy and detailed alleged "disclosures" from children. In his opinion, using force or coercion on traumatised children simply re-traumatizes them and far from producing love and affection, produces obedience based on fear, as in the [[trauma bond]] known as [[Stockholm syndrome]].&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{citation|vauthors=Perry B, Szalavitz M |title=The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog|publisher=Basic Books|location=Philadelphia|year=2006|isbn=978-0-465-05653-8|pages=160–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parenting techniques===
Therapists often instruct parents to follow programs of treatment at home, for example obedience-training techniques such as "strong sitting" (frequent periods of required silence and immobility) and withholding or limiting food.&lt;ref name=tfr79&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{citation |author=Thomas N |year=2000 |contribution= Parenting children with attachment disorders |editor=Levy TM |title=Handbook of attachment interventions |location=San Diego, CA |publisher=Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier authors sometimes referred to this as "[[German Shepherd]] training".&lt;ref name="Cline"&gt;{{citation |author=Cline FW |title=Hope for High Risk and Rage Filled Children: Reactive Attachment Disorder: Theory and Intrusive Therapy |year=1992 |publisher=EC Publications |location=Golden, CO |isbn=0-9631728-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some programmes children undergoing the two-week intensive stay with "therapeutic foster parents" for the duration or beyond and the adoptive parents are trained in their techniques.&lt;ref name=stryker/&gt;

According to the APSAC Task Force, because it is believed children with attachment problems resist attachment, fight against it and seek to control others to avoid attaching, the child's character flaws must be broken before attachment can occur. Attachment parenting may include keeping the child at home with no social contacts, home schooling, hard labor or meaningless repetitive chores throughout the day, motionless sitting for prolonged periods of time, and control of all food and water intake and bathroom needs. Children described as attachment-disordered are expected by attachment therapists&lt;ref name="hage"&gt;{{citation|author=Hage D|title=Holding therapy: Harmful? Or rather beneficial!|journal=Roots and Wings Adoption Magazine|year=1997}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2005-08-22--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to comply with parental commands "fast and snappy and right the first time", and to always be "fun to be around" for their parents.&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; Deviation from this standard, such as not finishing chores or arguing, is interpreted as a sign of attachment disorder that must be forcibly eradicated. From this perspective, parenting a child with an attachment disorder is a battle, and winning the battle by defeating the child is paramount.&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt;

Proper appreciation of total adult control is also considered vital, and information, such as how long a child will be with therapeutic foster parents or what will happen to him or her next, is deliberately withheld.&lt;ref name="Mercer et al.98105"&gt;{{harvnb|Mercer|Sarner|Rosa|2003|pages=98–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment parenting expert Nancy Thomas states that attachment-disordered children act worse when given information about what is going to occur because they will use the information to manipulate their environment and everyone in it.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

In addition to restrictive behavior, parents are advised to provide daily sessions in which older children are treated as if they were babies to create attachment.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; The child is held in the caregiver's lap, rocked, hugged and kissed, and fed with a bottle and given sweets. These sessions are carried out at the caregiver's wish and not upon the child's request. Attachment therapists believe that reenactments of aspects of infant care have the power to rebuild damaged aspects of early development such as emotional attachment.&lt;ref name="Mercer et al. 7579"&gt;{{harvnb|Mercer|Sarner|Rosa|2003|pages=75–79, 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrasting attachment theory-based methods===
{{See also|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
In contrast, traditional attachment theory holds that the provision of a safe and predictable environment and caregiver qualities such as sensitivity, responsiveness to children's physical and emotional needs and consistency, support the development of healthy attachment. Therapy based on this viewpoint emphasizes providing a stable environment and taking a calm, sensitive, non-intrusive, non-threatening, patient, predictable, and nurturing approach toward children. Further, as attachment patterns develop within relationships, methods to correct problems with attachment focus on improving the stability and positive qualities of the caregiver-child interactions and relationship.&lt;ref name="Haugaard"&gt;{{citation |author=Haugaard JJ |title=Recognizing and treating uncommon behavioral and emotional disorders in children and adolescents who have been severely maltreated: introduction |journal= Child Maltreat |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=123–30 |year=2004 |pmid=15104880 |doi=10.1177/1077559504264304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Nichols M, Lacher D, May J |year=2002 |title=Parenting with stories: creating a foundation of attachment for parenting your child |location= Deephaven, MN |publisher=Family Attachment Counseling Center |isbn=0-9746029-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; All mainstream interventions with an existing or developing evidential foundation focus on enhancing caregiver sensitivity, creating positive interactions with caregivers, or change of caregiver if that is not possible with existing caregivers.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p. 231–32"&gt;{{harvnb|Prior|Glaser|2006|pages=231–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AACAP 05"/&gt; Some interventions focus specifically on increasing caregiver sensitivity in foster parents.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p. 231–32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AACAP 05"&gt;{{citation |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=November 2005 |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1206–19 |title=Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood |last1=Boris |first1=Neil W. |last2=Zeanah |first2=Charles H. |author3=Work Group on Quality Issues |pmid=16239871 |url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(09)62229-2/fulltext |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical principles==
Like a number of other alternative mental health treatments for children, attachment therapy is based on some assumptions that differ strongly from the theoretical foundations of other attachment based therapies.&lt;ref name=tfr78&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to traditional attachment theory, the theory of attachment described by attachment therapy proponents is that young children who experience adversity (including [[maltreatment]], loss, separations, [[adoption]], frequent changes in child care, [[colic]] or even frequent [[ear infection]]s) become enraged at a very deep and [[primitive (biology)|primitive]] level.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt; This results in a lack of ability to attach or to be genuinely affectionate to others. [[Psychological repression|Suppressed]] or unconscious rage is theorized to prevent the child from forming bonds with caregivers and leads to behavior problems when the rage erupts into unchecked aggression. Such children are said to fail to develop a conscience, to not trust others, to seek control rather than closeness, to resist the authority of caregivers, and to engage in endless power struggles. They are seen as highly manipulative and as trying to avoid true attachments while simultaneously striving to control those around them through manipulation and superficial sociability. Such children are said to be at risk of becoming [[psychopath]]s who will go on to engage in very serious delinquent, criminal, and antisocial behaviors if left untreated.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt; The tone in which the attributes of these children are described has been characterized as "demonizing".&lt;ref name=pg186&gt;{{harvnb|Prior|Glaser|2006|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of this treatment also believe that emotional attachment of a child to a caregiver begins during the [[prenatal]] period, during which the unborn child is aware of the mother's thoughts and emotions. If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.&lt;ref name="Mercer et al.92"&gt;{{harvnb|Mercer|Sarner|Rosa|2003|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the child has had a peaceful [[gestation]], but after birth suffers pain or ungratified needs during the first year, attachment will again be blocked. If the child reaches the toddler period safely, but is not treated with strict authority during the second year, according to the so-called "attachment cycle", attachment problems will result. Failure of attachment results in a lengthy list of mood and behavior problems, but these may not be revealed until the child is much older. According to attachment therapist Elizabeth Randolph, attachment problems can be diagnosed even in an asymptomatic child through observation of the child's inability to crawl backward on command.&lt;ref name="Mercer et al. 180"&gt;{{harvnb|Mercer|Sarner|Rosa|2003|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randolph"&gt;{{citation |author=Randolph E |year=2001 |title=Broken hearts, wounded minds |location=Evergreen, CO |publisher=RFR Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say holding therapies have been promoted as "attachment" therapies, even though they are more antithetical to than consistent with attachment theory,&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Nilsen p. 316"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Nilsen|2005|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not based on attachment theory or research.&lt;ref name="Berlin et al."/&gt; Indeed, they are considered incompatible.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"/&gt; There are many ways in which holding therapy/attachment therapy contradicts [[John Bowlby|Bowlby's]] attachment theory, e.g. attachment theory's fundamental and evidence-based statement that security is promoted by sensitivity.&lt;ref name=pg265/&gt; According to Mary Dozier "holding therapy does not emanate in any logical way from attachment theory or from attachment research".&lt;ref name="dozier 03"&gt;{{citation |author=Dozier M |title=Attachment-based treatment for vulnerable children |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=253–7 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12944219 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001596151 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730310001596151&amp;magic=pubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis and attachment disorder==
Attachment therapists claim to diagnose [[attachment disorder]],&lt;ref name="tfr81"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref name="tfr8282"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|pages=79, 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within attachment therapy, the diagnoses of attachment disorder and reactive attachment disorder are used in a manner not recognised in mainstream practice. Prior and Glaser describe two discourses on attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p. 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Prior|Glaser|2006|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is science-based, found in academic journals and books with careful reference to theory, international classifications and evidence. They list [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]], [[Mary Ainsworth|Ainsworth]], Tizard, Hodges, Chisholm, O'Connor and [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and colleagues as respected attachment theorists and researchers in the field. The other discourse is found in clinical practice, non-academic literature and on the [[Internet]] where claims are made which have no basis in attachment theory and for which there is no empirical evidence. In particular unfounded claims are made as to efficacy of treatments.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p. 183"/&gt; The Internet is considered essential to the popularization of holding therapy as an "attachment" therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Nilsen|2005|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APSAC Task Force describes the relationship between the proponents of attachment therapy and mainstream therapies as polarized. "This polarization is compounded by the fact that attachment therapy has largely developed outside the mainstream scientific and professional community and flourishes within its own networks of attachment therapists, treatment centers, caseworkers, and parent support groups. Indeed, proponents and critics of the controversial attachment therapies appear to move in different worlds."&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt;

===Diagnosis lists and questionnaires===
Both the APSAC Task Force and Prior and Glaser describe the proliferation of alternative "lists" and diagnoses, particularly on the Internet, by proponents of attachment therapy, that are not in accord with either DSM or ICD classifications and which are partly based on the unsubstantiated views of Zaslow and Menta&lt;ref name="Zaslow"/&gt; and Cline.&lt;ref name="Task Force Report, Chaffin et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pg186/&gt; According to the Task Force, "These types of lists are so nonspecific that high rates of [[false-positive]] diagnoses are virtually certain. Posting these types of lists on internet sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders."&lt;ref name=tfr83list&gt;{{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|pages=83–84|ps= “Many of the controversial attachment therapies have promulgated quite broad and nonspecific lists of symptoms purported to indicate when a child has an attachment disorder. For example, Reber (1996) provided a table that lists "common symptoms of RAD." The list includes problems or symptoms across multiple domains (social, emotional, behavioral and developmental) and ranges from DSM-IV criteria for RAD (e.g., superficial interactions with others, indiscriminate affection toward strangers, and lack of affection toward parents), to nonspecific behavior problems including destructive behaviors; developmental lags; refusal to make eye contact; cruelty to animals and siblings; lack of cause and effect thinking; preoccupation with fire, blood, and gore; poor peer relationships; stealing; lying; lack of a conscience; persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter; poor impulse control; abnormal speech patterns; fighting for control over everything; and hoarding or gorging on food. Others have promulgated checklists that suggest that among infants, "prefers dad to mom" or "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" are indicative of attachment problems (Buenning, 1999). Clearly, these lists of nonspecific problems extend far beyond the diagnostic criteria for RAD and beyond attachment relationship problems in general. These types of lists are so nonspecific that high rates of false-positive diagnoses are virtually certain. Posting these types of lists on internet sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior and Glaser describe the lists as "wildly inclusive" and state that many of the behaviors in the lists are likely to be the consequences of neglect and abuse rather than located within the attachment [[paradigm]]. Descriptions of children are frequently highly pejorative and "demonizing". Examples given from lists of attachment disorder symptoms found on the internet include lying, avoiding eye contact except when lying, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, fascination with fire, blood, gore and evil, food related issues (such as gorging or hoarding), cruelty to animals and lack of conscience. They also give an example from the Evergreen Consultants in Human Behavior which offers a 45-symptom checklist including bossiness, stealing, [[enuresis]] and language disorders.&lt;ref name=pg186/&gt;

A commonly used diagnostic checklist in attachment therapy is the ''Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire'' or "RADQ", which originated at the Institute for Attachment in Evergreen.&lt;ref name="RADQ"&gt;{{citation |author=Randolph EM |year=1996 |title=Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire |publisher=Institute for Attachment, Evergreen CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented not as an assessment of reactive attachment disorder but rather attachment disorder. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviors, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like [[Conduct Disorder]] and [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]] or are not related to attachment difficulties.&lt;ref name="Cappelletty et al."&gt;{{citation |quote=The findings showed that children in foster care have reported symptoms within the range typical of children not involved in foster care. The conclusion is that the RADQ has limited usefulness due to its lack of specificity with implications for treatment of children in foster care |vauthors=Cappelletty G, Brown M, Shumate S |title=Correlates of the Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire (RADQ) in a Sample of Children in Foster Placement |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=22 |issue=1 |date=February 2005 |pages= 71–84 |doi=10.1007/s10560-005-2556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely based on the earlier Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist which itself shows considerable overlap with even earlier checklists for indicators of [[sexual abuse]]. The Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist includes statements about the parent's feelings toward the child as well as statements about the child's behavior. For example, parental feelings are evaluated through responses to such statements as "Parent feels used" and "is wary of the child's motives if affection is expressed", and "Parents feel more angry and frustrated with this child than with other children". The child's behavior is referred to in such statements as "Child has a grandiose sense of self-importance" and "Child 'forgets' parental instructions or directives". The compiler of the RADQ claims validity by reference to the Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist. It also purports to diagnose attachment disorder for which there is no classification.&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{citation |author= Mercer J |title=Attachment Therapy: A Treatment without Empirical Support |journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice SRMHP Home|date=Fall{{ndash}}Winter 2002 |volume=1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critic has stated that a major problem of the RADQ is that it has not been validated against any established objective measure of emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name="Mercer J"&gt;{{citation |author=Mercer J |title=Coercive restraint therapies: a dangerous alternative mental health intervention |journal=MedGenMed |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=6 |year=2005 |pmid=16369232 |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/508956 |pmc=1681667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient recruitment===
In addition to concerns about the use of non-specific diagnostic checklists on the Internet being used as a marketing tool, the Task Force also noted the extreme claims made by proponents as to both the prevalence and effect of attachment disorders. Some proponents suggest most or a high proportion of adopted children are likely to suffer attachment disorder. Statistics on the prevalence of maltreatment are wrongly used to estimate the prevalence of RAD.&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; Problematical or less desirable styles such as insecure or disorganized attachment are conflated with attachment disorder. Children are labeled as "RADs", "RAD-kids" or "RADishes".&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; They are seen as manipulative, dishonest, without conscience and dangerous.&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; Some attachment therapy sites predict that attachment-disordered children will grow up to become violent predators or psychopaths unless they receive the treatment proposed.&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; A sense of urgency is created which serves to justify the application of aggressive and unconventional techniques.&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; One site was noted to contain the argument that [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], were examples of children who were attachment-disordered who "did not get help in time".&lt;ref name=tfr79/&gt; Foster Cline in his seminal work on attachment therapy ''Hope for high risk and rage filled children'' uses the example of [[Ted Bundy]].&lt;ref name="Cline"/&gt;

In answering the question posed as to how a treatment widely regarded by attachment clinicians and researchers as destructive and unethical came to be linked with attachment theory and to be seen as a viable and useful treatment, O'Connor and Nilson cite the use of the Internet to publicize attachment therapy and the lack of knowledgeable mainstream professionals or appropriate mainstream treatments or interventions. They set out recommendations for the better dissemination of both understanding of attachment theory and knowledge of the more recent evidence-based treatment options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Nilsen|2005|pages=316–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Stryker in her anthropological study "''The Road to Evergreen''" argues that adoptive families of institutionalized children who have difficulties transitioning to a nuclear family are attracted to the Evergreen model despite the controversy, because it legitimises and reanimates the same ideas about family and domesticity as does the adoption process itself, offering renewed hope of "normal" family life. Institutionalized or abused children often do not conform to adopters conceptualizations of family behaviours and roles. The Evergreen model pathologizes the child's behaviour by a medical diagnosis, thus legitimising the family. As well as the promise of working where traditional therapies fail, attachment therapy also offers the idea of attachment as a negotiable [[social contract]] that can be enforced in order to convert the unsatisfactory adoptee into the "emotional asset" the family requires. By the use of confrontation the model offers the means to [[Operant conditioning|condition]] children to comply with parental expectations. Where the therapy fails to achieve this the fault is attributed to the child's conscious choice to not be a family member, or the child's inability to perform as family material.&lt;ref name=stryker&gt;{{citation|author=Stryker R|title=The Road to Evergreen: Adoption, Attachment Therapy, and the Promise of Family|year=2010|publisher=Cornell University press|location=Ithaca, London|isbn=978-0-8014-4687-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrasting mainstream position===
{{See also|Attachment disorder|Reactive attachment disorder}}
Within mainstream practice, disorders of attachment are classified in [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]] as reactive attachment disorder (generally known as RAD), and [[Disinhibited attachment disorder]]. Both classification systems warn against automatic diagnosis based on abuse or neglect. Many symptoms are present in a variety of other more common and more easily treatable disorders. There is as yet no other accepted definition of attachment disorders.&lt;ref name="Boris &amp; Zeanah"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |year=1999 |title= Disturbance and disorders of attachment in infancy: An overview |journal=Infant Mental Health Journal |volume=20 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;1::AID-IMHJ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] (AACAP) practice parameter published in 2005, the question of whether attachment disorders can be reliably diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence.&lt;ref name="AACAP 05"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
Attachment therapy prospered during the 1980s and '90s as a consequence of both the influx of older adopted orphans from Eastern European and [[third world]] countries and the inclusion of [[reactive attachment disorder]] in the 1980 [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] which attachment therapists adopted as an alternative name for their existing unvalidated diagnosis of attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="crossman"/&gt;

According to the APSAC Task Force, these therapies are sufficiently prevalent to have prompted position statements or specific prohibitions against using coercion or restraint as a treatment by mainstream professional societies such as: [[American Psychological Association]] (Division on Child Maltreatment), [[National Association of Social Workers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.childrenintherapy.org/resolutions/index.html#nasw |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040401153923/http://childrenintherapy.org/resolutions/index.html |archivedate= 2004-04-01 |title= Speaking Out Against Attachment Therapy |work= Advocates for Children in Therapy website}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and its Utah Chapter), [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]],&lt;ref name="Task Force Report, Chaffin et al."/&gt; American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,&lt;ref name="AACAP 05"/&gt; and [[American Psychiatric Association]]. The Association for the Treatment and Training in the Attachment of Children, (ATTACh), an organization for professionals and families associated with attachment therapy, has also issued statements against coercive practices.&lt;ref name=attach06&gt;{{citation |title=ATTACh White paper on coercion |year=2006 |url=http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=ATTACh |accessdate=2008-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072425/http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=attach03/&gt; Two American states, Colorado and North Carolina, have outlawed rebirthing.&lt;ref name="act2"&gt;{{citation |title=North Carolina Bans "Rebirthing" |url= http://www.childrenintherapy.org/atnews/2003Aug2.html |author=Advocates for Children in Therapy |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been professional licensure sanctions against some leading proponents and successful criminal prosecutions and imprisonment of therapists and parents using attachment therapy techniques. Despite this, the treatments appear to be continuing among networks of attachment therapists, attachment therapy centers, caseworkers, and adoptive or foster parents.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt; The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy|ACT]] states, "Attachment Therapy is a growing, underground movement for the 'treatment' of children who pose disciplinary problems to their parents or caregivers."&lt;ref name="ACTwhatis2"/&gt;

Rachel Stryker in her anthropological study "The Road to Evergreen" states that attachment therapies "of all stripes" are increasingly popular in the USA and that the number of therapists associated with the Evergreen model registering with ATTACh grows each year. She cites the large number of formerly institutionalized domestic and foreign adoptees in the USA and the apparently higher risk of disruption of foreign adoptions, of which there were 216,000 between 1998 and 2008.&lt;ref name=stryker/&gt;

The practice of holding therapy is not confined to the US. Prior and Glaser cite at least one clinic in the UK.&lt;ref name=pg263/&gt; Attachment therapists from the USA have conducted conferences in the UK.&lt;ref name=stryker/&gt; The British Association for Adoption and Fostering, (BAAF), has issued an extensive position statement on the subject which covers not only physical coercion but also the underlying theoretical principles.&lt;ref name="baaf"&gt;{{citation |title=Attachment Disorders, their Assessment and Intervention/Treatment |authors=BAAF Position Statement 4 |accessdate=2008-10-19 |url=http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002051146/http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been thought, until recently, that therapists calling themselves "attachment therapists" practising in the UK tended to be practising conventional forms of psychotherapy based on attachment theory.&lt;ref name=keys/&gt; In 2009 The British Journal of Social Work accepted an article rehabilitating holding therapy, "To Have and to Hold: Questions about a Therapeutic Service for Children" describing an earlier study involving the Keys Attachment Centre in Rossendale, Lancashire and the surrounding [[Keys Attachment Homes]]. In 2012, first-hand accounts from a survivor and a number of professionals provided evidence that the coercive Evergreen model of holding therapy had been systematically used to treat children in Local Authority care within a programme in North West England.&lt;ref name="Chaika"&gt;{{citation|author=Chaika, Anya|year=2012|title=Invisible England: The Testimony of David Hanson|page=29|publisher=Chalk Circle Press|location= London|isbn= 9781478205937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
The APSAC Task Force stated that proponents of attachment therapy correctly point out that most critics have never actually observed any of the treatments they criticize or visited any of the centers where the controversial therapies are practiced. Proponents argue that their therapies present no physical risk if undertaken properly and that critics' concerns are based on unrepresentative occurrences and misapplications of techniques, or misunderstanding by parents. Holding is described as gentle or nurturing and it is maintained that intense, cathartic approaches are necessary to help children with attachment disorders. Their evidence for this is primarily clinical experience and testimonials.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt;

According to the APSAC Task Force, there are controversies within the attachment therapy community about coercive practices. There has been a move away from coercive and confrontational models towards attunement and emotional regulation amongst some leaders in the field, notably Hughes, Kelly and Popper. A number of therapies are quite different from those that have led to the abuse and deaths of children in much publicized court cases. The Task Force, however, points out that all the therapies, including those using frankly coercive practices, present themselves as humane, respectful and nurturing, therefore caution is advised.&lt;ref name="Reply"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Chaffin M, Hanson R, Saunders BE |title= Reply to Letters |journal=Child Maltreat |year=2006a |volume=11|page=381 |doi=10.1177/1077559506292636 |accessdate=2008-10-19|url=http://cmx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/381 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners condemn the most dangerous techniques but continue to practice other coercive techniques.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt; Others have taken a public stand against coercion. The Task Force was of the view that all could benefit from more transparency and specificity as to how the therapy is behaviorally delivered.&lt;ref name="Reply"/&gt;

In 2001, 2003 and 2006, ATTACh, an organization set up by Foster Cline and associates, issued a series of statements in which they progressively changed their stance on coercive practices. In 2001, after the death of Candace Newmaker they stated "The child will never be restrained or have pressure put on them in such a manner that would interfere with their basic life functions such as breathing, circulation, temperature, etc."&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{citation |author=Fowler KA |title=Book Review |journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=Spring–Summer 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A White Paper, formally accepted in April 2007, "unequivocally state(s) our opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting." They acknowledge ATTACh's historical links with catharsis, provocation of rage, and intense confrontation, among other overtly coercive techniques (and indeed continue to offer for sale books by controversial proponents) but state that the organization has evolved significantly away from earlier positions. They state that their recent evolution is due to a number of factors including tragic events resulting from such techniques, an influx of members practicing other techniques such as attunement and a "fundamental shift ... away from viewing these children as driven by a conscious need for control toward an understanding that their often controlling and aggressive behaviors are automatic, learned [[defence mechanism|defensive]] responses to profoundly overwhelming experiences of fear and terror."&lt;ref name=attach07&gt;{{citation |title=ATTACh White paper on coercion |year=2007 |url=http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=ATTACh |accessdate=2008-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072425/http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=attach03&gt;{{citation |title=ATTACh Position Statement Regarding Coercive Treatment |year=2003 |url=http://www.attach.org/position.htm |accessdate=2008-03-16 |publisher=ATTACh}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being of the view that authoritative practices are necessary, and that nurturing touch and treatment aimed at the perceived developmental rather than chronological age are an integral part of the therapy, the White Paper promotes the techniques of attunement, sensitivity and [[emotional dysregulation|regulation]] and deprecates coercive practices such as enforced holding or enforced eye contact.&lt;ref name="attach07"/&gt;

==History==
Matthew Speltz of the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]] states that the roots of attachment therapy are traceable to psychologist Robert Zaslow and his "Z-process" in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Speltz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaslow"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Zaslow R, Menta M |year=1975 |title=The psychology of the Z-process: Attachment and activity |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=San Jose University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaslow attempted to force attachment in those suffering from [[autism]] by creating rage while holding them against their will. He believed this would lead to a breakdown in their [[defense mechanisms]], making them more receptive to others.&lt;ref name="Speltz"/&gt; Zaslow thought attachment arose when an infant experienced feelings of pain, fear and rage, and then made eye contact with the carer who relieved those feelings. If an infant did not experience this cycle of events by having his fear and rage relieved, the infant would not form an attachment and would not make eye contact with other people.&lt;ref name="Mercer75"&gt;{{harvnb|Mercer|Sarner|Rosa|2003|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaslow believed that creating pain and rage and combining them with eye contact would cause attachment to occur, long after the normal age for such developments.&lt;ref name="Mercer75"/&gt; Holding therapies derive from these "rage-reduction" techniques applied by Zaslow.&lt;ref name=o317&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Nilsen|2005|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holding is not used for safety purposes but is initiated for the purpose of provoking strong negative emotions such as fear and anger. The child's release typically depends upon his or her compliance with the therapist's [[wikt:clinical|clinical]] agenda or goals.&lt;ref name="Speltz"/&gt; In 1971, Zaslow surrendered his California psychology license following an injury to a patient during rage-reduction therapy.&lt;ref name="Zaslow 1970"&gt;{{citation |title=Accusation against Zaslow |authors=The Executive Secretary of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of California |url=http://www.kidscomefirst.info/zaslow.pdf |format=PDF |year=1971 |accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaslow's ideas on the use of the Z-process and holding for autism have been dispelled by research on the
genetic/biologic causes of autism.&lt;ref name="Speltz"/&gt;

Zaslow and his "Z-process", a physically rough version of holding therapy, influenced Foster Cline (known as the "father of attachment therapy") and associates at his clinic in Evergreen&lt;ref name="Mercer43"&gt;{{harvnb|Mercer|Sarner|Rosa|2003|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key tenet of Zaslow's approach was the notion of "breaking through" a child's defenses—based on the model of [[defense mechanism|ego defenses]] borrowed from [[psychoanalytic]] theory, which critics state has been misapplied. The "breaking through" [[metaphor]] was then applied to children whose attachments were thought to be impaired.&lt;ref name=o317/&gt; The clinic, originally called the Youth Behavior Program, was subsequently renamed the Attachment Center at Evergreen.&lt;ref name=act/&gt;

In 1983, [[ethologist]] Nikolas [[Tinbergen]] published a book recommending the use of holding therapy by parents as a treatment or "cure" for autistic children. Tinbergen based his ideas on his methods of observational study of birds. Parents were advised to hold their autistic children despite resistance and to endeavor to maintain eye contact and share emotions.&lt;ref name=tin&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Tinbergen N, Tinbergen EA |title=Autistic children: New hope for a cure |year=1983 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tinbergen believed that autism related to a failure in the bond between mother and child caused by "traumatic influences" and that enforced holding and eye contact could establish such a relationship and rescue the child from autism.&lt;ref name=tin/&gt; Tinbergen's interpretations of autism were without scientific rigor and were contrary to the then growing acceptance that autism had a genetic cause. Despite the lack of a sound theoretical or scientific base, holding therapy as a treatment for autism is still practiced in some parts of the world, notably Europe.&lt;ref name="bish"&gt;{{citation |title=Forty years on: Uta Frith's contribution to research on autism and dyslexia, 1966-2006 |author=Bishop DVM |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=61 |issue=1 |date=January 2008 |pages=16–26 |doi=10.1080/17470210701508665 |pmid=18038335 |pmc=2409181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speltz cites child psychiatrist Martha Welch and her 1988 book, ''Holding Time'',&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt; as the next significant development. Like Zaslow and Tinbergen, Welch recommended holding therapy as a treatment for autism.&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt; Like Tinbergen, Welch believed autism was caused by the failure of the attachment relationship between mother and child.&lt;ref name="tinW"&gt;{{citation |author=Welch M |veditors=Tinbergen N, Tinbergen EA |year=1983 |title=Appendix |encyclopedia=Autistic children: New hope for a cure |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers were instructed to hold their defiant child, provoking anger and rage, until such time as the child ceased to resist, at which point a [[affectional bond|bonding]] process was believed to begin.&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt;

Foster Cline and associates at the Attachment Center at Evergreen, Colorado began to promote the use of the same or similar holding techniques with adopted, maltreated children who were said to have an "attachment disorder". This was replicated elsewhere such as at "The Center" in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name="Speltz"/&gt; A number of other clinics arose in Evergreen, [[Colorado]], set up by those involved in or trained at the Attachment Center at Evergreen (renamed the Institute for Attachment and Development in about 2002).&lt;ref name= act&gt;{{citation |last=Advocates for children in Therapy |title=Foster W. Cline |url=http://www.advocatesforchildrenintherapy.org/proponents/cline.html |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included one set up by Connell Watkins, formerly an associate of Foster Cline at the Attachment Center and its clinical director. Watkins was one of the therapists convicted in the [[Candace Newmaker]] case in 2001 in which a child was asphyxiated during a rebirthing process in the course of a two-week attachment therapy "intensive".&lt;ref name="AOJ"&gt;{{Citation|title=Affirmation of judgement and sentence on appeal by Watkins |url=http://www.kidscomefirst.info/msoAB8FC.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907130015/http://www.kidscomefirst.info/msoAB8FC.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster Cline gave up his license and moved to another state following an investigation of a separate attachment therapy related incident.&lt;ref name=act/&gt;

In addition to the notion of "breaking through" defence mechanisms, other metaphors were adopted by practitioners relating to the supposed effects of early deprivation, abuse or neglect on the child's ability to form relationships. These included the idea of the child's development being "frozen" and treatment being required to "unfreeze" development.&lt;ref name=o317/&gt; Practitioners of holding therapy also added some components of Bowlby's attachment theory and the therapy came to be known as attachment therapy. Language from attachment theory is used but descriptions of the practices contain ideas and techniques based on misapplied metaphors deriving from Zaslow and psychoanalysis, not attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Nilsen|2005|pages=317–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prior and Glaser "there is no empirical evidence to support Zaslow's theory. The concept of suppressed rage has, nevertheless, continued to be a central focus explaining the children's behavior."&lt;ref name=pg263&gt;{{harvnb|Prior|Glaser|2006|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cline's privately published work ''Hope for high risk and rage filled children'' also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist [[Milton Erickson]] as a source, and reprints parts of a case of Erickson's published in 1961.&lt;ref name="Cline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{citation |author=Erickson MH |year=1961 |title=The identification of a secure reality |journal=Family Process |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=294–303 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1962.00294.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report describes the case of a divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child for hours at a time and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were [[psychological trauma|trauma]] bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.&lt;ref name="Cline"/&gt;

In addition, proponents believed that holding induced age regression, enabling a child to make up for physical affection missed earlier in life.&lt;ref name=o317/&gt; Regression is key to the holding therapy approach.&lt;ref name=pg265&gt;{{harvnb|Prior|Glaser|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attachment therapy, breaking down the child's resistance by confrontational techniques is thought to reduce the child to an infantile state, thus making the child receptive to forming attachment by the application of early parenting behaviors such as bottle feeding, cradling, rocking and eye contact.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{citation |title=Death by theory |journal=Scientific American |url=http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=000490DD-702D-10A9-A47783414B7F0000 |accessdate=2008-02-12 |author=Shermer M |date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but by no means all, attachment therapists have used rebirthing techniques to aid regression. The roots of the form of rebirthing used within attachment therapy lie in [[primal therapy]] (sometimes known as primal scream therapy), another therapy based on beliefs in very early trauma and the transformational nature of age regression.&lt;ref name="crossman"&gt;{{citation |author=Crossman P |title=The Etiology of a Social Epidemic |publisher=Skeptic Report |accessdate=2008-10-19 |url=http://www.skepticreport.com/pseudoscience/attachmenttherapy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby explicitly rejected the notion of regression stating "present knowledge of infant and child development requires that a theory of developmental pathways should replace theories that invoke specific phases of development in which it is held a person may become fixated and/or to which he may regress."&lt;ref name=pg263/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby"&gt;{{citation |author=Bowlby J |year=1998 |title=A Secure Base: Clinical Application of Attachment Theory (A Tavistock professional book) |location=London |publisher=Routledge |page=269 |isbn=0-422-62230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to O'Connor and Nilsen, although other aspects of treatment are applied, the holding component has attracted most attention because proponents believe it is an essential ingredient. They also considered the lack of available and suitable interventions from mainstream professionals as essential to the popularization of holding therapy as an attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Nilsen p. 316"/&gt;

In 2003, an issue of ''Attachment &amp; Human Development'' was devoted to the subject of attachment therapy with articles by well-known experts in the field of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Special Issue: Current perspectives on assessment and treatment of attachment disorders |editor=O'Connor TG |editor2=Zeanah CH |date=September 2003 |journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=219–326 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g714022753 |doi= 10.1080/14616730310001594009 |pmid=12944214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment researchers and authors condemned it as empirically unfounded, theoretically flawed and clinically unethical.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"/&gt; It has also been described as potentially abusive and a [[pseudoscientific]] intervention, not based on attachment theory or research, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children including at least six documented child fatalities.&lt;ref name="Berlin et al."/&gt; In 2006, the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC) Task Force reported on the subjects of attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems and laid down guidelines for the future diagnosis and treatment of attachment disorders.&lt;ref name=tfr83/&gt; The APSAC Task Force was largely critical of Attachment Therapy's theoretical base, practices, claims to an evidence base, [[non-specific symptom]]s lists published on the internet, claims that traditional treatments do not work and dire predictions for the future of children who do not receive attachment therapy. "Although focused primarily on specific attachment therapy techniques, the controversy also extends to the theories, [[diagnoses]], diagnostic practices, beliefs, and [[social group]] [[norm (sociology)|norms]] supporting these techniques, and to the patient recruitment and advertising practices used by their proponents."&lt;ref name=tfr77/&gt; In 2007, Scott Lilienfeld included holding therapy as one of the potentially harmful therapies (PHT's) at level 1 in his ''Psychological Science'' review.&lt;ref name="lilien"&gt;{{citation |author=Lilienfeld SO |year=2007 |title=Psychological treatments that cause harm |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=53–70|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00029.x|pmid=26151919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing it as "unfortunately" referred to as "attachment therapy", Mary Dozier and [[Michael Rutter]] consider it critical to differentiate it from treatments derived from attachment theory.&lt;ref name="DozRut"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Dozier M, Rutter M|lastauthoramp=yes |contribution=Challenges to the Development of Attachment Relationships Faced by Young Children in Foster and Adoptive Care |editor1=Cassidy J |editor2=Shaver PR |title=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |year=2008|edition=2nd |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York: London |isbn=978-1-60623-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mistaken association between attachment therapy and attachment theory may have resulted in a relatively unenthusiastic view towards the latter among some practitioners despite its relatively profound lines of research in the field of socioemotional development.&lt;ref name="Ziv"/&gt;

==Claims==
According to the APSAC Task Force, proponents of attachment therapy commonly assert that their therapies alone are effective for attachment-disordered children and that traditional treatments are ineffective or harmful.&lt;ref name=tfr78/&gt; The APSAC Task Force expressed concern over claims by therapies to be "[[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]]", or the ''only'' evidence-based therapy, when the Task Force found no credible evidence base for any such therapy so advertised.&lt;ref name="apsac quote"&gt;"Some proponents have claimed that research exists that supports their methods, or that their methods are evidence based, or are even the sole evidence-based approach in existence, yet these proponents provide no citations to credible scientific research sufficient to support these claims (Becker-Weidman, n.d.-b). This Task Force was unable to locate any methodologically adequate [[clinical trials]] in the published peer-reviewed scientific literature to support any of these claims for effectiveness, let alone claims that these treatments are the only effective available approaches." Task Force Report, {{harvnb|Chaffin|Hanson|Saunders|2006c|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did it accept more recent claims to evidence base in its November 2006 Reply.&lt;ref name="Reply"/&gt;

Two approaches on which published studies have been undertaken are holding therapy&lt;ref name="Myeroff"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Myeroff R, Mertlich G, Gross J |title=Comparative effectiveness of holding therapy with aggressive children |journal=Child Psychiatry Hum Dev |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=303–13 |year=1999 |pmid=10422354 |doi=10.1023/A:1021349116429}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dyadic developmental psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman 2006"&gt;{{citation |author=Becker-Weidman A |date=April 2006 |title=Treatment for Children with Trauma-Attachment Disorders: Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=147–171  |doi=10.1007/s10560-005-0039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these non-randomized studies concluded that the treatment method studied was effective.

Dyadic developmental psychotherapy was developed by psychologist Daniel Hughes, described by the Task Force as a "leading attachment therapist". Hughes' website gave a list of attachment therapy techniques, repeated by the APSAC Task Force from an earlier website, which he stated do not or should not form part of dyadic developmental psychotherapy, which the Task Force took as a description of attachment therapy techniques.&lt;ref name="Replyquote"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Chaffin M, Hanson R, Saunders BE |title=Reply to Letters |journal =Child Maltreat |year=2006b |volume=11 |page=381 |doi=10.1177/1077559506292636 |accessdate=2008-10-19 |url=http://cmx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/381 |quote=1.

Becker-Weidman's study was described by the Task Force as "an important first step toward learning the facts about DDP outcomes" but falling far short of the criteria necessary to constitute an evidence base.&lt;ref name="Reply"/&gt;

Some studies are still being undertaken on coercive therapies. A nonrandomized, before-and-after 2006 pilot study by Welch (the progenitor of "holding time") et al. on Welch's "prolonged parent-child embrace therapy" was conducted on children with a range of diagnoses for [[behavior|behavioral disorder]]s and claimed to show significant improvement.&lt;ref name="Welsh et al."/&gt;

In March 2007, attachment therapy was placed on a list of treatments that have the potential to cause harm to clients in the [[Association for Psychological Science|APS]] journal, ''Perspectives on Psychological Science''. Concern was expressed about methods that involve holding and restraint, and the lack of randomized, controlled experiments showing the effectiveness of the treatment.&lt;ref name="lilien"/&gt;

In 2010 a modest social work study and "invitation to a debate", based on interviews with the deliverers and recipients of a therapeutic intervention incorporating non-coercive holding at one centre in the UK, called for further consideration of the use of this type of intervention. The intervention was not described as "holding therapy" but as using a degree of holding in the course of therapy. Although recipients were generally positive about the therapy received, the holding aspect was the least liked. The authors call for research and a debate on issues of what constitutes "coercion" and the distinctions between the different variants of "holding" in therapy.&lt;ref name=keys&gt;{{citation|doi= 10.1093/bjsw/bcp078|journal= British Journal of Social Work|year=2010|volume= 40|pages= 1534–1552|title=To Have and to Hold: Questions about a Therapeutic Service for Children|vauthors=Sudbery J, Shardlow SM, Huntington AE |issue= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of cases of serious harm to children in which controversial attachment therapy techniques, theories or belief systems have been implicated. An estimated six children have died as a consequence of the more coercive forms of such treatments or the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris (2003)"&gt;{{citation |author=Boris NW |title=Attachment, aggression and holding: a cautionary tale |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=245–7 |year=2003 |pmid= 12944217 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001593947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Andrea Swenson, 1990; a 13-year-old adopted girl undergoing attachment therapy at The Attachment Center, Evergreen, Colorado. She was placed with "therapeutic foster parents". When the insurance company refused to continue to pay for her treatment, the adoptive parents were asked to allow the foster parents to adopt Andrea so that a fresh claim could be made. Andrea, having asked her foster parents what would happen if she took an overdose of drugs or slit her wrist, and been told she would die, took an overdose of aspirin. She was violently ill during the night and was incoherent, breathing heavily and still vomiting in the morning. Nevertheless, the foster parents went bowling, leaving her alone. A visitor found her dead in the hallway. The suit was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Karen |last=Auge |newspaper=DenverPost.com |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-06-25 |title= Alternative therapies not new in Evergreen |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/news0617d.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010309205804/http://www.denverpost.com/news/news0617d.htm |archivedate = 2001-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Advocates for Children in Therapy |title=Victim of Attachment Therapy |url=http://www.childrenintherapy.org/victims/swenson.html|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the post-mortem he was found to have 200 bruises and five old broken ribs. The adoptive mother was convicted as the abuser and the adoptive father of being aware but doing nothing to prevent it or seek help. Foster Cline gave evidence for both parents claiming Lucas suffered from reactive attachment disorder and that living with such a child was like living "in a situation with the same psychic pressures as those experienced in a concentration camp or cult" and that the parents were in no way responsible for the genesis of Lucas' alleged difficult behaviors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4683">The '''Better Care Fund''' is a pooled budget, initially £5.3 billion announced by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron Government]] in the June 2013 Spending Round. Local councils are allowed to increase the local fund.  The intention is to shift resources into social care and community services from the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] budget in England and so save £1 billion a year by keeping patients out of hospital.

Each of the 151 health and wellbeing boards is required to produce a local plan, and these plans are checked by [[NHS England]].  Analysis of the plans submitted showed that social care would benefit from the fund by about £2 billion. This is four times the amount projected for hospitals to save from reduced activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Social care to benefit most under better care fund|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-social-care-to-benefit-most-under-better-care-fund/5076445.article#.VJnB8F4gA|accessdate=23 December 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] said in November 2014 that the plans had been inadequately thought through and were based on “optimism rather than evidence”. There was no evidence that showed that integrated care reduces unplanned hospital admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS facing £700m black hole over failing Better Care Fund|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-facing-700m-black-hole-over-failing-better-care-fund-9852400.html|accessdate=23 December 2014|publisher=Independent|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Maude]] praised [[Inclusion Healthcare]] at a speech in December 2014 about the Fund saying the company could provide care more cheaply and simply than the NHS. He said the fund was unlikely to lift the pressure from overcrowded hospitals because of “endless process and bureaucracy” in the NHS. He related how Inclusion had helped a homeless man with leg ulcers who was refusing to go into hospital because he could not afford to put his dog in kennels while he was there  by writing "a cheque for £200 or whatever it cost to have the dog vaccinated and put into kennels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lessons from the UK: why public servants need space to fail|url=http://www.themandarin.com.au/14649-public-servants-need-space-fail-uk-minister/?pgnc=1|accessdate=23 December 2014|publisher=The Mandarin|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to  Maude, the firm say "actually if we had still been in the NHS we could never have done that without endless process and bureaucracy and auditing and which budget does it come out of, and how do we account for it, and it would never have happened”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tory Francis Maude says NHS reforms hinge on inclusion of private firms|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/22/nhs-better-care-fund-francis-maude-private-firms|accessdate=23 December 2014|publisher=Guardian|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] and the [[Healthcare Financial Managers Association]] surveyed the ambitious plans for saving money through integration financed by the BCF in December 2015 and concluded that 80% were likely to fail and that many were hampering progress, and “giving integration a bad name”.  Targets for reduced hospital admission had generally not been delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four-fifths of areas expect to miss BCF targets, survey finds|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/sectors/social-care/four-fifths-of-areas-expect-to-miss-bcf-targets-survey-finds/7000890.article|accessdate=8 February 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] produced a report saying that the £5.3 billion spent in 2015/16 had not delivered value for money.  Emergency hospital admissions had increased by 87,000 between 2014/15 and 2015/16, rather than the planned reduction of 106,000, which had cost an additional £311 million.  Delayed transfers of care increased by 185,000 days, rather than the planned reduction of 293,000, which had cost £146 million more. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS vanguard plans to save £900m by 2020 ‘optimistic’, says NAO|url=http://www.thecommissioningreview.com/article/nhs-vanguard-plans-save-£900m-2020-‘optimistic’-says-nao|accessdate=11 February 2017|publisher=Commissioning Review|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The CMA (AAMA) Certification/Recertification Examination==

The CMA (AAMA) [[Certification]]/Recertification Exam is drawn from an in-depth analysis of the general, clinical, and administrative tasks medical assistants perform on a daily basis, according to the Occupational Analysis of the CMA (AAMA).&lt;ref name="Occupational Analysis"&gt;[http://aama-ntl.org/resources/library/OA.pdf Occupational Analysis of the CMA (AAMA)]''American Association of Medical Assistants''. Retrieved 2010-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Board of Medical Examiners]] (NBME) serves as test consultant for the exam. 

Examination questions are formulated by the AAMA Certifying Board's Task Force for Test Construction, a group composed of practicing medical assistants, [[physician]]s, and medical assisting [[educator]]s from across the United States. Alongside the NBME, the Task Force updates the CMA (AAMA) Exam to reflect the changes in the day-to-day responsibilities of medical assistants, as well as developments in medical knowledge and [[technology]]. The examination tests knowledge in three major areas: general [[medical knowledge]] (e.g., [[terminology]] and [[anatomy]]), administrative knowledge (e.g., [[management]] and [[insurance]] processing), and clinical knowledge (e.g., medical preparation and [[pharmacology]]).&lt;ref name="Rise Above"&gt;[http://www.aama-ntl.org/resources/library/CMACred.pdf The CMA (AAMA) Credential: Rise Above the Crowd]. ''American Association of Medical Assistants''. Retrieved 2010-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible for the exam, an applicant must be a graduate of a medical assisting program accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs]] (CAAHEP) or the [[Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools]] (ABHES).&lt;ref name="Exam Eligibilty"&gt;[http://www.aama-ntl.org/resources/library/CertElig.pdf CMA (AAMA) Certification/Recertification Exam Eligibility]. ''American Association of Medical Assistants''. Retrieved 2010-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The exam is offered year-round at test centers nationwide.

== Recertification of the CMA (AAMA) credential ==

Every 60 months, the CMA (AAMA) is required to keep the credential current by recertifying.&lt;ref name="CE Application"&gt;[http://www.aama-ntl.org/resources/library/RecertCEAppWeb.pdf CMA (AAMA) Recertification by Continuing Education Application]. ''American Association of Medical Assistants''. Retrieved 2010-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The credential must be current for a medical assistant to use it in connection with [[employment]]. Certification status is a matter of public record and may be released, and also may be [http://www.aama-ntl.org/employers/verify.aspx verified] on the AAMA website. MedicalAssistantEdu.org

A CMA (AAMA) holder can recertify one of two ways: by earning 60 recertification points through [[continuing education]],&lt;ref name="CE Application" /&gt; or by retaking and passing the CMA (AAMA) Certification/Recertification Exam.&lt;ref name="Candidate Application"/&gt;

'''CURE International''' is a Christian [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[New Cumberland, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cure.org/blog/2011/02/the-mission-of-cure/|title=The Mission of CURE|year=2013|publisher=CURE|accessdate=25 April 2014|quote=As a Christian organization, we can help them through this difficult time. For the last 2,000 years, what they are looking for has been called the “kingdom of God.” It is something to obtain in the future, but it also something here now. It is a reference to Jesus but is also within those who follow Him. Helping people find that kingdom of God is the other half of what we do. So the answer to my question is simple: CURE International, healing the sick and proclaiming the kingdom of God. That’s our mission!}}&lt;/ref&gt; CURE's efforts are focused on providing [[medical care]] to children suffering primarily from [[orthopedic]] and [[neurological]] conditions.  The organization's stated mission is "healing the sick and proclaiming the kingdom of God." The organization operates hospitals in [[Afghanistan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Niger]], the [[Philippines]], [[Uganda]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Zambia]]. The organization also runs specialty programs for [[clubfoot]] and [[hydrocephalus]] in an additional 19 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cure.org/map|title=CURE International|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Bangladesh]] and [[Honduras]].

==History==
The organization was founded in 1996 by Dr. C. Scott Harrison and his wife, Sally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaidya, et al.|first1=Anuja|title=26 Spine Surgeons Involved in Humanitarian Efforts|url=http://www.beckersspine.com/lists/item/18121-26-spine-surgeons-involved-in-humanitarian-efforts.html|website=Becker's Spine Review|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years earlier, Harrison had traveled to [[Malawi, Africa]] to perform spine surgery and teach higher level orthopedic surgery skills to local surgeons. In the years following, Harrison and his wife made many trips back, discovering a need for children with orthopedic disabilities. When his tenure as CEO and President of Kirschner Medical was over, Harrison created the Crippled Children's United Rehabilitation Effort&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ccure.org/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-16 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20001019224249/http://ccure.org/# |archive-date=2000-10-19 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCURE or C²URE, later CURE), hoping to meet that need. CURE's first hospital opened in 1998 in [[Kenya]]. Today, it is the largest provider of pediatric surgical care in the developing world. Harrison stepped down as President in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://cure.org/2012/05/cure-international-appoints-dale-eugene-brantner-as-new-chief-executive-officer/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospitals==

===Current hospitals===
[[Afghanistan]]: CURE accepted the invitation from [[Afghan Ministry of Public Health]] to take over a hospital located in [[Kabul]] in January, 2005. The hospital offers care for 8,000 patients each year and training programs for doctors and nurses in obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery and general practice. In the fall of 2006, CURE partnered with [[Smile Train]] to develop a cleft lip and cleft palate surgical training program. 

On 24 April 2014, three CURE physicians were killed by an Afghan security guard, among them one American, Dr. Jerry Umanos, a [[pediatrician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/american-doctors-killed-kabul-hospital-shooting/story?id=23450132|title=American Father, Son Among Victims in Kabul Hospital Shooting|date=24 April 2014|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Umanos' wife, who forgave the gunman, commented on her husband's "love for the Afghan people" and "desire to be the hands and feet of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wife-us-doctor-slain-afghan-hospital-forgives-gunman/story?id=23456989|title=Wife of US Doctor Slain in Afghan Hospital Forgives Gunman|last=Curry|first=Colleen|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=25 April 2014|quote="I know Jerry would also like everybody to know about his love for the Afghan people," she said. "And we don’t hold any ill will towards the Afghan people in general or even the gunman who did this." Mrs. Umanos, who said she also spent several years working in Afghanistan, made it clear that her husband was a religious man. "Jerry always wanted us to serve underserved populations and Afghanistan was just one of them.

[[Uganda]]: Specializing in treating neurosurgical needs, the [[CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda]] opened in 2000 and has been recognized as a global leader in treatment of hydrocephalus. The hospital, located in [[Mbale]], also treats children with neural tube defects, spina bifida, epilepsy, and brain tumors. The training program brings in surgeons from many countries, including Bangladesh, the U.S., and Ghana.

[[United Arab Emirates]]: The CURE [[Oasis Hospital, Al Ain|Oasis Hospital]], located in [[Al Ain]], was established in 1960 to bring American medical care to the UAE. The hospital delivers 3,500 babies and treats over 122,000 patients annually. CURE acquired the hospital in 2006.

[[Zambia]]: The Beit CURE International Hospital of Zambia was established in 2004 in [[Lusaka]] when CURE signed an agreement with the Zambian Ministry of Health to operate a pediatric teaching hospital, specializing in treatment and care of children living with disabilities. The Beit Trust, a UK-based charity, donated $1.5 million to support construction of the hospital as a centennial gift to the people of Zambia. The hospital partners with Smile Train and has a hip replacement program.

====Tebow CURE Hospital====
[[File:Tebow CURE Hospital.jpg|thumb|The Tebow CURE Hospital in Davao City, Philippines]]
CURE and the Tebow Foundation announced plans to build a children's hospital in the fall of 2011 in [[the Philippines]], the country where [[ESPN]] broadcaster [[Tim Tebow]] was born. The Tebow CURE Hospital in [[Davao City]], on the island of [[Mindanao]], will hold 30 beds and will specialize in [[orthopedics]]. Construction began in January 2012 and was completed in late 2014, with a grand opening in May 2015. The project is estimated to cost $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Associated Press|title=Tim Tebow foundation to build hospital|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7239419/tim-tebow-foundation-help-build-children-hospital-philippines|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed hospitals===
[[Dominican Republic]]: The Centro de Ortopedia y Especialidades CURE International, established in 2003, was located in [[Santo Domingo]]. It served approximately 700 outpatients per month. The hospital also sent surgical teams into [[Haiti]] and responded to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] by sending in one of the first surgical teams into that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/12213805|title=Born for this Moment - CURE International's response to the Haitian earthquake|publisher=CURE International|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital ceased doing surgical operations in 2018, but CURE continues work in the country through its specialty clubfoot program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cure.org/dominican-republic/|title=CURE Dominican Republic|publisher=CURE International|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honduras]]: In 2013, the CURE Internacional Hospital de Ortopedia Pediátrica, located in [[San Pedro Sula]], closed due to increasing insecurity in the country, and a lack of funding from the government. During its four years of operation, approximately 20,000 children were treated with orthopedic corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2013/07/25/cierran-hospital-de-ortopedia-y-llevaran-equipo-a-dominicana/|title=Cierran Hospital de Ortopedia y llevarán equipo a Dominicana|publisher=latribuna.hn|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; CURE continues to work in the country through its specialty clubfoot and hydrocephalus programs.

==Specialty programs==
CURE Clubfoot: [[Clubfoot]], a congenital deformity making walking difficult or impossible, can be corrected, using the surgery-free [[Ponseti Method]] for $250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cure.org/downloads/site/clubfoot/ccw-creating_a_countrywide_program_model.pdf Creating country wide program for Ponseti Method] CURE, Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; CURE Clubfoot's goal is to eradicate clubfoot in the developing world, with over 220,000 children born each year with the deformity. Through partnerships with other international NGOs, the donor community and in-country partners, CURE has enrolled over 100,000 children&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/cure/clubfoot/prweb14524818.htm ''100,000 Children Rescued from Life-long Clubfoot Disability''] JULY 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; in 18 countries with 291 clinics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cure.org/clubfoot/ CURE Clubfoot] CURE, Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

CURE Hydrocephalus:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cure.org/hydrocephalus CURE Hydrocephalus]&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides surgeons the training and equipment to combat the condition. Surgeons are trained in multiple forms of [[hydrocephalus]] treatment, including a “shuntless” procedure known as the [[Benjamin Warf|Warf]] procedure, or [[Endoscopic third ventriculostomy#ETV combined with choroid plexus cauterization|ETV/CPC]], where they identify the blockage in the brain and create a new path through which the accumulating fluid can drain naturally. With the surgery taking as little as 45 minutes, CURE claims the results are permanent and often much more stable than implanting a shunt. 

On August 2, 2011, three representatives of CURE Hydrocephalus testified in front of the [[U. S. House of Representatives]] Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights. Dr. [[Benjamin Warf]], former medical director of CURE Uganda, Dr. Steven Schiff, who conducted research at CURE Uganda, and Jim Cohick, Senior Vice President of Specialty Programs at CURE International, spoke on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrissmith.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=254848 New Treatment for Hydrocephalus Topic of Health Subcommittee Hearing] Congressman Chris Smith, retrieved April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Ugand Hydrocephalus Treatment in Uganda] C-SPAN, retrieved April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and vision ==

The mission statement of the Center for Sex Positive Culture:&lt;br /&gt;
The Center for Sex Positive Culture encourages the exploration and celebration of the many facets of human sexuality. Through an encompassing variety of events, created by and for its membership, the CSPC seeks to educate, to facilitate consensual open sexual expression and dialog, and to provide a venue for fellowship and community.&lt;ref name="Mission and Sex Positive Vision"/&gt;

The vision statement of the Center for Sex Positive Culture:&lt;br /&gt;
As proponents of sex positive culture, we believe that the appropriate uses of sex extend beyond reproduction. They include creating personal pleasure, bonding interpersonal relationships, promoting spiritual growth, and enhancing emotional and physical health. In a sex positive world, everyone has the freedom and resources to pursue a fulfilling and empowering sex life.&lt;ref name="Mission and Sex Positive Vision"/&gt;

== Membership and activities ==
The CSPC's primary location is a nondescript {{convert|10,000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} group of buildings in Seattle's [[Interbay, Seattle, Washington|Interbay]] district. Membership is open to anyone over the age of 18 who has attended an orientation class and agrees to the organization's rules of conduct. There is also an annual membership fee. [[Volunteering|Volunteer]]s organize and run most events.

The space includes a library including a wide variety of books on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[kink (sexual)|kink]], as well as several flavors of [[pornography]].

There are many different on-site events that occur on a weekly or monthly basis.  "Offerings include BDSM focused events, sex and sensual touch focused events, bondage focused events, fetish and fantasy focused events, art focused events, socially focused events, and events specifically for new members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecspc.org/about-us/frequently-asked-questions#Q3 |title=What happens at the CSPC? |publisher=thecspc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same physical space is used in various configurations for different events. Some have only tables and chairs, other prominently feature [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]] equipment with an adjoining social area, plus private spaces for those who wish to avoid [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]].

Annual events organized by the CSPC or FSPC include:
* The [[Seattle Erotic Art Festival]].
* Seduction, a SEAF fundraiser gala Halloween party.

== History ==
Founded in 1999 as the Seattle Sex Positive Community Center. Socially speaking, it is an outgrowth of Allena Gabosch's ''Beyond the Edge Cafe'', which hosted BDSM related events. Several regulars of the cafe started discussing getting a dedicated space for their activities. One famously quoted "It would be great if we could get 200 members."{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In fact the idea became more popular than they envisioned; in its first year The Wet Spot registered about 2,000 members. In September 2007, they reached 10,000 registered members, although not all of them are current members. In 2007 the organization also changed its name to the Center for Sex Positive Culture&lt;ref name="namechange"/&gt; and opened a second, "annex" building.

In November 2008 the Center for Sex Positive Culture was scrutinized in a [[KOMO-TV]] report regarding the Center's non-profit status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage |first=Dan |url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2008/11/17/maybe_it_wouldn_t_be_a_proble |title=Maybe It Wouldn't Be a "Problem" If They Called It a Church? &amp;#124; Slog |publisher=Slog.thestranger.com |date=2008-11-17 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sexual activities which occur there.  The story was criticized by [[Dan Savage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage |first=Dan |url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2008/11/18/dan_lewis_needs_to_apologize_t |title=Dan Lewis Needs to Apologize Too &amp;#124; Slog |publisher=Slog.thestranger.com |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others for inaccuracies, and was later pulled from the station's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=787697 |title=Beat Off by Dominic Holden - Seattle News - The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper |publisher=Thestranger.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building Problems with new space, shutdown and acquisition of a new space ==

The Center lost its long term home in late 2016 when the building they were in was sold to developers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-re-build-the-center-for-sex-positive-culture-lgbt-education#/  Help Re-Build The Center For Sex-Positive Culture! - Indegogo website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was supposed to open in a new building at 1514 NW 46th Street, in the Ballard section of Seattle in the summer of 2017. However, the new space fell through due to unexpected major seismic upgrades required by the City of Seattle. In April 2018 the Foundation announced a name change to The Pan Eros Foundation and that a new home location for both the Foundation and the Center had been acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecspc.org/news/2018/4/3/march-newsletter/|title=March Newsletter|work=the CSPC|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genital wart]]s, which are a form of [[benign tumor]] of [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer. It is common to have multiple strains at the same time, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts.

Infection with HPV is generally believed to be required for cervical cancer to occur.&lt;ref name=pmid16362994&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Snijders PJ, Steenbergen RD, Heideman DA, Meijer CJ | title = HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis: concepts and clinical implications | journal = J.

=== Smoking ===
Cigarette smoking, both active and passive, increases the risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, current and former smokers have roughly two to three times the incidence of invasive cancer. Passive smoking is also associated with increased risk, but to a lesser extent.&lt;ref name=NIHNCIHPV2015/&gt;

===Oral contraceptives===
Long-term use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer. Women who have used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years have about three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have about four times the risk.&lt;ref name=NIHNCIHPV2015/&gt;

===Multiple pregnancies===
Having many pregnancies is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer.

Confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through [[colposcopy]], a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute [[acetic acid]] (e.g. [[vinegar]]) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include [[Instruments used in obstetrics and gynecology|punch forceps]] among others.

Colposcopic impression, the estimate of disease severity based on the visual inspection, forms part of the diagnosis.

Further diagnostic and treatment procedures are [[loop electrical excision procedure]] and [[cervical conization]], in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]].

[[File:Squamous carcinoma of the cervix.jpg|right|thumb|This large squamous carcinoma (bottom of picture) has obliterated the cervix and invaded the lower uterine segment. The uterus also has a round [[leiomyoma]] up higher.]]

Often before the biopsy, the doctor asks for medical imaging to rule out other causes of woman's symptoms. Imaging modalities such as [[ultrasound]], CT scan and MRI have been used to look for alternating disease, spread of tumor and effect on adjacent structures. Typically, they appear as heterogeneous mass in the cervix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = H. K. Pannu |author2 = F. M. Corl |author3 = E. K. Fishman | author-link = H. K.

===Precancerous lesions===

[[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]], the potential precursor to cervical cancer, is often diagnosed on examination of cervical biopsies by a [[pathology|pathologist]].  For premalignant dysplastic changes, [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] grading is used.

The naming and [[histology|histologic]] classification of cervical carcinoma precursor lesions has changed many times over the 20th century.  The [[World Health Organization]] classification&lt;ref name=CAresearchUK/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeMay&gt;{{cite book|author=DeMay, M| year=2007| title=Practical principles of cytopathology.  Revised edition.| isbn=978-0-89189-549-7|publisher=American Society for Clinical Pathology Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; system was descriptive of the lesions, naming them mild, moderate, or severe [[dysplasia]] or [[carcinoma in situ]] (CIS).  The term, [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] (CIN) was developed to place emphasis on the spectrum of abnormality in these lesions, and to help standardise treatment.&lt;ref name=DeMay/&gt;  It classifies mild dysplasia as CIN1, moderate dysplasia as CIN2, and severe dysplasia and CIS as CIN3.  More recently, CIN2 and CIN3 have been combined into CIN2/3.  These results are what a pathologist might report from a biopsy.

These should not be confused with the [[Bethesda system]] terms for Pap test ([[cytopathology]]) results.  Among the Bethesda results: [[Bethesda system|Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion]] (LSIL) and [[Bethesda system#HSIL|High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion]] (HSIL).  An LSIL Pap may correspond to CIN1, and HSIL may correspond to CIN2 and CIN3,&lt;ref name=DeMay/&gt; however, they are results of different tests, and the Pap test results need not match the histologic findings.

===Cancer subtypes===
[[File:Uterine leiomyoma with cancer cervix.jpg|thumb|Cervical cancer with [[uterine leiomyoma]]]] 
[[Histopathology|Histologic]] subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic324.htm#section~workup |title=Cervical Cancer |access-date=2007-12-02 |vauthors=Garcia A, Hamid O, El-Khoueiry A |date=2006-07-06 |work=eMedicine |publisher=[[WebMD]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209093214/http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC324.HTM#section~workup |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Dolinsky | title=Cervical Cancer: The Basics | date=2006-07-17 | publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania|Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania]] | url=http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/types/article.cfm?c=6&amp;s=17&amp;ss=129&amp;id=8226 | work=OncoLink | pages= | access-date=2007-12-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118175524/http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/types/article.cfm?c=6&amp;s=17&amp;ss=129&amp;id=8226# | archivedate=2008-01-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though squamous cell carcinoma is the cervical cancer with the most incidence, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix has been increasing in recent decades.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;

Noncarcinoma malignancies which can rarely occur in the cervix include [[melanoma]] and [[lymphoma]].  The FIGO stage does not incorporate [[lymph node]] involvement in contrast to the [[TNM staging system|TNM]] staging for most other cancers.

For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.

===Staging===
{{Main|Cervical cancer staging}}
Cervical cancer is staged by the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO) staging system, which is based on clinical examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, [[colposcopy]], endocervical [[curettage]], [[hysteroscopy]], [[cystoscopy]], [[proctoscopy]], intravenous [[urography]], and [[X-ray]] examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical [[conization]].

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially precancerous changes in the cervix.

The treatment of cervical cancer varies worldwide, largely due to access to surgeons skilled in radical pelvic surgery, and the emergence of fertility-sparing therapy in developed nations. Because cervical cancers are radiosensitive, radiation may be used in all stages where surgical options do not exist. Surgical intervention may have better outcomes than radiological approaches.&lt;ref name=BaalbergenVeenstra2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baalbergen|first1=Astrid|last2=Veenstra|first2=Yerney|last3=Stalpers|first3=Lukas|last4=Baalbergen|first4=Astrid|title=Primary surgery versus primary radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for early adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix|year=2013|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006248.pub3|journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemotherapy can be used to treat cervical cancer, and has been found to be more effective than radiation alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einhorn|first1=N|last2=Tropé|first2=C|last3=Ridderheim|first3=M|last4=Boman|first4=K|last5=Sorbe|first5=B|last6=Cavallin-Ståhl|first6=E|title=A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in cervical cancer (cervix uteri).|journal=Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)|date=2003|volume=42|issue=5–6|pages=546–56|doi=10.1080/02841860310014660|pmid=14596512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1b cancers and some stage 1a cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Early stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4&amp;nbsp;cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or [[radiation therapy]]. Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and [[brachytherapy]] (internal radiation). Women treated with surgery who have high-risk features found on pathologic examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Prognosis==
===Stage===
Prognosis depends on the stage of the cancer. The chance of a survival rate is nearly 100% for women with microscopic forms of cervical cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cervical Cancer|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry.do?ta=sprwh&amp;uh=cervical_cancer|publisher=Encyclopedia of Women's Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With treatment, the five-year [[relative survival rate]] for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is 92%, and the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate is about 72%. These statistics may be improved when applied to women newly diagnosed, bearing in mind that these outcomes may be partly based on the state of treatment five years ago when the women studied were first diagnosed.&lt;ref name="ACS Key Stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_1X_What_are_the_key_statistics_for_cervical_cancer_8.asp?sitearea= |title=What Are the Key Statistics About Cervical Cancer? |access-date=2007-12-02 |date=2006-08-04 |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071030194439/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_1X_What_are_the_key_statistics_for_cervical_cancer_8.asp?sitearea= &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With treatment, 80-90% of women with stage I cancer and 60-75% of those with stage II cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis.

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiologists]] working in the early 20th century noted that cervical cancer behaved like a sexually transmitted disease. In summary:
&lt;!--three of the following statements are unsourced, but it is not necessary to tag everything--&gt;
# Cervical cancer was noted to be common in female [[sex worker]]s.
# It was rare in [[nun]]s, except for those who had been sexually active before entering the convent. (Rigoni in 1841)
# It was more common in the second wives of men whose first wives had died from cervical cancer.

# In 1935, Syverton and Berry discovered a relationship between RPV (Rabbit Papillomavirus) and skin cancer in [[rabbit]]s. (HPV is species-specific and therefore cannot be transmitted to rabbits){{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

These historical observations suggested that cervical cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted agent. Initial research in the 1940s and 1950s attributed cervical cancer to [[smegma]] (e.g. Heins ''et al.'' 1958).&lt;ref name=Heins1958&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heins HC, Dennis EJ, Pratthomas HR | title = The possible role of smegma in carcinoma of the cervix | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 726–33 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13583012 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s it was suspected that infection with [[herpes simplex virus]] was the cause of the disease. In summary, [[Herpes simplex virus|HSV]] was seen as a likely cause because it is known to survive in the female reproductive tract, to be transmitted sexually in a way compatible with known risk factors, such as promiscuity and low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=pmid4352386&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alexander ER | title = Possible Etiologies of Cancer of the Cervix Other Than Herpesvirus | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1485–90 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4352386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpes viruses were also implicated in other malignant diseases, including [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], [[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], [[Marek's disease]] and the Lucké renal adenocarcinoma. HSV was recovered from cervical tumour cells.&lt;!--{{cn}}--&gt;

In Australia, Aboriginal women are more than five times more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests.&lt;ref name=CSP&gt;{{cite web | author = Cancer Institute NSW | publisher = NSW Government | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130411015842/http://www.csp.nsw.gov.au/aboriginal | archivedate = 11 April 2013 | url = http://www.csp.nsw.gov.au/aboriginal | title = Information about cervical screening for Aboriginal women | year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity in discussing the topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and fear about the procedure.&lt;ref name=SciNetwork2011&gt;{{cite web | author = Mary-Anne Romano | publisher = Science Network Western Australia | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130514223512/http://www.sciencewa.net.au/topics/health-a-medicine/item/995-aboriginal-cervical-cancer-rates-parallel-health-inequity.html | archivedate = 14 May 2013 | url = http://www.sciencewa.net.au/topics/health-a-medicine/item/995-aboriginal-cervical-cancer-rates-parallel-health-inequity.html | title = Aboriginal cervical cancer rates parallel health inequity | date = 17 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained Pap test providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.&lt;ref name=SciNetwork2011/&gt;

'''Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy''' ('''CIPN''') is a progressive, enduring, and often irreversible condition featuring pain, numbness, tingling and sensitivity to cold in the hands and feet (sometimes progressing to the arms and legs) that afflicts between 30% and 40% of patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref name = NCI&gt;{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-317/20141006060652/http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include [[thalidomide]], the [[epothilone]]s such as [[ixabepilone]], the [[vinca alkaloid]]s [[vincristine]] and [[vinblastine]], the [[taxane]]s [[paclitaxel]] and [[docetaxel]], the [[proteasome inhibitor]]s such as [[bortezomib]], and the platinum-based drugs [[cisplatin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[carboplatin]].&lt;ref name = NCI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|url=http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdf|author=Grisold W, Oberndorfer S, Windebank AJ|journal=European Association of Neurooncology Magazine|title=Chemotherapy and polyneuropathies|year=2012|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/herceptin/peripheral%20sensory%20neuropathy&lt;/ref&gt; Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount received and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity – in some cases [[motor nerve]]s are affected, and occasionally, also, the [[autonomic nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Beijers&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Beijers AJM, Jongen, JLM &amp; Vreugdenhil1 G |date=January 2012 |journal=The Netherlands Journal of Medicine |volume=70 |issue=1 |pmid=22271810 |url=http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001320/http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment.&lt;ref name= Windebank&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Windebank AJ &amp; Grisold W | title = Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy | journal =  Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System | date = 2008 Mar | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–46 | pmid = 18346229 | doi=10.1111/j.1529-8027.2008.00156.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some CIPN appears to be irreversible.&lt;ref name= Windebank/&gt; Pain can often be helped with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;{{vcite journal | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| title = Chemotherapy-induced pain puzzles scientists | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | author = Savage L | date = 2007 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/14/1070.long | pages = 1070–1071 | doi=10.1093/jnci/djm072 | pmid=17623791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIPN disrupts leisure, work, and family relations, and the pain of CIPN is often accompanied by sleep and mood disturbance, fatigue and functional difficulties. A 2007 American Cancer Society study found that most patients did not recall being told to expect CIPN, and doctors monitoring the condition rarely asked how it affects daily living but focused on practical effects such as dexterity and gait.&lt;ref name = Paice&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Paice JA, Ferrell B | title = The management of cancer pain | journal = CA&amp;nbsp;– A Cancer Journal for Clinicians | year = 2011 | volume = 61| issue = 3 | pages = 157–82 | pmid = 21543825 | doi = 10.3322/caac.20112}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known what causes the condition, but  [[microtubule]] and [[mitochondria]]l damage, and leaky blood vessels near nerve cells are some of the possibilities being explored.&lt;ref name= Windebank/&gt;

==Research==

===Antidepressants===
;Venlafaxine
:Forty eight patients experiencing acute neurotoxicity during [[oxaliplatin]] treatment were given either the [[antidepressant]] [[venlafaxine]] or [[placebo]]. Of those given venlafaxine, 31.3 percent experienced complete relief of symptoms as opposed to 5.3 percent of those on placebo. After three months, 38.5 percent of the venlafaxine-treated patients had no neuropathy, vs. 5.6 percent of those on placebo, and while 33.3 percent of the placebo-treated patients had grade 3 neuropathy after 3 months, none of the venlafaxine-treated patients did.&lt;ref name="Sherry"&gt;{{cite web | author= Sherry, Victoria | date= 10 September 2013 | title= Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN): Scientific and Clinical Perspectives | url= http://www.oncolink.org/resources/article.cfm?c=412&amp;id=6936 | publisher= The Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140221104546/http://www.oncolink.org/resources/article.cfm?c=412&amp;id=6936 | archivedate= 21 February 2014 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDMD2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first= Al|editor1-last= Benson |editor2-first= A.

;Duloxetine
:A trial of the antidepressant [[duloxetine]] suggested it may be useful in controlling the pain of neurotoxicity due to [[taxane]] or platinum treatment.&lt;ref name="MDMD2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=EM|last2=Pang|first2=H|last3=Cirrincione|first3=C|last4=Fleishman|first4=S|last5=Paskett|first5=ED|last6=Ahles|first6=T|last7=Bressler|first7=LR|last8=Fadul|first8=CE|last9=Knox|first9=C|last10=Le-Lindqwister|first10=N|last11=Gilman|first11=PB|last12=Shapiro|first12=CL|last13=Alliance for Clinical Trials in|first13=Oncology|title=Effect of duloxetine on pain, function, and quality of life among patients with chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy: a randomized clinical trial.|journal=JAMA|date=3 April 2013|volume=309|issue=13|pages=1359–67|pmid=23549581|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.2813|pmc=3912515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valproate===
The [[anticonvulsant]] [[valproate]], an effective treatment for [[diabetic neuropathy]], appeared to offer some protection against cisplatin-induced neuropathy in rats.&lt;ref name = "Sherry"/&gt;

===Interleukin-6===
[[Interleukin-6]] prevented peripheral nerve damage in animals without inhibiting the anti-cancer effect.&lt;ref name = "Sherry"/&gt;

===Dietary supplements===
As possible preventative interventions, the American [[National Cancer Institute]] Symptom Management and Health-related Quality of Life Steering Committee recommends continued investigation of several [[dietary supplements]], including [[glutathione]], and intravenous calcium and magnesium, which have shown early promise in limited human trials; [[acetyl-L-carnitine]], which was effective in animal models and on diabetes and HIV patients; and the anti-oxidant [[alpha-lipoic acid]].&lt;ref name="NCI"/&gt;

====Glutathione====
[[Glutathione]] was studied in two large [[double-blind]] [[placebo-controlled trial]]s and seemed to reduce neurotoxicity without interfering with the therapeutic effect, but shortcomings in the trial designs make confident interpretation of the results impossible. As of September 2013, patients are being recruited for a more definitive study.&lt;ref name = "Sherry"/&gt;

====Intravenous calcium and magnesium====
In a study of patients receiving [[oxaliplatin]] treatment, only 4 percent of those also receiving intravenous calcium and magnesium (ca/mg) before and after each oxaliplatin dose had to discontinue treatment due to neurotoxicity, compared to 33 percent who were receiving intravenous placebo; onset of neuropathy was also significantly delayed in the ca/mg patients, and only 22 percent of the ca/mg patients had long-term CIPN of grade 2 or worse compared with 41 percent of those on placebo. Overall, trials of ca/mg infusion suggest there are no serious harmful side effects and it may be an effective preventative therapy — the number of patients so far studied is small, however, and confident conclusions cannot be drawn.&lt;ref name= "Sherry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisFeyer2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mellar P. Davis|author2=Petra Feyer|author3=Petra Ortner|author4=Camilla Zimmermann|title=Supportive Oncology: Expert Consult|url=http://www.expertconsultbook.com/expertconsult/ob/book.do?method=display&amp;eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-1015-1..C2009-0-41651-9--TOP&amp;isbn=978-1-4377-1015-1&amp;selectBook=true&amp;decorator=none&amp;type=aboutPage|date=11 February 2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn= 9781437710151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acetyl-L-carnitine====
:Though [[preclinical trial]]s and a [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|phase II trial]] of [[acetyl-L-carnitine]] indicated it may be effective for CIPN, a 2013 review concluded there is no solid evidence to support its use; and the 2013 report of a [[Randomized trial|randomized]] [[double-blind]] [[placebo-controlled trial]] (409 patients) of acetyl-L-carnitine for the prevention of taxane-induced neuropathy found "no evidence that ALC affected CIPN at 12 weeks; however, ALC significantly increased CIPN by 24 weeks."&lt;ref name= "Schloss"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hutchinson"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hutchinson | first1 = L. | title = Chemotherapy: Supplements--for better or worse? | journal = Nat Rev Clin Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 426 |date=Aug 2013 | doi = 10.1038/nrclinonc.2013.106 | pmid = 23774646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
Two small [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs) and one larger RCT (86 subjects) tested [[glutamine]] in the prevention of platinum treatment-induced neuropathy and showed promise. As of September 2013 a larger, placebo-controlled trial is running.&lt;ref name = "Sherry"/&gt;

A 2013 [[systematic review]] of the use of [[acetyl-L-carnitine]], [[glutamine]], [[vitamin E]], [[glutathione]], [[vitamin B6]], [[omega-3 fatty acids]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[alpha lipoic acid]] and [[n-acetyl cysteine]] as anti-CIPN adjuvants concluded that "currently no agent has shown solid beneficial evidence to be recommended for the treatment or prophylaxis of CIPN."&lt;ref name= "Schloss"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schloss | first1 = JM. | last2 = Colosimo | first2 = M. | last3 = Airey | first3 = C. | last4 = Masci | first4 = PP. | last5 = Linnane | first5 = AW. | last6 = Vitetta | first6 = L. | title = Nutraceuticals and chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): A systematic review. | journal = Clin Nutr | volume =  32| issue =  6| pages =  888–93|date=Apr 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2013.04.007 | pmid = 23647723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research has focused on [[Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAP)]], a family of genes essential for proliferation and survival of cells. His work has identified [[survivin]], one of these IAP genes, is over-produced in almost every human cancer, and his team is currently studying the biology of survivin and how it could be used to develop treatments for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dario C.

Altieri has also been involved in the development of [[gamitrinib]], a [[Hsp90 inhibitor]] that was shown to disable the activity of [[mitochondria]] in cancerous cells.

In 2013, Altieri and his team received a $1.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to prepare the drug for human trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wistar Receives $1.5 Million Department of Defense Grant To Ready Potential Prostate Drug For Clinical Use|url=http://wistar.org/news-and-media/press-releases/Gamitrinib_DoD_Grant|publisher=[[The Wistar Institute]]|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combinatorial Drugs Target Cancer Cell Mitochonndria|url=http://www.biotechdaily.com/genomics_proteomics/articles/294722285/combinatorial_drugs_target_cancer_cell_mitochondria.html|publisher=[[biotechdaily.com]]|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to joining Wistar, Altieri was the founding chair of the Department of Cancer Biology at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. He also co-founded the Cancer Biology Training Consortium and the Pancreatic Cancer alliance in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer Biologist Dario Altieri to Lead the Wistar Institute Cancer Center|url=http://www.wistar.org/news-and-media/press-releases/cancer-biologist-dario-altieri-lead-the-wistar-institute-cancer-center|publisher=[[The Wistar Institute]]|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dental school''' ('''school of dental medicine''', '''school of dentistry''', '''dental college''') is a [[tertiary education]]al institution—or part of such an institution—that teaches [[dental medicine]] to prospective [[dentist]]s.  Upon successful completion, the graduate receives a degree in Dentistry, Dental Surgery, or Dental Medicine, which, depending upon the jurisdiction, might be a [[bachelor's degree]], [[master's degree]], a [[First professional degree|professional degree]], or a [[doctorate]].   Schools can also offer [[postgraduate training in general dentistry]], and/or training in [[endodontics]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], [[oral pathology]], [[oral and maxillofacial radiology]], [[orthodontics]], [[pedodontics]], [[periodontics]], [[prosthodontics]], or [[dental public health]].

In the European Union, [[Dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[Registered Dental Nurse|dental nurse]]s, [[dental technician]]s, [[dental therapist]]s, or other members of the [[dental auxiliary]] are trained in universities of applied science or polytechnics.

Sometimes [[dental education]] is done within [[medical school]]s, as in [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council|Pakistan]]; the separation between medical and dental educations is also blurred within certain sub-specialties, such as [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]].

[[File:Devereux Hall (Jacobs Hall, Campbell Mansion).JPG|thumb|California center's Devereux Hall in Santa Barbara County in 2010]]
The organization's first major expansion, to California, was aided by support from the [[Max Factor Sr.|Max Factor Family Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prost|first1=Marlene|title=Devereux: An Investment in Self-esteem|agency=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=May 7, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the Devereux Foundation opened a school and [[residential treatment center]] on the Campbell Ranch in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]]. Devereux Hall was designated [http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/boards/hlac/Landmarks/27%20-%20DEVEREUX%20HALL.pdf Historical Landmark No. 27] by the [[Santa Barbara County, California|County of Santa Barbara]] on September 8, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coombs|first1=Gary|last2=Olsen|first2=Phyllis|title=In the Grand Manor: The Story of Devereux Hall|date=1987|publisher=Institute for American Research|location=Goleta, California|isbn=0911773053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6087">The '''Drug Equality Alliance''' is a not for profit organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]] whose mission statement is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] to transform the "War on Some People who use Some Drugs" from its subjective historical and cultural roots into a rational and objective legal regulatory framework that secures equal rights and equal protection to all those who are concerned with dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs. Our mission is to use domestic and international legal jurisdictions to interrogate the law and its application to those who produce, commerce, possess and consume such drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugequality.org/index.htm |title=Drug Equality Alliance (DEA) - Mission Statement |publisher=Drugequality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Drug Equality Alliance believes that the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] is administering the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. This is contrary to the purpose of the Act, contrary to the original wishes of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], conflicts with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and is therefore illegal. It argues that the penalties associated with the possession, production and supply of various [[List of controlled drugs in the United Kingdom|controlled substances]] are not proportional to the relative harms which these substances cause to individuals and society, especially since two of the most dangerous drugs, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], are presently excluded from the Act. The Drug Equality Alliance is currently assisting and supporting several legal challenges in relation to this alleged maladminstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugequality.org/cases.htm |title=Drug Equality Alliance (DEA) - Cases |publisher=Drugequality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/26/law-drugspolicy |title=Peter Tatchell: The government is about to face a challenge to its drugs policy &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2008/10/government-challenged-on-drugs-law.html |title=Transform Drug Policy Foundation Blog: Government challenged on drugs law |publisher=Transform-drugs.blogspot.com |date=2008-10-14 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1104468_teacher_in_court_over_drugs |title=Teacher in court over drugs &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/4866493.Cannabis_campaigner_charged_with_possession/ |title=Cannabis campaigner charged with possession (From Western Telegraph) |publisher=Westerntelegraph.co.uk |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Monday 18 May 2009 10:24 |url=http://www.wigantoday.net/wigannews/Cannabis-test-case-in-court.5276365.jp |title=Cannabis test case in court - News |publisher=Wigan Today |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidence that the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] is being administered arbitrarily, the Drug Equality Alliance cites the following admission made by the Government in "The Government Reply to the Fifth Report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee Session 2005-6 HC 1031: Drug classification: making a hash of it?" (Cm 6941):

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the Government acknowledges that alcohol and tobacco account for more health problems and deaths than illicit drugs.... The distinction between legal and illegal substances is not unequivocally based on pharmacology, economic or risk benefit analysis. It is also based in large part on historical and cultural precedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm69/6941/6941.pdf |title=Drug classification: making a hash of it? CM 6941 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2010, in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] request process submitted by [[Casey William Hardison]], acting with the Drug Equality Alliance, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] ordered the [[Home Office]] to disclose a suppressed draft consultation paper with suggestions for a review of the drug classification system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugequality.org/ico.htm |title=Drug Equality Alliance (DEA) - News |publisher=Drugequality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugequality.org/files/FS50198230.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UKCIA in News and comment |url=http://ukcia.org/wordpress/?p=252 |title=Government forced to publish consultation paper on the future of drugs classification 2006. &amp;#124; The UKCIA News Blog |publisher=Ukcia.org |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UKCIA in News and comment |url=http://ukcia.org/wordpress/?p=262 |title=Freedom of Information ruling on drug classification proposals &amp;#124; The UKCIA News Blog |publisher=Ukcia.org |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was subject to a last minute appeal by the [[Home Office]], but the appeal was withdrawn on 9 July 2010 and the consultation paper was released on 12 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/07/tension_at_heart_of_drug_classification.html |title=Mark Easton's UK: Tension at heart of drug classification |publisher=BBC |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10599">[[Psychological trauma|Trauma]] survivors are a distinctive population with varying displays of [[Psychological resilience|resilience]], [[posttraumatic growth]], and resulting mental disorders. Mental health professionals who treat trauma survivors must incorporate specific ethical considerations when working with clients who have a history of trauma. 

Within the field of psychology, [[ethics]] define the standards of professional conduct. The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002|title=Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.57.12.1060|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=57|issue=12|pages=1060–1073|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.57.12.1060|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes their [[APA Ethics Code|Ethics Code]] as a “common set of principles and standards upon which psychologists build their professional and scientific work” (p. 8). Ethics help clinicians to think through and critically analyze situations, while also serving as aspirations and virtues that clinicians should strive towards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When working with trauma survivors, often times client’s traumatic experiences can be so overwhelming for both the patient and the clinician that professional and ethical boundaries may become endangered.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Frankel|first=A. Steven|title=Legal and ethical considerations in working with trauma survivors: Risk management principles for clinicians.|url=https://doi-org.paloaltou.idm.oclc.org/10.1037/0000019-027|work=APA handbook of trauma psychology: Foundations in knowledge (Vol. 1).|pages=547–558|publisher=American Psychological Association|doi=10.1037/0000019-027|isbn=1433826550|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidelines ==
The following ethical guidelines should be considered when working with clients who have survived a traumatic experience: 

=== Informed consent ===
The APA ethics code&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/|title=Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines many professional guidelines for clinicians including the maintenance of [[confidentiality]], minimizing intrusions to privacy, and obtaining informed consent. [[Informed consent]] ensures the client has an adequate understanding of the techniques and procedures that will be used during therapy, expected timeline for treatment, and possible consequences for engaging in specific tasks and goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When clinicians work with trauma survivors their informed consent should emphasize diagnosis and treatment of trauma and include clear guidelines for maintaining secure and firm boundaries. Some research suggests that clients who have experienced [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] may deliberately or unconsciously test clinician’s boundaries by missing or arriving late for appointments, bringing the clinician gifts, attempting to photograph the therapist, calling during non-office hours, or trying to extend the session either in person or with a follow-up phone call.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Risk management ===
Research suggests that trauma survivors are more likely than those without a history of trauma to report [[suicidal ideation]] and to engage in [[Self-harm|self-harming behaviors]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Amy E.|last2=Simiola|first2=Vanessa|last3=Brown|first3=Laura|last4=Courtois|first4=Christine|last5=Cook|first5=Joan M.|date=2017-06-29|title=The role of evidence-based therapy relationships on treatment outcome for adults with trauma: A systematic review|url=https://doi-org.paloaltou.idm.oclc.org/10.1080/15299732.2017.1329771|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|volume=19|issue=2|pages=185–213|doi=10.1080/15299732.2017.1329771|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, research also indicates that suicide attempts are correlated with both childhood maltreatment and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] symptom severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guina|first=Jeffrey|last2=Nahhas|first2=Ramzi W.|last3=Mata|first3=Nicholas|last4=Farnsworth|first4=Seth|date=2017-10-26|title=Which Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms, Trauma Types, and Substances Correlate With Suicide Attempts in Trauma Survivors?|url=https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.17m02177|journal=The Primary Care Companion For CNS Disorders|language=English|volume=19|issue=5|doi=10.4088/pcc.17m02177|issn=2155-7780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinicians who treat trauma survivors should continuously monitor their client’s suicidal ideation, means, and plans especially surrounding anniversary dates and [[Trauma trigger|triggering]] experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Client safety should be prioritized when working with trauma survivors, and should include immediately assessing client safety following intense sessions and frequent follow-ups with clients between sessions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ducharme|first=Elaine L.|date=2017-09-01|title=Best practices in working with complex trauma and dissociative identity disorder.|url=https://doi-org.paloaltou.idm.oclc.org/10.1037/pri0000050|journal=Practice Innovations|volume=2|issue=3|pages=150–161|doi=10.1037/pri0000050|issn=2377-8903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishing and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance ===
The APA outlines [[APA Ethics Code|General Principles]] that clinicians should use in order to aspire towards the very highest ethical ideals&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Among these General Principles are Principle A: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence and Principle C: Integrity. Beneficence and Nonmaleficence describes that clinicians strive to benefit those with whom they work, and make efforts to do no harm&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Fidelity and Responsibility includes establishing relationships of trust and being aware of one’s professional responsibilities&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Both of these principles should be considered when a clinician attempts to establish and maintain a strong therapeutic alliance with trauma survivors.  

For clients with a history of trauma, particularly those who have experienced [[betrayal trauma]], forging close and trusting relationships with others may be difficult&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. In addition, during the course of therapy clients may discuss terrifying, horrific, or disturbing experiences, which may elicit strong reactions from the therapist. Some of the possible negative reactions could include distancing and emotional detachment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, which may reinforce clients’ often negative schemas and self-image. Clinicians may also contribute to the challenges of establishing a strong therapeutic alliance by becoming overly inquisitive about the client’s traumatic experience, which, in turn, may lead to a lack of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|accurate empathy]]. For these reasons, clinicians treating those with a history of trauma may encounter unique challenges when attempting to develop a strong therapeutic alliance. 

==== Addressing transference and countertransference ====
Within the course of traditional therapy it is possible for [[transference]] and [[Countertransference|counter transference]] to interfere with treatment. For clinicians treating those with a history of trauma it is possible to experience “a priori counter-transference”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e609242012-147|title=Recovered memory and a priori countertransference in the context of ongoing risk|last=Dalenberg|first=Constance|last2=Tauber|first2=Yvonne|date=2001|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-11-08|last3=Palesh|first3=Oxana}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A priori counter-transference includes the thoughts, feelings, and prejudices that may arise before meeting with a potential client as a result of knowing that the client has gone through a certain traumatic event&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. These initial reactions may create ethical dilemmas as the clinician’s personal attitudes, beliefs, and values may become compromised, thereby increasing the amount of counter-transference the clinician may have towards the client. The [[APA Ethics Code|APA ethics code]] 2.06(b) describes a clinician’s ethical responsibility should personal situations interfere with a clinician’s ability to perform their duties adequately&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Clinicians experiencing a priori counter-transference should consider utilizing more frequent consultations, receive increased levels of personal therapy, or consider limiting, suspending, or terminating their work-related duties&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

==== Traumatic bonding ====
Dutton and Painter&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Donald G.|last2=Painter|first2=Susan|date=1993-01|title=Emotional Attachments in Abusive Relationships: A Test of Traumatic Bonding Theory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1891/0886-6708.8.2.105|journal=Violence and Victims|volume=8|issue=2|pages=105–120|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.8.2.105|issn=0886-6708}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally coined the term [[Traumatic bonding|“traumatic bonding”]] to describe the relationship bond that occurs between the perpetrator and victim of abusive relationships. As a result of ongoing cycles of positive and traumatic experiences powerful emotional bonds are created that are resistant to change&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. The term can also be borrowed to describe the relationship between a trauma clinician and the client. As the client describes their traumatic memories and re-experiences the accompanying powerful emotions and sensations they are prone to form a remarkably intense bond with their clinician. These emotionally driven experiences present ethical challenges and pitfalls for the clinician including behaving in extremes such as acting in an overprotective manner or distancing themselves from the client. The clinician may also feel triggered by their own similar trauma history, causing unnecessary discloses or the need to share the client’s story in order to seek revenge or justice. The APA ethics code 2.06(a) describes that clinicians should refrain from practicing if they know there is a substantial likelihood that their personal problems will prevent them from being objective or competent&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Clinicians who recognize that traumatic bonding might be occurring should increase consultations or consider limiting, suspending, or terminating their work-related duties&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

'''Friendship''' is a needs-driven [[non-governmental organisation]] that works in the [[Char (island)|Char]] islands and riverbanks of northern [[Bangladesh]], the coastal belt in the south, and as of 2017, the Rohingya refugee camps in [[Ukhia Upazila|Ukhia]], [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox's Bazar]] in the southeast. Established by Runa Khan in 2002, Friendship works to empower people through a sustainable, integrated development approach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=|first= |date=16 May 2016 |title=New models of working and partnership in development: the example of Friendship, a Bangladeshi organisation |url=http://alternatives-humanitaires.org/en/2016/05/16/new-models-of-working-and-partnership-in-development-the-example-of-friendship-a-bangladeshi-organisation/#more-1909+ |journal=Alternatives Humanitaires |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendship employees more than 1,500 employees that includes field staff, regional office staff, staff in the floating hospitals, teachers at Friendship schools, trainers at vocational schools, organizers and supervisors working in the northern and southern parts of the country and head office staff based in [[Dhaka]].

==  History ==
[[File:La péniche hôpital d'Yves.png|thumb|Lifebuoy Friendship Hospital]]
Friendship's first project was a floating hospital. French sailor and aviator [[Yves Marre]] sailed a river barge from France to Bangladesh to donate it for use by the people of Bangladesh. Runa Khan eventually converted the river barge to a floating hospital, the Lifebuoy Friendship Hospital (LFH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=For the Right to Live with Hope and Dignity |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/star-people/the-right-live-hope-and-dignity-201793 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=15 January 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The One Who Answered the Call |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/impact-journalism-day/the-one-who-answered-the-call-99613 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=20 June 2015 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/floating-hospital-poor/-/688342/2757844/-/fs36xuz/-/index.html|title=A floating hospital for the poor|last=|first=|date=20 June 2015|website=Daily Monitor|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Friendship has developed a healthcare system to provide primary healthcare and certain surgical procedures to river-based communities who are often difficult to reach from the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7257347.stm|title=The chance to see in Bangladesh|last=Crouch|first=Lizzie|date=2008-02-23|work=BBC Health Check|access-date=2018-01-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGO now has introduced two more floating hospitals: the Emirates Friendship Hospital in 2008 sponsored by the Emirates Airline Foundation and the Rongdhonu Friendship Hospital, former [[Rainbow Warrior II]] from [[Greenpeace]], in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Emirates opens floating hospital in Dhaka |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/emirates-opens-floating-hospital-in-dhaka-1.461015 |newspaper=Gulf News |date=24 November 2008 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Friendship launches another hospital ship |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-257544 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=15 November 2012 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received a donation through the [[Islamic Development Bank]] for the operation and construction of five more hospital ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1170216/world|title=Ahoy there!

Starting from 2005, a system of mobile Satellite Clinics was set up, complemented by health workers to serve communities at the grassroots level. Presently, each month, approximately 250,000 persons are treated by Friendship's health program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Friendship also has projects in education, disaster management, good governance, sustainable economic development and cultural preservation. Today Friendship helps about 500,000 people every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The friendlier side of Davos |url=http://www.euronews.com/2016/01/25/the-friendlier-side-of-davos/|work=Euronews |date=25 January 2016 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship's work areas==
[[File:Fr-PG-Cul.jpg|thumb|Cultural Preservation]]
Friendship supports communities mainly in the shifting northern river islands, known as chars, of the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] rivers and in the coastal areas of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Friendship is active in 22 [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|Upazilas]] over 12 Districts of Bangladesh. Today, its operations are most intense and multi-Sectoral in the districts of [[Kurigram District|Kurigram]] and [[Gaibandha District|Gaibandha]] in the North, and [[Patuakhali|Patuakali]] and [[Satkhira District|Satkhira]] in the South.

==Friendship International==
Three years after Friendship went into operation in [[Bangladesh]], Runa Khan took steps to set up a network of supporting organisations in Europe. Today Friendship is present in 5 countries in Europe including [[Luxembourg]], France, [[Netherlands]], UK and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banquedeluxembourgnews.com/news/entry/friendship-a-network-projects-and|title=Friendship: a network, projects and outlets|last=|first=|date=25 May 2014|website=Banque de Luxembourg|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">The '''Grossman model of health demand''' is a model for studying the demand for health and medical care outlined by [[Michael Grossman (economist)|Michael Grossman]] in a monograph in 1972 entitled: ''The demand for health: A theoretical and empirical investigation''. The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the "founding father of demand for health models".&lt;ref name="JRC2012"&gt;Jones, Andrew M. Rice, Nigel, and Contoyannis, Paul. ''The Dynamics of Health'' in Jones, Andrew M., ed. The Elgar companion to health economics. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012. p15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Dynamic optimization problems are often optimized using comparative statics, setting partial derivatives of the outcome function of interest, in this case the utility function, equal to zero. When the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to health consumption is assumed to equal zero, the resulting sub-model is the investment model. Solutions to the problem of this sub-model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

==Theoretical expansions==
The Grossman model was extended in a number of directions. Among the first to include uncertainty in the model were Charles Phelps and Maureen Cropper.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Charles E. "Demand for reimbursement insurance." In The role of health insurance in the health services sector, pp. 115-162. NBER, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, Maureen L. "Health, investment in health, and occupational choice." Journal of Political Economy 85, no. 6 (1977): 1273-1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between education and health was expanded in the model by Isaac Ehrlich.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Isaac. On the interaction between education and health and the concept of human capital. Mimeo., Jan, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the relationship between education and medical care demand, one important question is whether the marginal efficiency of capital elasticity with respect to education is less than or greater than one. If the curve is elastic (elasticity greater than one), education will increase medical care demand. On the other hand, if the curve is inelastic, education will decrease medical care demand.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Jan Acton expanded the time constraint by including travel and waiting time in health care.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, Jan Paul. "Nonmonetary factors in the demand for medical services: some empirical evidence." Journal of Political Economy 83, no. 3 (1975): 595-614.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"&gt;Grossman 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical estimation==
Important empirical studies into these components include the RAND Health Insurance Study led by [[Joseph Newhouse]] in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This study sought to estimate income, money price, and time price elasticities of demand for medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Willard G., Joseph P. Newhouse, Naihua Duan, Emmett B. Keeler, and Arleen Leibowitz. "Health insurance and the demand for medical care: evidence from a randomized experiment." The American economic review (1987): 251-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"/&gt; Another important study was the Oregon Health Insurance in the late 2000s and also estimated the role of public health provision on healthcare demand and was led by [[Katherine Baicker]] and [[Amy Finkelstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Amy, Sarah Taubman, Bill Wright, Mira Bernstein, Jonathan Gruber, Joseph P. Newhouse, Heidi Allen, Katherine Baicker, and Oregon Health Study Group. "The Oregon health insurance experiment: evidence from the first year." The Quarterly journal of economics 127, no. 3 (2012): 1057-1106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the model, health is neither a pure investment good nor a pure consumption good, but health stock benefits the agent in two ways, directly increasing utility and second by increasing healthy time available for other activities. One early criticism is that framing health as a dicotomous concept is intuitively wrong in that health is simultaneously both and health provides both alternatives simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Muurinen, Jaana-Marja. "Demand for health: a generalised Grossman model." Journal of Health economics 1, no. 1 (1982): 5-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Lloyd Hopkins''' (August 17, 1890 – January 29, 1946) was an American social worker, the 8th [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], and one of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s closest advisors. He was one of the architects of the [[New Deal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newdealproject.org/|title=New Deal Project|author=|date=|work=NewDealProject.org|access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the relief programs of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), which he directed and built into the largest employer in the country. In [[World War II]], he was Roosevelt's chief diplomatic adviser and troubleshooter.

Born in [[Iowa]], Hopkins settled in [[New York City]] after he graduated from [[Grinnell College]]. He accepted a position in New York City's Bureau of Child Welfare and worked for various social work and public health organizations. He was elected president of the [[National Association of Social Workers]] in 1923. In 1931, [[Jesse I. Straus]] hired Hopkins as the executive director of New York's Temporary Emergency Relief Administration. His leadership of the program earned the attention of Roosevelt, then the governor of New York, and Roosevelt brought Hopkins into his presidential administration after his victory in the 1932 presidential election. Hopkins supervised the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]], the [[Civil Works Administration]], and the [[Works Progress Administration]]. He also served as Secretary of Commerce from 1938 to 1940.

Hopkins served as an important foreign policy adviser and diplomat during World War II. He was a key policy maker in the [[Lend-Lease]] program that sent $50 billion in aid to [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]; [[Winston Churchill]] in his memoirs devotes a veritable [[panegyric]] to this "natural leader of men" who had "a flaming soul".&lt;ref name=wc&gt;{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston S.|title=The Grand Alliance|year=1948|publisher=Rosetta Books|isbn=978-0-7953-0616-7|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins dealt with "priorities, production, political problems with allies, strategy—in short, with anything that might concern the president".&lt;ref&gt;Henry H. Adams, ''Witness to Power: The Life of Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy'' (1985) p 184&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the major conferences of the Allied powers, including the [[Cairo Conference]], the [[Tehran Conference]], the [[Casablanca Conference]], and the [[Yalta Conference]]. His health declined after 1939 due to stomach cancer, and Hopkins died in 1946 at the age of 55.

==Early life==
Hopkins was born at 512 Tenth Street in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], the fourth child of four sons and one daughter of David Aldona and Anna (''née'' Pickett) Hopkins. His father, born in [[Bangor, Maine]], ran a harness shop (after an erratic career as a salesman, prospector, storekeeper and bowling-alley operator), but his real passion was bowling, and he eventually returned to it as a business. Anna Hopkins, born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], had moved at an early age to [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], where she married David. She was deeply religious and active in the affairs of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church. Shortly after Harry was born, the family moved successively to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]], and [[Kearney, Nebraska|Kearney]] and [[Hastings, Nebraska]]. They spent two years in [[Chicago]] and finally settled in [[Grinnell, Iowa]].

Hopkins attended [[Grinnell College]] and soon after his graduation in 1912 took a job with Christodora House, a social [[settlement house]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]] [[ghetto]]. In the spring of 1913, he accepted a position from John A. Kingsbury of the [[New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor]] (AICP) as "friendly visitor" and superintendent of the Employment Bureau within the AICP's Department of Family Welfare. During the 1915 recession, Hopkins and the AICP's William Matthews, with $5,000 from [[Elizabeth Milbank Anderson]]'s [[Milbank Memorial Fund]], organized the Bronx Park Employment program, one of the first public employment programs in the U.S.{{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=61, 67&amp;ndash;9}}

==Social and public health work==
In 1915, New York City Mayor [[John Purroy Mitchel]] appointed Hopkins executive secretary of the [[Bureau of Child Welfare]] which administered pensions to mothers with dependent children.

Hopkins at first opposed America's entrance into [[World War I]], but, when war was declared in 1917, he supported it enthusiastically. He was rejected for the draft because of a bad eye.{{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=128}} Hopkins moved to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] where he worked for the [[American Red Cross]] as director of Civilian Relief, Gulf Division. Eventually, the Gulf Division of the Red Cross merged with the Southwestern Division and Hopkins, headquartered now in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], was appointed general manager in 1921. Hopkins helped draft a charter for the [[American Association of Social Workers]] (AASW) and was elected its president in 1923.

In 1922, Hopkins returned to New York City, where the AICP was involved with the [[Milbank Memorial Fund]] and the State Charities Aid Association in running three health demonstrations in New York State. Hopkins became manager of the Bellevue-Yorkville health project and assistant director of the AICP.  In mid-1924 he became executive director of the New York [[Tuberculosis]] Association. During his tenure, the agency grew enormously and absorbed the [[New York Heart Association]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=139&amp;ndash;41}}

In 1931, New York Governor [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] named [[Macy's|R. H. Macy's]] department store president [[Jesse Straus]] as president of the [[Temporary Emergency Relief Administration]] (TERA).  Straus named Hopkins, then unknown to Roosevelt, as TERA's executive director.  His efficient administration of the initial $20&amp;nbsp;million outlay to the agency gained Roosevelt's attention, and in 1932, he promoted Hopkins to the presidency of the agency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Edward Smith]], p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hopkins and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] began a long friendship, which strengthened his role in relief programs.&lt;ref&gt;George T. McJimsey, ''Harry Hopkins: Ally of the Poor and Defender of Democracy'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1933, Roosevelt summoned Hopkins to Washington as federal relief administrator. Convinced that paid work was psychologically more valuable than cash handouts, Hopkins sought to continue and expand New York State's work-relief programs, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration. He supervised the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA), the [[Civil Works Administration]] (CWA), and the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA).  Over 90% of the people employed by the Hopkins programs were unemployed or on relief. He feuded with [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], who ran a rival program&amp;mdash;the [[Public Works Administration]]&amp;mdash;which also created jobs but did not require applicants to be unemployed or on relief.&lt;ref&gt;McJimsey, ''Harry Hopkins'' (1987) ch 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tax-spend.JPG|thumb|400px|Although Hopkins denied saying "We will tax and tax, and spend and spend, and elect and elect," critics thought the slogan fit the New Deal very well]] --&gt;

FERA, the largest program from 1933 to 1935, involved giving money to localities to operate work relief projects to employ those on direct relief. CWA was similar but did not require workers to be on relief in order to receive a government sponsored job. In less than four months, the CWA hired four million people, and during its five months of operation, the CWA built and repaired 200 swimming pools, 3,700 playgrounds, 40,000 schools, {{convert|250000|mi|km}} of road, and 12 million feet of sewer pipe.

The WPA, which followed the CWA, employed 8.5 million people in its seven-year history, working on 1.4 million projects, including the building or repair of 103 golf courses, 1,000 airports, 2,500 hospitals, 2,500 sports stadiums, 3,900 schools, 8,192 parks, 12,800 playgrounds, 124,031 bridges, 125,110 public buildings, and {{convert|651087|mi|km}} of highways and roads. The WPA operated on its own, and on selected projects in cooperation with local and state governments, but always with its own staff and budget. Hopkins started programs for youth ([[National Youth Administration]]) and for artists and writers ([[Federal One|Federal One Programs]]). He and Eleanor Roosevelt worked together to publicize and defend New Deal relief programs. He was concerned with rural areas but increasingly focused on [[cities in the Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Howard, ''The WPA and Federal Relief Policy'' (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Hopkins began to decline from his struggle with stomach cancer in the late 1930s, FDR appeared to be training him as a possible successor.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II,'' pp. 69, Random House, New York, NY. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of World War II in Europe, however, FDR himself ran again in 1940, winning an unprecedented third term.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=107}}

==World War II==
On May 10, 1940, after a long night and day of discussing the [[German invasion of the Netherlands]], Belgium, and Luxembourg that had ended the so-called "[[Phony War]]", Roosevelt urged a tired Hopkins to stay for dinner, and then the night, in a second-floor White House bedroom. Hopkins would live out of the bedroom for the next three-and-a-half years.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II,'' p. 69, Random House, New York, NY. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=37}}

During the war years, Hopkins acted as Roosevelt's chief emissary to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. In January 1941 Roosevelt dispatched Hopkins to assess Britain's determination and situation. Churchill escorted this important visitor all over the United Kingdom. Before he returned, at a small dinner party in the North British Hotel, Glasgow, Hopkins rose to propose a toast. "I suppose you wish to know what I am going to say to President Roosevelt on my return. Well I am going to quote to you one verse from the Book of Ruth ... 'Whither thou goest, I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge, thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.'"{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=212&amp;ndash;13}} Hopkins became the administrator of the [[Lend-Lease]] programme, under which the United States gave or loaned to [[Free French Forces|Free France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] food, oil, and [[materiel]]&lt;!--NOT A TYPO--&gt; including warships, warplanes and weaponry in exchange for leases on army and naval bases in Allied territory.

[[File:Harry Hopkins NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|News photo of Hopkins departing for [[United Kingdom|Britain]], January 1941|170px]]
Hopkins had a major voice in policy for the vast $50&amp;nbsp;billion Lend-Lease program, especially regarding supplies, first for Britain and then (upon the German invasion) the USSR. He went to Moscow in July 1941 to make personal contact with [[Joseph Stalin]]. Hopkins recommended, and the president accepted, the inclusion of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s in Lend Lease. He then accompanied Churchill to the [[Atlantic Charter|Atlantic Conference]]. Hopkins promoted an aggressive war against Germany and successfully urged Roosevelt to use the Navy to protect convoys headed for Great Britain before the U.S. entered the war in December 1941. Roosevelt brought him along as advisor to his meetings with Churchill and Stalin at [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo]], [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]], [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca]] in 1942-43, and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] in 1945. [[File:Harry Hopkins meets President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right| Harry Hopkins talks with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] at [[Saky|Saki]] before setting out to [[Yalta]].|220px]]He was a firm supporter of [[China]], which received Lend-Lease aid for its military and air force. Hopkins wielded more diplomatic power than the entire [[State Department]]. Hopkins helped identify and sponsor numerous potential leaders, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwight William Tuttle, ''Harry L. Hopkins and Anglo-American-Soviet Relations, 1941-1945'' (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to live in the White House and saw the President more often than any other advisor.

In mid-1943, Hopkins faced a barrage of criticism from Republicans and the press that he had abused his position for personal profit. One congressman asserted that British media tycoon [[Lord Beaverbrook]] had given Hopkins' wife Louise $500,000 worth of emeralds, which Louise denied. Newspapers ran stories detailing sumptuous dinners that Hopkins attended while making public calls for sacrifice. Hopkins briefly considered suing the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' for libel after a story that compared him to [[Grigory Rasputin]], the famous courtier of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], but was dissuaded by FDR.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=458&amp;ndash;59}}

Although Hopkins' health was steadily declining, Roosevelt sent him on additional trips to Europe in 1945; he attended the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945. He tried to resign after Roosevelt died, but President [[Harry S. Truman]] sent him on one more mission to Moscow.

Hopkins had three sons who served in the armed forces during the war, Robert, David and Stephen. Stephen was killed in action serving in the Marine Corps.&lt;ref&gt;15 Stars, Stanley Weintraub, p. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with the Soviet Union==
Hopkins was the top American official assigned to dealing with Soviet officials during World War II. He interfaced with Soviet officials ranging from the middle ranks to the very highest, including Stalin. [[Anastas Mikoyan]] was Hopkins' counterpart with responsibility for [[Lend-Lease]]. He often explained Roosevelt's plans to Stalin and other top Soviet officials in order to enlist Soviet support for American objectives – an endeavor that met with limited success. A particularly striking example of bad faith was Moscow's refusal to allow American naval experts to see the captured German experimental U-boat station at [[Gdynia]] and thus help the protection of the very convoys that carried Lend-Lease aid.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Norton, 2001, p 150&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Hopkins passed on Stalin's stated goals and needs to Roosevelt. As the top American decision maker in Lend-Lease, he gave priority to supplying the Soviet Union, despite repeated objections from Republicans. As Soviet soldiers were bearing the brunt of the war, Hopkins felt that American aid to the USSR would hasten the war's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;David Roll, ''The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler'' (2012) ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins continued to be a target of attacks even after his death. [[George Racey Jordan]] testified to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] in December 1949 that Hopkins passed nuclear secrets to the USSR. Historians do not cite Jordan as credible—at the time Jordan claimed to have met with Hopkins in Washington regarding uranium shipments, Hopkins was in intensive care at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota. In 1963 the FBI concluded that Jordan "either lied for publicity and profit or was delusional".&lt;ref&gt;David Roll, ''The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler'' (2012) p 399&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that any Soviets who spoke to Hopkins would have been routinely required to report the contact to the [[NKVD]], the Soviet national security agency. Eduard Mark (1998) says that some Soviets, such as master-spy [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], thought Hopkins was pro-Soviet, while others thought he was not.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Mark, "Venona's Source '19' and the 'Trident' Conference of May 1943: Diplomacy or Espionage?" ''Intelligence &amp; National Security,'' April 1998, Vol. 13 Issue 2, p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Verne W. Newton, author of ''FDR and the Holocaust'', said that no writer discussing Hopkins has identified any secrets disclosed, nor any decision in which he distorted American priorities in order to help Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Verne W. |last=Newton |title=A Soviet Agent? Harry Hopkins? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/opinion/a-soviet-agent-harry-hopkins.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 28, 1990 |access-date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Mark demonstrates, Hopkins was not pro-Soviet in his recommendations to FDR; he was anti-German and pro-U.S.  Any "secrets" disclosed were authorized. Mark says that at the time, any actions were taken specifically to help the American war effort, and to prevent the Soviets from making a deal with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Mark, "Venona's Source '19' and the 'Trident' Conference of May 1943: Diplomacy or Espionage?" ''Intelligence &amp; National Security,'' Apr 1998, Vol. 13 Issue 2, p 1–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]] concluded in 2013:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The case advanced for Hopkins' guilt has two parts.  The first is a highly specific claim that Hopkins was a Soviet agent code-named "19," a high-level source who appears in a Soviet cable deciphered by the U.S. National Security Agency.  That claim, however, is entirely mistaken.  The fallback position is that even if Hopkins is not "19," there is nonetheless convincing evidence that he was a Soviet agent.  That claim is based on evidence too weak to be the basis for a confident conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontpagemag.com/2013/john-earl-haynes-and-harvey-klehr/was-harry-hopkins-a-soviet-spy/ John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, "Was Harry Hopkins A Soviet Spy?". ''Frontpage.Mag''. August 16, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820061116/http://frontpagemag.com/2013/john-earl-haynes-and-harvey-klehr/was-harry-hopkins-a-soviet-spy |date=August 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more detail see Harvey  Klehr, and John Earl, Haynes,  "Harry Hopkins and Soviet Espionage" ''Intelligence &amp; National Security'' (Nov 2014) 29#6 pp 864-879. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hopkins may simply have been naïve in his estimation of Soviet intentions. Historian Robert Conquest wrote that "Hopkins seems just to have accepted an absurdly fallacious stereotype of Soviet motivation, without making any attempt whatever to think, or to study the readily available evidence, or to seek the judgement of the knowledgeable. He conducted policy vis-a-vis Stalin with mere dogmatic confidence in his own (and his circle's) unshakeable sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Norton, 2001, p 151&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1913, Hopkins married Ethel Gross (1886–1976), a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant active in New York City's [[Progressive movement]]. They had three sons: David, Robert, and Stephen,{{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=144&amp;ndash;145}} and though Gross divorced Hopkins in 1930 shortly before Hopkins became a public figure, the two kept up an intimate correspondence until 1945. {{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=147}}&lt;ref name=Goldschmidt&gt;Arthur Goldschmidt.

In 1942, Hopkins married Louise Gill Macy (1906–1963) in the [[Yellow Oval Room]] at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse&gt;The White House Historical Society. [https://www.whitehousehistory.org/questions/how-many-weddings-have-been-held-at-the-white-house "How many weddings have been held at the White House?"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Macy was a divorced, gregarious former editor for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. The two continued to live at the White House at Roosevelt's request,{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=349&amp;ndash;50}} though Louise eventually demanded a home of their own. Hopkins ended his long White House stay on December 21, 1943, moving with his wife to a [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] townhouse.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=459, 480}}

==Cancer and death==
In mid-1939, Hopkins was told that he had [[stomach cancer]], and doctors performed an extensive operation that removed 75% of his stomach. What remained of Hopkins' stomach struggled to digest proteins and fat, and a few months after the operation, doctors stated that he had only four weeks to live. At this point, Roosevelt brought in experts who transfused Hopkins with [[blood plasma]] that halted his deterioration. When the "[[Phony War]]" phase of World War II ended in May 1940, the situation galvanised Hopkins; as [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] wrote, "the curative impact of Hopkins' increasingly crucial role in the war effort was to postpone the sentence of death the doctors had given him for five more years".{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=31&amp;ndash;32}}

Though his death has been attributed to his stomach cancer, some historians have suggested that it was the cumulative malnutrition related to his post-cancer digestive problems. Another claim is that Hopkins died from liver failure due to hepatitis or cirrhosis,&lt;ref&gt;David L. Roll, ''The Hopkins Touch'', 2013, pages 404-405&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Robert E. Sherwood|Robert Sherwood]] authoritatively reported that Hopkins' postmortem examination showed the cause of death was [[hemochromatosis]] &lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Sherwood, ''Roosevelt and Hopkins'', 2001 revised edition, page 889&lt;/ref&gt; due to hepatic iron accumulation from his many blood transfusions and iron supplements.

Hopkins died in [[New York City]] on January 29, 1946, at the age of 55. His body was cremated and his ashes interred in his old hometown at the Hazelwood Cemetery in [[Grinnell, Iowa]]. There is a house on the Grinnell College campus named after him.

'''Homeopathy Plus!''' is an [[Australia]]n company run by [[homeopathy|homeopath]] Fran Sheffield in [[Tuggerah, New South Wales]]. It is known for the claim that homeopathy is an effective, and safer, alternative to [[vaccination]] for conditions including [[pertussis|whooping cough]], along with claims that homeopathy is superior to [[chemotherapy]] for cancer.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2867990.htm | title=Homeopathy Plus and Fran Sheffield | work=ABC Lateline | date=2011-04-23 | accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims for "homeoprophylaxis" were assessed as misleading by the Complaints Resolution Panel of the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] and a retraction demanded;&lt;ref name="TGA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tga.gov.au/advert-complaint/homeopathic-homeoprophylaxis-and-homeoprophylactic-products-homeopathy-plus-complaint-no-201105004 | title=Homeopathic, homeoprophylaxis and homeoprophylactic products - Homeopathy Plus - Complaint No 2011/05/004 | publisher=Department of Health, Australian Government | date=2013-03-27 | accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was ignored. The prophylaxis claims were referred to the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC),&lt;ref name="Conversation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theconversation.com/accc-takes-legal-action-over-homeopathy-claims-12399 | title=ACCC takes legal action over homeopathy claims | publisher=The Conversation | date=2013-02-22 | accessdate=December 22, 2014 | author=Palmer, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although this was stated to have resulted in their removal,&lt;ref name="ACCC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-tackles-homeopathy-plus-whooping-cough-claims | title=ACCC tackles Homeopathy Plus!

:2) The First Respondent and the Second Respondent have in trade or commerce:
::a) engaged in conduct that was misleading and deceptive or was likely to mislead and deceive, in contravention of section 18 of the ACL;
::b) in connection with the supply or possible supply of Homeopathic Treatments, and in connection with the promotion of the supply of Homeopathic Treatments, made false or misleading representations that the Homeopathic Treatments are of a particular standard or quality in contravention of section 29(1)(a) and (b) of the ACL; and
::c) in connection with the supply or possible supply of Homeopathic Treatments, and in connection with the promotion of the supply of Homeopathic Treatments, made false or misleading representations that Homeopathic Treatments have a use or benefit in contravention of section 29(1)(g) of the ACL.&lt;ref name="Ars"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/12/australian-court-to-penalize-homeopaths-for-claiming-vaccine-alternative/ | title=Australian court to penalize homeopaths for claiming vaccine alternative | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | date=2014-12-22 | accessdate=December 22, 2014 | author=Timmer, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judgement"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2014/2014fca1412 | title=ACCC Judgement | publisher=ACCC | accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal judge concluded that: "there is no reasonable basis, in the sense of an adequate foundation, in medical science to enable the First Respondent and the Second Respondent to state that Homeopathic
Treatments are safe and effective as an alternative to the Vaccine for the Prevention of Whooping Cough".&lt;ref name="Judgment"&gt;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v. Homeopathy Plus!

Sheffield was also the originator of a controversial [[change.org]] petition to the [[World Health Organization]] calling on the WHO to use homeopathy in the 2014 [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]]; a New Zealand MP who signed the petition was demoted from his position as a result.&lt;ref name="StuffEbola"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10682926/Green-MP-Homeopathy-is-an-option | title=Green MP: Homeopathy is an option | work=Stuff (NZ) | date=2014-10-31 | accessdate=December 22, 2014 | author=Gulliver, Aimee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZHeraldEbola"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11350661 | title=Fight Ebola with homeopathy - MP | work=New Zealand Herald | date=2014-10-30 | accessdate=December 22, 2014 | author=Bennett, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] called the idea of homeopathy for Ebola "barking mad".&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/571278/20141031/homeopathy-ebola-outbreak-john-key-new-zealand.htm#.VJhtvV4gAA | title=New Zealand PM Calls Homeopathic Remedy For Ebola 'Barking Mad' | work=International Business Times | date=2014-10-31 | accessdate=December 22, 2014 | author=Su, Reissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence was announced on October 14, 2015: Fran Sheffield was fined $23,000 and banned from selling the products for five years, and Homeopathy Plus fined $115,000.&lt;ref name="SMH_Fine"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/homeopathy-plus-director-fran-sheffield-banned-from-promoting-vaccines-20151013-gk8ic7.html | title=Homeopathy Plus! director Fran Sheffield banned from promoting 'vaccines' | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=October 14, 2015 | accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idiothetic''' literally means "self-proposition" (Greek derivation), and is used in navigation models (e.g., of a rat in a maze) to describe the use of self-motion cues, rather than [[allothetic]], or external, cues such as landmarks, to determine position and movement. The word is sometimes also spelled "ideothetic" (e.g., Chen et al, 1994 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Head-direction cells in the rat posterior cortex. II. Contributions of visual and ideothetic information to the directional firing.|last = Chen|first = LL|date = 1994|journal = Exp Brain Res |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=24–34|doi = 10.1007/bf00243213|pmid = 7843299}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Idiothetic cues include [[Vestibular nerve|vestibular]], [[Optical flow|optic flow]] and [[proprioception]]. Idiothetic cues are important for the type of navigation known as [[path integration]]&lt;ref name="Mittel73"&gt;Mittelstaedt, H. and Mittelstaedt, M.-L. (1973). "Mechanismen der orientierung ohne richtende aussenreize." [[Fortschritte der Zoologie|Fortschr. Zool.]] 21:46–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstaedt, M.-L. and Mittelstaedt, H. (1980). "Homing by path integration in a mammal." [[Naturwissenschaften]] 67:566–567.&lt;/ref&gt; in which subjects navigate purely using such self-motion cues.

The term ''idiothetic'' is also used in [[personality psychology]]. Idiothetic psychology of personality suggests that personality description follows [[idiographic]] principles, while personality development centres around [[nomothetic]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lamiell, J. T. (1981). Toward an idiothetic psychology of personality. American Psychologist, 36(3), 276–289. http://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.36.3.276&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jefferson Center for Vocational Rehabilitation''' (or '''Jefferson Center''' for short) was a skills center in [[Toledo, Ohio]] from 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Carl | title = Low Marks For Jefferson Center
| publisher = [[Toledo Blade]] | date = January 8, 1988| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tXsUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8QIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4645,4006434&amp;dq=jefferson+center&amp;hl=en| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; until its closure by [[Toledo City School District|Toledo Public Schools]] in June 2000.  It was created to serve troubled high school juniors, seniors and dropouts within Toledo's school district that may have had physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral issues.

==History==
Created in 1970, the Jefferson Center moved into the old [[U.S. Post Office]] building at 1300 Jefferson Avenue in 1972.  The school hoped to be a trendsetter nationally and aimed at TPS students that had issues with their home schools.  Instead of having principals, teachers, students, and a separate set of rules for adults and children, the school was set up with the titles of director, supervisors, evaluators, and trainees.   After much renovation to equip the building for instruction, the school was able to provide programs in building maintenance, child care, fabric service, food service, health care, manufacturing and construction, merchandising, office services, and warehousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wolfe | first = Mary Ellen | title = There’s New Life In The Old Post Office

Despite its intentions to serve troubled teens, the Jefferson Center still had problems with attendance and graduation rates throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Carl | title = Low Marks For Jefferson Center
| publisher = [[Toledo Blade]] | date = January 8, 1988| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tXsUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8QIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4645,4006434&amp;dq=jefferson+center&amp;hl=en| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a short debate on whether it was living up to its original expectations, the school was spared from closure in 1989 along with [[Macomber High School (Toledo, Ohio)|Macomber]]-[[Whitney High School (Toledo, Ohio)|Whitney]] High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lane| first = Tahree| title = School board gives reprieve to Macomber

The Jefferson Center remained open until June 2000 when TPS decided to save $15.2 million by cutting the alternative school, along with Old Orchard Junior High and 67 teaching jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = 2 schools, 67 teachers axed by Toledo board

In April 2011, TPS considered demolishing the building unless an alternative use for it could be found.  A majority of the school board has voiced opinion in favor of keeping the historic 1911 building standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rosenkrans| first = Nolan| title = Old post office could be razed by end of year| publisher = [[Toledo Blade]] | date = April 27, 2011| url = http://toledoblade.com/local/2011/04/27/Old-post-off-ice-could-be-razed-by-end-of-year.html| accessdate = May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lac du Ballon''' is a [[reservoir]] in [[Haut-Rhin]], [[France]] situated in a side valley of [[florival]], on the slope of [[Grand Ballon]] mountain. At an elevation of 988 m, its surface area is 0.08&amp;nbsp;km².

[[File:Col du Ballon.jpg|thumb|left|The lake, seen from the Grand Ballon, across the Ballon pass]]
The small [[glacial lake]] was enlarged by a [[dam]] on the [[moraine]] already in the 16th century. In 1699, [[Vauban]] had it refurbished to supply canals for the building of [[Neuf-Brisach]]. The remainders of this dam were destroyed by flooding in 1740 and 1778.

In 1869, manufacturers dug a gallery to the lake bottom to increase the usable water height. Until 1955, the rock ground became leaky.

1966–1968 the lake was tightened, the dam heightened again, with a flood [[spillway]] at the left end. The old gallery was backfilled, a new bottom outlet with a valve tower built.
In 2000, the dam and the lake shore were masoned, the dam top fixed with concrete.

The lake provides [[fresh water]] supply and [[retention basin|flood protection]] for the Lauch valley and the town of [[Guebwiller]].

The '''Medical Mission Sisters''' (MMS) are a [[congregation (Catholic)#Congregations as a historical category of religious institutes|religious congregation]] of women in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] founded in 1925 and dedicated to providing the poor of the world better access to health care. They were formerly officially known as the "Society of the Catholic Medical Missions".

==History==
The congregation grew out of the experiences of Dr. [[Anna Dengel]], a native of [[Austria]]. Dr. Dengel had served for several years as a medical [[missionary]] to the poor of what was then Northern [[India]] and today is the nation of [[Pakistan]]. She had experienced firsthand the unnecessary sickness and death of countless Muslim women and children, whose customs kept them cut off from medical care administered by male physicians.

After months of traveling to give talks about the conditions in India, and speaking with many members of the [[clergy]], Dr. Dengel became convinced that only a group of Religious Sisters who had been professionally trained as physicians could reach these women, who were cut off from adequate medical care by cultural and religious traditions. Such a project, however, was contrary to [[canon law]] of the time, which prohibited members of religious institutes from practicing medicine.

Nevertheless, she drew up a Constitution for the Community she had in mind and wrote that the members were “to live for God…to dedicate themselves to the service of the sick for the love of God and …to be properly trained according to the knowledge and standards of the time in order to practice medicine in its full scope, to which the Sisters were to dedicate their lives.”

Permission was granted on June 12, 1925, to begin the new Congregation and, on September 30, 1925, the “First Four”—Dr. Anna Dengel of Austria, Dr. Johanna Lyons of Chicago, Evelyn Flieger, R.N., originally from Britain, and Marie Ulbrich, R.N., of Luxemburg, Iowa—came together in Washington, D.C., to begin the Medical Mission Sisters.

The “First Four” were unable to profess [[religious vows]] officially because the Catholic Church had yet to approve Sisters working in the medical field, yet they lived as professed Sisters just the same. Finally, in 1935, after the Medical Mission Sisters had grown, the Catholic Church changed its regulations and approved Sisters’ working in medicine and all of its branches. The Medical Mission Sisters then made their public, [[canon law|canonical]] vows, and they began to establish communities around the world.

==Music==
The North American headquarters for the Congregation came to be established in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1964 when, like [[The Singing Nun]] (Soeur Sourire) had done a year earlier - the Sisters began singing their own homegrown brand of spiritually-themed folk music as an aide to the medical health and wellness they professed.

In 1965 one of the most prolific of these composers, Sister [[Miriam Therese Winter]] had composed what would become a [[Grammy]]-award-winning worldwide hit ''Joy is Like the Rain''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCIXVPYJuSg Joy is Like the Rain]&lt;/ref&gt; Response was so strong to the song that other songs were written and a marathon eight-hour recording session was commissioned in Philadelphia in early 1966, at which this song was recorded along with dozens of others which would make up their first five albums.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Beginnings of international hospitals==
In 1965, at the request of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Addis Ababa]] in [[Ethiopia]], Mother Anna made a visit to that nation to investigate the possibilities of starting a hospital for the people of that nation. Two Medical Mission Sisters arrived in Ethiopia in 1967 to start the groundwork for this mission. A few more Sisters came in 1969, and their work was able to begin. As of 2008, there were a dozen Sisters serving there, both foreigners and native Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecs.org.et/Congreg/Medical%20Mission%20Sisters.htm Ethiopian Catholic Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521004415/http://www.ecs.org.et/Congreg/Medical%20Mission%20Sisters.htm |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
As of 2010, there are about 600 Sisters in the congregation, serving in 17 nations around the globe. The four first Sisters of the Congregation were from three different nations. In keeping with this heritage of internationality among the "First Four", the Sisters in the Congregation today come from 23 nations.

The Sisters serve in a wide variety of ways. Among them, through:  health care and education; wholeness and wellness programs; the development of women; work for justice; worship and spirituality; and music and song. They also have 80 Associates, women and men of many nations who share their values and have committed themselves to live the mission of the Society, which is "to be a healing presence at the heart of a wounded world."

As examples of the range of services the Sisters do in different countries: 
*In India, the Sisters run the Center for Healing and Integration, to train the people low to get low-cost health care through natural resources.
*In [[Pasco County]], [[Florida]], they run a community-based program to connect the unemployed with potential employers.
*A Learning Center for Ecological Spirituality was established in [[Udenhout]], the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Medical Mission Sisters website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baby warming tray.jpg | thumb | 250px |Some fathers fully participate in the birth of their children]]
'''The role of men in childbirth''' in the [[Western world]] has become more participatory than it was in the past. More Western women want their male partners to give active assistance during [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]].

==History==
===United States===
[[File:USMC-110525-M-9426J-003.jpg|left|thumb|Father learns how to care for "practice baby"]]

Until the concluding decades of the 19th century, an experienced [[nurse midwife]], who was considered to be knowledgeable about the birth process, typically helped to deliver a woman's baby. Birth typically took place in the home, and it was considered to be an event for females. It was a time for female friends and relatives to come into the home and care for the mother, her household, provide reassurance, and offer guidance. Birth was not considered to be a private event, but more of a social one, that also could create a strong bond among the participants and supporting attendees.

Physicians there warned that it was dangerous not to receive modern medical attention while delivering children. They also stated one in every thirty women was expected to die because of a lack of medical attention. Due to these warnings, many women favored going into labor with a physician as opposed to a midwife.  Physicians typically prohibited friends and relatives from participating or observing.  The birth process may have been regarded as private or even embarrassing to the patient or the doctor and there were issues of preventing infection. Around 1910,  some states began to outlaw the midwifery practice. Others enacted regulatory requirements which were difficult for many midwives to complete.
Since the 1920s, physician assistance has been predominant during childbirth. However, since the 1960s midwifery has returned and grown in popularity and societal acceptance.  Even during childbirth with a physician, it is now common for women to have their families, particularly their partners, in the delivery room with them. 

To help their wives prepare for childbirth, many male partners participate in specialized childbirth classes, such as [[Lamaze]] or [[Bradley method of natural childbirth]]. Men may give active assistance during childbirth by simply being present during his wife's labor or by coaching during childbirth. Many women find their partners' presence in the delivery room to be comforting.  If he is present the man may be able to assist in making decisions that may be required at various junctures in the childbirth process (for example, regarding the use of [[epidural]], accelerating delivery, dealing with medical problems and other matters).

===Australia===
Until the early 1960s men were typically excluded from the labour room.  However, during this decade there was an increasing pressure on hospitals to allow men into the labour room to provide support for their partners.  It was only by the 1980s that it became common and expected that men would be present when their partners gave birth.  The contemporary Australian experience is that men are expected to be present and support their partners.&lt;ref name="Vernon"&gt;[[David Vernon (writer)|Vernon, David]] (2006) ''[[Men at Birth]]'', [[Australian College of Midwives]], [[Canberra]], {{ISBN|0-9751674-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting husband's aid during pregnancy and delivery==
[[File:USMC-090513-M-4913M-001.jpg|left|thumb|Military father in the "empathy belly" during a Baby Boot Camp  workshop on the basics of newborn care.]]

Many women find it soothing to have someone assist them during their pregnancies, making it more common for a woman's male partner to support her both before and during childbirth. The type and quality of a relationship between a man and a woman is what determines how, and if, the man will be active during his partner’s pregnancy.

===Fear and anxiety===
Some contend that when men are fearful or anxious regarding birth that they actually make the birth more difficult for their partner.  Their fear may be 'transmitted' to their partner and this increases her [[adrenaline]] levels leading to [[Childbirth|labor]] stalling. In some circumstances this may require the use of medications such as [[oxytocin]] to restart labor and thus can sometimes lead to a cascade of intervention that can result in a [[caesarean section]].&lt;ref name="Vernon"/&gt;

==Examples of participation==
Two musicians have played or performed musical works during the delivery of a child of theirs. [[Mickey Hart]] recorded ''[[Music to be Born By]]'' and played it back during delivery, and [[Alfredo Rolando Ortiz]] played [[Paraguayan harp]] at the birth of his child.

'''Mind–body interventions''' are medical and [[alternative medicine|pseudomedical]] interventions based on the idea of the mind influencing the physical body. The category was introduced in September 2000 by the [[United States]] [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH), so encompasses [[alternative medicine]] interventions.&lt;ref&gt;US National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health Collection Development Manual. Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 8 October 2003. [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html Online Version.] Retrieved 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It excludes scientifically validated practices such as [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].

==NCCIH definition==

The [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|NCCIH]] defines mind-body interventions as those practices that "employ a variety of techniques designed to facilitate the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms", and include [[guided imagery]], [[guided meditation]] and forms of [[Meditation|meditative praxis]], [[hypnosis]] and [[hypnotherapy]], [[prayer]], as well as [[art therapy]], [[music therapy]], and [[dance therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, S. E., Expanding Horizons of Healthcare: Five Year Strategic Plan 2001–2005. 25 September 2000. US Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service. National Institutes of Health. NIH Publication No. 01-5001. [https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/about/plans/fiveyear/fiveyear.pdf Online Version] Retrieved 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In conventional medicine==

All mind-body interventions focus on the interaction between the [[brain]], [[Human body|body]], and [[behavior]] and are practiced with intention to use the [[mind]] to alter physical function and promote overall [[health]] and [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, G., Fisher, W., and Johnson, A., Mind–body therapies in integrative oncology. In Current Treatment Options in Oncology, Vol. 11, Nos. 3-4, 2010, pp128-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wieland, L.S., Manheimer E., Berman B.M., Development and classification of an operational definition of complementary and alternative medicine for the Cochrane Collaboration. Alternative therapies in health and medicine, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2011, pp50-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|NCCIH]] does not consider mind-body interventions as within the purview of complementary and alternative medicine when there is sufficient [[scientific evidence]] for the benefit of such practices along with their professional application in [[Medicine|conventional medicine]]. One such practice that the NCCIH defines as a mind-body intervention because it utilizes the [[mind]]'s capacity to affect bodily function and [[symptom]]s, but for which there is sufficient [[scientific evidence]] and [[Medicine|mainstream application]] for it to fall outside the purview of complementary and alternative medicine is [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;US National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health Collection Development Manual. Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 8 October 2003. [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html Online Version.] Retrieved 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative terms==

Since 2008, authors documenting research conducted on behalf of the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|NCCIH]] have used terms "mind and body practices" and "mind-body medicine" interchangeably with "mind-body interventions" to denote both [[Therapy|therapeutic]] as well as [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|physical]] and [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|mental]] rehabilitative practices that "focus on the relationships between the brain, mind, body, and behavior, and their effect on health and disease."&lt;ref&gt;Wahbeh, H., Haywood, A., Kaufman, K., and Zwickey, H., Mind–body medicine and immune system outcomes: a systematic review. The Open Complementary Medicine Journal, Vol. 1, 2009, pp25-34.&lt;/ref&gt; and have furthermore attested requisite professional competence among those administering such practices, stating that "mind and body practices include a large and diverse group of procedures or techniques administered or taught by a trained practitioner or teacher".&lt;ref&gt;Complementary, Alternative, or Integrative Health: What’s In a Name?

==Evidence for efficacy==

There are documented benefits of several mind-body interventions derived from [[Scientific method|scientific research]] firstly into their use in contributing to the treatment a range of conditions including [[headache]]s, [[coronary artery disease]] and [[chronic pain]]; secondly in ameliorating [[disease]] and the [[symptom]]s of [[Chemotherapy | chemotherapy-induced]] [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and localized [[Pain|physical pain]] in patients with [[cancer]]; thirdly in increasing the perceived capacity to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with significant problems and challenges; and fourthly in improving the reported overall [[quality of life]]. In addition, there is evidence supporting the [[brain]] and [[central nervous system]]'s influence on the [[immune system]] and the capacity for mind-body interventions to enhance [[Immune system|immune function]] outcomes, including defense against and recovery from [[infection]] and [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, E., Pittler, M.H., Wider, B., and Boddy, K., Mind–body therapies: are the trial data getting stronger?

'''Breast Cancer Awareness Month''' ('''BCAM'''), also referred to in America as '''National Breast Cancer Awareness Month''' ('''NBCAM'''), is an annual international health campaign organized by major [[breast cancer]] charities every October to increase [[breast cancer awareness|awareness of the disease]] and to [[fundraising|raise funds]] for research into its cause, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure. The campaign also offers information and support to those affected by breast cancer.

Breast cancer awareness month is a yearly campaign that intend educate people about the importance of early screening, test and more. This campaign starts on October 1st and ends on October 31st every year.

==History==
[[Image:P20171001MC-0035 (36802991953).jpg|thumb|[[White House]] illuminated pink in honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in 2017]]

NBCAM was founded in 1985 in October as a partnership between the [[American Cancer Society]] and the pharmaceutical division of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (now part of [[AstraZeneca]], producer of several anti-breast cancer drugs).  The aim of the NBCAM from the start has been to promote mammography as the most effective weapon in the fight against breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcam.org/about_faq.cfm |title=About Us |publisher=National Breast Cancer Awareness Month |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716123431/http://www.nbcam.org/about_faq.cfm |archivedate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 [[Evelyn Lauder]], Senior Corporate Vice President of the [[Estée Lauder Companies]], founded [[The Breast Cancer Research Foundation]] and established the [[pink ribbon]] as its symbol, though this was not the first time the ribbon was used to symbolize breast cancer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esteelauder.com/templates/products/multiproduct.tmpl?ngextredir=1&amp;CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY5887 |title=Estée Lauder Official Site |publisher=Esteelauder.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326022114/http://www.esteelauder.com/templates/products/multiproduct.tmpl?ngextredir=1&amp;CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY5887 |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 68-year-old California woman named Charlotte Haley, whose sister, daughter, and granddaughter had breast cancer, had distributed peach-color ribbons to call attention to what she perceived as inadequate funding for research.&lt;ref name=Kolata30Oct&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=October 30, 2015|first=Gina|last=Kolata|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/health/breast-cancer-awareness-pink.html|title=A Growing Disenchantment With October ‘Pinkification’}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1991, the [[Susan G. Komen Foundation]] had handed out pink [[ribbon (award)|ribbons]] to participants in its New York City race for breast [[cancer survivor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/before-you-buy/history-of-the-pink-ribbon/ |title=History of the Pink Ribbon |publisher=Think Before You Pink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Delta Air Lines]] painted N845MH,a [[Boeing 767]]-432ER in "Breast Cancer Research Foundation" special colors. In September 2015, a newer version of the livery was repainted on the same plane.

==Activities and events==

A variety of events around the world are organized in October, including walks and runs, and the pink illumination of landmark buildings. In the United States, the [[National Football League]] promotes breast cancer awareness by incorporating pink on and off the field, and [[comic strip]] artists use pink on one day in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/lifestyles/2010/oct/10/pink10-ar-553154/|title=Comic strips go pink for breast-cancer awareness|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-10-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20101108133359/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/lifestyles/2010/oct/10/pink10-ar-553154/|archivedate=2010-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Race for the Cure===
In October 1983 the [[Race for the Cure]] was held for the first time in Dallas, Texas, where 800 people participated.  According to the organizers, by 2002 the number of participants reached 1.3 million and the event was held in over 100 US cities.  The event is also being organized in several other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.komen.org/Komen/NewsEvents/RacefortheCure/index.htm Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure] Susan G.

===Susan G. Komen 3 Day ===
This 60-mile fundraising walk, which is spread across 3 days, raises money for breast cancer research. This walk, which benefits [[Susan G. Komen]], occurs in seven cities in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;the3day.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male breast cancer==
[[Male breast cancer]], which is rare, is generally overlooked.  In 2009 the male breast cancer advocacy groups Out of the Shadow of Pink, A Man's Pink, and the Brandon Greening Foundation for Breast Cancer in Men joined together to globally establish the third week of October as "Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Criticisms ==

Inspiration for the foundation of NBCAM came from Zeneca Inc. in 1989 when they began a breast cancer screening program within their company. In 1996, with the screening program and study complete, Zeneca Inc. analyzed the total monetary amounts lost due to the increase in health care provided compared with the total monetary amounts lost if the company was to scrap the program were compared. The total costs to the company of running the early detection program were estimated to be $400,000. Total costs to the company if they chose not to run the program were estimated to be around $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pezzullo|first=Phaedra|title=Resisting "National Breast Cancer Awareness Month": The Rhetoric of Counterpublics and their Cultural Performances|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=November 2003|volume=89|issue=4|pages=345–365|doi=10.1080/0033563032000160981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pezzullo (2003) "(Astra)Zeneca’s initial justification for NBCAM was one of basic accounting, not a critique of how women’s healthcare has been assessed or implemented nor a desire to prevent women from developing breast cancer; instead, it was cost-effective for a company to detect cancer in its employees during the disease’s earlier stages."

Critics have said that "the BCAM idea 'was conceived and paid for by a British chemical company that both profits from this epidemic and may be contributing to its cause...'".&lt;ref&gt;Janette D. Sherman, M.D.(New York and London: Taylor and
Francis, 2000). {{ISBN|1-56032-870-3}}. Life's Delicate Balance  [http://www.safe2use.com/drsherman/life/15.htm ''THE CANCER MOVEMENT: Independent, Sold-Out, or Bought Up? '' ].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes referred to as ''National Breast Cancer Industry Month'', critics of NBCAM point to a conflict of interest between corporations sponsoring [[breast cancer awareness]] while profiting from diagnosis and treatment. The breast cancer advocacy organization, [[Breast Cancer Action]], has said repeatedly in newsletters and other information sources that October has become a [[public relations]] campaign that avoids discussion of the causes and prevention of breast cancer and instead focuses on "awareness" as a way to encourage women to get their mammograms. The term ''[[pinkwashing (breast cancer)|pinkwashing]]'' has been used by Breast Cancer Action to describe the actions of companies which manufacture and use chemicals which show a link with breast cancer and at the same time publicly support charities focused on curing the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/FocusOnPinkwashers.html Focus on Pinkwashers], Breast Cancer Action's ''think before you pink'' campaign site. Retrieved November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other criticisms center on the marketing of "pink products" and tie-ins, citing that more money is spent marketing these campaigns than is donated to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/PDF/NYTimesAd.pdf Who's Really Cleaning Up Here] Breast Cancer Action's ''think before you pink'' campaign site. Retrieved November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'' in October 2015, fine print disclaimers on pink products sold by [[Dick's Sporting Goods]] reveal that in some instances, no money at all is donated to breast cancer research.&lt;ref name=Kolata30Oct/&gt; Other companies cap the amount they give to research during each October's "pink" campaign, but do not tell consumers when that cap has been reached.&lt;ref name=Kolata30Oct/&gt;

'''Optomyography (OMG)''' was proposed in 2015 as a technique that could be used to monitor muscular activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Optomyography (OMG): A Novel Technique for the Detection of Muscle Surface Displacement Using Photoelectric Sensors |last1=Hamid Muhammed |first1=Hamed |last2=Raghavendra |first2=Jammalamadaka |date=2015 |conference=Measurements - Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Bioelectromagnetism, International Society for Bioelectromagnetism |volume=10 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:886303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to use OMG for the same applications where [[Electromyography]] (EMG) and [[Mechanomyography]] (MMG) are used. However, OMG offers superior [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and improved robustness against the disturbing factors and limitations of EMG and MMG.
The basic principle of OMG is to use active near-infra-red optical sensors to measure the variations in the measured signals that are reflected from the surface of the skin while activating the muscles below and around the skin spot where the photoelectric sensor is focusing to measure the signals reflected from this spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=A New Approach for Rehabilitation and Upper-Limb Prosthesis Control Using Optomyography (OMG) |last1=Hamid Muhammed |first1=Hamed |last2=Raghavendra |first2=Jammalamadaka |date=2016 |conference=THE 1ST 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (IBIOMED 2016) |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7869814/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Generating proper control signals is the most important task to be able to control any kind of a prosthesis, computer game or any other system which contains a human-computer interaction unit or module. For this purpose, surface-Electromyographic (s-EMG) and Mechanomyographic (MMG) signals are measured during muscular activities and used, not only for monitoring and assessing these activities, but also to help in providing efficient rehabilitation treatment for patients suffering from disabilities as well as in constructing and controlling sophisticated prostheses for various types of amputees and disabilities. However, while the existing s-EMG and MMG based systems have compelling benefits, many engineering challenges still remain unsolved, especially with regard to the sensory control system.

'''Overactive let-down''' ('''OALD''') is the forceful ejection of [[milk]] from the [[breast]] during [[breastfeeding]]. In some women it occurs only with the first let-down in a feeding, occasionally women may have multiple strong letdowns during a feeding. OALD can make breastfeeding difficult and can be the source of some [[Breastfeeding difficulties|breastfeeding complications]]. It may also be known as hyper milk-ejection. A woman may have OALD in addition to an oversupply of  breastmilk. (Often called foremilk-hindmilk imbalance, [[hyperlactation syndrome]], oversupply colic syndrome, and other near synonyms.) 
The physical or medical cause of an overactive let-down is still unknown. Whether mothers with OALD have a higher overall milk volume – or a strong reaction to the hormone [[oxytocin]] (which causes the let-down reflex) also remains to be seen.

==Complications==
The forceful spray of milk can cause the baby to consume too much milk too quickly as well as to swallow air during the period of rapid swallowing following the let-down. The speed of the flow of milk into the mouth can cause the baby to react with reduced nursing times and aversion to nursing often described by mothers as "fussiness", "[[colic]]ky", "dislikes nursing", or "is weaning". Some babies, especially those of approximately 2–4 months of age, become increasingly upset with the spray of milk which may increase their aversion to nursing to the point of refusing the breast (a nursing strike).

Overactive let-down can be a part of a constellation of symptoms that make up oversupply syndrome or oversupply colic. Babies coping with OSS, gain weight quickly in the early months, even while nursing for short period. Some OSS babies sleep for surprisingly long periods of time and depth, possibly due to an over-full feeling, while others have very disturbed sleep, possibly due to gastrointestinal pain.

==Treatment==
There are effective remedies{{examples|date=January 2013}} for overactive let-down, and oversupply syndrome, however aggressive treatment should be watched carefully by someone familiar with the condition as the mother is at a higher risk for plugged ducts, mastitis and other breast infections.

Overactive let-down can take a long time to control and can be frustrating for the mother and baby, but when controlled effectively a long and satisfying breastfeeding relationship is possible. Mothers with this condition are often given various incorrect rationales for their concerns such as "having weak milk", or "bad milk", it's "just colic", the baby will "grow out of it", or the child is "allergic to your milk", or a food in the mother's diet.

There are no valid reasons to stop breastfeeding due to this condition.

A strong letdown reflex often coincides with overactive milk production, engorgement, and problems with the sucking/breathing pattern of the baby. 

Remedies for Engorgement include:
* Gentle [[breast massage]] from the chest wall toward the nipple area before nursing.
* Cool compresses for up to 20 minutes before nursing.
* Moist warmth for a few minutes before nursing may help the milk begin to flow. Avoid using warmth for more than a few minutes as the warmth can increase swelling and inflammation.
* When preparing to nurse, mothers should allow the initial letdown reflex to occur and then subside before beginning the nursing session. Or they may stop the nursing momentarily until that strong letdown reflex passes. This will allow the milk flow to normalize. For very young infants, it may help to hand express the initial milk flow. It can extend the nursing session which is preferable for young infants.

Remedies for OALD include:

* When nursing, listen carefully to the breathing and sucking pattern of the baby. If the pattern is interrupted and it sounds as if the baby is struggling to swallow, gently slip a finger in the baby's mouth and remove the nipple until the baby is able to swallow and breathe. Also, have a hand towel near during nursing. It can be easily tucked into the bra to absorb the overflow of milk when waiting for that letdown reflex to subside.
* Nurse early and often – at least 10 times per 24 hours. Don't skip feedings (even at night).
* Nurse on baby's cues ("on demand"). If baby is very sleepy: wake baby to nurse every 2–3 hours, allowing one longer stretch of 4–5 hours at night.
* Allow baby to finish the first breast before offering the other side. Switch sides only once baby pulls off or falls asleep. Don't limit baby's time at the breast.

[[Breast pump|Pumping off milk]] should be done only with the guidance of an experienced breastfeeding counselor, as part of a unilateral ad lib protocol.

In general, '''quality of life''' ('''QoL''' or '''QOL''') is the perceived [[wikt:quality#Noun|quality]] of an individual's daily life, that is, an assessment of their [[wikt:well-being|well-being]] or lack thereof. This includes all [[emotional]], [[social]] and physical aspects of the individual's life. In [[health care]], '''health-related quality of life''' (HRQoL) is an assessment of how the individual's well-being may be affected over time by a [[disease]], [[disability]] or [[disorder (medicine)|disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/concept.htm CDC - Concept - Health-Related Quality of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bottomley A | title = The cancer patient and quality of life | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 120–5 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11961195 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.7-2-120 | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/7/2/120 | access-date = 2015-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Early versions of healthcare-related quality of life measures referred to simple assessments of physical abilities by an external rater (for example, the patient is able to get up, eat and drink, and take care of personal hygiene without any help from others) or even to a single measurement (for example, the angle to which a limb could be flexed).

The current concept of health-related quality of life acknowledges that subjects put their actual situation in relation to their personal expectation.&lt;ref name="hqlo.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jongen PJ, Lehnick D, Sanders E, Seeldrayers P, Fredrikson S, Andersson M, Speck J | title = Health-related quality of life in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients during treatment with glatiramer acetate: a prospective, observational, international, multi-centre study | journal = Health and Quality of Life Outcomes | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 133 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21078142 | pmc = 2999586 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7525-8-133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2018|sure=y}} The latter can vary over time, and react to external influences such as length and severity of illness, family support, etc. As with any situation involving multiple perspectives, patients' and physicians' rating of the same objective situation have been found to differ significantly. Consequently, health-related quality of life is now usually assessed using patient questionnaires. These are often multidimensional and cover physical, [[social]], [[emotional]], [[cognitive]], work- or role-related, and possibly [[Spirituality|spiritual]] aspects as well as a wide variety of disease related symptoms, therapy induced side effects, and even the financial impact of medical conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid14613562"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burckhardt CS, Anderson KL | title = The Quality of Life Scale (QOLS): reliability, validity, and utilization | journal = Health and Quality of Life Outcomes | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 60 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14613562 | pmc = 269997 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7525-1-60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often used interchangeably with the measurement of health status, both health-related quality of life and health status measure different concepts.

=== Activities of daily living ===
{{Main|Activities of daily living}}
Because health problems can interfere with even the most basic aspects of daily living (for example, [[breathing]] comfortably, quality of [[sleep]], eliminating wastes, feeding oneself, dressing, and others), the [[health care]] professions have codified the concepts of [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs) and [[activities of daily living#Instrumental ADLs|instrumental activities of daily living]] (IADLs). Such analysis and classification helps to at least partially [[objectivity (science)|objectify]] quality of life. It cannot eliminate all [[subjectivity]], but it can help improve measurement and [[communication]] by [[Quantification (science)|quantifying]] and by reducing [[ineffability]].

===Examples===
{{See also|List of patient-reported quality of life surveys}}
Similar to other [[psychometrics|psychometric]] assessment tools, health-related quality of life questionnaires should meet certain quality criteria, most importantly with regard to their reliability and validity. Hundreds of validated health-related quality of life questionnaires have been developed, some of which are specific to various illnesses. 
The questionnaires can be generalized into two categories:

''Generic instruments''
*CDC HRQOL–14 "Healthy Days Measure": A questionnaire with four base questions and ten optional questions used by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/hrqol14_measure.htm).
*[[SF-36|Short-Form Health Survey]] (SF-36, SF-12, SF-8): One example of a widely used questionnaire assessing physical and mental health-related quality of life. Used in clinical trials and population health assessments. Suitable for [[pharmacoeconomics|pharmacoeconomic]] analysis, benefiting healthcare rationing.
*[[EQ-5D]] a simple quality of life questionnaire (https://euroqol.org).
*[[AQoL-8D]] a comprehensive questionnaire &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richardson J, Iezzi A, Khan MA, Maxwell A | title = Validity and reliability of the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D multi-attribute utility instrument | journal = The Patient | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–96 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24271592 | doi = 10.1007/s40271-013-0036-x | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40271-013-0036-x | pmc = 3929769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maxwell A, Özmen M, Iezzi A, Richardson J | title = Deriving population norms for the AQoL-6D and AQoL-8D multi-attribute utility instruments from web-based data | journal = Quality of Life Research | volume = 25 | issue = 12 | pages = 3209–3219 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27344318 | doi = 10.1007/s11136-016-1337-z | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-016-1337-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; that assesses HR-QoL over 8 domains - independent living, happiness, mental health, coping, relationships, self-worth, pain, senses (https://www.aqol.com.au).
''Disease, disorder or condition specific instruments''

==Utility==
A variety of validated surveys exist for [[health care providers|healthcare providers]] to use for measuring a patient’s health-related quality of life. The results are then used to help determine [[therapy|treatment]] options for the patient based on past results from other patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Measures Quality of Life   |url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/foundation-health-measures/Health-Related-Quality-of-Life-and-Well-Being|website=www.healthypeople.gov|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to measure intra-individual improvements in QoL pre- and post-treatment.

When it is used as a [[longitudinal study]] device that surveys patients before, during, and after treatment, it can help [[health care providers]] determine which treatment plan is the best option, thereby improving healthcare through an evolutionary process.

===Importance===
There is a growing field of research concerned with developing, evaluating, and applying quality of life measures within health related research (e.g. within [[randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled studies]]), especially in relation to [[Health Services Research]]. Well-executed health-related quality of life research informs those tasked with health rationing or anyone involved in the [[decision-making]] process of agencies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[European Medicines Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bottomley A, Jones D, Claassens L | title = Patient-reported outcomes: assessment and current perspectives of the guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration and the reflection paper of the European Medicines Agency | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–53 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19013787 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.09.032 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804908007922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marquis P, Caron M, Emery MP |title=The Role of Health-Related Quality of Life Data in the Drug Approval Processes in the US and Europe: A Review of Guidance Documents and Authorizations of Medicinal Products from 2006 to 2010 |url= http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25030/The_Role_of_Health_Related_Quality_of_Life_Data_in.2.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=147–60 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/bf03256856|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, health-related quality of life research may be used as the final step in [[clinical trials]] of experimental therapies.

The understanding of Quality of Life is recognized as an increasingly important healthcare topic because the relationship between cost and value raises complex problems, often with high emotional attachment because of the potential impact on human life. For instance, healthcare providers must refer to [[cost-benefit analysis]] to make economic decisions about access to expensive drugs that may prolong life by short amount of time and/or provide a minimal increase to quality of life. Additionally, these treatment drugs must be weighed against the cost of alternative treatments or [[preventative medicine]]. In the case of chronic and/or terminal illness where no effective cure is available, an emphasis is placed on improving health-related quality of life through interventions such as symptom management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Symptom management | work = NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms | url = https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/symptom-management | publisher = United States National Cancer Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[adaptive technology]], and [[palliative care]].

In the realm of elder care, research indicates that improvements in quality of life ratings may also improve resident outcomes, which can lead to substantial cost savings over time. Research has also shown that quality of life ratings can be successfully used as a key-performance metric when designing and implementing organizational change initiatives in nursing homes.&lt;ref name="pmid10794190"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell JM, Kemp BJ | title = Quality of life in assisted living homes: a multidimensional analysis | journal = The Journals of Gerontology. Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = P117–27 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10794190 | doi = 10.1093/geronb/55.2.P117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Research revolving around Health Related Quality of Life is extremely important because of the implications that it can have on current and future treatments and health protocols. Thereby, validated health-related quality of life questionnaires can become an integral part of clinical trials in determining the trial drugs' value in a cost-benefit analysis. For example, the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) is using their health-related quality of life survey, [https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/hrqol14_measure.htm Healthy Day Measure], as part of research to identify health disparities, track population trends, and build broad coalitions around a measure of population health. This information can then be used by multiple levels of government or other officials to "increase quality and years of life" and to "eliminate health disparaties" for equal opportunity.
&lt;ref name="pmid8054098"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Testa MA, Nackley JF | title = Methods for quality-of-life studies | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 535–59 | date = 1994 | pmid = 8054098 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.15.050194.002535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
The quality of life ethic refers to an ethical principle that uses assessments of the quality of life that a person could potentially experience as a foundation for making decisions about the continuation or termination of life. It is often used in contrast to or in opposition to the [[sanctity of life]] ethic.

==Analysis==

===Statistical biases===
It is not considered uncommon for there to be some [[statistic]]al anomalies during data analysis. Some of the more frequently seen in health-related quality of life analysis are the [[ceiling effect (statistics)|ceiling effect]], the floor effect, and response shift bias.

The ceiling effect refers to how patients who start with a higher quality of life than the average patient do not have much room for improvement when treated. The opposite of this is the floor effect, where patients with a lower quality of life average have much more room for improvement.&lt;ref name="hqlo.com"/&gt; Consequentially, if the spectrum of quality of life before treatment is too unbalanced, there is a greater potential for skewing the end results, creating the possibility for incorrectly portraying a treatment's effectiveness or lack thereof.

====Response shift bias====
Response shift bias is an increasing problem within longitudinal studies that rely on [[patient-reported outcome|patient reported outcomes]].&lt;ref name="pmid16146573"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ring L, Höfer S, Heuston F, Harris D, O'Boyle CA | title = Response shift masks the treatment impact on patient reported outcomes (PROs): the example of individual quality of life in edentulous patients | journal = Health and Quality of Life Outcomes | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 55 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16146573 | pmc = 1236951 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7525-3-55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2018|sure=y}} It refers to the potential of a subject’s views, values, or expectations changing over the course of a study, thereby adding another factor of change on the end results. [[Clinicians]] and [[health care providers|healthcare providers]] must recalibrate surveys over the course of a study to account for Response Shift Bias.&lt;ref name="pmid15955236"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner JA | title = Response shift and glycemic control in children with diabetes | journal = Health and Quality of Life Outcomes | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 38 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15955236 | pmc = 1180844 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7525-3-38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2018|sure=y}} The degree of recalibration varies due to factors based on the individual area of investigation and length of study.

===Statistical variation===
[[File:Standard deviation diagram.svg|thumb|Standard deviation]]
In a study by Norman et al. about health-related quality of life surveys, it was found that most survey results were within a half [[standard deviation]]. Norman et al. theorized that this is due to the limited human discrimination ability as identified by [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] in 1956. Utilizing the [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|Magic Number of 7 ± 2]], Miller theorized that when the scale on a survey extends beyond 7 ± 2, humans fail to be consistent and lose ability to differentiate individual steps on the scale because of [[channel capacity]].

Norman et al. proposed health-related quality of life surveys use a half standard deviation as the statistically significant benefit of a treatment instead of calculating survey-specific “minimally important differences", which are the supposed real-life improvements reported by the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norman GR, Sloan JA, Wyrwich KW | title = Interpretation of changes in health-related quality of life: the remarkable universality of half a standard deviation | journal = Medical Care | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 582–92 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12719681 | doi = 10.1097/01.MLR.0000062554.74615.4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Norman et al. proposed all health-related quality of life survey scales be set to a half standard deviation instead of calculating a scale for each survey validation study where the steps are referred to as "minimally important differences".

'''Estimation of a Rasch model''' is used to estimate the parameters of the [[Rasch model]]. Various techniques are employed to estimate the parameters from matrices of response data. The most common approaches are types of [[maximum likelihood]] estimation, such as joint and conditional maximum likelihood estimation. Joint maximum likelihood (JML) equations are efficient, but inconsistent for a finite number of items, whereas conditional maximum likelihood (CML) equations give consistent and unbiased item estimates. Person estimates are generally thought to have [[bias of an estimator|bias]] associated with them, although weighted likelihood estimation methods for the estimation of person parameters reduce the bias.

==Rasch model==
The Rasch model for dichotomous data takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pr \{X_{ni}=1\}=\frac{\exp({\beta_n} - {\delta_i})}{1 + \exp({\beta_n} - {\delta_i})},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \beta_n &lt;/math&gt; is the ability of person &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \delta_i &lt;/math&gt; is the difficulty of item &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;.

==Joint maximum likelihood==
Let &lt;math&gt;x_{ni}&lt;/math&gt; denote the observed response for person ''n'' on item ''i''. The probability of the observed data matrix, which is the product of the probabilities of the individual responses, is given by the likelihood function

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda = \frac{\prod_{n} \prod_{i} \exp(x_{ni}(\beta_n-\delta_i))}{\prod_{n} \prod_{i}(1+\exp(\beta_n-\delta_i))}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The log-likelihood function is then

:&lt;math&gt;
\log \Lambda = \sum_n^N \beta_n r_n - \sum_i^I \delta_i s_i - \sum_n^N \sum_i^I \log(1+\exp(\beta_n-\delta_i))
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_n=\sum_i^I x_{ni}&lt;/math&gt; is the total raw score for person ''n'', &lt;math&gt;s_i=\sum_n^N x_{ni}&lt;/math&gt; is the total raw score for item ''i'', ''N'' is the total number of persons and ''I'' is the total number of items.

Solution equations are obtained by taking partial derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;\delta_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_n&lt;/math&gt; and setting the result equal to 0. The JML solution equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;
s_i = \sum_n^N p_{ni},\quad i=1,\dots,I
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
r_n = \sum_i^I p_{ni},\quad n=1,\dots,N
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_{ni}=\exp(\beta_n-\delta_i)/(1+\exp(\beta_n-\delta_i))&lt;/math&gt;. 

The resulting estimates are biased, and no finite estimates exist for persons with score 0 (no correct responses) or with 100% correct responses (perfect score). The same holds for items with extreme scores, no estimates exists for these as well. This bias is due to a well known effect described by Kiefer &amp; Wolfowitz (1956). It is of the order &lt;math&gt;(I-1)/I&lt;/math&gt;, and 
a more accurate (less biased) estimate of each &lt;math&gt;\delta_i&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by multiplying the estimates by &lt;math&gt;(I-1)/I&lt;/math&gt;.

==Conditional maximum likelihood==
The conditional likelihood function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda = \prod_{n} \Pr\{(x_{ni})\mid r_n\} =\frac{\exp(\sum_i -s_i\delta_i)}{\prod_{n} \gamma_r}
&lt;/math&gt;

in which

: &lt;math&gt;
\gamma_r = \sum_{(x) \mid r}\exp(-\sum_i x_{ni}\delta_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[elementary symmetric function]] of order ''r'', which represents the sum over all combinations of ''r'' items. For example, in the case of three items,

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2 = \exp(-\delta_1-\delta_2)+\exp(-\delta_1-\delta_3)+\exp(-\delta_2-\delta_3).&lt;/math&gt;

==Estimation algorithms==
Some kind of [[expectation-maximization algorithm]] is used in the estimation of the parameters of Rasch models. Algorithms for implementing Maximum Likelihood estimation commonly employ [[Newton-Raphson]] iterations to solve for solution equations obtained from setting the partial derivatives of the log-likelihood functions equal to 0. Convergence criteria are used to determine when the iterations cease. For example, the criterion might be that the mean item estimate changes by less than a certain value, such as 0.001, between one iteration and another for all items.

==Structure==
Sanyukai is located in the [[San'ya]] district in Tokyo, Japan.&lt;ref name="Sanyukai" /&gt; The building has three floors, and includes the free Sanyu clinic, a kitchen where food is prepared for the Outreach Program, and an office where free legal advice is offered. Sanyukai also hosts events in an effort to bring the community together in aiding the homeless.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Clinic==
Located on the first floor of the Sanyukai building, Sanyu Clinic is one of the only free clinics in all of Tokyo. Homeless members of society can receive consultations with professional doctors and nurses. Depending on the diagnosis, the patient may receive medical advice, free prescription medication, or a ride to the hospital for intensive care. Most of the clinic staff are medical professionals volunteering on their time off. At this point, Sanyu clinic hosts 9 doctors, 1 chiropractor, 4 acupuncturists and 6 nurses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Working full-time at Sanyukai is one registered nurse who is also the clinic coordinator; another nurse works part-time.

==Outreach program==
Centered around the kitchen on the second floor, the Outreach Program strives to provide the homeless with free meals and decent clothing. Several times a week, Sanyukai will prepare individually wrapped meals and go on patrol in the area. Concentrating in parks and riverside areas where homeless individuals tend to frequent, these patrols provide free meals and conversation. This Program works to not only provide the homeless with daily needs, but also establish Sanyukai as a place of safety and help for them. While providing food, the patrol also takes note of everyone's health, sometimes recommending a visit to the Sanyu Clinic. The Outreach Program works to establish and maintain connections with the homeless in the area, to more effectively aid those in need.

==Social center==
Another aspect of Sanyukai is how it functions as a gathering place for the homeless in the area. Everyday, a large group of people can be found in front of the building, joking and socializing. Most of the homeless people in the area are middle aged or elderly men who are out of work and have no real family. Sanyukai functions as a place where these people can relax and socialize. The volunteers provide green tea and other basic things at the Sanyukai entrance that help these people on a daily basis. The homeless are provided with toothbrushes, shaving razors, towels, hand soap and laundry detergent, to help them maintain their hygiene and health. Once a month a barber volunteers his services and spends a day giving as many free haircuts as he can. Overall, Sanyukai is not only a place where the homeless go when they are sick or starving, but rather a landmark where they are welcomed and taken care of.

'''Sloan letters''', designed by Louise Sloan in 1959, are a set of [[optotype]]s used to test [[visual acuity]] generally used in [[Snellen chart]]s and [[logMAR chart]]s.

This set of optotypes consists of ten specially formed "letters", C, D, H, K, N, O, R, S, V and Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniroma2.it/otticafp/va.html |title=SOEISGEO 20_IV_97 |publisher=Uniroma2.it |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These letters, unlike the ones used in older Snellen charts, are designed to give acuity testing results that are comparable to tests made using [[Landolt C|Landolt broken rings]]. 

Computer fonts for Macintosh and Windows operating systems are available for research purposes. The fonts are based on Louise Sloan’s design, which has been designated the US standard for acuity testing by the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, Committee on Vision (1980, Adv Ophthalmol, 41, 103-148).&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/denispelli/Eye-Chart-Fonts/ Pelli's Sloan fonts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stratum intermedium''' in a [[tooth development|developing tooth]] is a layer of two or three [[cells (biology)|cells]] between the [[inner enamel epithelium]] and the newly forming cells of the [[stellate reticulum]]. It first appears during the early bell stage of tooth development, at around the 14th week of intrauterine life. The stratum intermedium has a notably high [[alkaline phosphatase]] activity.  This layer, along with the inner enamel epithelium, is responsible for the [[tooth enamel]] [[amelogenesis|formation]]. It is a part of the dental (enamel) organ.

The '''Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)''' is a national U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to researching issues around lack of access to mental healthcare . They research issues around barriers to treatment and propose solutions to improve access to care for those severe [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]] such as [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]] and major depressive disorder. Towards this end, the organization publicizes research as well as proposing laws, policies and practices for implementing treatment. The organizations provides education around personal barriers to treatment such as anosognosia-the neurological deficit leading to lack of awareness that one has a mental illness and needs treatment. They also publish reports comparing states and ranking access, adequacy and other issues around quality mental healthcare. They focus on as assisted outpatient treatment laws (AOT),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Involuntary_outpatient_commitment|title=Involuntary outpatient commitment - Harvard Health|last=Publications|first=Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the criminalization of those with mental illness and the negative impacts of deinstitutionalization of those with mental illness without increasing community based services.

==History==

[[E. Fuller Torrey]], M.D. founded the Treatment Advocacy Center in 1998 as a function of the National Association on Mental Illness (NAMI). For nearly 10 years in the decade after the widespread elimination of psychiatric hospital beds in the U.S., Torrey had been a psychiatrist at St. Elizabeths Hospital for the treatment of serious and persistent mental illness in Washington, D.C.  Torrey also believed that the migration of individuals who would have been hospitalized prior to the closing of state psychiatric hospitals (a trend known as "deinstitutionalization") into jails and prisons was best explained by behaviors that resulted from their non-treatment. With the support of entrepreneur Theodore Stanley and his wife Vada, the Treatment Advocacy Center separated from NAMI shortly after its founding to focus entirely on promoting the legal changes to enable treatment for those who are most ill. Operating without funding from the pharmaceutical industry, the Treatment Advocacy Center has evolved into one of the nation's  largest source of research on issues regarding untreated severe mental illness. The organization operates with the support of the closely affiliated Stanley Medical Research Institute, the largest nongovernment source of funding for research into bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in the United States, and many individual donors and foundations. Torrey continues to serve as a member of the Treatment Advocacy Center's board and is executive director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute.

==Activities==

The Treatment Advocacy Center engages in a wide range of activities and projects including:

* Development of a Model Law for Assisted Treatment (also called involuntary treatment). Released in 2000, the Model Law suggests a legal framework for authorizing court-ordered treatment of individuals with untreated severe mental illness who meet certain legal criteria around dangerousness to self or others or inability to care for oneself due to a mental illness.
* Advocacy for laws and policies to decrease the arrest, incarceration, homelessness, hospitalization, and violence that can occur when someone has untreated mental illness.
* Research and study into public policy and other issues related specific to severe mental illness.
* Education of policymakers and judges regarding severe mental illnesses and treatment availability.
* Support for the development of new treatments for and research into the causes of severe and persistent psychiatric illnesses.

'''Vegetable carving''' is the art of carving [[vegetables]] to form beautiful objects, such as flowers or birds.

==The origins of vegetable carving==
[[File:Thai vegetable carving.jpg|thumb|Vegetable carving, Thailand]]
The origins of vegetable carving are disputed: some believe it to have begun in Japan in ancient times, others believe it to have begun in Sukothai, [[Thailand]] 700 years ago, while still others believe that vegetable carving originated in the time of the [[Tang dynasty]] (AD 618-906) and the [[Song dynasty]] (AD 960-1279) in China.

===Japan===
Japan has also been referred to as the root of the art of fruit and vegetable carving, called [[Mukimono]] in Japanese. According to the book "Japanese Garnishes, The Ancient Art of Mukimono", by Yukiko and Bob Haydok, Mukimono's origins began in ancient times when food was served on unglazed clay pottery. These rough platters were covered with a leaf before the food was plated. Artistic chefs realized that the cutting or folding of the leaf in different ways created a more attractive presentation. Mukimono did not become popular until the sixteenth century, the Edo period, when Mukimono gained official recognition. At this time, street artists created clever garnishes upon request. From these beginnings the art has developed into a very important part of every Japanese chef's training.

===Thailand===
Another popular theory of the history of vegetable and fruits carving is that it originates in Thailand. It started during the [[Loi Krathong]] festival in the 14th century. During Loi Krathong, rafts are individually decorated using many objects, including banana leaves and flowers.

In the year 1364, one of King Phra Ruang’s servants, Nang Noppamart, had the desire to create a unique decoration for her raft. Nang carved a flower from a vegetable using a real flower as a pattern. She carved a bird as well and set it beside the flower. Using these carvings, she created a raft that stood out above the rest. King Phra Ruang was impressed by the grace and beauty of the carving and decreed that every woman should learn this new art.

Moreover, in the central Thailand, people usually used banana stalk to decorate a bier. Banana stalks were carved by artists into the form of art that called [[Thaeng yuak]] art.   

As the centuries passed, enthusiasm for this art waxed and waned. In 1808, King Rama II loved vegetable carving so much so that he wrote poetry about it. However, during the 1932 revolution in Thailand, appreciation for vegetable carving died down. In order to revive interest, it is taught from the age of 11 in primary schools through secondary school in Thailand. Optional courses are also offered in universities throughout Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thaicarving.co.uk/php/history.php |title=The History of Thai Fruit and Vegetable Carving |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125120930/http://www.thaicarving.co.uk/php/history.php |archivedate=25 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetable carving today==
Regardless of its origins, vegetable carving is flaunted in many different Asian restaurants, cruises, hotels, and other various places.
In the mid-20th century, the art of vegetable carving began to grow outside Asia. Since then other cultures have slowly come to appreciate the beauty and culture associated with the practice. Today, one can marvel at vegetable carving throughout the world.

The products of vegetable carving are generally flowers or birds; however, the only limit is one’s imagination. The techniques of vegetable carving vary from person to person, as does the final result. Some carvings present more artistic detail, while others have simple, yet beautiful shapes. Vegetable carving is generally used as a garnish, but it can also be used for flower arranging.

'''Warren Fellows''' (born 13 September 1953) is an [[Australia]]n former drug courier who was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in [[Thailand]] in 1978 for his role in a [[heroin]] [[illegal drug trade|trafficking]] operation that took place from Perth to Bangkok. In his best-selling book ''The Damage Done'', Fellows describes the violence and harsh conditions he experienced in Thailand prisons.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fellows was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. His father Bill Fellows, was a champion [[jockey]] and [[horse trainer]] who won the 1949 [[Melbourne Cup]] on [[Foxzami]]. He was the youngest of three children, but his two-year-old sister Gail, died in 1950 from a "bowel complication". His older brother Gary died when he was 36 years old. Gary was living with his wife Carole and two sons Brett and Rodney. He also had a son named Adrian Simon who wrote "Milk-Blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows was educated at [[De La Salle College Ashfield|De La Salle College]], a Catholic school for boys in [[Ashfield, New South Wales]]. Fellows claims he was nearly expelled from the school when he was caught running a [[Gambling#Gambling on horse races|horse betting]] operation from his school desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren "left" De La Salle College and went to Randwick North High School.

===Drug trafficking===
Fellows worked in various jobs, including as a [[bartender|barman]] and an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] [[hairdresser]] in [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]]. It was through his bar work that he first became involved with drug trafficking, successfully importing [[Hashish|hash]] from [[India]] with a friend. On his return to Australia he married and had a child. Word got out about the successful drug run and a customer in the bar where Fellows worked employed him to travel to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Hawaii]] and [[South America]] to smuggle [[cocaine]] into Australia. Fellows came to know drug dealer William Sinclair, who took him to [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] where he was introduced to [[Neddy Smith]] and made his first successful attempt at smuggling heroin into Australia.

After returning to Australia, Neddy Smith who was impressed with his smuggling skills, contacted Fellows and offered him a job. Smith did not have the notoriety he had later, but was already a major and feared figure in the [[Sydney]] criminal world. Fellows claims he became involved with Smith because he was "young and impressionable" and flattered that he "was liked by a man most people were terrified of".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows worked for Smith as a drug courier, domestically and internationally.

===Thailand===
In October 1978, Smith instructed Fellows to again travel to Bangkok, this time in the company of Smith's brother-in-law [[Paul Hayward]]. Hayward played professional [[rugby league]] with the [[Newtown Jets]] and had been selected to represent Australia as a [[boxing|boxer]] at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. Hayward had done "favours" for Smith, but this was his first international job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows and Hayward became best friends. Prior to leaving Australia, Fellows was tipped off by a friend with a police contact at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], that the [[Commonwealth Police]] believed he was involved in a large drug importation operation and had him under [[surveillance]]. Fellows reported this to Smith who dismissed it, claiming that he would have been informed if it were true. Smith insisted they continue with the job.

Hayward and Fellows became increasingly apprehensive, but after Smith lost his patience with them and made implied threats, they reluctantly agreed to go through with the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows was particularly anxious about returning to Bangkok. During his last trip in February 1978, he had been forced to abandon a package of heroin he had been attempting to ship back to Australia and feared that Thai police may have found it and been able to trace the drugs back to him. So Fellows procured a false passport through a friend, in the name of a deceased child Gregory Hastings Barker. Smith later said that Fellows got done because he booked his flight using Smith's telephone, although Fellows says that he can not remember whether he booked it with Smiths phone or not.

On arriving in Thailand, Fellows and Hayward met William Sinclair by chance. Sinclair now lived in Bangkok and owned the Texas Bar. Sinclair took them to his bar, and in a drunken state, attempted to obtain information from them about their trip. Unbeknown to them, the trio were under surveillance and the meeting appeared to police to incriminate Sinclair, even though according to Fellows, he was not involved. Fellows claims that there were many warning signs and that the night before they were arrested he had a "moment of clarity" and resolved to wash the heroin down the bath drain. But he fell asleep and was woken in the morning by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|pp=37-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest===
On 12 October 1978, the rooms occupied by Fellows and Hayward at the Montien Hotel in Bangkok were raided by Thai police. The pair were arrested when 8.5 [[kilograms]] of heroin was found in a suitcase in Hayward's room.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows alleges they were subjected to [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of Thai Narcotics Suppression Unit officers who demanded they sign statements which they could not read because they were written in [[Thai language|Thai]]. The officers demanded Fellows and Hayward make statements incriminating Sinclair. Fellows claims they resisted because Sinclair was innocent, but he eventually relented when officers informed them they were to be executed without trial under Article 27 of the military law and dragged Hayward outside for execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|pp=41-52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows and Hayward agreed to sign the statement and Sinclair was arrested and charged.

The three men were sent to Bambat remand centre at [[Klong Prem Central Prison]], but after plotting an escape attempt were moved to "Maha Chai" the Special Bangkok Metropolitan Prison on Maha Chai Road (now the [[Bangkok Corrections Museum]]). They spent three years in Maha Chai before they were convicted of heroin trafficking. Sinclair and Fellows were sentenced to life imprisonment and Hayward was sentenced to 30 years' jail. They were sent to the [[Klong Prem Central Prison|Lard Yao]] prison but after five days there when Sinclair attempted to bribe the wrong guard, they were transferred to [[Bangkwang]]. Two years later, Sinclair's conviction was overturned on appeal in 1983. Hayward was later returned to Lard Yao, and later received a [[pardon|royal pardon]] and was released from Lard Yao on 7 April 1989. Fellows received a royal pardon and was released from Bangkwang on 11 January 1990.

Whilst imprisoned in Thailand, Fellows attempted suicide several times, one he recalls was when he was locked into a darkroom he wrapped a sarong around his neck and tied it to a hook on the ceiling; however, he claimed as he felt his bowels fall the sarong snapped, causing him to fall, saving him. Fellows became addicted to heroin. He claimed that heroin was easily available in Thai prisons and was the only form of escape from the appalling conditions. In his [[autobiography]] ''[[The Damage Done (book)|The Damage Done]]'', he expressed great sympathy for those afflicted by addiction to drugs. He writes that it was "an outstanding case of poetic justice" that he should become addicted himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fellows|Marx|1997|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Australia===
On his return to Australia, he spent two weeks in a hospital being treated for [[malnutrition]] and [[pneumonia]]. He expressed concern regarding his and Paul Hayward's ability to adapt back into society, an issue which he claims played a part in Hayward's death in 1992 from a heroin overdose. Fellows explains how he still has [[hallucinations]] of strange abnormal creatures hovering over him and watching him. Furthermore, Fellows claims that he has the same nightmare once a month, regarding him lying on a beach with two beautiful women feeling free and happy, however as he begins to walk off into the sunset he turns around and notices that the two girls have disappeared and that he is back in the Thailand Prison where a guard is calling his name telling him to go in his cell.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Fellows says that although he is released from Bangkwang he will never be free from the tortures in his mind. In the late 2000s, Fellows commented in the media on the cases of the [[Bali Nine]] and [[Schapelle Corby]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The '''Water Framework Directive''' 2000/60/EC is an [[EU directive]] which commits [[European Union]] member states to achieve good qualitative and quantitative status of all [[Body of water|water bodies]] (including marine waters up to one nautical mile from shore) by 2015. It is a framework in the sense that it prescribes steps to reach the common goal rather than adopting the more traditional limit value approach. The Directive's aim for 'good status' for all water bodies will not be achieved, with 47% of EU water bodies&lt;ref&gt;2012 WFD review by the European Commission http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012DC0670&amp;from=EN&lt;/ref&gt; covered by the Directive failing to achieve the aim.

==Objectives of the Directive==
The Directive aims for 'good status' for all ground and [[surface water]]s (rivers, lakes, transitional waters, and coastal waters) in the EU.

The ecological and chemical status of surface waters are assessed according to the following criteria:
* Biological quality (fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic flora)
* Hydromorphological quality such as river bank structure, river continuity or substrate of the river bed
* Physical-chemical quality such as temperature, oxygenation and nutrient conditions
* Chemical quality that refers to environmental quality standards for river basin specific pollutants. These standards specify maximum concentrations for specific water pollutants. If even one such concentration is exceeded, the water body will not be classed as having a “good ecological status”.&lt;ref name="Umweltbundesamt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/publikation/long/4194.pdf | title=WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE: THE WAY TOWARDS HEALTHY WATERS | publisher=Umweltbundesamt | accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Water Framework Directive stipulates that [[groundwater]] must achieve "good quantitative status" and "good chemical status" (i.e. not polluted) by 2015. Groundwater bodies are classified as either "good" or "poor".&lt;ref name="Umweltbundesamt" /&gt;

Article 14 of the directive requires member states "to encourage the active involvement of interested parties" in the implementation of the directive. This is generally acknowledged to be an assimilation of the [[Aarhus Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=23 March 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial management of river basins==
One important aspect of the Water Framework Directive is the introduction of '''River Basin Districts'''. These areas have been designated, not according to administrative or political boundaries, but rather according to the river basin (the spatial catchment area of the river) as a natural geographical and hydrological unit. As rivers often cross national borders, representatives from several Member States have to co-operate and work together for the management of the basin (so-called transboundary basins). They are managed according to [[River Basin Management Plans]], which should provide a clear indication of the way the objectives set for the river basin are to be reached within the required timescale. They should be updated every six years.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=16 May 2012
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate data recoding, each stretch of water is given a "'''Water Framework Directive ID'''" ("WFDID" or "Waterbody ID"). For example, the stretch of the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]], in the West Midlands of England, from the [[River Blythe]] to [[River Anker]] is referred to as GB104028046440.&lt;ref name="GB104028046440"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planning.northwarks.gov.uk/portal/servlets/AttachmentShowServlet?ImageName=274903|title=GB104028046440|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgressions==
The [[Ebro]] River Transfer, a project from the Spanish National Hydrological Plan of 2001 was highly criticised as being contrary to the principles of the EU Water Framework Directive, and later put on hold. The project planned to transfer huge amounts of water from the Ebro River to the south-east of Spain with the construction of 120 dams.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Ostia-Toilets.JPG|thumb|Ancient Roman latrines in Ostia Antica]]

The '''xylospongium''' (greek) or '''tersorium''' (roman), also known as ''sponge on a stick'', was a [[hygienic]] utensil used by [[ancient Roman]]s to wipe their anus after [[defecating]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirsky|first=Steve|title=Getting to the Bottom|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/toilet-tissue-anthropologists-uncover-all-the-ways-weve-wiped/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=308|issue=3|pages=85–85|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0313-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a wooden stick ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ξύλον, ''Xylon'') with a [[sea sponge]] (Greek: Σπόγγος, ''Spongos'') fixed at one end.

The tersorium was shared by people using public latrines. To clean the sponge, they simply washed it in a bucket with water and salt or vinegar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sapiens.org/column/curiosities/ancient-roman-bathrooms/|title=What Did Ancient Romans Do Without Toilet Paper?|work=SAPIENS|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a breeding ground for bacteria, causing the spread of disease in the latrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innominatesociety.com/Articles/Death%20and%20Disease%20in%20Ancient%20Rome.htm|title=Death and Disease in Ancient Rome|website=www.innominatesociety.com|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classical antiquity]] a ''xylospongium'' might be used in the same way as we use a [[toilet brush]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiplinger 2012, S. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[baths of the seven sages]]'' in [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], a [[fresco]] from the 2nd century contains the Inscription ''(u)taris xylosphongio''&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Année épigraphique]]'' 1941, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the first known mention of the term.
Also in the early second century a papyrus letter of [[Claudius Terentianus]] to his father [[Claudius Tiberianus]] uses the term ''xylospongium'' in a phrase.&lt;ref&gt;(29)…''Non magis quravit me pro xylesphongium meo. Non magis cunavit me quam xylosphongium'' (30) ''sed siam negotium ct circa res suas.'' – Translation: (29)…He did not care for me more than for a xylospongium, (30) even for his own things. (Michigan Papyri VIII, 29-30)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the first century [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] reported that a Germanic gladiator had committed suicide with a sponge on a stick. The German hid himself in the latrine of an amphitheater and pushed the wooden stick into his gullet and choked to death.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistulae morales'' 8, 70, 20. …''lignum id, quod ad emundanda obscena adhaerente spongia positum est''…&lt;/ref&gt;
