      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7677">'''Alarm fatigue''' or '''alert fatigue''' occurs when one is exposed to a large number of frequent [[alarm device|alarms]] (alerts) and consequently becomes [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to them.

Like [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf|crying ''wolf'']], such [[false alarm]]s rob the valid alarms of the value they were intended to add (duly alerting people to danger).

== In healthcare ==
The constant sounds of alarms and noises from blood pressure machines, ventilators and heart monitors causes a "tuning out" of the sounds due to the brain adjusting to stimulation. This issue is present in hospitals, in home care providers, nursing homes and other medical facilities alike. The [[Joint Commission|Joint Commission's]] sentinel event reports 80 alarm-related deaths and 13 alarm-related serious injuries over the course of a few years. On April 18, 2013, the Joint Commission issued a [[sentinel event]] alert that highlighted the widespread problem of alarm fatigue in hospitals. Their recommendations included establishing guidelines to tailor alarm settings, training all members of the clinical team on safe use of alarms, and sharing information about alarm-related incidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This alert resulted in designation in 2014 of clinical alarm system safety as a National Patient Safety Goal and it remains a goal in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/2017_NPSG_HAP_ER.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  This Goal will force hospitals to establish alarm safety as a priority, identify the most important alarms, and establish policies to manage alarms by January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Joint Commission|title=The Joint Commission Announces 2014 National Patient Safety Goal|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/JCP0713_Announce_New_NSPG.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monegain, Bernie. "'Alarm Fatigue' Endangers Patients." Healthcare IT News. HIMSS Media, 9 April 2013. Web. 24 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[ECRI Institute]] has listed alarms on its "Top Ten Hazards List"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecri.org/press/Pages/2014-Top-10-Health-Technology-Hazards-Report.aspx|title=ECRI Institute Releases Top 10 Health Technology Hazards Report for 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2007; in 2014 alarms was listed as the number one hazard.

===Unintended outcomes of alarms===
The large number of alarms, especially of false alarms, has led to several unintended outcomes.  Some consequences are disruption in patient care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Healthcare Technology Foundation|title=2011 National Clinical Alarms Survey|url=http://www.aami.org/hottopics/alarms/2011_HTFAlarmsSurveyAAMISummit.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; desensitization to alarms,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borowski|first=M|author2=Görges, M|author3= Fried, R|author4= Such, O|author5= Wrede, C|author6= Imhoff, M|title=Medical device alarms.|journal=Biomedizinische Technik.

===Solutions===

====Changing alarm sounds and parameters====
There are many solutions proposed to reduce alarm fatigue in healthcare settings. One recommendation is to change alarm sounds to be softer and friendlier in order to improve identification of alarms by sound alone. Another recommendation is for clinicians to adjust the [[parameters]] and delays to alarms to match the patient’s traits and status. However, this directly trades sensitivity for specificity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Centralized alarms====
Another solution that has been proposed is to use [[centralized alarms]]. In this approach, alarms don't fire at the bedside, but fire at a central monitoring station where a trained healthcare provider evaluates each alarm and alerts the bedside clinician if they should intervene or evaluate the patient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27483066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cantillon DJ, Loy M, Burkle A, Pengel S, Brosovich D, Hamilton A, Khot UN, Lindsay BD |title=Association Between Off-site Central Monitoring Using Standardized Cardiac Telemetry and Clinical Outcomes Among Non-Critically Ill Patients |journal=JAMA |volume=316 |issue=5 |pages=519–24 |year=2016 |pmid=27483066 |doi=10.1001/jama.2016.10258 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2016.10258 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changing alarm algorithms====
[[Biomedical engineering|Biomedical engineers]] may improve monitors by adjusting alarm [[algorithms]]. Currently, the alarm systems are very sensitive but not specific. This leads to a large amount of [[false alarms]]. The algorithms used can be adjusted to balance between sensitivity and specificity to limit the number of false alarms and still detect true deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=JM|author2=Tremper, KK|title=Alarms in the intensive care unit: too much of a good thing is dangerous: is it time to add some intelligence to alarms?|journal=Critical Care Medicine|date=February 2010|volume=38|issue=2|pages=702–3|pmid=20083933|doi=10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181bfe97f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15150">[[File:British Army Ammunition Technician Badge.JPG|right|frame|160px|The AT Badge.]]

An '''ammunition technician''' (AT) is a [[British Army]] soldier, formerly of the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] but since 1993 of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]], trained to inspect, repair, test, store, and modify all ammunition, guided missiles, and explosives used by the British Army. These technicians are also trained to use demolition to safely dispose of individual items of ammunition and explosives ([[Explosive ordnance disposal|EODs]]) or to conduct logistics disposal of bulk stocks of multi items. After gaining sufficient experience, those who show the appropriate qualities are given extra training to render safe [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) by a process called [[IEDD|improvised explosive device disposal]].  Experienced ATs may be called to give evidence as expert witnesses in criminal or coroner's courts in relation to ammunition or explosives or to EOD and IEDD duties.

==History==
Within the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the receipt into service, storage, examination and issue of ammunition was possibly the oldest and most important function of the Corps. War could not be waged without ammunition, and to be waged successfully the ammunition had to be in every respect serviceable and dependable. The trade were previously called Ammunition Examiners (AE) and it was in the safeguarding of ammunition stockpiles during the wars that the Ammunition Examiner proved his worth.  Promotion however was limited up to Warrant Officer Class 2 and at this stage the AE had to re-muster in the trade of RAOC Clerk in order to obtain higher rank. In 1948, the increased responsibility of the ammunition organization in Ordnance Services and in order to use the experience of these highly skilled tradesmen both as Warrant Officers and as Officers, the RAOC decided that promotion to WO1 would be introduced.   RAOC Instruction No 466 introduced a new type of Quartermaster commission into the Royal Army Ordnance Corps to permit the Warrant Officer Ammunition Examiner being commissioned within the sphere of his normal employment on ammunition duties. These commissioned WOs would be called Assistant Inspecting Ordnance Officers (AIOOs).

==Training==
Training was initially undertaken at Bramley in Hampshire at the School of Ammunition. However the school moved to [[MoD_Kineton | Kineton]] in 1974.  To qualify to attend the Ammunition Technician Class 2 course,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyjobs.mod.uk/Jobs/JobDetail.htm?armyjobid=RLC350%2f359&amp;category=3] MOD Website&lt;/ref&gt; a soldier must first pass a pre-select course, during which time they will be assessed for suitability for role.  The pre-selection includes psychometric testing, leadership skills, problem solving, resource planning and numeracy tests.

The basic AT course is 9 months in duration, the first part of which is spent at [[Shrivenham#Military colleges|The Royal Military College of Science]].  The instruction within the Defence College of Management and Technology forms the first phase of the 9-month course.  The aim of the first part is to provide the scientific and technical basis for further training in ammunition and explosives. The syllabus is an integrated study of mathematics, ballistics, explosives and general chemistry, physics, metallurgy, electronics and the design of armoured vehicles, artillery and infantry weapons. Time is also spent on nuclear, biological and chemical weapons design and the related protection systems.  The remainder of the course covers conventional land munitions, explosive demolitions, conventional munitions disposal, guided weapons and explosive theory and safety.  The majority of the course takes place at the Defence EOD Munitions Search Training Regiment (DEMS Trg Regt).  Training previously took place at the Defence EOD Munitions Search School Kineton, DEMSS Kineton, and before that the [[Army School of Ammunition]].

After 3 years gaining experience in trade, these technicians will be selected to return to Kineton to attend their Class 2 to Class 1 Upgrading Course, a 3-month course to broaden their technical knowledge and ability in munitions incident investigations, large scale demolitions and the disposal of chemical and biological munitions.

The Royal Logistic Corps Ammunition Technicians trained at Kineton are regarded throughout the world as the subject matter experts in the management of munitions and in [[Improvised Explosive Device]] (IED) disposal as a result of their combined experience in Palestine, Cyprus, Hong Kong, [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]], Iraq, Afghanistan, Aden, Malaya and other conflicts.

Commissioned officers are known as [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s and for the Sandhurst entrant, they complete a 17-month technical course in the rank of Captain.  ATs that become commissioned later in their service are also referred to as ATOs and will be granted the ato qualification by a testing board based on their experience, knowledge and competence.

==Scope of Work==
ATs are employed within the Royal Logistic Corps of the British Army and are the technical experts in storing and processing ammunition in base depots or field storage sites at home or on operations where safety in storage is paramount to overall force protection.  Being an Ammunition Technician calls for intelligence, clear thinking and analytical skills, a calm outlook coupled with excellent attention to detail, discipline and courage.  ATs develop specialist skills to look after the MoDs global stockpiles of ammunition by carrying out surveillance tasks, testing, inspecting, maintaining and disposing of all sorts of ammunition, from bullet clips, anti-aircraft guided weapon systems, mines, mortars, tank rounds and aircraft bombs.  The Ammunition Technician profession is not exclusive to the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] but similar technical personnel also exist in the Canadian, Australian [[RAAOC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/army/stayarmy/TECH_AMMO.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823035539/http://www.defence.gov.au/army/stayarmy/TECH_AMMO.htm |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }} RAAOC AT Website&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand [[Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment|RNZALR]]. Ammunition Technicians trained at the Defence EOD Munitions Search School, Kineton also work on loan service engagements in a number of African, Far Eastern and Middle Eastern armed forces.

In the United Kingdom, bomb disposal is carried out in all three services ([[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]], and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] and [[Royal Engineers]] of the [[British Army]]). The majority of counter terrorist bomb disposal and conventional munitions disposal activity is carried out by the Ammunition Technicians of the Royal Logistic Corps, the [[Royal Navy]] [[Clearance diver|Clearance Diver]]s deal with items below the high water mark and underwater tasks, the [[Royal Air Force]] deal with conventional and IED tasks on all RAF stations in the UK, as well as aircraft crash sites, weapons and other explosives; including ejection seats and stores release systems. The [[Royal Engineers]] deal with minefields, conventional, biological and chemical munitions and German WWII aircraft bombs that occasionally turn up.

==Operational Honours==
The trade of Ammunition Technician is one of the most highly decorated professions in the British Army.  The trade has been awarded 231 British gallantry awards as follows:

*George Cross - 9
*George Medal - 80
*Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - 1
*Military Cross - 3
*Queen's Gallantry Medal - 100
*MBE for Gallantry - 14
*BEM for Gallantry - 23

In addition, Ammunition Technicians and Ammunition Technical Officers have also received almost 200 Mention in Dispatches, King's or Queen's Commendations for Bravery.

A further 100 awards of the MBE and BEM have been made to Ammunition Technicians for distinguished service within their trade.

These decorations have been awarded since 1940 and in places such as Aden, Afghanistan, Albania, Burma, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Great Britain, Greece, Hong Kong, Iraq, Italy, Kuwait, Malaya, Malta, Northern Ireland, Pacific, Sicily and Yugoslavia.

==RAOC/RLC EOD Memorial==
[[File:RAOC and RLC EOD Memorial.jpg|thumb|RAOC and RLC EOD Memorial]]
Although a highly decorated trade, the price of recognition for Ammunition Technicians and Ammunition Technical Officers has been high. The Ammunition Technician trade has lost a number of their colleagues killed in action whilst undertaking operational Explosive Ordnance Disposal tasks worldwide. Ammunition Technicians proudly have their own memorial at Marlborough Barracks, Temple Herdewyke in Warwickshire, the home of the trade.

The idea of a memorial was initiated by the senior Warrant Officers of the trade and supported by the Director of Land Service Ammunition and his staff. A RAOC EOD Memorial Working Party was set up and reported progress to the Director General of Ordnance Services.  The memorial was funded by RAOC central funds, donations from industry and from private donations from individual technicians within the trade. There were also some significant donations in kind, all the bricks for the enclosure and surrounding wall were gifted by a local brickworks and the shrubbery was donated and planted by a local nursery.&lt;ref&gt;Lt Col Ret'd Joe Hastings, Project Officer for the Memorial&lt;/ref&gt;  The memorial was designed by the Fine Arts Department of Coventry Polytechnic and sculpted from local sandstone.  The memorial represents a single bomb disposal operator, dressed in the bomb suit and holding his protective helmet.  This scene is one that every EOD operator will recognise as being the last few moments before donning the helmet and becoming totally shut off from the team and ready to make the longest walk into danger towards an explosive device. The memorial is enclosed behind double wrought iron gates bearing the trade badges of the ATO and AT.  The gates lead into a walled garden with 2 stone benches.  The walls bear grey slate tablets, each engraved with the name of those killed, the date and location of the incident. A small brass plaque records the award of posthumous gallantry medals or decorations.

The memorial was formally opened during a dedication service on 23 June 1991.  The service of dedication was led by the Chaplain General to the Forces, The Reverend James Harkness OBE QHC MA with readings by WO1 (Staff Sergeant Major) B Johnson GC and Major General PWE Istead CB OBE GM, Representative Colonel Commandant, RAOC.  Amongst the guests at the service where the widows and families of many of those whose names appear on the memorial.   A parade and the annual service of remembrance by members of the units based at Kineton is held at the EOD Memorial on Remembrance Sunday in November each year.

The EOD memorial is dedicated to the fallen ATO's and AT's of The Royal Army Ordnance Corps and The Royal Logistic Corps who through their selfless commitment, have singularly taken the "Longest Walk" in the service of their country but sadly, have not returned.  Members of the ammunition trade have been killed in Cyprus, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, England, Iraq and Afghanistan, '''"Sua Tela Tonanti / We Sustain"'''

The '''attitude indicator''' ('''AI'''), formerly known as the '''gyro horizon''' or '''artificial horizon''', is a [[flight instrument]] that informs the pilot of the aircraft orientation relative to Earth's horizon, and gives an immediate indication of the smallest orientation change.  The miniature aircraft and horizon bar mimic the relationship of the aircraft relative to the actual horizon.  &lt;ref name="FAA2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Instrument Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-15B |date=2012 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, FAA |page=5-17,5-19 |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAA1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, FAA-H-8083-25B |date=2016 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, FAA |page=8-16,8-18,8-19 |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/media/10_phak_ch8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a primary instrument for flight in [[instrument meteorological conditions]].  &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guided Flight Discovery Private PilotJe|last=Jeppesen, A Boeing Company|first=|publisher=Jeppesen|year=2007|isbn=978-0-88487-429-4|location=|pages=2–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_airframe_handbook/media/ama_ch10.pdf Aircraft Instrument Systems page 10-56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
[[File:Attitude Indicator Interior.png|thumb|AI interior]]
The essential components of the AI include a symbolic miniature aircraft mounted so that it appears to be flying relative to the horizon.  An adjustment knob, to account for the pilot's line of vision, moves the aircraft up and down to align it against the horizon bar.  The top half of the instrument is blue to represent the sky, while the bottom half is brown to represent the ground.  The bank index at the top shows the aircraft angle of bank.  Reference lines in the middle indicate the degree of pitch, up or down, relative to the horizon.&lt;ref name=FAA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAA2/&gt;

Most Russian-built aircraft have a somewhat different design.  The background display is colored as in a Western instrument, but moves up and down only to indicate pitch.  A symbol representing the aircraft (which is fixed in a Western instrument) rolls left or right to indicate bank angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Learmount|first=David |title=Which way is up for Eastern and Western artificial horizons? |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/learmount/2009/02/which_way_is_up_for_eastern_an/ |work=flightglobal.com |date=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029214654/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/learmount/2009/02/which_way_is_up_for_eastern_an/ |archivedate=October 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A proposed hybrid version of the Western and Russian systems that would be more intuitive, never caught on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130625220312/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/safety-expert-proposes-low-cost-loss-of-control-fixes-353929 Safety expert proposes low-cost loss of control fixes ], [[FlightGlobal]], 2011-03-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Vacuum Pump system.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Vacuum system using a vacuum pump]]
[[File:Venturi vacuum.png|thumb|upright=.8|Vacuum system using a venturi]]
The heart of the AI is a [[gyroscope]] (gyro) that spins at high speed, from either an electric motor, or through the action of a stream of air pushing on rotor vanes placed along its periphery.  The stream of air is provided by a vacuum system, driven by a vacuum pump, or a venturi.  Air passing through the narrowest portion of a venturi has lower air pressure through Bernoulli's Principle.  The gyro is mounted in a double gimbal, which allows the aircraft to pitch and roll as the gyro stays vertically upright.  A self-erecting mechanism, actuated by gravity, counteracts any [[precession]] due to [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing friction]].  It may take a few minutes for the erecting mechanism to bring the gyros to a vertical upright position after the aircraft engine is first powered up.&lt;ref name=FAA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAA2/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_airframe_handbook/media/ama_Ch10.pdf|title=Chapter 10. Aircraft Instrument Systems|last=Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301132332/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_airframe_handbook/media/ama_Ch10.pdf|archive-date=2014-03-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitude indicators have mechanisms that keep the instrument level with respect to the direction of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faatest.com/books/IFRH/4-4.htm|title=4-4|first=alan|last=murphy|date=|website=www.faatest.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument may develop small errors, in pitch or bank during extended periods of acceleration, deceleration, turns, or due to the earth curving underneath the plane on long trips. To start with, they often have slightly more weight in the bottom, so that when the aircraft is resting on the ground they will hang level and therefore they will be level when started. But once they are started, that pendulous weight in the bottom will not pull them level if they are out of level, but instead its pull will cause the gyro to [[precession|precess]]. In order to let the gyro very slowly orient itself to the direction of gravity while in operation, the typical vacuum powered gyro has small pendulums on the rotor casing that partially cover air holes. When the gyro is out of level with respect to the direction of gravity, the pendulums will swing in the direction of gravity and either uncover or cover the holes, such that air is allowed or prevented from jetting out of the holes, and thereby applying a small force to orient the gyro towards the direction of gravity. Electric powered gyros may have different mechanisms to achieve a similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faatest.com/books/IFRH/4-5.htm|title=4-5|first=alan|last=murphy|date=|website=www.faatest.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Older AIs were limited in the amount of pitch or roll that they would tolerate.  Exceeding these limits would cause the gyro to tumble as the gyro housing contacted the gimbals, causing a precession force.  Preventing this required a caging mechanism to lock the gyro if the pitch exceed 60° and the roll exceeded 100°.  Modern AIs don't have this limitation and don't require a caging mechanism.&lt;ref name=FAA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAA2/&gt;

Attitude indicators are also used on manned spacecraft and are called '''Flight Director Attitude Indicators''' (FDAI), where they indicate the craft's yaw angle (nose left or right), pitch (nose up or down), roll, and orbit relative to a fixed-space [[inertial reference frame]] from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-FDAI.html|title=Flight-Director/Atitude Indicator|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDAI can be configured to use known positions relative to Earth or the stars, so that the engineers, scientists and astronauts can communicate the relative position, attitude, and orbit of the craft. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/aohindex.htm|title=Apollo Flight Journal - Apollo Operations Handbook.

==Attitude and Heading Reference Systems==
[[AHRS|Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS)]] are able to provide three-axis information based on [[ring laser gyroscope]]s, that can be shared with multiple devices in the aircraft, such as "[[glass cockpit]]" primary flight displays ([[Primary flight display|PFD]]s).  Rather than using a spinning gyroscope, modern AHRS use [[solid-state electronics]], low-cost [[inertial sensor]]s, [[rate gyro]]s, and [[magnetometer]]s.&lt;ref name=FAA1/&gt;{{rp|8-20}}&lt;ref name=FAA2/&gt;{{rp|5-22}}

With most AHRS systems, if an aircraft's AIs have failed there will be a standby AI located in the center of the instrument panel, where other standby basic instruments such as the airspeed indicator and altimeter are also available.  These mostly mechanical standby instruments may be available even if the electronic flight instruments fail, though the standby attitude indicator may be electrically driven and will, after a short time, fail if its electrical power fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NTSB Safety Recommendation |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publications/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=A-08-054|date=2010-11-08|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attitude Direction Indicator (ADI), or Flight Director Indicator (FDI), is an AI integrated with a Flight Director System (FDS).  The ADI incorporates a computer that receives information from the navigation system, such as the AHRS, and processes this information to provide the pilot with a 3-D flight trajectory cue to maintain a desired path.  The cue takes the form of V steering bars.  The aircraft is represented by a delta symbol and the pilot flies the aircraft so that the delta symbol is placed within the V steering bars.&lt;ref name=FAA2/&gt;{{rp|5-23,5-24}}

==Early education and career==
Barbara Knickerbocker Beskind is a designer and internationally recognized pioneer in the field of [[occupational therapy]]. Beskind graduated in 1945 from the College of Home Economics at [[Syracuse University]] with a BS in Applied Arts and Design. At the end of World War II, she trained as an occupational therapist through the [[United States Army|U.S. Army’s]] War Emergency Course and served for 20 years, retiring as a major in 1966. She went on to found the Princeton Center for Learning Disorders, the first independent private practice in occupational therapy in the U.S. She authored a clinical text published in 1980 on the treatment of children with [[Learning disability|learning disorders]] and holds a patent for inflatable equipment that helps learning-disordered children improve their [[Balance (ability)|balance]]. The [[American Occupational Therapy Association]] honored Beskind as a Charter Fellow in recognition of her innovative therapeutic techniques. In 1989 she retired after a 44-year career in occupational therapy.

Following her retirement, she studied creative and non-fiction writing at [[Bennington College]] (three summer courses) and six semesters at [[Lebanon College]]. As a result, she has published three more books authored also under her maiden name Barbara Knickerbocker: an historical family autobiography, ''Powderkeg''; a book of her art and poetry, ''Touches of Life in Time and Space''; and an historical fiction, ''Flax to Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&amp;text=Barbara+Knickerbocker&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=Barbara+Knickerbocker&amp;sort=relevancerank|title=Amazon.com: Barbara Knickerbocker: Books|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beskind studied abstract art at Sharon Arts Center in [[Sharon, New Hampshire]], with a focus on its early roots in the Russian avant-garde. After three trips to Russia to study these artists, she taught a non-credit course at [[Colby–Sawyer College|Colby-Sawyer College]] in [[New London, New Hampshire]].

==Today==
In January 2013, Beskind saw [[IDEO]] founder David Kelley speak on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' (t.v. series) about the importance of cultivating a diversity of experience among team members developing new products and services. Beskind wrote to the company, offering to help IDEO design for aging and low-vision populations. Then at age 89, she began working for IDEO in their [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] offices and has been directly involved with client projects related to [[Contact lens|contact lenses]], [[health care delivery]], and [[retirement home]] services.

As a conceptual designer, she has developed specific ideas for a pair of glasses for those with [[macular degeneration]] such as she has. She is developing an alternative [[Walker (mobility)|walker]] called the “Trekker” with vertical grips to promote good posture and to maintain alternative arm-leg movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/technology-innovations-that-could-help-the-elderly-1435245122|title=Technology Innovations That Could Help the Elderly|first=Timothy|last=Hay|date=29 June 2015|website=Wsj.com|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33626980|title=Silicon Valley's 91-year-old designer|date=7 September 2015|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has adapted ski poles to preserve good balance and gait patterns for those with vision and mobility problems.

'''Barrier boards''' are typically long plastic or wooden beams used during [[road works]] and similar activities to cordon off areas, close roads or direct traffic.

They are also known as '''council barriers''', '''Show Stoppers''', '''works barricades''', or '''safety barricades'''.

==Around the World==

* In [[Australia]] barrier boards, normally referred to simply as council barriers, are 2.5m long heavy duty [[PVC]] boards with yellow and black reflective stripes on both sides supported by 1 or 2 'A frame' stands/legs.
* In [[Europe]] barrier boards are typically red and white striped boards made from PVC plastic or wood and are used in conjunction with [[traffic cones]].
* In the [[United States]] barriers are typically white aluminium or plastic 'A frame' devices with orange and white reflective boards on either one side or both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Blindspots analysis''' (also '''blind spots analysis''') is a method aimed at uncovering obsolete, incomplete, or incorrect assumptions in a decision maker’s mental scheme of the environment. [[Michael Porter]] used the term "blind spots" to refer to conventional wisdom which no longer holds true, but which still guides business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porter Michael, E. |date=1980|title= Competitive Strategy|location= NY|publisher= Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further popularized by [[Barbara Tuchman]], in her book ''The March of Folly'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuchman, Barbara |date=1985|title= The March of Folly|location= NY|publisher= Ballantine Books |edition=Paperback }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe political decisions and strategies which were clearly wrong in their assumptions, and by other authors since, such as social psychologists [[Mahzarin Banaji]] and [[Anthony Greenwald]] in their study of [[prejudice]].

==Uncovering blind spots==
Ben Gilad fully developed, in his book, ''Business Blindspots'' (1994), the following three-step "Gilad method" for uncovering blind spots&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step One'': Conducting a [[Porter five forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure – aka 5 force analysis]] on a given industry or segment (market), augmented with identification of possible change drivers, which are defined as trends with the potential to have profound (structural) effect on the balance of power among the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step Two:'' Collecting [[competitive intelligence]] on the target company’s top executives assumptions regarding the same industry structure as in Step One. Sources may include annual reports' letters to shareholders, autobiographies, interviews in the press, public appearances and speeches, industry meetings, congressional testimonies, conference calls with security analysts (transcripts are publicly available), and all other statements regarding vision and beliefs. An alternative technique is known among competitive intelligence professionals as “strategy’s reverse engineering” which looks for the underlying assumptions which can rationalize existing strategy.
#''Step Three:'' Compare the results of Step Two with the analysis in Step One. Any contradiction with the analysis in Step One is a potential blindspot.

== Underlying assumptions ==

Underlying Blindspots Analysis is an assumption about the inherent [[cognitive bias|biases]] of decision making at the top of organizations (business, government or otherwise) exceeding those of their subordinates or outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liff, Stewart|author-link=Stewart Liff|title= The Complete Guide to Hiring and Firing Government Employees|pages= 109–111|publisher= AMACOM|location= New York|date=2009|isbn= 978-0-8144-1450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many top executives in business and government organizations are smart, capable people, they are also vulnerable to several decision biases that come with their powerful positions, including [[cognitive dissonance]], motivated cognitions, overconfidence, and ego-involvement.&lt;ref&gt;(Cramer et al., 2005),(Rosenzweig, 2007), (Bossidy and Charan, 2004), (USA Today, 2005), (Gilad, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenzweig, Phil|title= The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|location= NY|publisher=The Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0743291255|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impaired ability of leaders to see reality for what it is, and the more objective (less ego-involved) analysis of analysts and mid-level planners means that Step 3 of the Blindspots Analysis can be a powerful tool for pointing to potential blinders

'''Chief information officer''' ('''CIO'''), '''chief digital information officer''' ('''CDIO''') or '''information technology''' ('''IT''') '''director''', is a job title commonly given to the most senior executive in an enterprise who works for the traditional [[information technology]] and computer systems that support enterprise goals.

Typically, the CIO reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] but may also report to the [[chief operating officer]] or [[chief financial officer]].  In military organizations, they report to the [[commanding officer]]. The Chief Information Officer role was first defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.williamgruber.com/strategic-information|title=williamgruber|website=williamgruber}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 by  William R. Synnott, former Senior Vice President of the Bank of Boston, and William H. Gruber, former professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;ref&gt;Synnott W.R. and Gruber W.H. (1981) Information Resource Management: Opportunities and Strategies for the 1980s. New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The need for CIOs==
CIOs or CDIOs form a key part of any business that utilizes technology and data. In recent times, it has been identified that an understanding of just business or just IT is not sufficient.&lt;ref name="Business Week"&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Simson|first1=Ernest|title=The new role of the CIO|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/the-new-role-of-the-cio|website=ww.businessweek.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs manage IT resources and plan "[[Information and communications technology|ICT]] including policy and practice development, planning, budgeting, resourcing and training”.&lt;ref name=Nottingham.ac.uk&gt;{{cite web|last1= University of Nottingham|title=The role of a Chief Information Officers (CIO) or equivalent Senior ICT Manager|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/gradschool/sict/toolkit/knowledge-base/ict-services/role-cio|website=www.nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, CIOs are becoming increasingly important in calculating how to increase profits via the use of ICT frameworks, as well as the vital role of reducing expenditure and limiting damage by setting up controls and planning for possible disasters. ''[[Computer Weekly]]'' magazine highlights that “53% of IT leaders report a shortage of people with high-level personal skills” in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Computer Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manwani|first1=Sharm|last2=Flint|first2=David|title=From manager to chief information officer|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/From-manager-to-chief-information-officer|website=www.computerweekly.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most organisations can't expect to fill demand for skilled resources and 57% of CIOs don't have the right learning and support mechanisms in place to enable current staff to meet the skill shortage.&lt;ref name="CIO WaterCooler"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIOWaterCooler - The Changing Shape of IT|url=https://ciowatercooler.co.uk/cio-survey-the-changing-shape-of-it|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs are needed to decrease the gulf between roles carried out by both IT professionals and non-IT professionals in businesses in order to set up effective and working relationships.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The Chief Information Officer of an organization is responsible for a number of roles. First and most importantly, the CIO must fulfill the role of business leader.&lt;ref name="Business Leader Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peppard|first1=Joe|title=Unlocking the Performance of the Chief Information Officer (CIO)|journal=California Management Review|date=August 2010|volume=52|issue=4|page=5|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/52640613/unlocking-performance-chief-information-officer-cio|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a CIO must make executive decisions regarding things such as the purchase of IT equipment from suppliers or the creation of new systems, they are therefore responsible for leading and directing the workforce of their specific organization. In addition, the CIO is ‘required to have strong organizational skills’.&lt;ref name="Roles and Responsibilities Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawry|first1=Rachel|last2=Waddell|first2=Dianne|last3=Singh|first3=Mohini|title=Roles, Responsibilities and Futures of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in the Public Sector|date=2007|page=3|url=http://www.hadjarian.com/esterategic/tarjomeh/arzi1.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant for a Chief Information Officer of an organization who must balance roles in order to gain a competitive advantage and keep the best interests of the organization's employees. CIOs also have the responsibility of recruiting, so it is important that they take on the best employees to complete the jobs the company needs fulfilling.

In addition, CIOs are directly required to map out both the ICT strategy and ICT policy of an organization. The ICT strategy covers future proofing, procurement, and the external and internal standards laid out by an organization. Similarly, the CIO must write up the ICT policy, detailing how ICT is utilized and applied. Both are needed for the protection of the organization in the short and long term and the process of strategizing for the future. Paul Burfitt, former CIO of [[AstraZeneca]], also outlines the CIO's role of IT governance, which he refers to as the “clarifying” of “accountability and the role of committees”.&lt;ref name="Roles and Responsibility Computer Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Computer Weekly|title=What exactly does a chief information officer do?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240061366/What-exactly-does-a-chief-information-officer-do|website=www.computerweekly.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the CIO and their close cousin has become more closely involved in customer facing products. With the rising awareness in organisations that their customers are expecting digital services as part of their relationship with an organisation, CIOs have been tasked with product oriented responsibilities. Clear examples of this are seen at facilities management company MITIE where former CIO of energy firm Centrica Davi Cooper is the CTIO and has an agenda to create online services for their customers.&lt;ref name="CIO Interview: David Cooper, CTIO of Mitie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=CIO Interview: David Cooper, CTIO of Mitie|url=https://horizoncio.network/cio-interview-david-cooper-ctio-of-mitie|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks involved==
As the CIO has a large number of responsibilities such as provision of finance, recruitment of professionals and development of policy and strategy, the risks are consequently vast. The CIO of U.S company [[Target Corporation|Target]] was forced into resignation in 2014 after the theft of 40 million credit card details and 70 million customer details by hackers.&lt;ref name="CIO Resigntion Article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaas|first1=Lisa|title=Target CIO Beth Jacob resigns in breach aftermath|url=http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/03/06/target-cio-beth-jacob-resigns-in-breach-aftermath/|website=www.nakedsecurity.sophos.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs carry out a large number of roles and therefore the chance of failure is very high. In this way, any CIO must be knowledgeable about the industry so they can adapt and reduce the chance of error.

With the introduction of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) CIOs have now become increasingly focused on how their role is regulated and can lead to financial and reputation damage to a business.  However, regulations such as GDPR have also been advantageous to CIOs enabling them to have the budget and authority in the organisation to make significant changes to the way information is managed.  Sabah Khan-Carter of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp described GDPR as "a really big opportunity for most organisations".&lt;ref name="CIO Podcast: GDPR is a business opportunity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=CIO Podcast: GDPR is a business opportunity|url=https://horizoncio.network/cio-podcast-gdpr-is-a-business-opportunity|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology==
Information technology and its systems have become so important that the CIO has come to be viewed in many organizations as a key contributor in formulating [[strategic]] goals for an organization.  The prominence of the CIO position has greatly risen as information, and the information technology that drives it, has become an increasingly important part of the modern organization.  Many CIOs are adding additional [[c-level]] titles to reflect the growing importance of technology in successfully running companies; this trend is referred to as the [[CIO-plus]].  The CIO may be a member of the executive committee of an organization, and/or may often be required to engage at board level depending on the nature of the organization and its operating structure and governance environment.  No specific qualifications are intrinsic to the CIO position, though the typical candidate may have expertise in a number of technological fields - [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], or [[information systems]]. However, in healthcare there is a rising demand for CIOs to be qualified. The benefit of this is that they will then be seen as peers to their clinical peers and able to command greater respect and opportunity in the organisation.&lt;ref name="Healthcare CIOs chime agreement for professional recognition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=UK's leading NHS CIOs discuss the need for professional qualification|url=https://horizoncio.network/healthcare-cios-chime-agreement-for-professional-recognition/|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Many candidates have [[Master of Business Administration]] or [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meridith Levinson |url=http://www.cio.com/article/122507/Should_You_Get_an_MBA_ |title=Should You Get an MBA? - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership |publisher=CIO.com |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, CIOs' leadership capabilities, business acumen and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills. It is now quite common for CIOs to be appointed from the business side of the organization, especially if they have [[project management]] skills.

Despite the strategic nature of the role, a 2017 survey, conducted by [[Logicalis]], of 890 CIOs across 23 countries found that 62% of CIOs spend 60% or more of their time on day to day IT activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicalis-thinkhub.com/|title=Logicalis CIO Survey 2017-2018 {{!}} Think Hub {{!}}|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=www.logicalis-thinkhub.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Gartner]] Executive Programs conducted a global CIO survey and received responses from 2,053 CIOs from 41 countries and 36 industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2304615|title=Gartner Executive Program Survey of More Than 2,000 CIOs Shows Digital Technologies Are Top Priorities in 2013 |publisher=Gartner |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gartner reported that survey results indicated that the top ten technology priorities for CIOs for 2013 were [[analytics]] and [[business intelligence]],  [[mobile technologies]], [[cloud computing]], [[Collaborative software|collaboration technologies]], [[Software modernization|legacy modernization]], [[IT management]], [[customer relationship management]], [[virtualization]], [[security]], and [[enterprise resource planning]].

''CIO'' magazine's "State of the CIO 2008" survey asked 558 IT leaders whom they report to.  The results were: [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (41%), [[chief financial officer|CFO]] (23%), [[Chief operating officer|COO]] (16%), Corporate CIO (7%) and Other (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/147950/_State_of_the_CIO_2008_Data_Shows_CIO_Salaries_Influence_Rising |title=State of the CIO 2008 Data Shows CIO Salaries, Influence Rising |publisher=CIO |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a CIO is involved with driving the analysis and re-engineering of existing business processes, identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, reshaping the enterprise's physical infrastructure and network access, and with identifying and exploiting the enterprise's knowledge resources.  Many CIOs head the enterprise's efforts to integrate the Internet into both its long-term strategy and its immediate business plans. CIOs are often tasked with either driving or heading up crucial IT projects that are essential to the strategic and operational objectives of an organization.  A good example of this would be the implementation of an [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) system, which typically has wide-ranging implications for most organizations.

Another way that the CIO role is changing is an increased focus on service management.&lt;ref name="servMgmt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/558564/Recession_Shifts_IT_Service_Management_Into_Fast_Lane |title=CIO Magazine: Recession Shifts IT Service Management into Fast Lane |publisher=Cio.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[SaaS]], [[IaaS]], [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]] and other more flexible value delivery techniques are brought into organizations the CIO usually functions as a 3rd party manager for the organization.  In essence, a CIO in the modern organization is required to possess business skills and the ability to relate to the organization as a whole, as opposed to being a technological expert with limited functional business expertise.  The CIO position is as much about anticipating trends in the market place with regard to technology as it is about ensuring that the business navigates these trends through expert guidance and proper strategic IT planning that is aligned to the corporate strategy of the organization.

==Distinction between CIO, CDO and CTO==
The roles of Chief Information Officer, [[Chief Digital Officer]] and [[Chief Technology Officer]] are commonly blurred. Tom Silver, the North American senior vice president for Dice, states that CTOs are concerned with technology itself, often customer-facing, whereas CIOs are much more concerned with its applications in the business and how this can be managed.&lt;ref name="Oracle CTO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetlin|first1=Minda|title=CIO or CTO- What's in a Title?|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/features/050110-ciocto-143658.html|website=www.oracle.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, CIOs manage a business's IT systems and functions, creates and delivers strategies and policies, and places great emphasis on internal customers. In contrast to this, CTOs place emphasis on the external customers to the organization and focus on how different technology can make the company more profitable.&lt;ref name="Tech Republic CTO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiner|first1=Jason|title=Sanity check: What's the difference between CIO and CTO?|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/sanity-check-whats-the-difference-between-cio-and-cto/|website=www.techrepublic.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional definition of CTOs focused on using technology as an external competitive advantage now includes CDOs who use the power of modern technologies, online design and [[big data]] to digitalise a business.

==Awards and recognition==

It is not uncommon for CIOs to be recognised and awarded annually, particularly in the technology space. These awards are commonly dictated by the significance of their contribution to the industry and generally occur in local markets only. Awards are generally judged by industry peers, or senior qualified executives such as the [[chief executive officer]], [[chief operating officer]] or [[chief financial officer]]. Generally awards recognise substantial impact to the local technology market.

In [[Australia]], the top 50 CIOs are recognised annually under the [[CIO50]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cio.com.au/cio50/|title=Home- CIO 50- CIO|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States|United States of America]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[New Zealand]] CIOs are recognised under the [[CIO100]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/category/cio100/|title=CIO 100 Symposium and Awards|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.co.uk/cio100/archive/|title=CIO 100 Archive - CIO UK|website=www.cio.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cio.co.nz/cio100nz/|title=CIO 100- CIO New Zealand|website=CIO New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luma Chroma both.png|thumb|Luminance only, Chrominance only, and full color image.]]
'''Chrominance''' (''chroma'' or C for short) is the signal used in [[video]] systems to convey the color information of the picture, separately from the accompanying [[Luma (video)|luma]] signal (or Y for short). Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;B′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Y′ (blue&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;luma) and V&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;R′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Y′ (red&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;luma).  Each of these difference components may have scale factors and offsets applied to it, as specified by the applicable video standard.  

In [[composite video]] signals, the U and V signals modulate a color [[subcarrier]] signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal; the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[amplitude]] of this modulated chrominance signal correspond approximately to the [[hue]] and [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] of the color.  In digital-video and still-image [[color space]]s such as [[Y′CbCr]], the luma and chrominance components are digital sample values.

Separating [[RGB]] color signals into luma and chrominance allows the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of each to be determined separately.  Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by [[chroma subsampling]].

==History==
The idea of transmitting a [[color television]] signal with distinct [[Luma (video)|luma]] and chrominance components originated with [[Georges Valensi]], who patented the idea in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;French patent 841335, issued Feb. 6, 1939; cited in U.S. Patent 2375966 [http://www.google.com/patents?id=dbhHAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=ininventor:valensi+color+television#PPA20,M1 "System of Television in Colors"], issued May 15, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Valensi's patent application described:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The use of two channels, one transmitting the predominating color (signal T), and the other the mean brilliance (signal t) output from a single television transmitter to be received not only by color television receivers provided with the necessary more expensive equipment, but also by the ordinary type of television receiver which is more numerous and less expensive and which reproduces the pictures in black and white only.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Previous schemes for color television systems, which were incompatible with existing monochrome receivers, transmitted [[RGB]] signals in various ways.

==Television standards==
In [[analog television]], chrominance is encoded into a [[video signal]] using a [[subcarrier]] frequency. Depending on the video standard, the chrominance subcarrier may be either [[quadrature amplitude modulation|quadrature-amplitude-modulated]] ([[NTSC]] and [[PAL]]) or [[frequency modulation|frequency-modulated]] ([[SECAM]]).

In the PAL system, the color subcarrier is 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz above the video carrier, while in the NTSC system it is 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz above the video carrier. The NTSC and PAL standards are the most commonly used, although there are other video standards that employ different subcarrier frequencies. For example, [[PAL-M (television)|PAL-M]] (Brazil) uses a 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz subcarrier, and [[SECAM]] uses two different frequencies, 4.250&amp;nbsp;MHz and 4.40625&amp;nbsp;MHz above the video carrier.

The presence of chrominance in a video signal is indicated by a [[color burst]] signal transmitted on the [[back porch]], just after horizontal synchronization and before each line of video starts. If the color burst signal were visible on a television screen, it would appear as a vertical strip of a very dark olive color. In [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]], hue is represented by a [[phase shift]]&lt;!-- [[quadrature modulation]] --&gt; of the chrominance signal relative to the color burst, while saturation is determined by the amplitude of the subcarrier. In [[SECAM]] (R′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Y′) and (B′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Y′) signals are transmitted alternately and phase does not matter.

Chrominance is represented by the [[YUV|U-V]] color plane in PAL and SECAM video signals, and by the [[YIQ|I-Q]] color plane in NTSC.

==Digital systems==
Digital video and digital still photography systems sometimes use a luma/chroma decomposition for improved compression.  For example, when an ordinary [[RGB]] digital image is compressed via the [[JPEG]] standard, the RGB colorspace is first converted (by a rotation [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]) to a [[YCbCr]] colorspace, because the three components in that space have less correlation redundancy and because the chrominance components can then be subsampled by a factor of 2 or 4 to further compress the image.  On decompression, the Y′CbCr space is rotated back to RGB.

In [[serial communication]] of digital data, '''clock recovery''' is the process of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode the transmitted symbols. Clock recovery from the data stream is expedited by modifying the transmitted data. Wherever a serial communication channel does not transmit the clock signal along with the data stream, the clock must be regenerated at the receiver, using the timing information from the data stream.  Clock recovery is a common component of systems communicating over wires, optical fibers, or by radio. 

Some digital data streams, especially high-speed serial data streams (such as the raw stream of data from the magnetic head of a [[disk drive]] and serial communication networks such as [[Ethernet]]) are sent without an accompanying [[clock signal]].  The receiver generates a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then phase-aligns the clock to the transitions in the data stream with a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL).  This is one method of performing a process commonly known as ''clock and data recovery'' (CDR).  Other methods include the use of a [[delay-locked loop]] and [[oversampling]] of the data stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Oversampling can be done ''blind'' using multiple phases of a free-running clock to create multiple samples of the input and then selecting the best sample.  Or, a counter can be used that is driven by a sampling clock running at some multiple of the data stream frequency, with the counter reset on every transition of the data stream and the data stream sampled at some predetermined count.  These two types of oversampling are sometimes called ''spatial'' and ''time'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The best [[bit error ratio]] (BER) is obtained when the samples are taken as far away as possible from any data stream transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most oversampling designs using a counter employ a sampling clock frequency that is an even multiple of the data stream, an odd multiple is better able to create a sampling point further from any data stream transitions and can do so at nearly half the frequency of a design using an even multiple.  In oversampling type CDRs, the signal used to sample the data can be used as the recovered clock.

Clock recovery is very closely related to the problem of [[carrier recovery]], which is the process of re-creating a phase-locked version of the carrier when a [[suppressed carrier]] modulation scheme is used.  These problems were first addressed in a 1956 paper, which introduced a clock-recovery method now known as the [[Costas loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In order for this scheme to work, a data stream must transition frequently enough to correct for any drift in the PLL's oscillator.  The limit for how long a clock-recovery unit can operate without a transition is known as its maximum consecutive identical digits (CID) specification.  To ensure frequent transitions, some sort of [[self-clocking signal]] is used, often a [[run length limited]] encoding; [[8b/10b encoding]] is very common, while [[Manchester encoding]] serves the same purpose in old revisions of [[IEEE 802.3|802.3]] [[local area network]]s.

'''CodeSynthesis XSD/e''' is a validating [[XML]] parser/serializer and [[C++]] [[XML Data Binding]] generator for Mobile and [[Embedded systems]]. It is developed by [[Code Synthesis]] and [[dual license|dual-licensed]] under the [[GNU GPL]] and a proprietary license. 

Given an XML instance specification ([[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]), XSD/e can produce three kinds of C++ mappings: Embedded C++/Parser for event-driven XML parsing, Embedded C++/Serializer for event-driven XML serialization, and Embedded C++/Hybrid which provides a light-weight, in-memory object model on top of the other two mappings.

The C++/Hybrid mapping generates C++ classes for types defined in XML Schema as well as parsing and serialization code. The C++ classes represent the data stored in XML as a statically-typed, tree-like object model and support fully in-memory as well as partially in-memory/partially event-driven XML processing. The C++/Parser mapping generates validating C++ parser skeletons for data types defined in XML Schema. One can then implement these parser skeletons to build a custom in-memory representation or perform immediate processing as parts of the XML documents become available. Similarly, the Embedded C++/Serializer mapping generates validating C++ serializer skeletons for types defined in XML Schema which can be used to serialize application data to XML.

CodeSynthesis XSD/e itself is written in C++&lt;ref&gt;[[Bjarne Stroustrup]]. [http://www.research.att.com/~bs/applications.html C++ applications], 2007-05-25. Retrieved on 2007-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and supports a number of embedded targets include Embedded [[Linux]], [[VxWorks]], [[QNX]], [[LynxOS]], [[iPhone OS]] and [[Windows CE]].

'''Communications servers''' are open, standards-based computing systems that operate as a [[Carrier grade|carrier-grade]] common platform for a wide range of communications applications and allow equipment providers to add value at many levels of the system architecture.

Based on industry-managed standards such as [[AdvancedTCA]], [[Advanced_Mezzanine_Card#MicroTCA_.2F_.CE.BCTCA|MicroTCA]], [[Carrier Grade Linux]] and [[Service Availability Forum]] specifications, communications servers are the foundational platform upon which equipment providers build network infrastructure elements for deployments such as [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS), [[IPTV]] and wireless broadband (e.g. [[WiMAX]]).

Support for communications servers as a category of server is developing rapidly throughout the communications industry.  Standards bodies, industry associations, vendor alliance programs, hardware and software manufacturers, communications server vendors and users are all part of an increasingly robust communications server ecosystem.

Regardless of their specific, differentiated features, communications servers have the following attributes: open, flexible, carrier-grade, and communications-focused.

== Attributes ==

=== Open ===

*Based on industry-managed open standards
*Broad, multi-vendor ecosystem
*Industry certified interoperability
*Availability of tools that facilitate development and integration of applications at the standardized interfaces
*Multiple competitive options for standards-based modules

=== Flexible ===

*Designed to easily incorporate application-specific added value at all levels of the solution
*Can be rapidly repurposed as needs change to protect customer investment
*Multi-level, scalable, bladed architecture
*Meets needs of multiple industries beyond telecommunications, such as medical imaging, defense and aerospace

=== Carrier grade ===

*Designed for
**Longevity of supply
**Extended lifecycle (&gt;10 years) support
**[[High availability]] (&gt;5NINES)
*“Non-disruptively” upgradeable and updateable
*Hard [[Real-time computing|real time]] capability to ensure quality of service for critical traffic
*Meets [[Network Equipment-Building System|network building regulations]]

== Industry-managed standards ==
Several industry-managed standards are critical to the success of communications servers, including:

=== [[AdvancedTCA]] ===
The [[Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture]] (ATCA) is a series of [[PCI Industrial Computers Manufacturers Group]] ([[PICMG]]) specifications, targeted to meet the requirements for carrier grade communications equipment. This series of specifications incorporates the latest trends in high speed interconnect technologies, next generation processors and improved reliability, manageability and serviceability.

=== [[AdvancedMC]] ===
The PICMG [[Advanced Mezzanine Card]] specification defines the base-level requirements for a wide range of high-speed mezzanine cards optimized for, but not limited to, AdvancedTCA Carriers.   AdvancedMC enhances AdvancedTCA’s flexibility by extending its high-bandwidth, multi-protocol interface to individual hot-swappable modules.

=== [[Advanced_Mezzanine_Card#MicroTCA_.2F_.CE.BCTCA|MicroTCA]] ===
This PICMG specification provides a framework for combining AdvancedMC modules directly, without the need for an AdvancedTCA or custom carrier.  [[Advanced_Mezzanine_Card#MicroTCA_.2F_.CE.BCTCA|MicroTCA]] is aimed at smaller equipment – such as wireless base stations, Wi-Fi and WiMAX radios, and VoIP access gateways where small physical size low entry cost, and scalability are key requirements.

=== [[Carrier Grade Linux]] ===
An enhanced version of Linux for use in a highly available, secure, scalable, and maintainable carrier grade system. The specification is managed by the CGL Working Group of the [[Open Source Development Labs]].

=== [[Service Availability Forum|HPI and AIS]] ===
These [[Service Availability Forum]] (SA Forum) specifications define standard interfaces for telecom platform management and high-availability software.

The Hardware Platform Interface (HPI) specification defines the interface between high availability middleware and the underlying hardware and operating system.

At a higher layer than HPI, the Application Interface Specification (AIS) defines the application programming interface between the high availability middleware and the application. AIS allows an application to run on multiple computing modules, and applications that support AIS can migrate more easily between computing platforms from different manufacturers that support the standard.

In addition to the standards development organizations mentioned above, four industry associations / vendor alliance programs are playing key roles in the development of the communications server ecosystem.

== Industry associations ==

=== [[SCOPE Alliance]] ===
[[SCOPE Alliance]] is an industry alliance committed to accelerating the deployment of carrier grade base platforms for service provider applications. Its mission is to help, enable and promote the availability of open carrier grade base platforms based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf hardware / software and Free Open Source Software building blocks, and to promote interoperability to better serve Service Providers and consumers.

=== [http://www.cp-ta.org Communications Platforms Trade Association] ===
The Communications Platforms Trade Association (CP-TA) is an association of communications platforms and building block providers dedicated to accelerating the adoption of [[special interest group|SIG]]-governed, open specification-based communications platforms through interoperability certification. With industry collaboration, the CP-TA plans to drive a mainstream market for open industry standards-based communications platforms by certifying interoperable products.

== Vendor alliance programs ==

=== [http://www.intel.com/design/network/ica/index.htm Intel Communications Alliance] ===
The [http://www.intel.com/design/network/ica/index.htm Intel Communications Alliance] is a community of communications and embedded developers and solutions providers committed to the development of modular, standards-based solutions on [[Intel]] technologies.

{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}
In electrical and electronic engineering, a '''current clamp''' or '''current probe''' is an electrical device with jaws which open to allow clamping around an electrical conductor. This allows measurement of the current in a conductor without the need to make physical contact with it, or to disconnect it for insertion through the probe. Current clamps are typically used to read the magnitude of [[alternating current]] (AC) and, with additional instrumentation, the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[waveform]] can also be measured. Some clamps meters can measure currents of 1000&amp;nbsp;A and more. [[Hall effect]] and vane type clamps can also measure [[direct current]] (DC).

==Types of current clamp==

===Current transformer===
A common form of current clamp comprises a split ring made of ferrite or soft iron. A wire coil is wound round one or both halves, forming one winding of a [[current transformer]]. The conductor it is clamped around forms the other winding. Like any transformer this type works only with AC or pulse waveforms, with some examples extending into the megahertz range.

When measuring current, the subject conductor forms the primary winding and the coil forms the secondary.

This type may also be used in reverse, to inject current into the conductor, for example in [[electromagnetic compatibility]] susceptibility testing to induce an [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] current. Usually, the injection probe is specifically designed for this purpose. In this mode, the coil forms the primary and the test conductor the secondary.

===Iron vane===
In the iron vane type, the magnetic flux in the core directly affects a moving iron vane, allowing both AC and DC to be measured, and gives a true [[root mean square]] (RMS) value for non-sinusoidal AC waveforms. Due to its physical size it is generally limited to power transmission frequencies up to around 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The vane is usually fixed directly to the display mechanism of an analogue (moving pointer) clamp meter.
The calibration of the instrument is clearly non-linear.

===Hall effect===
The [[Hall effect]] type is more sensitive and is able to measure both DC and AC,&lt;ref&gt;http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/an-overview-of-clamp-meter&lt;/ref&gt; in some examples up to the kilohertz (thousands of hertz) range. This type was often used with [[oscilloscope]]s, and with high-end computerized digital multimeters, however, they are becoming common place for more general use.

===Rogowski coil===
Resembling a current clamp in appearance and function is the [[Rogowski coil]] current sensor. This coreless transformer is used in clamp meters and power monitoring loggers. It has the advantage of better linearity, having no core to saturate, it can be made flexible, and does not require any magnetic or electrical contact at the opening end.&lt;ref&gt;http://en-us.fluke.com/training/training-library/test-tools/clamp-meters/inside-flexible-coil-clamp-meters.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Rogowski coil gives a voltage proportional to the rate of change of current in the primary cable, so more signal processing is needed before the sensed values can be displayed.

==Clamp meter==
[[File:Clampmeter.jpg|thumb|150px|Clampmeter|A digital clamp meter]][[Image:tongtester.jpg|thumb|450px|right|A multimeter with built-in clamp. Pushing the large button at the bottom opens the lower jaw of the clamp, allowing the clamp to be placed around a conductor.]]
An electrical meter with integral AC current clamp is known as a clamp meter, clamp-on ammeter, tong tester, or colloquially as an amp clamp.

A clamp meter measures the vector sum of the currents flowing in all the conductors passing through the probe, which depends on the [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship of the currents. Only one conductor is normally passed through the probe. In particular if the clamp is closed around a two-conductor cable carrying power to equipment, the same current flows down one conductor and up the other; the meter correctly reads a net current of zero. As electrical cables for equipment have both insulated conductors (and possibly an earth wire) bonded together, clamp meters are often used with what is essentially a short extension cord with the two conductors separated, so that the clamp can be placed around only one conductor of this extension.

A relatively recent development was a multi-conductor clamp meter with several sensor coils around the jaws of the clamp.  This could be clamped around standard two- or three-conductor single-phase cables to provide a readout of the current flowing through the load,&lt;ref name=mmc850&gt;[http://www.megger.com/common/documents/MMC850_DS_en_V02.pdf?ref=/us/products/ProductDetails.php?ID=656 Megger MMC850 clamp meter specification.] Designed to read current even if both conductors enclosed.&lt;/ref&gt; with no need to separate the conductors.

The reading produced by a conductor carrying a very low current can be increased by winding the conductor around the clamp several times; the meter reading divided by the number of turns is the current,&lt;ref name=weschler&gt;[http://www.weschler.com/_upload/sitepdfs/ammeters/clampons.pdf Weschler Instruments: Columbia Tong Ammeters]&lt;/ref&gt; with some loss of accuracy due to inductive effects.

Clamp meters are used by electricians, sometimes with the clamp incorporated into a general purpose [[multimeter]].

It is simple to measure very high currents (hundreds of amperes) with the appropriate current transformer. Accurate measurement of low currents (a few milliamperes) with a current transformer clamp is more difficult.  The range of any given meter can be extended by passing the conductor through the jaw multiple times.  For example a 0–200&amp;nbsp;A meter can be turned into a 0–20&amp;nbsp;A meter by winding the conductor 10 times around the jaw's core.

[[File:Ammeter-Columbia-iron-vane-type-clamp-on-ammeter.jpg|thumb|left|Columbia iron vane type clamp-on ammeter, with heads for different ranges]]
Less-expensive clamp meters use a rectifier circuit which actually reads mean current, but is calibrated to display the RMS current corresponding to the measured mean, giving a correct RMS reading only if the current is a [[sine wave]]. For other waveforms readings will be incorrect; when these simpler meters are used with non-sinusoidal loads such as the [[Ballast (electrical)|ballasts]] used with [[fluorescent lamp]]s or [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s or most modern computer and electronic equipment, readings can be quite inaccurate. Meters which respond to true RMS rather than mean current are described as "true RMS".

Typical hand-held [[Hall effect]] units can read currents as low as 200&amp;nbsp;mA, and units that can read down to 1&amp;nbsp;mA are available.

The Columbia tong test ammeter (illustrated) is an example of the iron vane type, used for measuring large AC currents up to 1000 amperes. The iron jaws of the meter direct the magnetic field surrounding the conductor to an iron vane that is attached to the needle of the meter. The iron vane moves in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, and thus produces a meter indication proportional to the current. This type of ammeter can measure both AC and DC currents and provides a true RMS current measurement of non-sinusoidal or distorted AC waveforms. Interchangeable meter movements can be installed in the clamping assembly to provide various full-scale current values up to 1000 amperes. The iron vane is in a small cylinder that is inserted in a space at the hinged end of the clamp-on jaws. Several jaw sizes are available for clamping around large conductors and bus bars up to {{convert|4+1/2|in|mm}} wide.&lt;ref name=weschler/&gt; As the illustration shows, the scale is very non-linear and unsuitable for measuring low currents, with currents of less than half the full-scale deflection crammed into a short section of the dial.
{{clear}}

===Power meter, energy analyzer===
Clamp probes are used with some meters to measure [[electrical power]] and [[electrical energy|energy]]. The clamp measures the current and other circuitry the [[voltage]]; the true power is the product of the instantaneous voltage and current [[Integral|integrated]] over a [[Frequency|cycle]]. Comprehensive meters designed to measure many parameters of electrical energy ([[power factor]], [[distortion]], instantaneous power as a function of time, [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationships, etc.), [[energy analyzer]]s, use this principle. A single clamp is used for single-phase measurements; with an appropriate instrument with three clamps, measurements may be made on [[three-phase]] power systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">[[File:CC1000ip closed.jpg|thumb|Example of a Cyclic corrosion test chamber.]]
'''Cyclic Corrosion Testing''' (CCT) has evolved in recent years, largely within the [[automotive industry]], as a way of [[accelerating]] real-world corrosion failures, under laboratory controlled conditions.  
As the name implies, the test comprises different [[climates]] which are cycled automatically so the samples under test undergo the same sort of changing environment that would be encountered in the natural world. The intention being to bring about the type of [[failure]] that might occur naturally, but more quickly i.e. accelerated. By doing this manufacturers and suppliers can predict, more accurately, the service [[life expectancy]] of their products.

Until the development of Cyclic Corrosion Testing, the traditional [[Salt spray test]] was virtually all that manufacturers could use for this purpose. However, this test was never intended for this purpose. Because the test conditions specified for salt spray testing are not typical of a naturally occurring environment, this type of test cannot be used as a reliable means of predicting the ‘real world’ service life expectancy for the samples under test. The sole purpose of the salt spray test is to compare and contrast results with previous experience to perform a [[quality audit]]. So, for example, a spray test can be used to ‘police’ a production process and forewarn of potential manufacturing problems or defects, which might affect [[corrosion]] resistance. .&lt;ref name="Automotive Corrosion Testing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=J|title=Automotive Corrosion Testing|journal=SAE Technical Paper 780910|date=1978|doi=10.4271/780910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To recreate these different environments within an [[environmental chamber]] requires much more flexible testing procedures than are available in a standard salt spray chamber.

The lack of correlation between results obtained from traditional salt spray testing&lt;ref name=LeBozec&gt;{{cite journal|last1=N. LeBozec, N. Blandin and D. Thierry|title=Materials &amp; Corrosion|journal=Accelerated corrosion tests in the automotive industry: A comparison of the performance towards cosmetic corrosion|date=2008|volume=No.11|issue=59|pages=889–893|doi=10.1002/maco.200804168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ‘real world’ atmospheric corrosion of [[vehicles]], left the automotive industry without a reliable test method for predicting the service [[life expectancy]] of their products. This was and remains of particular concern in an industry where [[anti-corrosion]] warranties have been gradually increasing and now run to several years for new vehicles.

With ever increasing consumer pressure for improved vehicle corrosion resistance and a few ‘high profile’ corrosion failures amongst some vehicle manufactures – with disastrous commercial consequences, the automotive industry recognized the need for a different type of corrosion test.

Such a test would need to [[simulate]] the types of conditions a vehicle might encounter naturally, but recreate and accelerate these conditions, with good [[repeatability]], within the convenience of the laboratory.&lt;ref name=Baboian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baboian|first1=Robert|title=Corrosion Tests and Standards: Application and Interpretation|journal=Automotive|date=2005|pages=673–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CCT is effective for evaluating a variety of [[corrosion]] types, including [[galvanic corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]].

[[File:VDA 621-415.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during cyclic corrosion test VDA 621-415]]

== Test Stages ==

Taking results gathered largely from ‘real world’ exposure sites, automotive companies, led originally by the [[Japanese automobile industry]], developed their own Cyclic Corrosion Tests. These have evolved in different ways for different vehicle manufacturers, and such tests still remain largely industry specific, with no truly international CCT standard. However, they all generally require most of the following conditions to be created, in a repeating [[sequence]] or ‘cycle’, though not necessarily in the following order:&lt;ref name="LeBozec"/&gt;

• A salt spray ‘pollution’ phase. This may be similar to the traditional salt spray test although in some cases direct impingement by the [[salt solution]] on the test [[Sample (material)|specimens]], or even complete immersion in salt water, is required. However, this ‘pollution’ phase is generally shorter in duration than a traditional salt spray test.
[[File:D17 2028 ECC1.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during cyclic corrosion test D17 2028 ECC1]]
• An air drying phase. Depending on the test, this may be conducted at [[ambient temperature]], or at an elevated temperature, with or without control over the [[relative humidity]] and usually by introducing a continuous supply of relatively fresh air around the test samples at the same time. It is generally required that the samples under test should be visibly ‘dry’ at the end of this test phase.
 [[File:CETP 00.00-L-467 Ford.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during cyclic corrosion test CETP 00.00-L-467]]
• A [[condensation]] humidity ‘wetting’ phase. This is usually conducted at an elevated temperature and generally a high [[humidity]] of 95-100%RH. The purpose of this phase is to promote the formation of condensation on the surfaces of the samples under test.

• A controlled humidity/humidity cycling phase. This requires the tests samples to be exposed to a controlled temperature and controlled humidity climate, which can either be constant or cycling between different levels. When cycling between different levels, the rate of change may also be specified.

The above list is not exhaustive, since some automotive companies may also require other climates to be created in sequence as well, for example; sub-zero refrigeration, but it does list the most common requirements.&lt;ref name="LeBozec"/&gt;

'''DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification''' is the primary document by which the certification authorities such as [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] and [[Transport Canada]] approve all commercial software-based aerospace systems. The document is published by [[RTCA, Incorporated]], in a joint effort with [[EUROCAE]], and replaces [[DO-178B]]. The new document is called DO-178C/ED-12C and was completed in November 2011 and approved by the RTCA in December 2011.  It became available for sale and use in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Timberlake Membership Software, 703-591-4232 |url=http://www.rtca.org/store_list.asp |title=Rtca, Inc |website=Rtca.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The FAA approved [[AC 20-115|AC 20-115C]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-115C.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903075843/http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-115C.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  on 19 Jul 2013, making DO-178C a recognized "acceptable means, but not the only means, for showing compliance with the applicable airworthiness regulations for the software aspects of airborne systems and equipment certification."

==Background==
Since the release of [[DO-178B]], there have been strong calls by DERs (FAA [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative|Designated Engineering Representatives]]) for clarification/refinement of the definitions and boundaries between the key DO-178B concepts of high-level requirements, low-level requirements, and derived requirements and a better definition of the exit/entry criteria between systems requirements and system design (see [[ARP4754]]) and that of software requirements and software design (which is the domain of DO-178B). Other concerns included the meaning of verification in a [[Model-based design|model-based development paradigm]] and considerations for replacing some or all software testing activities with model simulation or formal methods. The release of DO-178C and the companion documents [[DO-278|DO-278A]] (Ground Systems), [[DO-248B|DO-248C]]&lt;!-- see discusion of update to DO-248B article --&gt; (Additional information with rationale for each DO-178C objective), DO-330 (Tool Qualification), DO-331 (Modeling), DO-332 (Object Oriented), and DO-333 (Formal Methods) were created to address the issues noted.  The SC-205 members worked with the SAE S-18 committee to ensure that ARP4754A and the above noted DO-xxx documents provide a unified and linked process with complementary criteria.

Overall, DO-178C keeps most of the DO-178B text, which has raised concerns that issues with DO-178B, such as the ambiguity about the concept of low-level requirements, may not be fully resolved.&lt;ref name=advances&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Dale|editor-first=Chris|editor2-first=Tom|editor2-last=Anderson|title=Advances in systems safety : proceedings of the Nineteenth Safety-Critical Systems Symposium, Southampton, UK, 8-10th February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=9780857291325|pages=298–299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEhtNRsMWXIC&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;ots=ZYDkWqUv6e&amp;dq=DO%20178B%20derived%20requirements&amp;pg=PA298#v=onepage&amp;q=DO%20178B%20derived%20requirements&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committee organization==
The RTCA/EUROCAE joint committee work was divided into seven Subgroups:
* SG1: SCWG Document Integration
* SG2: Issues and Rationale
* SG3: Tool Qualification
* SG4: Model Based Development and Verification
* SG5: Object-Oriented Technology
* SG6: Formal Methods
* SG7: Safety Related Considerations

The Model Based Development and Verification subgroup (SG4), was the largest of the working groups. All work is collected and coordinated via a web-site that is a collaborative work management mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.pr.erau.edu/SCAS/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719191415/http://forum.pr.erau.edu/SCAS/ |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working artifacts and draft documents were held in a restricted area available to group members only.

The work was focused on bringing DO-178B/ED-12B up to date with respect to current software development practices, tools, and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Software level==
The '''Software Level''', also known as the '''Design Assurance Level''' (DAL) or '''Item Development Assurance Level''' (IDAL),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;RTCA/DO-178C "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification", p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; is determined from the [[ARP4761|safety assessment process]] and [[hazard analysis]] by examining the effects of a failure condition in the system. The failure conditions are categorized by their effects on the aircraft, crew, and passengers.
* '''Catastrophic''' - Failure may cause deaths, usually with loss of the airplane. 
* '''Hazardous''' - Failure has a large negative impact on safety or performance, or reduces the ability of the crew to operate the aircraft due to physical distress or a higher workload, or causes serious or fatal injuries among the passengers. 
* '''Major''' - Failure significantly reduces the safety margin or significantly increases crew workload.  May result in passenger discomfort (or even minor injuries).
* '''Minor''' - Failure slightly reduces the safety margin or slightly increases crew workload.  Examples might include causing passenger inconvenience or a routine flight plan change.
* '''No Effect''' - Failure has no impact on safety, aircraft operation, or crew workload.

DO-178C alone is not intended to guarantee software safety aspects. Safety attributes in the design and as implemented as functionality must receive additional mandatory system safety tasks to drive and show objective evidence of meeting explicit safety requirements. The certification authorities require and DO-178C specifies the correct DAL be established using these comprehensive analyses methods to establish the software level A-E.  "The software level establishes the rigor necessary to demonstrate compliance" with DO-178C.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Any software that commands, controls, and monitors safety-critical functions should receive the highest DAL - Level A.

The number of objectives to be satisfied (some with independence) is determined by the software level A-E. The phrase "with independence" refers to a separation of  responsibilities where the objectivity of the verification and validation processes is ensured by virtue of their "independence" from the software development team.  For objectives that must be satisfied with independence, the person verifying the item (such as a requirement or source code) may not be the person who authored the item and this separation must be clearly documented.&lt;ref&gt;RTCA/DO-178C "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification", p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traceability==
[[File:DO-178C Traceability.png|thumb|Diagram illustrating the required tracing between certification artifacts, as required by the RTCA DO-178C standard.   Red-colored traces are required only for Level A.  Purple-colored traces are required for Levels A, B, and C.  Green-colored traces are for Levels A, B, C, and D.  Level E does not require any tracing.  The references on each trace arrow represent references to the standard for the objective, the activity, and the review/verification, respectively.]]
DO-178 requires a documented connection (called a trace) between the certification artifacts.  For example, a Low Level Requirement (LLR) traces up to a High Level Requirement (HLR).  A traceability analysis is then used to ensure that each requirement is fulfilled by the source code, that each requirement is tested, that each line of source code has a purpose (is connected to a requirement), and so forth.  Traceability ensures the system is complete.    The rigor and detail of the certification artifacts is related to the software level.

==Differences with DO-178B==
SC-205 was responsible for revising DO-178B/ED-12B to bring it up to date with respect to current software development and verification technologies.  The structure of the document remains largely the same from B to C. Example changes include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title       = HighRely Synopsis of National FAA Software and Hardware Meeting Includes DO-178C Status
 | year        = 2006
 | url         = http://www.mil-embedded.com/news/Industry+News/3247
 | quote       = ''DO-178C will contain more details on software modeling and the potential ability to use modeling to supplant some of the verification techniques normally required in DO-178B. DO-178C will also more fully address OO (Object Oriented) software and the conditions under which it can be used and the certification ramifications of OO in DO-178C.''
 | accessdate  = 30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provide clearer language and terminology, provide more consistency
* More objectives (for Levels A, B, and C)
* Clarified the "hidden objective", applicable to Level A, which was implied by [[DO-178B]] in section 6.4.4.2b but not listed in the Annex A tables.  This objective is now explicitly listed in DO-178C, Annex A, Table A-7, Objective 9: "Verification of additional code, that cannot be traced to Source Code, is achieved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title       = RTCA/DO-178C Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification
 | publisher   = RTCA, Inc.
 | year        = 2011
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Parameter Data Item Files - Provides separate information that influences the behavior of an executable object code (without changing it).  An example would be a configuration file that sets up the schedule and major time frames of a partitioned operating system.  The parameter data item file must be verified together with the executable object code, or else it must be tested for all possible ranges of the parameter data items.
* [[DO-330]] "Software Tool Qualification Considerations", a new “domain independent, external document”, was developed to provide guidance for an acceptable tool qualification process. While DO-178C was used as the basis of the development of this new document, the text was adapted to be directly and separately applicable to tool development and to address all tool aspects.  Tool Qualification guidance was removed in DO-178C, replaced with guidance for deciding when to apply DO-330 tool qualification guidance to tools used in a DO-178C context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pothon |first= Frédéric, et al, |date= 2012 |title= DO-178C/ED-12C versus DO-178B/ED-12B Changes and Improvements  |url= http://www.adacore.com/uploads/technical-papers/DO178C-ED12C-Changes_and_Improvements-Sep2012.pdf |page= 49 |accessdate= 2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Technology supplements were added to ''extend'' the guidance of the DO-178C document to specific techniques. Rather than expanding the prior text to account for all current and future software development techniques, supplements are made available to explicitly add, delete, or otherwise modify the guidance of the core standard for application to specific techniques or technologies. All guidance in these supplements are written in the context of the affected guidance elements in DO-178C and so should be considered as at the same level of authority as that core document.&lt;ref&gt;Pothon, pp. 43-46 &lt;/ref&gt;
** [[DO-331]] "Model-Based Development and Verification Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A" - addressing Model-Based Development (MBD) and verification and the ability to use modeling techniques to improve development and verification while avoiding pitfalls inherent in some modeling methods
** [[DO-332]] "Object-Oriented Technology and Related Techniques Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A" - addressing [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented software]] and the conditions under which it may be used
** [[DO-333]] "Formal Methods Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A" - addressing [[formal methods]] to complement (but not replace) testing

===Guidelines vs. Guidance===
DO-178B was not completely consistent in the use of the terms Guidelines and Guidance within the text.  "Guidance" conveys a slightly stronger sense of obligation than "guidelines".  As such, with the DO-178C, the SCWG has settled on the use of “guidance” for all the statements that are considered as "recommendations", replacing the remaining instances of "guidelines" with “supporting information” and using that phrase wherever the text is more "information" oriented than "recommendation" oriented.  

The entire DO-248C/ED-94C document, "Supporting Information for DO-178C and DO-278A", falls into the “supporting information” category, not guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Pothon, p. 14 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample difference between DO-178B and DO-178C==
Chapter 6.1 defines the purpose for the software verification process. DO-178C adds the following statement about the Executable Object Code:
* "The Executable Object Code satisfies the software requirements (that is, intended  function), and provides confidence in the absence of unintended functionality."
* "The Executable Object Code is robust with respect to the software requirements that it can respond correctly to abnormal inputs and conditions."
As a comparison, DO-178B states the following with regard to the Executable Object Code:
* "The Executable Object Code satisfies the software requirements."
The additional clarification fills a gap that a software developer may encounter when interpreting the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alm.parasoft.com/achieving-do178c-compliance/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911083554/http://alm.parasoft.com/achieving-do178c-compliance |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bubble pump.ogv|right|frame|Example solar powered gas lift pump]]'''Gas lift''' or '''bubble pumps''' use the [[artificial lift]] technique of raising a fluid such as water or oil by introducing bubbles of [[compressed air]], [[water vapor]] or other vaporous [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s into the outlet tube. This has the effect of reducing the [[hydrostatic pressure]] in the outlet tube vs. the hydrostatic pressure at the inlet side of the tube.

Devices using this type of lift mechanism: 
*[[Coffee percolator]]s use vaporized water to lift hot water
*[[Airlift pump]]s uses compressed air to lift water
*[[Pulser pump]]s use a subterranean chamber of air for an airlift pump
*[[Airlift (dredging device)|Suction dredge]]s use an airlift pump to vacuum mud, sand and debris
*[[Mist lift]] pumps uses vaporized water to lift seawater in [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]]

==Petroleum industry uses==
In the United States, gas lift is used in 10% of the oil wells that have insufficient reservoir pressure to produce the well. In the petroleum industry, the process involves injecting gas through the tubing-casing [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]]. Injected gas aerates the fluid to reduce its [[density]]; the formation pressure is then able to lift the oil column and forces the fluid out of the wellbore. Gas may be injected continuously or intermittently, depending on the producing characteristics of the well and the arrangement of the gas-lift equipment.&lt;ref name=rigzone&gt;{{citation |title=How Does Artificial Lift Work? |url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=315&amp;c_id=4 |publisher=Rigzone|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gaslift.jpg|right|frame|Gas lift is a form of artificial lift where gas bubbles lift the oil from the well.]]

The amount of gas to be injected to maximize oil production varies based on well conditions and geometries.  Too much or too little injected gas will result in less than maximum production.  Generally, the optimal amount of injected gas is determined by well tests, where the rate of injection is varied and liquid production (oil and perhaps water) is measured.

Although the gas is recovered from the oil at a later separation stage, the process requires energy to drive a [[Gas compressor|compressor]] to raise the pressure of the gas to a level where it can be re-injected.

The gas-lift [[mandrel]] is a device installed in the tubing string of a gas-lift well onto which or into which a gas-lift [[valve]] is fitted. There are two common types of mandrels. In a conventional gas-lift mandrel, a gas-lift valve is installed as the tubing is placed in the well. Thus, to replace or repair the valve, the tubing string must be pulled. In the side-pocket [[mandrel]], however, the valve is installed and removed by [[Slickline|wireline]] while the mandrel is still in the well, eliminating the need to pull the tubing to repair or replace the valve.

A gas-lift valve is a device installed on (or in) a gas-lift mandrel, which in turn is put on the [[production tubing]] of a gas-lift well. Tubing and casing pressures cause the valve to open and close, thus allowing gas to be injected into the fluid in the tubing to cause the fluid to rise to the surface. In the lexicon of the industry, gas-lift mandrels are said to be "tubing retrievable" wherein they are deployed and retrieved attached to the production tubing. See gas-lift mandrel.

Gas lift operation can be optimized in different ways.The newest way is using risk-optimization which considers all aspects for gas lift allocation.

==History==
Air lift uses compressed air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It is also found in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a foot valve at the bottom of the string.  Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using compressed air, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift.  In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas lift valves that could be used for unloading in stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Gas lift |url = http://www.google.com/patents/US2909392 |accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline sinker bars to change the lift point.  Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R. King patented the pressurized bellows valve that is used today. In 1951 the sidepocket mandrel was developed for selectively positioning and retrieving gas lift valves with wireline.

'''Gillette''' is a [[brand]] of men's and women's [[safety razor]]s and other [[personal care]] products including shaving supplies, owned by the multi-national corporation [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G).

Based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, it was owned by '''The Gillette Company''', a supplier of products under various brands until that company merged into P&amp;G in 2005. The Gillette Company was founded by [[King C. Gillette]] in 1901 as a safety razor [[manufacturer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECuyAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Gillette, K.C.|title=The Gillette Blade|date=February 1918|volume= 1|number=4|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Colman M. Mockler Jr. as CEO from 1975–91, the company was the target of three [[takeover]] attempts, from [[Ronald Perelman]] and Coniston Partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/the-gillette-company Gale Directory of Company Histories: The Gillette Company], answers.com; accessed August 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2005, Procter &amp; Gamble finalized its merger with the Gillette Company.

The Gillette Company's assets were incorporated into a P&amp;G unit known internally as "Global Gillette". In July 2007, Global Gillette was dissolved and incorporated into Procter &amp; Gamble's other two main divisions, Procter &amp; Gamble Beauty and Procter &amp; Gamble Household Care. Gillette's brands and products were divided between the two accordingly.  The Gillette R&amp;D center in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Gillette South Boston Manufacturing Center (known as "Gillette World Shaving Headquarters"), still exist as functional working locations under the Procter &amp; Gamble-owned Gillette brand name.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gillette.com/about/history|title=Gillette history|website=gillette.com|access-date= August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillette's subsidiaries [[Braun (company)|Braun]] and [[Oral-B]], among others, have also been retained by P&amp;G.

In some languages, the brand has become the [[List of generic and genericized trademarks|genericized trademark]] for all razor blades, for example in [[Czech language|Czech]] (''žiletka''), [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (''žilett''), [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (''žilete''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (''žilét''), [[Polish language|Polish]] (''żyletka''), and [[Serbo-Croatian]] (''žilet'').

=== Double-edged safety razors ===
[[File:1930's Gillette Razor and Packaging.tif|thumb|Gillette razor and packaging, circa 1930's]]
The first [[safety razor]] using the new [[disposable]] blade went on sale in 1903.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gillette maintained a limited range of models of this new type razor until 1921 when the original Gillette patent expired.  In anticipation of the event, Gillette introduced a redesigned razor and offered it at a variety of prices in different cases and finishes, including the long running “aristocrat". Gillette continued to sell the original razor but instead of pricing it at $5, it was priced at $1, making a Gillette razor truly affordable to every man regardless of economic class. In 1932 the Gillette Blue Blade, so-named because it was dipped in blue lacquer, was introduced. It became one of the most recognizable blades in the world.  In 1934 the "twist to open" (TTO) design, was intuitiuted, which featured butterfly-like doors that made blade changing much easier than it had been, wherein the razor head had to be detached from the handle.

Razor handles continued to advance to allow consumer to achieve a closer shave. In 1947, the new (TTO) model, the ''"Super Speed"'', was introduced. This was updated in 1955, with different versions being produced to shave more closely — the degree of closeness being marked by the color of the handle tip.

In 1955, the first ''adjustable'' razor was produced. This allowed for an adjustment of the blade to increase the closeness of the shave. The model, in various versions, remained in production until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Gillette Adjustable Double Edge Razors|url=http://www.gilletteadjustable.com|publisher=GilletteAdjustable.com|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Vintage Gillette Safety Razor, Old Type Set, Made In USA, Circa 1920s (19844414006).jpg|thumb|"Old type" Gillette safety razor, made between 1921 and 1928]]

The Super Speed razor was again redesigned in 1966 and given a black resin coated metal handle. It remained in production until 1988. A companion model  the,''"Knack"'', with a longer plastic handle, was produced from 1966 to 1975. In Europe, the Knack was sold as "Slim Twist" and "G2000" from 1978 to 1988, a later version known as "G1000" was made in England and available until 1998. A modern version of the Tech, with a plastic thin handle, is still produced and sold in several countries under the names 7 O'clock, Gillette, Nacet, Minora, Rubie and Economica.

=== Discontinued products ===
* '''Techmatic''' was a single blade razor introduced in the mid-1960s. It featured a disposable cartridge with a razor band which was advanced by means of a lever. This exposed an unused portion the band and was the equivalent of five blades.
:*'''Adjustable Techmatic''' was a version of the Techmatic dating from 1970. The adjustable version featured user-selection of shave closeness on the cartridge. The adjustable version was interchangeable with the non-adjustable version. Both versions of the Techmatic and their cartridges have been discontinued.

== Criticism ==

The desire to release ever more expensive products, each claiming to be the ''best ever'', has led Gillette to make disputed claims for its products. In 2005, an [[injunction]] was brought by rival [[Wilkinson Sword]] which was granted by the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|Connecticut District Court]] which determined that Gillette's claims were both "unsubstantiated and inaccurate" and that the [[product demonstration]]s in Gillette's advertising were "greatly exaggerated" and "literally false". While advertising in the United States had to be rewritten, the court's ruling does not apply in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.co.uk/go/4097 "Truth in advertising"], Gizmag; accessed August 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G) shaving products have been under investigation by the UK [[Office of Fair Trading]] as part of an inquiry into alleged collusion between manufacturers and retailers in setting prices. According to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper, an industry insider claimed that the Fusion range of blades cost only £0.05 each to manufacture, yet sold for up to £2.43: a mark-up price of more than 4,750%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1191456/Sharp-practice-The-razor-heads-cost-just-5p-make-sell-2-43-each.html "Sharp practice? The razor heads that cost just 5p to make, but sell for £2.43 each"], ''[[Daily Mail (UK)|Daily Mail]]'', June 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillette was fined by [[Autorité de la concurrence]] in France in 2016 for [[price fixing]] on personal hygiene products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/court-appeal-price-fixing-fine-upheld-consumer-companies-gillette-loreal-procter-gamble-sc-johnson-18567-view-article.html |title=Huge price-fixing fine is upheld |publisher=The Connexion |date=28 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170209165431/http://www.connexionfrance.com/court-appeal-price-fixing-fine-upheld-consumer-companies-gillette-loreal-procter-gamble-sc-johnson-18567-view-article.html |archivedate=9 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Net worth ==
In 1999, Gillette, as a company, was worth US$43&amp;nbsp;billion, and it was estimated that the [[brand equity|brand value]] of Gillette was worth US$16&amp;nbsp;billion. This equated to 37% of the company's value, which was the same as [[DaimlerChrysler]], one of the world's largest car manufacturers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Pavitt.

[[File:Gillette Advertisement 1953.jpg|thumb|Gillette advertisement flyer, circa 1953]]

== Promotions ==
Gillette has a long history of promotions for its products, especially towards young men. Current promotions include sponsorship of sports events such as [[Major League Baseball]] (since the 1940s, when it was the only sponsor for [[World Series]] television broadcasts) and the [[England national rugby league team]], along with the [[Rugby League Four Nations]]. Gillette ships a razor to males in the United States around the time of their 18th birthday; as of 2010 Gillette has been sending the Fusion ProGlide. Athletes such as [[Roger Federer]], [[Tiger Woods]], [[Shoaib Malik]], [[Derek Jeter]], [[Thierry Henry]], [[Kenan Sofuoglu]], [[Park Ji-Sung]], [[Dr DisRespect]], [[Rahul Dravid]], and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] are sponsored by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.athletepromotions.com/gillette-endorsements.php|title=Gillette Endorsements - Athletes Who Are Endorsed by Gillette|last=Variant|website=www.athletepromotions.com|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were calls to boycott Gillette products given their association with [[Thierry Henry]], after a handball by Henry went undetected by referees and allowed France to knock Ireland out of [[France vs Republic of Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off|qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Marketing experts have highlighted "the curse of Gillette", given the mishaps that happen to sports stars associated with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/henry-woods-federer-the-curse-of-gillette-1830663.html|work=The Independent|location=London, UK|title=Henry, Woods, Federer: The curse of Gillette|date=November 29, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' featured a triple-blade razor in 1975, 23 years before the Mach3, with the slogan "The Triple-Trac. Because you'll believe anything". Not to be outdone, satirical newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' printed a mock-commentary by Gillette's president after Wilkinson/Schick introduced their Quattro razor in 2004, three years before the Fusion was introduced, entitled ''Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades,11056|title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades|author=James M.

== Canadian headquarters ==
Until the late 1980s, Gillette Canada's headquarters were in the [[Montreal]] suburb of [[Mont-Royal, Quebec]] until they moved west to another Montreal suburb in [[Kirkland, Quebec|Kirkland]]. The Kirkland offices were closed in 1999 and Gillette Canada moved to [[Mississauga, Ontario]], a [[Toronto]] suburb following the Gillette acquisition of [[Duracell]]. The Mississauga offices were closed in 2005-06 after [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] acquired Gillette, and Gillette's Canadian headquarters are located in downtown Toronto with parent Procter &amp; Gamble on Yonge St.

====Task 13====
The idea behind Task 13 was to push [[construction]] technology towards its limits to achieve the lowest possible total purchased [[List of energy resources|energy]] consumption. Task 13 was part of the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] ''Solar Heating and Cooling Programme'', to test the designs and techniques, and to monitor their performance.

On average, the houses were designed to require 44 [[kWh]]/m², 75% lower than the average 172 kWh/m² that would have been required had the houses been built to normal standards. (Analysis of 11 of the houses in use indicated that total savings made in practice was actually 60% [http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/cgi-bin/egwddf2/6969/screen.tcl/host=ddfcat&amp;host=ddf&amp;gattr1=parseOp&amp;v=1&amp;fe=10&amp;e11=indoor&amp;f11=all&amp;l11=and&amp;s1=sortkey&amp;page=28&amp;name=show_record&amp;norec=1&amp;ppage=30&amp;lposddfcat=7&amp;lposddf=24&amp;service=ddf%32&amp;context1=b&amp;lang=eng]).The 44 kWh/m² resulted from:
*[[Electricity]] – 18 kWh/m²
*[[Space heating]] – 14 kWh/m² 
*Water heating – 11 kWh/m² 
*Cooling – 1 kWh/m²

In addition there was an average solar contribution designed to average 37 kWh/m², from a combination of [[passive solar]] gains, [[active solar]], and [[photovoltaics]].

The buildings were constructed to be [[airtight]], [[superinsulation|superinsulated]] to roughly double normal standards, and to minimise [[thermal bridge]]s. [[Masonry]] and several [[timber frame]]d methods were represented, as well as newly designed [[steel]] strengthened [[polystyrene]] block walls. The Berlin "Zero Heating Energy House" included a {{conv|20|m3}} [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|seasonal thermal store]].[http://wire.ises.org/wire/doclibs/EuroSun96.nsf/id/F7DE064B758101BDC12565E6003737C3/$File/paper.pdf]

The homes in the programme were:
*Pleiade Row House, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium
*Brampton Advanced House, Canada
*Waterloo Region Green Home, Canada [http://wire0.ises.org/wire/doclibs/EuroSun96.nsf/5e0a56caccf2d7f8c1256927007e99bf/0a62da4514aed139c12565e600372fe6!OpenDocument]

*Urban Villa, Amstelveen, [[Netherlands]] [http://wire.ises.org/wire/doclibs/EuroSun96.nsf/5e0a56caccf2d7f8c1256927007e99bf/3d3df9e54fb54c10c12565e600373dad!OpenDocument]
*IEA Task 13 House, Hamar, Norway [http://www.ntnu.no/arkitekt/Bygningsteknologi/Prosjekter/IEA_lavenergi.html]
*Roskar Low Energy House, Sweden
*Duplex in Gelterkinden, Switzerland
*Exemplary House, Grand Canyon, United States
*Exemplary House, Yosemite, USA

Among the lessons learned were that:
*Airtightness was difficult to achieve
*Ventilation systems could suffer from noise and draft problems
*Care was needed to design out summer overheating
*Simple installations and systems were easier for the residents to understand

===International SHC conference===
In 2011, the IEA SHC Executive Committee announced an annual international conference on solar heating and cooling for buildings and industry. The first conference, SHC 2012 took place 9–11 July 2012 in [[San Francisco]],.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shc2012.org/ Website of the SHC 2012 conference]&lt;/ref&gt; SHC 2013 on 23–25 September 2013 in [[Freiburg]], Germany., SHC 2014 on 13–15 October in Beijing, China, SHC 2015 on 2–4 December in Istanbul, Turkey.  SHC 2013 and SHC 2015 were jointly with the European Solar Thermal Industry Federation (ESTIF), which had previously organized their own conference, ESTEC.

===Publications===
Apart from the reports and other publications of the research projects (Tasks), the Solar Heating and Cooling Programme publishes several cross-cutting documents, the most important one being the annual collector statistics ''Solar Heat Worldwide''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The SHC newsletter ''Solar Update'' is published twice per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-shc.org/newsletter/ IEA SHC newsletter ''Solar Update'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iLabs''' is a non-profit Milan-based organization pursuing multidisciplinary research on radical extension of human life-span. It was founded in 1977 by Gabriele Rossi and Antonella Canonico, who advocate the scenario known as “Semi-Immortality”, an elaborate vision of an era of quasi-immortal individuals (“intelligent systems”), that is philosophically linked to other instances of [[Transhumanism]] and futurists’ theories (such as [[Raymond Kurzweil]]’s). 

''iLabs'' led the development of [[Artificial Intelligence]] tools in Italy: the first relational database (1984), a self-monitoring and self-modifying application for production planning (1985), programs for [[data compression]] (1980), visual recognition (1983), [[cryptography]] (1987).

Starting with the publishing of ''Semi-Immortality''&lt;ref&gt;The English version of [http://www.semi-immortality.com/ Semi-Immortality] is freely available under a CC license.&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2007, ''iLabs'' has also been devoting considerable resources to further improve the impact of the research program and raise the general awareness towards semi-immortality and related topics, resulting in a series of books, articles, interviews and events popular in the Italian transhumanist community and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ilabs.it/ iLabs] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2011 ''iLabs'' hosted the [http://www.singularitysummit.it/defaultEN.asp iLabs Singularity Summit], featuring speeches from [[Raymond Kurzweil]] and [[Aubrey De Grey]].

==History==
''iLabs'' was founded in 1977 by two young Italian researchers, Antonella Canonico (psychologist) and Gabriele Rossi (computer scientist). The lab pursues a long-term research goal – the radical extension of human life-span  – through the completion of mid-term projects in several fields.

Throughout their history, ''iLabs'' has been pioneering the use of Artificial Intelligence and psychoneurophysiology (also known as [[Psychoneuroimmunology]]) in a variety of experimental and real-world settings.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the interview on [http://www.newtonline.it/ Newton] (August 2010). [http://www.semi-immortalita.it/public/newton_agosto.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the ''iLabs'' department of Artificial Intelligence created the first Italian data-base, ''Sistema I'', the first of a series of projects in [[computer science]]:

* in 1991, ''IAssist'', an [[expert system]] for customer care;
* in 1993, ''i5'', an expert system for insurance [[risk management]];
* in 1994, ''BBS-RCAuto'', the first real-time comparison of insurance policies across the all Italian market;
* in 1995, ''ZaZen'', an expert system for [[derivative market trading]];
* in 1996, ''iAssicur97'', a completely web-based software allowing natural language queries;
* in 2010, ''iMaat'', a digital universe based on a proprietary [[reversible cellular automaton]].&lt;ref&gt;Tutorial, papers and simulations
are available on the book [http://www.mmdr.it/provaEN.asp website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The department of Psychoneurophysiology was one of the first institution in the country promoting the field through innovative proposals in [[psychology]], [[stress management]] and [[bio-statistics]]:

* in 1996, the creation of a free web-service for psychological assistance;
* in 2002, ''Buddhamam'', a wellness center specialized in stress management;
* in 2008, ''iMed'', a statistical estimator of biological age from blood samples.

The department started focusing on [[psycho-oncology]] in 2000, with hundreds of subjects successfully treated since then.

==iLabs R&amp;D Structure==
''iLabs'' is privately owned and run since their foundation. ''iLabs'' started commercial spin-offs to apply their discoveries in business-oriented contexts; in turn, profits from commercial activities are used to fund the labs projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monsieur.it/sommario_scheda.aspx?id=788&amp;numero=86 Monsieur], April 2010. [http://www.semi-immortalita.it/public/monsieur.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main agenda is carried on, for the most part, by the departments of Artificial Intelligence and Psychoneurophysiology. However, ''iLabs'' relies on renowned experts to further widen the scope of the research program: professionals from mathematics, physics, logic, law, economics, medicine, biology have worked for the lab to address specific scientific challenges. The results of the projects are popularized through books, events, digital material, and spread in the academic community with peer-reviewed publications.

''iLabs'' [http://www.ilabs.it/Partners.asp partners] include [[Humanity+]], [[SENS Foundation]], [http://www.kurzweilai.net/ KurzweilAI], [http://www.scienceagainstaging.com/ENG/index_ENG.html Science for Life Extension], [http://www.estropico.org/  Estropico]. Four ''iLabs'' members are also in the Advisory Board of Lifeboat Foundation.

==Semi-Immortality and the Call for Players==
“Semi-immortality” is the title of the ''iLabs'' volume detailing the first thirty years of research: since it is doubtful that full immortality can be truly achieved by physical entities, the term “semi-immortality” was preferred as the main tag over ''iLabs'' vision.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.semi-immortality.com/ Semi-Immortality], Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two explicit assumptions underlying the labs work: first, only a truly global perspective may lead mankind to a radical extension of the life-span. According to the founders, technology and science will play a major role, but without addressing serious challenges in ethics and social theory all the attempts would be doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/nel_2030_luomo_arrivera_alla_semi-immortalita/21-06-2009/articolo-id=360348-page=0-comments=2 ''Il Giornale''], June 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, achieving the “''semi-immortality''” is a hard, articulated task requiring huge efforts and resources, as well as the finest minds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libero-news.it/ ''Libero''], July 18, 2008. [http://www.semi-immortalita.it/intervista_libero.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''iLabs'' published online the first version of their “[http://www.ilabs.it/public/CallForPlayers_1.0_ENG.pdf Call for Players]”, detailing the fields of study in their global agenda and explaining the labs’ structure and activities. The document’s explicit aim is to attract interested researchers to their projects.

According to the document, the ''semi-immortality'' picture is declined in three core areas of study and intervention:

# mathematics, physics, computer science
# biology, medicine, psychology
# philosophy, law, politics

=== Mathematics, physics, computer science ===
''iLabs'' projects in this area are based on the so-called ''Mathematics of the Models of Reference''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Mathematics of the Models of Reference'', 2010, College Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; The theory –created by Gabriele Rossi and developed with Francesco Berto and Jacopo Tagliabue – use cellular automata theory as the building block of computation and a perfect isomorphism between matter and information as the main “philosophical” assumption.

''iLabs'' digital universe satisfies universality (it is equivalent to a [[Turing Machine]]) and perfect reversibility (a desideratum if one wants to easily preserve various quantities and never lose information), and it comes embedded in a first-order theory allowing computable, qualitative statements on the universe evolution.

=== Biology, medicine, psychology ===
After two decades of studies on mind-body relations and psycho-oncology, ''iLabs'' started the development of a proprietary protocol for health monitoring, inspired by the success of [[evidence-based medicine]].

Collecting more than 80 million single blood tests, the Department of Psychoneurophysiology created ''iMed'', a statistical estimator of “biological age”. The algorithm takes as input a subject’s blood test and gives back a probability distribution; the statistics can then be used to compare the subject’s real age with her biological age, thereby yielding a quantitative assessment of the aging rate.

''iMed'' is now being expanded to include other simple and inexpensive test to improve the estimator accuracy: the hope is to develop an easy-to-use and reliable method to objectively assess the health status of any subject

=== Philosophy, law, politics ===
Given the attention ''iLabs'' has always been putting on ethical aspects of the technological developments, it is not surprising that many activities are focused on forecasting social changes and planning new scenarios for justice, economy, education.

Gabriele Rossi – a popular entrepreneur and innovator in the Italian insurance market – wrote dozens of articles in popular and specialized magazines on the impact of the technological revolution (and the life-span extension) on the economy and the society as a whole.

More recently, ''iLabs'' published ''[http://www.lalegge.net/defaultEN.asp The Law in the Society of Semi-Immortality]'': the essay argues for two radical changes in how justice and morality are currently conceived. Approaching the Singularity, artificial minds could be used to make the whole process of justice administration perfectly objective, progressively eliminating the human bias in legal judgments. Second, new values are likely to be promoted by the exponential technological trend: the book holds that, in the near future, the value of Truth is likely to have increasing importance in advanced societies.

The two claims are not uncontroversial, as several speakers and critics pointed out during the first presentations of the volume in the academic ([http://www.filosofia.lettere.unipd.it/analitica/sifa2010/ SIFA 2010]) and transhumanist community ([http://transvision2010.wordpress.com/ Transvision 2010]&lt;ref&gt;The video of the conference are available [http://telexlr8.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/transvision-2010-october-22-24-2010/ here].&lt;/ref&gt;). To promote an informed debate on ethical and social issues of the technological evolution, ''iLabs'' writes monthly contributions to Italian national magazines and blogs.

'''Ivan Pului''' (son of Iwan Pului {{lang-uk|Іва́н Пулю́й, син Па́вла Пулю́я}}; {{lang-de|Johann Puluj}}; 2 February 1845 – 31 January 1918) was a Ukrainian [[physicist]] and [[inventor]], who has been championed as an early developer of the use of [[X-ray]]s for [[medical imaging]]. His contributions were largely neglected until the end of the 20th century.

==Biography==

Ivan Pului graduated with honors from Theological Faculty of the [[University of Vienna]] (1869), later also from the Department of Philosophy (1872). In 1876 Pulyui finished his doctorate on internal friction in gases at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under supervision of [[August Kundt]]. Pului taught at the Navy academy in [[Fiume]] ([[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]) (1874–1876), [[University of Vienna]] (1874–1884) and the German part of the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|Higher Technical School in Prague]] (1884–1916). He served as the rector of the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|Higher Technical School in Prague]] (German part) in 1888–1889. Puluj also worked as a state adviser on electrical engineering for [[Bohemia]]n and [[Moravia]]n local governments.

In addition he completed a translation of the [[Bible]] into the [[Ukrainian language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tntu.edu.ua/?l=en&amp;p=university/puluj Ivan Pul'uj] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308025558/http://www.tntu.edu.ua/?l=en&amp;p=university%2Fpuluj |date= 8 March 2012 }}.

==Scientific contribution==
[[File:Ampoule Puluj-12.jpg|thumb|Cathode ray tube #12, Ivan Puluj design, ca 1896]]
[[File:Apparat nach Puluj.png|thumb|Puluj's apparatus for determining the mechanical equivalent of heat]]Puluj did heavy research into [[cathode ray]]s, publishing several papers about those rays between 1880 and 1882. In 1881 as a result of [[experiment]]s into what he called ''cold light'' Prof. Puluj developed the Puluj lamp;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205092029/http://www.uibk.ac.at/exphys/museum/en/details/tubes/puluj.html Puluj-Röhre, 1870]. uibk.ac.at&lt;/ref&gt; it was awarded the Silver Medal at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition in Paris, 1881. Throughout the world, it has become known as the "lamp of Puluj" and even it was [[mass production|mass-produced]] for some time.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Puluj expertimented with his new device and published his results in a [[scientific paper]], ''Luminous Electrical Matter and the Fourth State of Matter'' in  the ''Notes of the Austrian Imperial Academy of Sciences'' (1880–1883), but expressed his ideas in an obscure manner using obsolete terminology. Puluj did gain some recognition when the work was translated and published as a book by the [[Royal Society]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref name="Kulynyak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulynyak|first=Danylo |date=9 July 2000|title=Ivan Pului, the discoverer of X-rays|journal=Ukrainian Weekly|publisher=[[Ukrainian National Association|Ukrainian National Association, Inc]]|location=Parsippany, NJ|volume=68|issue=23|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Professor Puluj's finding were essentially X-rays, he did not recognise them as such at first, although he demonstrated X-ray pictures of a hand and fingers obtained by using his tube / lamp to his students. This credit later went on to [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]]. Once Roentgen visited Professor Puluj's laboratory and the latter presented one of his tubes to Roentgen. Roentgen went home and in his laboratory started to conduct experiments with Puluj's tube. Puluj also continued to do research with his X-ray tubes. On 8 February 1896, just 6 weeks after Röntgen presented his finding about X-Rays, Puluj published his own findings in the French journal [[La Nature]] in Paris. He presented photographs that exhibited the skeleton of a stillborn child. His work was republished in various European scientific journals. Puluj would release further images of human body parts, including an image of a fractured human hand, and would suggest possible medical usages of this new technology. The quality of Puluj's pictures was much better than that of Roentgen's. &lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{cite web

Puluj made many other discoveries as well. He is particularly noted{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} for inventing a device for determining the [[mechanical equivalent of heat]] that was exhibited at the ''[[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]]'', [[Paris]], 1878. Puluj also participated in opening of several [[power plant]]s in Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Czech language [http://ctn.cvut.cz/pt/download.php?id=169 biographical article]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in the journal of the [[Czech Technical University]] (2005, No 2, p. 39-40) mentions details and problems Puljui met during the construction of early power plants in the Czech lands.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quotes about Puluj ===
* "World history has never been just to certain individuals or certain nations. Small nations and their achievements are often neglected while the accomplishments of large nations are at times exaggerated."
** Slavko Bokshan, a [[Serbia]]n scientist who worked in the same department as Puluj and Roentgen

'''Jennifer Anne MacKinnon Sidey-Gibbons''' (born August 3, 1988) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian Astronaut Corps|astronaut]], engineer, and lecturer. She was selected by the [[Canadian Space Agency|Canadian Space Agency (CSA)]] as one of the two members of the 2017 CSA group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/bio-jennifer-sidey.asp|title=Biography of Jennifer Sidey|last=|first=|date=2017-07-01|website=Canadian Space Agency website|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life &amp; Education==
Dr. Jennifer (Jenni) Anne MacKinnon Sidey-Gibbons was born on August 3 1988 in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. 

Jenni's interest in science was supported by her mother, who often took her to museums and found role models from the fields of Science and Engineering. Her uncle, a civil engineer, would also involve her in design tasks. One of the aforementioned tasks included designing a baseball pitch that would drain effectively during rain storms or a passive water treatment plant.

Jenni holds an honours bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [[McGill University]]. Whilst she was at McGill, she carried out research in collaboration with the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA) and the National Research Council Flight Research Laboratory on flame propagation in microgravity. She then completed a Ph.D in 2015 in engineering at Jesus College, [[University of Cambridge]], where she focused on combustion under the supervision of  Professor Nondas Mastorakos.

==Career==
Prior to joining the Canadian Space Agency, Sidey-Gibbons worked as an assistant professor in internal combustion engines at the [[Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge|Department of Engineering]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. The focus of her research was flames, how they are used, and how to stop them from emitting harmful pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-diva.eng.cam.ac.uk/directory/jennysidey|title=Dr. Jenni A. M.  Sidey — CUED Division A|last=|first=|date=|website=www-diva.eng.cam.ac.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely, she worked on the development of low-emission combustors for gas turbine engines.

She also taught undergraduate and graduate students in the Energy, Fluid Mechanics and Turbomachinery Division on topics ranging from conventional and alternative energy production to introductory thermodynamics and flame physics.

Aside from these formal responsibilities, she also actively acted as a role model for young women considering technical careers in science-related fields. Most notably, she is the co-founder of the Cambridge chapter of [[Robogals]], a student-run international organization that aims to inspire and empower young women to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through fun and educational initiatives. Through this work, she has taught programming to over 3,000 young girls across the United Kingdom.

In 2016, she was awarded the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|Institution of Engineering and Technology's]] [[Young Woman Engineer of the Year Award]], as well as a [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] Young Engineer of the Year Award.

The '''''Journal of Environmental Engineering''''' is a [[wikt:Monthly|monthly]] [[engineering]] journal published by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. The journal covers [[interdisciplinary]] aspects of the research and practice in [[environmental engineering]], [[systems engineering]], and [[sanitation]]. Papers focus on design, development of engineering methods, management, governmental policies, and societal impacts of wastewater collection and treatment; the fate and transport of contaminants on watersheds, in surface waters, in groundwater, in soil, and in the atmosphere; environmental biology, microbiology, chemistry, fluid mechanics, and physical processes that control natural concentrations and dispersion of wastes in air, water, and soil; nonpoint-source pollution on watersheds, in streams, in groundwater, in lakes, and in estuaries and coastal areas; treatment, management, and control of hazardous wastes; control and monitoring of air pollution and acid deposition; airshed management; and design and management of solid waste facilities. A balanced contribution from consultants, practicing engineers, and researchers is sought on engineering solutions, and professional obligations and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt; Scimago [http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23355&amp;tip=sid] SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank 5 October 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lonza Group''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] multinational, [[chemical engineering|chemical]]s and [[biotechnology]] company, headquartered in [[Basel]], with major facilities in Europe, North America and South Asia. Lonza was established under that name in the late 19th-century in Switzerland. The company provides product development services to the [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biologic medical product|biologic]] industries, including [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[fine chemicals|fine]] and performance chemicals, custom manufacturing of [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[chemical synthesis]] capabilities, detection systems and services for the [[bioscience]] sector. &lt;!-- Looking to use the Company article structure proposed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Companies/Guidelines#Suggested_Structure in 2011. --&gt;

==History==
Lonza was founded in 1897 in the small Swiss town of [[Gampel]], situated in the canton of [[Valais]], taking its name from the nearby [[Lötschental|river]]. Initially the company produced electricity used to manufacture chemicals such as [[calcium carbide]]. Lonza moved to neighbouring [[Visp]] (where it retains a production site today) in 1909 and began manufacturing synthetic [[fertilizer|fertiliser]]s, and moves into [[vitamin]]s, [[acid]]s, [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]]s and additives followed. In 1974, the group merged with aluminium firm [[Alusuisse]], after which the group moved into the biotechnology sector. Lonza de-merged from the Alusuisse-Lonza Group in 1999 and listed on the [[SWX Swiss Exchange]].

The company expanded in the [[United States]] in 1969 and acquired smaller biopharmaceutical units in recent years. In 1996, Lonza acquired Celltech Biologics and began producing mammalian cell cultures and monoclonal antibodies. In October 2011, Lonza acquired American firm Arch Chemicals for $1.4 billion, as a result becoming the world's largest manufacturer of [[biocide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simonian|first=Haig|title=Lonza in $1.4bn acquisition of Arch Chemicals|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/87235890-ab98-11e0-8a64-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1dakMfQnQ|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2016, the group announced its intention to acquire InterHealth Nutraceuticals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Lonza Extends Its Reach in the Healthcare Continuum with Acquisition of InterHealth Nutraceuticals|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Lonza|url=https://www.lonza.com/about-lonza/media-center/news/Tensid/2016-08-15-05-00-English.aspx|access-date=2018-04-15}}{{Self-published source|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leader in research, development, manufacture and marketing of value-added nutritional ingredients for use in dietary supplements. The acquisition of the US based company will be done at a value of up to {{US$|300 million}}. In December 2016, the company announced it would acquire [[Capsugel]] for {{US$|5.5 billion}}, from private equity firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/lonza-buys-capsugel-for-55b-cash/81253556|title=Lonza Buys Capsugel for $5.5B Cash|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|first=|date=15 December 2016|work=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News|access-date=2018-04-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonza is involved in the manufacturing of [[biologics]] with several pharmaceutical companies. Lonza entered into a partnership with [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]] in 2009 to develop and manufacture biosimilars. In 2010, they made a deal with [[GlaxoSmithKline]] to manufacture therapeutic [[monoclonal antibodies]]. In 2014, Lonza entered into an agreement with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] to manufacture two biologic drugs. Lonza also manufactures [[Imbruvica]] for [[Pharmacyclics]] and [[Mydicar]] for [[Celladon]]. In 2015, Lonza contracted with [[Alexion]] to construct a new facility dedicated to Alexion manufacturing. In 2017, Lonza and [[Sanofi]] partnered to construct a new facility for production of biologics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonza.com/about-lonza/company-profile/company-history.aspx|title=Company History|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|first=|date=&lt;!--no source date; copyright 2018--&gt;|website=Company Profile|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}{{Self-published source|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21131">A '''metadyne''' is a [[direct current]] electrical machine with two pairs of [[Brush (electric)|brushes]]. It can be used as an [[amplifier]] or [[rotary transformer]].  It is similar to a [[third brush dynamo]] but has additional regulator or "variator" windings. It is also similar to an [[amplidyne]] except that the latter has a compensating winding which fully counteracts the effect of the flux produced by the load [[Electric current|current]]. The technical description is "a cross-field direct current machine designed to utilize [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] reaction". A metadyne can convert a constant-[[voltage]] input into a constant-current, variable-voltage output.

==History==
The word ''metadyne'' is derived from the Greek words for conversion of power.&lt;ref name=bruce165/&gt; While the name is believed to have been coined by Joseph Maximus Pestarini ([[Italian language]] Giuseppe Massimo Pestarini) in a paper which he submitted to the [[Montefiore Institute|Montefiore]] International Contest at [[Liège (city)|Liège]], [[Belgium]] in 1928, the type of machine which it described had been known since the 1880s. The first known British [[patent]] for a direct-current, cross-field generator was obtained by A. I. Gravier of Paris in 1882, and two further patents were obtained by E. Rosenberg in 1904 and 1907.&lt;ref name=tustin163&gt;{{harvnb |Tustin |1952 |p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg later became the chief electrical engineer for [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], and his machine produced a cross field by applying a short-circuit to an additional set of brushes.&lt;ref name=dummelow156&gt;{{harvnb|Dummelow |1949 |p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Osnos looked at the practical arrangements for several such machines in 1907,&lt;ref name=bennett10&gt;{{harvnb |Bennett |1993 |p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year, Felton and Guilleaume obtained a British patent, number 26,607, which described auxiliary windings, armature windings and multiple commutators, although all in fairly general terms. He also indicated that they could be used to transform a constant voltage into a constant current.&lt;ref name=tustin163/&gt; Other patents were obtained prior to 1910 by [[Mather &amp; Platt]], [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|Brown Boverei]] and [[Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. Ltd.|Bruce Peebles]].&lt;ref name=tustin300&gt;{{harvnb |Tustin |1952 |p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spare Carbon Brushes for a Metadyne machine.jpg|thumbnail|Spare Metadyne carbon brushes. They are individually wrapped and, together with labels, sealed in plastic. Total length including the connecting wire and ring is 115 mm. The thickness of the carbon slab is 8 mm.]]
Pestarini worked on developing the theory of such machines between 1922 and 1930, although he concentrated on their static characteristics, rather than their dynamic characteristics.&lt;ref name=bennett10/&gt; He contributed three papers on the subject to ''Revue Générale de l'Electricité'' in 1930,&lt;ref name=tustin300/&gt; which included some practical applications. The main one was the use of the constant-current output for the control of traction motors on electric vehicles and the operation of cranes, areas in which he had some practical experience, following trials in conjunction with the [[Alstom|Alsthom]] Company in France.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=163-164}} In 1930, he made a trip to Britain, and the Metropolitan-Vickers company took his ideas and developed a working system.&lt;ref name=bennett10/&gt; Unlike Rosenberg's solution, Pestarini, who later became a Professor at the Institute Electrotechnico Nazionale Galileo Ferraris in [[Turin]], connected the additional brushes to an external supply to produce a transformer metadyne.&lt;ref name=dummelow156/&gt; The machine worked as a voltage-to-current amplifier because the flux generated by the current to the load opposed the flux in the control circuit.&lt;ref name=bennett10/&gt; Development work at Metropolitan-Vickers in the 1930s was led by [[Arnold Tustin]], and the company held the British patents for the Metadyne.&lt;ref name=bennett131&gt;{{harvnb |Bennett |1993 |p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pestarini also visited the United States in 1930, although there is no record of the system being used there. The [[General Electric]] engineers, led by [[Ernst Alexanderson]], were interested, but modified the design by the addition of a compensating winding, which counteracted the effect of the flux produced by the load current. This turned the machine from a voltage-to-current amplifier into a voltage-to-voltage amplifier, and they called the new variant an [[Amplidyne]]. The development costs were largely funded by US naval contracts for the development of vertical stabilisers, which were used to improve the aiming and firing of guns on ships.&lt;ref name=bennett10/&gt; During the same period, the Macfarlane Engineering Company, who were based in Glasgow, developed a variant of the cross field machine quite independently, which they named the ''Magnicon''.&lt;ref name=tustin164&gt;{{harvnb |Tustin |1952 |p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pestarini filed a patent on the metadyne machine in France on 14 January 1932, and submitted it to the United States Patent Office at the end of the year, on 23 December. The US patent was granted on 30 January 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1945447?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Patent US1945447 - Control of Electric Motors |publisher=United States Patent Office |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He submitted a second US patent for an improved machine in November 1946, which was granted on 10 June 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2599936?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Patent US1945447 - Metadyne Motor |publisher=United States Patent Office |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Metadyne.jpg|thumb |right |300px |Three arrangements of a metadyne cross-field DC machine, and the construction of Macfarlane's Magnicon]]
The diagram shows three arrangements of a metadyne machine. In all cases, compensation windings have been omitted for clarity. The first arrangement represents a one-cycle cross-field machine. In a normal DC machine, the effect of the excitation current generates a flux (A1), which in turn generates a quadrature flux which is at right angles to the exciting flux. By wiring the quadrature brushes together, current is produced in the armature, and the flux that this produces (A2) is again at right angles to the quadrature axis, resulting in an armature reaction which is directly opposed to the original excitation. This feature is fundamental to the machine, and does not depend on its direction of rotation. When the armature reaction is partially compensated by a compensation winding, the uncompensated portion of the armature reaction acts in this way.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |p=179}} As the output current rises, it suppresses the effect of the excitation, until it reaches a state where there is just enough excitation to maintain the current. Any further increase would eliminate the flux which sustains its operation, and the current is maintained irrespective of the resistance of the load or the back emf produced by it. The machine thus acts as a constant-current generator, where the current is proportional to the excitation.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=180-181}}

The second diagram shows a machine with no excitation winding, but instead, a constant voltage is connected to the quadrature brushes. This produces a flux similar to the one produced by the rotation of the armature in the excitation flux in the first example. The operation of the machine is therefore very similar, with the output current rising until the flux it produces almost counteracts the flux generated by the applied voltage. Tustin has shown that the input and output power are the same, and so the machine transforms the constant-voltage input into a constant-current output. As with the metadyne generator, the Metadyne transformer can be partially compensated, and will continue to operate as a constant-current device until the compensation exceeds 97 per cent.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=181–182}}

The third diagram shows a metadyne connected to two separate motors, and this arrangement was often used for the control of traction motors on electric trains. Connecting them in this way reduces the effective loading on the Metadyne, and enables a smaller machine to be installed. The Metadyne acts as a "positive or negative booster". If Vcc is the supply voltage, and V&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; is the output voltage of the Metadyne, then the total voltage across the load can vary from 0 to 2·Vcc, as V&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; varies between −Vcc and +Vcc. Although the system is prone to the currents in the two halves of the load becoming unbalanced, this can be corrected by the provision of extra series windings, which act like an additional circuit resistance.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=182-183}}

===Rosenberg generator===
The Rosenberg generator is very similar to the Metadyne generator, both in its construction and its electrical connection. It generally does not have a compensation winding, so that the whole of the armature reaction opposes the initial excitation. Parts of the magnetic circuit are normally not laminated, which creates delays between excitations and fluxes, but the machines are used in applications where a quick response is not essential. Their predominant use has been in trains, where they are axle-driven, and used to provide lighting and the charging of batteries.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=183–184}} An axle-driven generator is subject to variable speeds and changes in the direction of rotation, but the characteristics of the machine allow it to produce useful energy down to very low speeds. At slow speeds, the output voltage increases with the square of the speed, but the magnetic circuit soon becomes saturated, resulting in much smaller increases as the speed increases. When used in circuits which include batteries charged from the output, a rectifier or reverse-current cut-out is normally required to prevent discharge of the batteries through the generator at very low speeds, or when the train stops.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=185–186}}

===Magnicon===
The Magnicon, developed by Macfarlane's in Scotland, is similar to the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to as a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |p=187}} The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90&amp;nbsp;degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The [[magnetomotive force]] (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=189–190}} Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.{{sfn |Tustin |1952 |pp=190–191}}

==Uses==
Metadynes have been used to control the aiming of [[Artillery|large guns]] and for speed control in [[Electric multiple unit|electric trains]], in particular the [[London Underground O and P Stock]]. They have been superseded by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices.

===Traction control===
[[File:CP &amp; R at Upminster.jpg|thumb|right| A London Underground CP train (in red) at Upminster. They were originally fitted with Metadyne controls and were the first electric multiple units to use regenerative braking.]]
In the early 1930s, the London Underground were aware of the development of the metadyne equipment taking place at Metropolitan-Vickers, and the potential for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which it provided. Before committing to an untried system, they therefore built a test train, by converting six cars originally built between 1904 and 1907 for the [[Metropolitan Railway]]. The work was carried out at [[Acton Works]] in 1934. Since a single metadyne unit could be used to control four motors, and each motor car had two motors, they were formed into two-car units, with a driving cab at the outer ends. By coupling the units together, trials of a two-car, four-car and six-car train could be carried out. The metadyne unit weighed about 3 tons, and consisted of three rotating machines, an exciter, a regulator and the actual metadyne machine, which were linked together mechanically. Electrically, the traction supply was fed into the machine, and the output fed the motors, without the need for starting resistances.&lt;ref name=bruce134&gt;{{harvnb |Bruce |1970 |pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test train ran through much of 1935 and 1936, and was tried on nearly all of the electrified tracks on the Metropolitan line and the [[District line]]. Once the concept had been proved to be reliable, the train was also used in passenger service. Besides the regenerative braking, the acceleration was found to be particularly smooth. When the decision was taken to proceed with the new system on the O and P stock, the test train was dismantled, and the equipment was fitted to three [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery locomotives]]&lt;ref name=bruce134/&gt; built by the [[Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]], which were part of a batch of nine vehicles supplied between 1936 and 1938. The equipment was particularly suitable for battery locomotives, as the lack of starting resistances reduced the amount of power wasted when starting and stopping frequently. At slow speeds, conventional control systems would often overheat, but the metadyne-equipped locomotives could pull trains weighing 100&amp;nbsp;tons for long distances at speeds as low as {{convert|3|mph|kph|abbr=on}} without problems. However, the complexity of the equipment, and the difficulty of maintaining the metadyne machine, resulted in the locomotives not being used sufficiently, and they were withdrawn for scrapping in 1977.&lt;ref name=bruce30&gt;{{harvnb |Bruce |1987 |p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main production run of O Stock consisted of 116 motor cars, which were formed into 58 two-car units. Trials began with a four-car formation on the District line between [[High Street Kensington tube station|High Street Kensington]] and [[Putney Bridge tube station|Putney Bridge]] in September 1937, and a six-car formation began working on the [[Hammersmith &amp; City line|Hammersmith line]] in January 1938. There were some technical problems, caused by the demands put on the power supply system when a train of six motor cars started, and the amount of power that such a train attempted to return to the system when the regenerative brakes were used. This was partially mitigated by ordering a further 58 trailer cars, and converting each two-car unit into a three-car unit, by inserting a trailer car into the formation. A batch of P Stock was then ordered, to replace the trains on the Metropolitan line. Although O and P Stock units could be coupled together, the metadyne units in particular were not the same, and could not be interchanged between the builds. By the early 1950s, this was a serious disadvantage, when a series of failures occurred, which required extensive repairs. A decision was taken to remove the equipment and replace it with a Pneumatic Cam Motor (PCM) system, using spare controllers from the 1938 tube stock. The first converted train entered service on 31 March 1955, and the stock was redesignated at CO/CP Stock, since it contained cars from both batches. All of the metadyne equipment was subsequently replaced.{{sfn |Bruce |1970 |pp=135-136}}

Despite the shortcomings which led to its demise, the metadyne system as introduced in 1936 on the O Stock trains was the first in the world to provide regenerative braking on an electric multiple unit. Acceleration was smoother than on a train which switched starting resistances, and when braking the metadyne unit returned power to the tracks, which could be used by other trains if needed. However, conditions were not always ideal, and the substations were not really designed to cope with regeneration, which meant that often the train switched to [[Dynamic braking#Rheostatic braking|rheostatic braking]], where the power was dissipated in a resistance bank. The weight of the equipment was also a serious drawback.&lt;ref name=bruce165&gt;{{harvnb |Bruce |1970 |p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun control===
In the period immediately before the [[Second World War]], there was increasing interest in power-operated gun controls, although military authorities were nervous of introducing a complex system which would have to be maintained in the field. However, with the increasing speed of aircraft, the need to enable searchlights, anti-aircraft guns and naval guns to move ever faster to track their movement meant the some form of powered control was essential. Engineers were faced with the problem of making a heavy piece of equipment, such as a gun on its mounting carriage, track an input signal in a smooth and accurate fashion, with very little lag between changes in the input and the actual position of the gun mount. The gun needed to be aimed at the target at all times, and moving at the correct velocity to remain so.{{sfn |Bennett |1993 |pp=130–131}}

A human operator anticipates errors, and can also compensate for known lags in the operation of the system. Mimicking of this behaviour had been achieved for electronic signals and low-power electromechanical systems, but gun control was on a completely different scale, with machinery weighing tons and having significant inertia needing to move at velocities of up to 30 degrees per second, and accelerations of 10 degrees per second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1937, the [[Admiralty]] had placed an order with [[Metropolitan Vickers]] for a control system for an eight-barrel [[Pom-Pom gun]]. Pestarini had developed a similar system for the Italian navy. The original design used a single Metadyne to supply a constant current to the armatures of motors mounted on several guns. Each was then controlled by manually adjusting the field current. Tustin, who did most of the design work, found that the system had a large time constant, due to the inductance of the field windings. In order to improve its response, he supplied the field windings with a constant current, and used a partially compensated Metadyne to control the armature current of each motor. Tustin compared [[Ward Leonard control]] systems, Metadynes and Amplidynes, and accepted that each had its merits, but favoured the Metadyne, of which he had several years experience from their use in traction control.&lt;ref name=bennett131/&gt;

==History==
Mobile Phone Throwing became a hit when first arranged in year 2000 in Savonlinna, Finland. Organizer was a translation and interpretation company Fennolingua. Its multi-national personnel and many athletics threw away their frustrations along with the mobile phones. Local recycling centers were a partner and they collected all the toxic waste.
The Mobile Phone Throwing World Championships has been arranged every year since the year 2000 in Savonlinna in late August. All the international interest on the Championships has now led to official national championships all over Europe. The First national championships were organized in Trondheim, Norway in June 2004. The first prize was a trip to the World Championships to Savonlinna, Finland. In February 2005 there was the first winter championships in Stoos, Switzerland. The winners from both Original and Freestyle categories won trips to the World Championships to Savonlinna. The first German championships were arranged in June 2005 in Northern Germany. People could also buy a new mobile phone at the Championships. The winner gets a new mobile phone. Throwers and international media were immediately very interested and every year the Championships gathered a wide range of nationalities to Savonlinna to throw the cell phones.

[[Lawrence University]] has hosted a [[Rotary dial|Rotary Phone]] Throw in 2005, 2006, and 2007. This competition has similar rules to the mobile phone throw, yet uses rotary phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thor.lawrence.edu/calendar/main.php?view=event&amp;eventid=1178826571903 |title=May 30, 2007&amp;nbsp;– Phone throw |publisher=Lawrence University Calendar |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling==
Nokia, which is one of the leading cell phone giants in the world, has its headquarters in Finland. Lead organizer Christine Land was inspired to create the event back in 2000. Back in the first event, a leading insurance company in Finland sponsored the event for recycling purposes. According to insurance companies, there are a lot of cell phones lying in thousands of lakes all around Finland. Many phones are returned to their mobile carrier stores in return for a new one; however, others are discarded instead of being recycled and they become a toxic waste. The battery in the cell phone can ultimately become a toxic waste and it must be taken care of properly.

Millions of phones are replaced all over the world in favor for new ones. About 70 percent of overall toxic in landfills is made up by electronic scraps. Recycling these electronics hasn’t been made a huge priority in a lot of places all over the world. Many of the cell phones that we currently use contain products like plastic and metal that can be recycled on a daily basis. These being recycled can easily save energy. When these metals and plastics are place into landfills, they can pollute the air and contaminate some of our drinking water.

Lead, which comes in the coating of the cell phone, is a toxic element that can result in serious health effects when in high levels. When [[electronic waste]] is burned, it can produce toxic fumes that are very dangerous. Mobile phone recycling is a very important issue that insurance companies that sponsor the Mobile Phone Throwing Championships are very aware of.

==World and national championships==
The '''Mobile Phone Throwing World Championships''' have been held annually since 2000 in [[Savonlinna]], [[Finland]]. The first national competition was held in [[Trondheim]], Norway, in June 2004, with several other countries across Europe also staging their own events. The first winter championships were held in [[Stoos]], Switzerland, in February 2005. Commonly, the prize for first place in a national event is entry to the world championships, and the grand prize for winning the world championship is a new mobile phone. Many events are supported by mobile phone [[recycling]] organizations and promote the recycling of the phones.&lt;ref name="stoori" /&gt;

In the UK, the championships are held every August and organized by 8th Day UK Ltd. The first event, in 2005, was held at Richmond Golf Driving Range, and the 2006 event at [[Tooting Bec|Tooting Bec Athletics Track]] in [[London]]. [[ActionAid Recycling]] partnered the event to raise awareness for mobile phone recycling and raised money from donated phones for the first two years, but due to the involvement of a casino (Golden Palace) in the 2007 event and the associations this would have in relation to charity, are no longer involved.

In 2007, the UK event was held at Old Hamptonians Rugby Club on 12 August, with throws recorded from 3.70&amp;nbsp;m to 95.83&amp;nbsp;m, a new unofficial world record. The men's winner was Chris Hughff, and the ladies' winner was Jan Singleton, both successfully defending their 2006 titles. There were also throws recorded by a penguin and a gorilla{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, prompting a new category&amp;nbsp;— fancy dress&amp;nbsp;– to be incorporated for 2008.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The 2008 competition was held at the same location, with Jan Singleton defending her title and Jeremy Gallop claiming the men's title. Madeleine James set a new benchmark for the Under 3 Category of 1.57&amp;nbsp;m.

The 2007 world championships were in Savonlinna as usual. The winner of the men's freestyle event, Taco Cohen of the Netherlands, won for a novel performance that incorporated [[juggling]] and [[acrobatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Mobile phone throwing turns artistic in Finland | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1041_3-6204512.html | date=25 August 2007 | publisher=CNET | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120726190243/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1041_3-6204512.html | archivedate=26 July 2012 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Juggling, Lobbing at the 8th Annual Mobile Phone Throwing World Championships | author=Michael Santo | url=http://www.realtechnews.com/2007/08/27/juggling-lobbing-at-the-8th-annual-mobile-phone-throwing-world-championships/ | publisher=RealTechNews | date=August 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thousand nine saw the UK event move to Battersea Park Athletics stadium, with Jeremy Gallop (89.10&amp;nbsp;m) defending his title and Julia Geene (33.40&amp;nbsp;m) winning the ladies' event. Peter Yates set a new Vets record of 75.20&amp;nbsp;m, and Oliver James set an Under 2 record of 2.05&amp;nbsp;m. The fancy dress event was won by Morph, who threw 54.73&amp;nbsp;m. The event was run alongside the [[Sumo Suit Athletics]] World Championships.

In 2010, the event was again held together with the [[Sumo Suit Athletics]] World Championships in Battersea Park Athletics track. Both Jeremy Gallop and Julia Geens successfully defended their titles, with throws of 88.51&amp;nbsp;m and 32.00&amp;nbsp;m respectively. In the men's event, there was a 1st prize of an Xbox 360 sponsored by BuyMobilePhones.net in an effort to raise awareness about mobile recycling.

The World event for 2010 was to be held on 21 August 2010 but for unknown reasons (as yet), was canceled.

On August 24, 2013, the '''World Mobile Phone Throwing Championships''' took place in Savonlinna, Finland. Over eighty people from six different countries participated in the event that has grown immensely since its conception in 2000. The 2013 Champion for the Men’s Traditional Division, Riku Haverinen, cast his 220-gram mobile device a staggering 97.7 meters (the length of a full soccer field.)  This is five meters short of the World record of 102.68&amp;nbsp;m set in 2012 by Chris Hughff from Great Britain. Coming in second in the Men’s Traditional Division was Ikka Aaltonen with 87.88&amp;nbsp;m, followed by Otto Sammalisto with a valiant effort of 86.09&amp;nbsp;m. These three top performers, all from Finland, represented the host country in the 2013 Championships. In the Women’s Traditional Division, the champion Asa Lundgren, threw her mobile device 40.41&amp;nbsp;m, impressive as it was only after a few times practicing. The Women’s Traditional Division was much closer than the Men’s, with second place with a score of 39.88&amp;nbsp;m from Louise Van De Ginste, Belgian winner from earlier in the summer of 2013. Van De Ginste was followed by third-place finisher Tanja Pakarinen, who launched a mobile device 36.69&amp;nbsp;m. Again the Finns dominated the competition with two of the top three finishers being from Finland. The Freestyle division was won by Erika Vilpponen, with a stellar performance with a circus bike paired with a throw of the mobile device backwards over the shoulder. It was a clear victory for Erika according to the panel of judges. After this year’s championships, new divisions are being looked at for future championships.

'''Other tournaments'''

The Spanish championships are held in Tarragona, Catalonia, during the celebrations of Carnival in February or March. The 2009 tournament was held on Sunday, 22 February in the Francoli Park, Tarragona.

===United States===
On August 1, 2008, the United States held its first national championship in [[South Hadley]], [[Massachusetts]], at Buttery Brook Park, sponsored by Family Wireless. The United States event has also dedicated itself to recycling cellular phones.

There was a second cell phone throwing contest held in the United States on July 5, 2009, at Szot Park in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]], Massachusetts. It was sponsored by Family Wireless.

Men’s record was beaten later in Savonlinna but the women’s record from Czech Republic is still the best one in its category. It was set by Tereza Kopicová who threw a cell phone 60.24 meters.

===Liechtenstein===
The first National Championships for Liechtenstein were held on 29 May 2010 in the town Ruggell.&lt;ref name="2010 LIE Info Page"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handyweitwurf.li/CFDOCS/cmsout/admin/index.cfm?GroupID=171&amp;MandID=5&amp;meID=2421&amp; |title=Informationen Meisterschaft 2010 |publisher=Handyweitwurf.li |language=German |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were completed in accordance with the Finnish rules with the same four categories.

Johannes Heeb won in the men's category with a throw of 74.2&amp;nbsp;m, and the women's category was won by Stephanie Parusel, throwing 48.5&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="2010 LIE News Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?id=9034&amp;source=lv&amp;ressort=home |title=Landesmeister im Handyweitwurf gekürt |language=German |work=Liechtensteiner Vaterland |date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Manuel Hug won the juniors with a throw of 55.9&amp;nbsp;m, while the team category was won by Team "Schulzentrum Unterland" with 196&amp;nbsp;m.
The current Swiss national record holder, Dino Roguljic, made a "celebrity" appearance and managed to throw 66.2&amp;nbsp;m.

===Freestyle===
Freestyle phone throwing is an event held in which contestants enter a mat that is around 1" thick to soften the impact in case a phone is dropped. Players begin performing a series of tricks that include various flips, spins, high throws, etc. If one drops one's mobile phone, he or she is automatically out, and judges take his score from that point. One minute is given for a total "run time", and after the minute is up, if one has not dropped one's phone, he or she gets a score from 1 to 100. Phone classes include standard phones, which are free, to $50 phones with either no moving device such as slide or flip open, or with the standard flip open style. Second class is the "Advanced" class, which includes phones with full keyboards, slide movement devices, side-kick flip devices, or touch screens. This class is based on the fact that if the phone is dropped, there is more of a consequence since the phones are so elaborate and/or expensive.

===Belgium===
The first National Championships for Belgium were held in July 2006 in Ghent. Since 2010 JIM Mobile is organizing the event. Last year's champion had a throw of 62.70&amp;nbsp;m. The Belgian Champion of 2011 had a throw of 63.94&amp;nbsp;m. More info can be found at [http://www.bkgsmwerpen.be www.bkgsmwerpen.be] or [http://www.jimmobile.be www.jimmobile.be].

In  [[consumer electronics]], the '''MultiMediaCard''' ('''MMC''') is a [[memory card | memory-card]] standard used for [[solid-state storage]]. Unveiled in 1997 by  [[SanDisk]] and [[Siemens AG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/flash-removable-storage-ssd-drive,3626-3.html | website= TomsHardware.com | title= Upgrading And Repairing PCs 21st Edition | publisher= Que Publishing | author= Scott Mueller | isbn= 978-0789750006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MMC is based on a surface-contact low pin-count serial interface using a single memory stack substrate assembly, and is therefore much smaller than earlier systems based on high pin-count parallel interfaces using traditional surface-mount assembly such as [[CompactFlash]]. Both products were initially introduced using SanDisk NOR-based [[flash memory | flash]] technology. MMC is about the size of a postage stamp: 24&amp;nbsp;mm × 32&amp;nbsp;mm × 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm.  MMC originally used a 1-[[bit]] [[serial interface]], but newer versions{{when?|date=March 2018}} of the specification allow transfers of 4 or 8 bits at a time. MMC can be used in many devices that can use [[Secure Digital]] (SD) cards.

Typically, an MMC operates as a storage medium for a portable device, in a form that can easily be removed for access by a [[Personal computer|PC]]. For example, a [[digital camera]] would use an MMC  for storing image files. Via an MMC reader (typically a small box that connects via [[USB]] or some other serial connection, although some can be found integrated into the computer itself), a user could transfer pictures taken with the digital camera to his or her computer. Modern computers, both laptops and desktops, often have SD slots, which can additionally read MMCs if the operating system drivers can.

MMCs are available in sizes up to and including 512&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]]. They are used in almost every context in which [[memory card]]s are used, like [[mobile phone| cellular phone]]s, digital audio players, digital cameras and [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s. Since the introduction of SD cards, few companies build MMC slots into their devices (an exception is some mobile devices like the [[Nokia 9300]] communicator in 2004, where the smaller size of the MMC is a benefit), but the slightly thinner, pin-compatible MMCs can be used in almost any device that can use SD cards if the software/firmware on the device is capable.

While few companies build MMC slots into devices {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} (SD cards are more common), the embedded MMC (eMMC) is still widely used in consumer electronics as a primary means of integrated storage in portable devices. It provides a low-cost flash-memory system with a built-in controller that can reside inside an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] phone or in a low-cost PC and can appear to its host as a bootable device, in lieu of a more expensive form of solid-state storage, such as a traditional [[solid-state drive]].

This technology is a standard available to any [[company (law)|company]] wanting to develop products based on it. There is no royalty charged for devices which host an MMC. A membership with the MMC Association must be purchased in order to manufacture the cards themselves.

As of July 2009, the specifications version 4.4 (dated March 2009) can be requested from the MMCA, and after registering with MMCA, can be downloaded free of charge. Older versions of the standard, as well as some optional enhancements to the standard such as MiCard and SecureMMC, must be purchased separately.

A highly detailed version is available on-line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/141187/SAMSUNG/MC2GH512NMCA-2SA00/305/1/MC2GH512NMCA-2SA00.html |title=MC2GH512NMCA-2SA00 datasheet(1/102 Pages) SAMSUNG &amp;#124; SAMSUNG MultiMediaCard |website=Html.AllDatasheet.com |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contains essential information for writing an MMC driver.

As of 23 September 2008, the MMCA group has [https://web.archive.org/web/20080302013503/http://www.mmca.org/compliance/buy_spec/mmc_spec_v4_3/ turned over] all specifications to the [http://www.jedec.org JEDEC organization] including embedded MMC (e-MMC) and miCARD assets. [[JEDEC]] is an organization devoted to standards for the solid-state industry.

As of February 2015, the latest specifications version 5.1 can be requested from JEDEC, and after registering with JEDEC, can be downloaded free-of-charge. Older versions of the standard, as well as some optional enhancements to the standard such as MiCard and SecureMMC, must be purchased separately.

==Variants==

===RS-MMC===
In 2004, the '''Reduced-Size MultiMediaCard''' ('''RS-MMC''') was introduced as a smaller form factor of the MMC, about half the size: 24&amp;nbsp;mm × 18&amp;nbsp;mm × 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm.  The RS-MMC uses a simple mechanical adapter to elongate the card so it can be used in any MMC (or SD) slot.  RS-MMCs are currently available in sizes up to and including 2&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]].

The modern continuation of an RS-MMC is commonly known as '''MiniDrive''' ('''MD-MMC'''). A MiniDrive is generally a [[microSD]] card adapter in the RS-MMC form factor. This allows a user to take advantage of the wider range of modern MMCs available&lt;ref&gt;TheMiniDrive.com, http://www.TheMiniDrive.com. Extracted 23 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; to exceed the historic 2&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] limitations of older chip technology.

Implementations of RS-MMCs include [[Nokia]] and [[Siemens cellular telephones|Siemens]], who used RS-MMC in their [[Series 60]] [[Symbian]] [[smartphone]]s, the [[Nokia 770 Internet Tablet]], and generations 65 and 75 (Siemens). However, since 2006 all of Nokia's new devices with card slots have used [[miniSD]] or [[microSD]] cards, with the company dropping support for the MMC standard in its products. Siemens exited the mobile phone business completely in 2006. Siemens continue to use MMC for some [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]] storage leveraging MD-MMC advances.

===DV-MMC===
The Dual-Voltage MultimediaCard ('''DV-MMC''') is one of the first acceptable changes in MMC was the introduction of dual-voltage cards that can operate at 1.8&amp;nbsp;V in addition to 3.3&amp;nbsp;V. Running at lower voltages reduces the card's energy consumption, which is important in mobile devices. However, simple dual-voltage parts quickly went out of production in favour of MMCplus and MMCmobile which offer capabilities in addition to dual-voltage capability.

===MMCplus and MMCmobile===
The version 4.x of the MMC standard, introduced in 2005, brought in two very significant changes to compete against SD cards: ability to run at higher speeds (26&amp;nbsp;MHz and 52&amp;nbsp;MHz) than the original MMC (20&amp;nbsp;MHz) or SD (25&amp;nbsp;MHz, 50&amp;nbsp;MHz) and a four- or eight-bit-wide [[Bus (computing)|data bus]].

Version 4.x full-size cards and reduced-size cards can be marketed as '''MMCplus''' and '''MMCmobile''' respectively.

Version 4.x cards are fully backward compatible with existing readers but require updated hardware/software to use their new capabilities; even though the four-bit-wide bus and high-speed modes of operation are deliberately electrically compatible with SD, the initialization protocol is different, so firmware/software updates are required to use these features in an SD reader.

===MMCmicro===
[[File:Mmc-micro.PNG|thumb|MMCmicro]]

'''MMCmicro''' is a micro-size version of MMC.  With dimensions of 14&amp;nbsp;mm × 12&amp;nbsp;mm × 1.1&amp;nbsp;mm, it is even smaller and thinner than RS-MMC. Like MMCmobile, MMCmicro allows dual voltage, is backward compatible with MMC, and can be used in full-size MMC and SD slots with a mechanical adapter. MMCmicro cards have the high-speed and four-bit-bus features of the 4.x spec but not the eight-bit bus, due to the absence of the extra pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/FlashCard/MMC/micro_mmc.htm |title=Samsung Semiconductor Global Official Website |language=ru |publisher=Samsung.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formerly known as ''S-card'' when introduced by [[Samsung]] on 13 December 2004. It was later adapted and introduced in 2005 by the [[MultiMediaCard Association]] (MMCA) as the third form factor memory card in the ''MultiMediaCard'' family.&lt;ref&gt;allmemorycards.com, ''[http://www.allmemorycards.com/mmc-micro.htm MMCmicro]''. Extracted 22 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

MMCmicro appears very similar to [[microSD]] but the two formats are not physically compatible and have incompatible pinouts.

===MiCard===
The '''MiCard''' is a backward-compatible extension of the MMC standard with a theoretical maximum size of 2048&amp;nbsp;GB (2&amp;nbsp;TB) announced on 2 June 2007. The card is composed of two detachable parts, much like a microSD card with an SD adapter. The small memory card fits directly in a USB port while it also has MMC-compatible electrical contacts, which with an included electromechanical adapter fits in traditional MMC and SD card readers. To date, only one manufacturer (Pretec) has produced cards in this format.&lt;ref name=micard&gt;{{cite web
| title = Pretec Announces S-Diamond, 1st In the World to Implement miCARD Standard
| url = http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070604006489&amp;newsLang=en
| accessdate = 21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]] of Taiwan, at the time of the announcement twelve [[Taiwan]]ese companies (including [[ADATA]] Technology, [[Asustek]], [[BenQ]], [[Carry Computer Eng. Co.]], [[C-One Technology]], [[DBTel]], [[Power Digital Card Co.]], and [[RiCHIP]]) had signed on to manufacture the new memory card. However, as of June 2011 none of the listed companies had released any such cards, and nor had any further announcements been made about plans for the format.

The card was announced to be available starting in the third quarter of 2007. It was expected to save the 12 Taiwanese companies who planned to manufacture the product and related hardware up to US$40 million in licensing fees, that presumably would otherwise be paid to owners of competing flash memory formats. The initial card was to have a capacity of 8&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]], while the standard would allow sizes up to 2048&amp;nbsp;GB. It was stated to have data transfer speeds of 480 [[Mbit/s]] (60 [[Mbyte/s]]), with plans to increase data throughput over time.

===SecureMMC===
An additional, optional, part of the MMC 4.x specification is a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] mechanism intended to enable MMC to compete with SD or [[Memory Stick]] in this area. Very little information is known{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} about how SecureMMC works or how its DRM characteristics compare with its competitors.

===eMMC===
[[File:Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 - Samsung KLMAG2GE4A-A002-3955.jpg|thumb|eMMC KLMAG2GE4A-A002 inside the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1]].]]
The eMMC ([[embedded system|embedded]] MMC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datalight.com/solutions/technologies/emmc/what-is-emmc|title=What is eMMC Memory – software support - Reliance Nitro|author=|date=|website=datalight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) architecture puts the MMC components (flash memory plus controller) into a small [[ball grid array]] (BGA) IC package for use in circuit boards as an embedded non-volatile memory system. eMMC exists in 100, 153, 169 ball packages and is based on an 8-bit parallel interface.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hyperstone.com Flash Memory Form Factors - The Fundamentals of Reliable Flash Storage, Retrieved 19. April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  This is noticeably different from other versions of MMC as this is not a user-removable card, but rather a permanent attachment to the circuit board. In the event of an issue stemming from either the memory or its controller, the entire PCB ([[Printed Circuit Board]]) would need to be replaced.

eMMC does not support the [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI-bus]] protocol.

Almost all mobile phones and tablets used this form of flash for main storage up to 2016, in 2016 [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] started to take control of the market. The latest version of the eMMC standard ([http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/results/jesd84-b51 JESD84-B51]) by JEDEC is version 5.1 released February 2015, with speeds rivaling discrete [[Serial ATA|SATA]]-based SSDs (400 MB/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/technology-focus-areas/flash-memory-ssds-ufs-emmc/e-mmc |title=e.MMC v5.1 |publisher=JEDEC |date= |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Seagate, Hitachi and others are in the process of releasing [[Small Form Factor committee|SFF]] hard disk drives with an interface called [[CE-ATA]]. This interface is electrically and physically compatible with MMC specification. However, the command structure has been expanded to allow the host controller to issue [[AT Attachment|ATA]] commands to control the hard disk drive.

'''NxTier''', is an [[application service provider|ASP]] company that provided software solutions to the [[logistics]] and [[supply chain]] industry. Using their VSC platform, the industry has visibility and control of their data virtually anywhere in the world at any time. The VSC platform is an [[application service provider|ASP]] application deployed over the [[Internet]].
The platform allows logistic and supply chain industry providers to schedule and dispatch [[transportation management system]], accept and transmit [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]], provide Web tracking functionality, manage orders with the [[order management system|OMS]] , perform [[business analytics]] and consolidate and optimize orders and loads.

The system was originally created specifically for the [[third-party logistics]] (3PL) market. Later it was quickly adopted by the specialized delivery, home delivery and the [[less than truckload]] (LTL) markets. Today it has furthered it reach to full [[truckload carrier]] market, the service industry; dispatch and scheduling, retail build out, appliance and furniture as well as retail replenishment. As the internet became a more reliable platform NxTier positioned its VSC platform to compete in the EDI space to reduce or eliminate [[value added network]] (VAN) based fees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7232">The '''Open Science Grid Consortium''' is an organization that administers a worldwide [[grid computing|grid]] of technological resources called the '''Open Science Grid''', which facilitates [[distributed computing]] for scientific research.  Founded in 2004, the [[consortium]] is composed of service and resource providers, researchers from universities and national laboratories, as well as computing centers across the United States.  Members independently own and manage the resources which make up the distributed facility, and consortium agreements provide the framework for technological and organizational integration.

==Use==
The OSG is used by scientists and researchers for data analysis tasks which are too computationally intensive for a single [[data center]] or [[supercomputer]].  While most of the grid's resources are used for [[particle physics]], research teams from disciplines like [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], and [[geographic information systems]] are currently using the grid to analyze data. Research using the grid's resources has been published in the [[Journal of Physical Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Large Hadron Collider===
The Open Science Grid was created in order to facilitate data analysis from the [[Large Hadron Collider]], and about 70% of its 300,000 computing-hours per day are dedicated to the analysis of data from particle colliders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaudin |first=Sharon |title=Collider probes universe's mysteries at the speed of light |work=ComputerWorld |accessdate=2009-03-02 |date=2008-11-09 |url=http://www.infoworld.com/news/feeds/08/09/09/Collider-probes-universes-mysteries-at-the-speed-of-light.html }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once data has been collected and distributed by the [[LHC Computing Grid]], the Open Science Grid assists physicists from institutions around the world in analysis.  The grid has been designed so that resources and data are shared automatically: {{quote|It's really driven not so much by where the physicists come from, but what their interests are.

Within the framework of [[Open Government Initiative]], the [[federal government of the United States]] adopted the [[Data.gov#Open Government Directive|Open Government Directive]], according to which: "An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive|title=Open Government Directive|work=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of Minnesota===
The [[Minnesota|State of Minnesota]] defines the criteria for open, XML-based file formats as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070206155518882 Meanwhile, Deep Down in Texas: An Open Format Bill is Filed] – Tuesday, 6 February 2007 @ 03:55 PM PST Contributed by: Andy Updegrove – ConsortiumInfo.org&lt;/ref&gt;

* The format is interoperable among diverse internal and external platforms and applications
* The format is fully published and available royalty-free
* The format is implemented by multiple vendors
* The format is controlled by an open industry organization with a well-defined inclusive process for evolution of the standard

===Commonwealth of Massachusetts===
The [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] "defines open formats as specifications for data file formats that are based on an underlying open standard, developed by an open community, affirmed and maintained by a standards body and are fully documented and publicly available."&lt;ref&gt;[http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2007-07-03-a.html Major Revision of Massachusetts Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM).] Robin Cover, Editor – Created: 3 July 2007. – Cover Pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM) classifies four formats as "Open Formats":
#[[OpenDocument|OASIS Open Document Format For Office Applications (OpenDocument) v. 1.1]]
#[[Office Open XML|Ecma-376 Office Open XML Formats (Open XML)]]
#[[HTML|Hypertext Document Format v. 4.01]]
#[[plain text|Plain Text Format]]

===The Linux Information Project===
According to [[The Linux Information Project]], the term ''open format'' should refer to "any format that is published for anyone to read and study but which may or may not be encumbered by patents, copyrights or other restrictions on use"&lt;ref name="Free File Format Definition"/&gt; – as opposed to a ''free format'' which is ''not'' encumbered by any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other restrictions.

==Examples of open formats==

{{See main|List of open formats}}

Open formats include:

*[[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] — a raster image format standardized by ISO/IEC
*[[FLAC]] — lossless audio codec
*[[WebM]] — a video/audio container format
* [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] — HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.
*[[gzip]] — for compression
* [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] — style sheet format usually used with (X)HTML, standardized by [[W3C]]

'''Precision mechanics''' (also "fine mechanics") is an engineering discipline that deals with the design and construction of smaller precision [[machine]]s, often including measuring and control mechanisms of different kinds.

The study may be further defined as the practices of rigid body [[kinematics]] to the positioning and holding of objects on the micrometre scale and smaller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4287">The '''Remote Activation Munition System (RAMS)''' is a radio frequency controlled system that is used to remotely detonate demolition charges or remotely operate electronic equipment such as beacons, laser markers, and radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/senate-report/189/1|title=Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 Report|last=|first=|date=May 11, 1998|work=Committee on Armed Services|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by a team of researchers led by James Chopak at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] over the span of four years starting in 1996 and ending in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdo14krj6oMC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22army+research%22+Remote+activation+Munitions+System&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZYRGdzEDed&amp;sig=7a_OfeROuJx-VWiCIu114Br5MRw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf1dnonvTbAhVprlkKHccwD3s4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22army%20research%22%20Remote%20activation%20Munitions%20System&amp;f=false|title=U.S. Special Operations Forces: 1996 Posture Statement|last=Holmes|first=H.

The RAMS was designed to serve as a more portable and convenient alternative to conventional remote activation systems like the model XM-122, which was considered too big, heavy, and fragile for efficient use. In addition, the XM-122 was limited in its range (about 1km) and relied on very large high capacity batteries. In contrast, the RAMS weighed only a couple pounds and its microprocessor-based transmitter was powered by at most seven standard 9-volt batteries. The device was capable of reaching a range up to 2 kilometers, and the combination of the crystal filter in the receivers and the FM detector circuit made it possible to maintain high signal sensitivity at a low power consumption rate. In addition, the RAMS was operational in harsh environments with temperatures as low as -25 degrees F and as high as 140 degrees F. It was also capable of functioning when submerged in saltwater, up to depths of 66 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Andrejkovics, R., Chopack, J., Brann, H., Hopkins, John, Tobin, R., &amp; Fraser, W. (2003). ''[https://patents.google.com/patent/US6546873B1/en United States Patent No. US 6,546,873 B1]''. Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; However, testing performed by the Army Research Laboratory have found that due to the low power levels of the RAMS receiver’s electrical signals output, the system has demonstrated a noticeable level of unreliability in performance past a certain distance.&lt;ref&gt;Land, D.G. (2008). ''[https://patents.google.com/patent/US7451700 United States Patent No. US 7,451,700 B1]''. Waltham, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern versions of the RAMS can weigh as little as three powers and can reach a range of more than 5 kilometers, allowing operators to stand farther away from the blast at a safer distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/92437/new_system_untethers_soldiers_from_demo_charge|title=New system untethers Soldiers from demo charge|last=Buckley|first=Melissa|date=December 6, 2012|work=U.S. Army|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wolfrid Rudyerd Boulton''' (April 5, 1901 – January 24, 1983) was an American [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] who worked extensively in Africa.  Boulton held positions at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] and traveled widely on expeditions to Africa.  With his first wife, [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Laura Boulton]], he made the first recordings of African tropical bird calls.  Boulton was recruited into the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) during the [[Second World War]] because of his knowledge of Africa and his experience in foreign travel.  He was responsible for monitoring the supply of [[uranium ore]] from the [[Belgian Congo]] for the [[Manhattan Project]].  Boulton transferred to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 1947 and resigned in 1958.

Boulton moved to [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1959 with his third wife and established the [[Atlantica Foundation]], a charitable organization to encourage the study of African birds.  The foundation received funding from the CIA and Boulton was later interviewed by Rhodesia's [[Central Intelligence Organisation]] over his links to the organization.  Atlantica lost much of its funding following [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965 and Boulton closed the foundation in 1978.  He died in [[Zimbabwe]] (Rhodesia).

==Early life and career==
W. Rudyerd Boulton was born in [[Beaver, Pennsylvania|Beaver]], Pennsylvania, on April 5, 1901.&lt;ref name="shavit26"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shavit|first1=David|title=The United States in Africa – A Historical Dictionary |date=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-25887-2|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first name is given variously as Wolfrid and Wilfred but was generally not used, being known as "W. Rudyerd Boulton", "Rudyerd Boulton" or "Rud".&lt;ref name=auk/&gt;&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  He joined the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] at around the age of 15 – he would remain a member for the whole of his life.&lt;ref name=auk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traylor, Jr.|first1=Melvin A.|year=1986|title=In Memoriam: W. Rudyerd Boulton|journal=The Auk|volume=103|issue=2|page=420|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v103n02/p0420-p0420.pdf|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Amherst College]] and then the [[University of Pittsburgh]], from which he graduated with [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1924.&lt;ref name=kronos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Nancy J.|year=2015|title=Marriage, Science, and Secret Intelligence in the life of Rudyerd Boulton (1901–1983): An American in Africa|journal=Kronos|volume=41|issue=1|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0259-01902015000100012&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after graduation Boulton was made research assistant at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s ornithology department.  He was a participant of [[Arthur Stannard Vernay]]'s 1925 expedition to Angola and in the same year married the [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Laura Boulton]] (''[[née]]'' Crayton).&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

Boulton transferred to the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in 1926 as assistant curator of birds and in 1929 joined the [[Sarah Lavanburg Straus]] expedition to [[Nyasaland]] (Malawi), [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]].  In the course of this, with his wife, he made the first ever recordings of the calls of African tropical birds.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  Boulton was also a member of the 1929–30 Carnegie Museum African expedition.&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;  In 1931 Boulton was appointed assistant curator at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] and, the same year, accompanied [[Ralph Pulitzer]] on his expedition to Angola.&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  During the expedition he discovered a previously unknown species of [[warbler]] that he [[Laura's woodland warbler|named in honour of his wife]].&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  In 1933 he published a children's book entitled ''Travelling with the Birds''.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  Boulton was a member of the 1934 Field Museum-Straus expedition that traveled 12,900&amp;nbsp;km from Dakar to [[Cameroon]] via [[Nigeria]] and later took part in expeditions to [[Panama]], the [[West Indies]] and the [[Galapagos Islands]].&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;  Boulton was promoted to curator of birds in 1937, a position he retained until 1946.&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;&lt;ref name=auk/&gt;  He separated from his wife in 1938 and remarried four years later to [[Inez Cunningham Stark]], an heiress, poet and [[Patronage|patron of the arts]].&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

==OSS/CIA career==
Boulton was recruited into the [[Office of Strategic Services]], which was then the US intelligence agency, in 1942 due to his knowledge of Africa and overseas experience.  He was appointed divisional deputy for Africa in the [[Secret Intelligence Branch]].&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  Boulton was responsible, from 1943, for co-coordinating a joint program with the [[X-2 Counter Espionage Branch]] to monitor the supply of uranium ore, vital to the success of the [[Manhattan Project]], which was primarily obtained from the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  Despite his experience, Boulton was based primarily in Washington, DC, only once leaving the country – to visit North Africa in 1944.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;  During the war [[Adolph W. Schmidt]], later to be the American ambassador to Canada, served as one of his intelligence officers.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

By February 1946 Boulton had become head of the Secret Intelligence Branch's Africa division and had to resign from his position at the Carnegie so that he could focus on his work for the government, although he remained a research associate of the museum.  He transferred to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] when it was established as the successor to the OSS in 1947.  An ornithological expedition Boulton undertook in North Africa in 1952 may have been funded by the CIA as cover for an operation, or if not, by his wife.  A further expedition to Southern Rhodesia and Angola in 1957 was funded by the Carnegie Museum.  Boulton resigned from the CIA in April 1958, the same year his wife died.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

==Rhodesia==
Boulton married for the third and final time in April 1959 to Louise Rehm, the widow of a former OSS colleague.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  Within months the couple had moved to [[Southern Rhodesia]] where they founded the [[Atlantica Foundation]], a charitable organization to encourage ornithologists, particularly students, to study the birds of Africa.&lt;ref name=auk/&gt;&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;  Boulton had a farm near [[Lake McIlwaine]] which housed an extensive art collection that was exhibited at the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|Rhodes National Gallery]] in December 1960.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  He sold some of his art, including works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Paul Klee]] to fund the work of Atlantica.  Boulton and his wife made frequent donations to the organization, contributing fully one third of their wealth to it, and it also received financial support from the CIA.  The foundation funded scholarships at [[Nyatsime College]] and donated books to more than 100 educational establishments.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

In addition to his work at the foundation Boulton was managing editor of ''Rhodesia Science News'' and president of the [[Rhodesia Scientific Association]].  He also assisted with early conservation projects in the region to the south-west of [[Lusaka]], which was established as [[Lochinvar National Park]] in 1972, and experimented with farming termites as a nutritional foodstuff.  Boulton carried out expeditions with a mobile laboratory to the [[Kalahari Desert]] in [[Tanzania]].  The laboratory included advanced listening equipment and map-making tools, which he may well have used to carry out surveys for the CIA.  Rhodesia's [[Central Intelligence Organisation]] was suspicious of Boulton's CIA connections and advanced equipment and he was interviewed by them.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

Boulton lost his international funding following [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965 and the introduction of US sanctions in 1967.  As a result, Atlantica was forced to heavily reduce its programs.  It may well be that the Boultons would have left the increasingly isolated Rhodesia if Louise was able to, but she was struck by blindness and senility and required 24-hour care.  Louise died in 1974 and two years later Boulton returned to the United States to manage the process of closing Atlantica.  He transferred the remaining funds to the [[Conservation Trust of Rhodesia]] in 1978.  The Atlantica properties were used to educate students from within the country and from Mozambique by the new black-majority government of Zimbabwe (which Rhodesia had been renamed).&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;

Boulton suffered two strokes in later life and was a wheelchair user.&lt;ref name=kronos/&gt;  He died on January 24, 1983, in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="shavit26"/&gt;

A species of African gecko, ''[[Rhoptropus|Rhoptropus boultoni]]'', is named in honour of Rudyerd Boulton.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association recommends low-pressure bleach or detergent assisted washing as the preferred method for cleaning asphalt roofs in order to prevent damage to the shingles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asphaltroofing.org/press-room/press-releases/algae-moss-prevention-and-cleaning-asphalt-roofing-systems|title=ARMA - Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association {{!}} Algae &amp; Moss Prevention and Cleaning for Asphalt Roofing Systems|date=2016-09-23|website=www.asphaltroofing.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Soft washing is using an electric agricultural sprayer to apply a water-based, biodegradable disinfecting cleaning solution to kill the mold, mildew, bacteria, algae, fungus, moss and more on exterior home and building surfaces.

'''Soft washing Equipment''' is distinctly different than power and pressure washing equipment. The electric diaphragm pump applies the cleaning solution at 40-80 PSI. The equipment used for soft washing may also have telescoping handles so that the cleaning solution can easily reach roof eaves, upper story windows, and other such areas, without this added pressure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://annarborpowerwashingpros.com/what-is-soft-washing-ann-arbor-mi/|title=What is Soft Washing|work=Ann Arbor Power Washing Pros|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 18th century BCE – 18th century ==
* c. 1700 BCE – [[Zimri-Lim]], ruler of Mari in Syria commanded the construction of one of the first [[Ice house (building)|ice house]]s near the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref name="Dalley2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Dalley|authorlink=Stephanie Dalley|title=Mari and Karana: Two Old Babylonian Cities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_oTh51M5XF4C&amp;pg=PA91|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-931956-02-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* c. 500 BCE – The [[yakhchal]] (meaning "ice pit" in Persian;) is an ancient Persian type of refrigerator. The structure was formed from a mortar resistant to heat transmission, in the shape of a dome. Snow and ice was stored beneath the ground, effectively allowing access to ice even in hot months and allowing for prolonged food preservation. Often a [[badgir]] was coupled with the [[yakhchal]] in order to slow the heat loss. Modern refrigerators are still called yakhchal in Persian.
* 1396 CE - Ice storage warehouses called "Dong-bing-go-tango (meaning "east ice storage warehouse" in Korean) and Seo-bing-go ("west ice storage warehouse") were built in Han-Yang (currently Seoul, Korea). The buildings housed ice that was collected from the frozen Han River in January (by lunar calendar). The warehouse was well-insulated, providing the royal families with ice into the summer months.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These warehouses were closed in 1898 AD but the buildings are still intact in Seoul.

In [[telecommunication]]s and related engineering (including [[computer networking]] and [[Computer programming|programming]]), the term '''timeout''' or '''time-out''' has several meanings, including:

* A [[telecommunications network|network]] parameter related to an enforced [[Event-driven programming|event]] designed to occur at the conclusion of a predetermined elapsed [[time]].  
* A specified period of time that will be allowed to elapse in a [[system]] before a specified event is to take place, unless another specified event occurs first; in either case, the period is terminated when either event takes place.  Note:  A timeout condition can be canceled by the receipt of an appropriate time-out cancellation [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]]. 
* An event that occurs at the end of a predetermined period of time that began at the occurrence of another specified event. The timeout can be prevented by an appropriate signal.

Timeouts allow for more efficient usage of limited resources without requiring additional interaction from the agent interested in the goods that cause the consumption of these resources. The basic idea is that in situations where a system must wait for something to happen, rather than waiting indefinitely, the waiting will be aborted after the timeout period has elapsed. This is based on the assumption that further waiting is useless, and some other action is necessary.

Other examples are
* In [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] connections, the server will usually close a client connection after a certain period of inactivity (the timeout period).  This ensures that connections do not persist forever, if the client crashes or the network goes down.  Open connections consume resources, and may prevent other clients from accessing the same mailbox.
* In [[HTTP persistent connections]], the web server saves opened connections (which consume [[CPU time]] and [[computer memory|memory]]). The web client does not have to send an "end of requests series" signal.  Connections are closed (timed out) after five minutes of inactivity; this ensures that the connections do not persist indefinitely.
* In a timed light switch, both [[energy]] and lamp's [[life-span]] are saved. The user does not have to switch off manually.
* [[Tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s commonly turn off their [[backlight]] after a certain time without user input.
* In an electronic text-based [[customer relationship management]] software tool, the threads can be auto-closed in a timed base, allowing the workers save browse time. The customer does not have to send an "I'm done" signal.

{{merge|Stagnation temperature|discuss=Talk:Stagnation temperature#Merger proposal|date=October 2017}}

In aviation, [[stagnation temperature]] is known as '''total air temperature''' and is measured by a temperature probe mounted on the surface of the aircraft. The probe is designed to bring the air to rest relative to the aircraft. As the air is brought to rest, [[kinetic energy]] is converted to [[internal energy]]. The air is compressed and experiences an [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] increase in temperature. Therefore, total air temperature is higher than the static (or ambient) air temperature.

Total air temperature is an essential input to an [[air data computer]] in order to enable computation of static air temperature and hence [[true airspeed]].

The relationship between static and total air temperatures is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T_\mathrm{total}}{T_{s}}={1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_a^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{s}=&lt;/math&gt; static air temperature, SAT ([[kelvin]]s or [[Rankine scale|degrees Rankine]])&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{total}=&lt;/math&gt; total air temperature, TAT (kelvins or degrees Rankine)&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{a}=&lt;/math&gt; [[Mach number]]&lt;br&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\ =\,&lt;/math&gt; ratio of specific heats, approx 1.400 for dry air

In practice, the total air temperature probe will not perfectly recover the energy of the airflow, and the temperature rise may not be entirely due to adiabatic process. In this case, an empirical recovery factor (less than 1) may be introduced to compensate:

(1) :&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T_\mathrm{total}}{T_{s}}={1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}eM_a^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:''e'' = recovery factor (also noted ''C''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)

'''Typical recovery factors'''

Platinum wire ratiometer thermometer ("flush bulb type"): ''e'' ≈ 0.75 - 0.9

Double platinum tube ratiometer thermometer ("TAT probe"):  ''e'' ≈ 1

'''Other notations'''

Total air temperature (TAT) is also called: indicated air temperature (IAT) or ram air temperature (RAT)&lt;br /&gt;
[[Outside air temperature|Static air temperature (SAT)]] is also called: [[Outside air temperature|outside air temperature (OAT)]] or true air temperature

== Ram rise ==

The difference between TAT and SAT is called ram rise (RR) and is caused by compressibility and friction of the air at high velocities.

(2) :&lt;math&gt;RR_\mathrm{total}=TAT-SAT \,&lt;/math&gt;

In practice the ram rise is negligible for aircraft flying at (true) airspeeds under Mach 0.2

For airspeeds (TAS) over Mach 0.2, as airspeed increases the temperature exceeds that of still air. This is caused by a combination of kinetic (friction) heating and [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic compression]]

*''Kinetic heating''. As the airspeed increases, more and more molecules of air per second hit the aircraft. This causes a temperature rise in the Direct Reading thermometer probe of the aircraft due to friction. Because the airflow is thought to be compressible and [[isentropic process|isentropic]], which, by definition, is adiabatic and reversible, the equations used in this article do not take account of ''friction heating''. This is why the calculation of static air temperature requires the use of the recovery factor, &lt;math&gt; {e} &lt;/math&gt;. Kinetic heating for modern passenger jets is almost negligible.
*''[[adiabatic process|Adiabatic compression]]''. As described above, this is caused by a conversion of energy and not by direct application of heat. At airspeeds over Mach 0.2, in the Remote Reading temperature probe (TAT-probe), the outside airflow, which may be several hundred knots, is brought virtually to rest very rapidly. The energy ([[specific kinetic energy|Specific Kinetic Energy]]) of the moving air is then released (converted) in the form of a temperature rise ([[specific enthalpy|Specific Enthalpy]]). Energy cannot be destroyed but only transformed; this means that according to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the total energy of an isolated system must remain constant.

The total of kinetic heating and adiabatic temperature change (caused by adiabatic compression) is the '''Total Ram Rise'''.

Combining equations (1) &amp; (2), we get:

:&lt;math&gt;
 RR_\mathrm{total}={T_s\frac{\gamma -1}{2}eM_a^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we use the [[Mach number]] equation for dry air:

:&lt;math&gt;
 M_a={\frac{V}{a}}
&lt;/math&gt;   
where  &lt;math&gt;
 a={\sqrt{\gamma R_{sp} T_s}}
&lt;/math&gt;

we get

(3) :&lt;math&gt;
 RR_\mathrm{total}={e V^2 \frac{\gamma -1}{\gamma2R_{sp} }}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;
RR_{total} = {\frac{V^2}{2 C_p}} e &lt;/math&gt;  

by using  &lt;math&gt; 
 R_{sp} = { C_p - C_v }&lt;/math&gt;
 
and

:&lt;math&gt;
 \gamma = {\frac{ C_p}{C_v}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a = &lt;/math&gt; [[speed of sound|local speed of sound]].
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = &lt;/math&gt; [[heat capacity ratio|adiabatic index]] (ratio of heat capacities) and is assumed for aviation purposes to be 7/5 = 1.400.
:&lt;math&gt; R_{sp} = &lt;/math&gt; [[gas constant|specific gas constant]]. The approximate value of &lt;math&gt; R_{sp} &lt;/math&gt; for dry air is 286.9 J·kg−1·K−1.
:&lt;math&gt; C_p = &lt;/math&gt; [[heat capacity]] constant for constant pressure.
:&lt;math&gt; C_v = &lt;/math&gt; [[heat capacity]] constant for constant volume.
:&lt;math&gt; T_s = &lt;/math&gt; static air temperature, SAT, measured in kelvins.
:&lt;math&gt; V = &lt;/math&gt; [[true airspeed]] of the aircraft, TAS.
:&lt;math&gt; e = &lt;/math&gt; recovery factor, which has an approximate value of 0.98, typical for a modern TAT-probe.

By solving (3) for the above values with TAS in knots, a simple accurate formula for ram rise is then:
 
:&lt;math&gt;  RR_\mathrm{total}=\frac{V^2}{87^2}  &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:1920s TRF radio manufactured by Signal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|This 1920s TRF radio manufactured by Signal is constructed on a [[breadboard]] ]]
[[Image:Tuning Neutrodyne receiver 1924.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Tuning a TRF receiver, like this 5 tube Neutrodyne set from 1924 with two stages of RF amplification, was a complicated process. The three tuned circuits, controlled by the 3 large knobs, had to be tuned in unison to the new station. So tuning in a station was a process of successive approximation. Once a station was found, the numbers on the dials were written down, so it could be found again.]] 
[[Image:Tuning a TRF radio 1925.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Tuning all 3 stages of a TRF set in unison. This 1925 Grebe Synchrophase receiver has [[thumbwheel]]s instead of knobs which can be turned with a finger, so a third hand is not needed. ]]

A '''tuned radio frequency receiver''' (or '''TRF receiver''') is a type of [[radio receiver]] that is composed of one or more tuned radio frequency (RF) [[amplifier]] stages followed by a [[detector (radio)|detector]] ([[demodulator]]) circuit to extract the [[audio signal]] and usually an audio frequency amplifier. This type of receiver was popular in the 1920s. Early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station's [[frequency]], but later models had ganged tuning, the tuning mechanisms of all stages being linked together, and operated by just one control knob. By the mid 1930s, it was replaced by the [[superheterodyne receiver]] patented by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Edwin Armstrong]].

== Background ==
The TRF receiver was patented in 1916 by [[Ernst Alexanderson]].  His concept was that each stage would amplify the desired signal while reducing the interfering ones.  Multiple stages of RF amplification would make the radio more sensitive to weak stations, and the multiple tuned circuits would give it a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] than the single stage receivers common at that time.  All tuned stages of the radio must track and tune to the desired reception frequency.  This is in contrast to the modern [[superheterodyne receiver]] that must only tune the receiver's [[RF front end]] and [[local oscillator]] to the desired frequencies; all the following stages work at a fixed frequency and do not depend on the desired reception frequency.

Antique TRF receivers can often be identified by their cabinets. They typically have a long, low appearance, with a flip-up lid for access to the [[vacuum tube]]s and [[tuned circuit]]s.  On their front panels there are typically two or three large dials, each controlling the tuning for one stage.  Inside, along with several vacuum tubes, there will be a series of large coils.  These will usually be  with their axes at right angles to each other to reduce magnetic coupling between them.

A problem with the TRF receiver built with [[triode]] vacuum tubes is the triode's interelectrode capacitance.  The interelectrode capacitance allows energy in the output circuit to [[feedback]] into the input.  That feedback can cause instability and [[oscillation]] that frustrate reception and produce squealing or howling noises in the speaker. In 1922, [[Louis Alan Hazeltine]] invented the technique of ''neutralization'' that uses additional circuitry to partially cancel the effect of the interelectrode capacitance.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book

Under certain conditions, "the neutralization is substantially independent of frequency over a wide frequency band."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Terman |first= Frederick E. |author-link= Frederick Terman |title= Radio Engineers' Handbook |publisher= McGraw-Hill |year= 1943 |page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perfect neutralization cannot be maintained in practice over a wide band of frequencies because leakage inductances and stray capacities" are not completely canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Frederick Emmons |last=Terman |authorlink=Frederick Terman |title=Radio Engineering |edition=second |year=1937 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The later development of the [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]] vacuum tubes minimized the effect of interelectrode capacitances and could make neutralization unnecessary; the additional electrodes in those tubes shield the plate and grid and minimize feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Terman|1937|p=238}} states, "Neutralization is always necessary in tuned triode amplifiers for otherwise the input resistance will be so low that oscillations can be expected. It is not employed with pentode and screen-grid amplifiers, however, because the direct-capacity coupling between grid and plate in such tubes is very small."&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
[[File:Tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver block diagram 2.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Block diagram of TRF receiver]]

The classic TRF receivers of the 1920s and 30s usually consisted of three sections: 
*one or more tuned RF amplifier stages.  These amplify the signal of the desired station to a level sufficient to drive the detector, while rejecting all other signals picked up by the antenna.
*a [[detector (radio)|detector]], which extracts the [[audio signal|audio]] ([[modulation]]) signal from the radio [[carrier signal]] by [[rectifier|rectifying]] it. 
*''optionally'', but almost always included, one or more [[audio amplifier]] stages which increase the power of the audio signal.

[[Image:Leutz Phantom 9 tube TRF receiver.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Leutz 9-tube receiver from 1927 clearly shows the component parts of a TRF set. Each RF stage is in a separate compartment. Within each compartment can be seen ''(from top)'': the triode tube, the interstage coupling coil, and the capacitor attached to its front panel tuning dial. The compartments contain ''(from left)'': the 4 RF stages, the detector stage, and the 4 tube audio amplifier.  The capacitors could be linked to a common shaft and tuned together, or tuned separately.]]

Each tuned RF stage consists of an amplifying device, a [[triode]] (or in later sets a [[tetrode]]) [[vacuum tube]], and a [[tuned circuit]] which performs the filtering function.  The tuned circuit consisted of an air-core RF coupling [[transformer]] which also served to couple the signal from the [[plate electrode|plate]] circuit of one tube to the input [[control grid|grid]] circuit of the next tube. One of the windings of the transformer had a variable [[capacitor]] connected across it to make a [[tuned circuit]]. A variable capacitor (or sometimes a variable coupling coil called a ''variometer'')  was used, with a knob on the front panel to tune the receiver.  The RF stages usually had identical circuits to simplify design.

Each RF stage had to be tuned to the same frequency,  so the capacitors had to be tuned in tandem when bringing in a new station.  In some later sets the capacitors were "ganged", mounted on the same shaft or otherwise linked mechanically so that the radio could be tuned with a single knob, but in most sets the [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of the tuned circuits could not be made to "track" well enough to allow this, and each stage had its own tuning knob.&lt;ref name="Felix"&gt;{{cite journal

The detector was usually a [[grid-leak detector]]. Some sets used a [[crystal detector]] ([[semiconductor diode]]) instead.  Occasionally, a [[regenerative circuit|regenerative detector]] was used, to increase selectivity.

Some TRF sets that were listened to with [[earphone]]s didn't need an audio amplifier, but most sets had one to three transformer-coupled or RC-coupled audio amplifier stages to provide enough power to drive a [[loudspeaker]].

[[Image:TRF Schematic.jpg|700px|Schematic of Six Tube Design using Triode Tubes – Two Radio Frequency Amplifiers, One Grid-Leak Detector, Three Class ‘A’ Audio Amplifiers]]

The schematic diagram shows a typical TRF receiver.  This particular  example uses six triodes. It has two radio frequency amplifier stages, one grid-leak detector/amplifier and three class ‘A’ audio amplifier stages.  There are 3 tuned circuits ''T1-C1, T2-C2, and T3-C3''.  The second and third tuning capacitors, ''C2'' and ''C3'', are ganged together ''(indicated by line linking them)'' and controlled by a single knob, to simplify tuning.  Generally, two or three RF amplifiers were required to filter and amplify the received signal enough for good reception.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Terman characterizes the TRF's disadvantages as "poor selectivity and low sensitivity in proportion to the number of tubes employed. They are accordingly practically obsolete."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Terman|1943|p=658}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Selectivity requires narrow bandwidth, but the bandwidth of a filter with a given [[Q factor]] increases with frequency. So to achieve a narrow bandwidth at a high radio frequency required high-Q filters or many filter sections.  Achieving constant sensitivity and bandwidth across an entire broadcast band was rarely achieved. In contrast, a superheterodyne receiver translates the incoming high radio frequency to a lower intermediate frequency which does not change.  The problem of achieving constant sensitivity and bandwidth over a range of frequencies arises only in one circuit (the first stage) and is therefore considerably simplified.

The major problem with the TRF receiver, particularly as a consumer product, was its complicated tuning.  All the tuned circuits need to track to keep the narrow bandwidth tuning.  Keeping multiple tuned circuits aligned while tuning over a wide frequency range is difficult.  In the early TRF sets the operator had to perform that task, as described above.  A superheterodyne receiver only needs to track the RF and LO stages; the onerous selectivity requirements are confined to the IF amplifier which is fixed-tuned.

During the 1920s, an advantage of the TRF receiver over the [[regenerative receiver]] was that, when properly adjusted, it did not radiate [[electromagnetic interference|interference]].&lt;ref name="Glasgow"&gt;{{cite journal

==Modern usage==
Although the TRF design has been largely superseded by the superheterodyne receiver, with the advent of semiconductor electronics in the 1960s the design was "resurrected" and used in some simple integrated radio receivers for hobbyist radio projects, kits, and low-end consumer products.   One example is the [[ZN414]] TRF radio [[integrated circuit]] from [[Ferranti]] in 1972 shown below

Unintentional radiation from these devices can create [[Interference (communication)|interference]] on [[AM radio]], and on the [[video]] of [[television]] stations.

==Regulatory overview==
In North America, active devices that are characterized as "unintentional radiators" are governed by [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations and its CRTC equivalents in Canada. Globally, most domestic regulation of unintentional radiators are based on [[ITU]] recommendations.

Generally, this means the device leaks a signal at some level. Microprocessor-controlled appliances, anything with a [[clock signal]], and [[switching voltage regulator]]s all make some kind of noise, at the repetition frequency and at harmonics. In most countries, government agencies regulate how much leakage is tolerated. This prevents leakage from [[cable television]] systems, for example, from interfering with radio communications between aircraft and [[control tower]]s.

Because it costs money to filter out noise, there is always a balance struck between regulatory compliance and perfect filtering in these devices. [[Microwave oven]]s or devices with microprocessors may leak within allowable limits but may generate an undesired signal that interferes with a licensed communications device. It also generally means that users who intentionally radiate signals ([[Television|TV stations]] and [[Cellular telephone|cell phone]] companies) can order the device turned off if it interferes with their licensed operations.

[[Image:Cable end.JPG|thumb|right|Ferrite bead at the end of a [[USB]] cable]]
There is an entire industry based on [[Compliance (regulation)|regulatory compliance]]: manufacturers shipping a product to a foreign country must comply with each country's limitations on leakage of interfering signals. For example, in Germany the [[Technischer Überwachungsverein|TÜV]] issues regulatory rules for unintentional radiators. The big cylindrical bumps on the cable to monitors and laptop chargers are [[ferrite bead|ferrite cores]] which reduce undesired signals.

'''U18''' is a large scale [[E-learning|e-education]] venture based out of [[India]]. University18  works with Indian Universities in a [[public–private partnership]], developing and delivering Accredited Degree and Diploma Programs to the Indian Learner around the Nation. U18 has a global footprint, with students spread across the world, and exam centers in [[Africa]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Dubai]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Programs==
University18's Programs are all structured around a web based e-education platform, one that has both asynchronous and synchronous components - the Learning Management System, and a Virtual Classroom System. Regular online sessions, with Professors from various Institutions around the Nation, act to bridge the gap between full time classroom learning and  Distance Learning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.university18.edu.in&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professors==
The fact that U18 uses professors drawn from different Institutions give their programs some flexibility and flavor. The U18 premise is that classroom interaction, as well as the mentoring a classroom lecture (online) can provide, aid both the effort an adult learner makes and the challenges he/she faces by re-entering the formal education system after a break.

==Re.Vica Project==
The Re.Vica Project of the [[European Commission]], describes U18 thus -
“University18, a nonprofit private-sector initiative (currently in partnership with the [[Karnataka State Open University]]), represents a significant development in the region which may well have great impact in the near future“.&lt;ref&gt;http://revica.europace.org/Re.ViCa%20Online%20Handbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
U18 is a nominee for the eIndia 2010 Awards,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eindia.net.in/awards/2010/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; to be given out in August, at the eIndia 2010 convention at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].

==Tie-ups==
University18 currently has tie ups with [[Assam Don Bosco University]] and the [[University of Mysore]]

[[Image:Vectorscope.jpg|thumb|250px|A video vectorscope displaying [[color bars]]. The diagonal direction of the [[color burst]] vector is indicative of a [[PAL]] signal.]]
[[Image:Vectorscope graticule.png|thumb|250px|The graticule of an NTSC vectorscope.]]

A '''vectorscope''' is a special type of [[oscilloscope]] used in both audio and video applications. Whereas an oscilloscope or waveform monitor normally displays a plot of signal vs. time, a vectorscope displays an [[Oscilloscope#X-Y mode|X-Y plot]] of two signals, which can reveal details about the relationship between these two signals. Vectorscopes are highly similar in operation to oscilloscopes operated in X-Y mode; however those used in video applications have specialized graticules, and accept standard television or video signals as input ([[demodulation|demodulating]] and [[demultiplex]]ing the two components to be analyzed internally).

==Applications==

===Video===
In video applications, a vectorscope supplements a [[waveform monitor]] for the purpose of measuring and testing television signals, regardless of format ([[NTSC]], [[PAL]], [[SECAM]] or any number of [[digital television]] standards). While a waveform monitor allows a broadcast technician to measure the overall characteristics of a video signal, a vectorscope is used to visualize [[chrominance]], which is encoded into the video signal as a subcarrier of specific frequency. The vectorscope locks exclusively to the chrominance subcarrier in the video signal (at 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz for NTSC, or at 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz for PAL) to drive its display. In digital applications, a vectorscope instead plots the Cb and Cr channels against each other (these are the two channels in digital formats which contain chroma information).

A vectorscope uses an overlaid circular reference display, or ''graticule'', for visualizing chrominance signals, which is the best method of referring to the [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]] scheme used to encode color into a video signal. The actual visual pattern that the incoming chrominance signal draws on the vectorscope is called the ''trace''. Chrominance is measured using two methods—color [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]], encoded as the [[amplitude]], or [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], of the subcarrier signal, and [[hue]], encoded as the subcarrier's [[phase (waves)|phase]]. The vectorscope's graticule roughly represents saturation as distance from the center of the circle, and hue as the angle, in standard position, around it. The graticule is also embellished with several elements corresponding to the various components of the standard [[color bars]] video [[test pattern|test signal]], including boxes around the circles for the colors in the main bars, and perpendicular lines corresponding to the U and V components of the chrominance signal (and additionally on an NTSC vectorscope, the I and Q components). NTSC vectorscopes have one set of boxes for the color bars, while their PAL counterparts have two sets of boxes, because the R-Y chrominance component in PAL reverses in phase on alternating lines. Another element in the graticule is a fine grid at the nine-o'clock, or -U position, used for measuring [[differential gain]] and [[differential phase|phase]].

Often two sets of bar targets are provided: one for color bars at 75% amplitude and one for color bars at 100% amplitude. The 100% bars represent the maximum amplitude (of the composite signal) that composite encoding allows for. 100% bars are not suitable for broadcast and are not [[broadcast-safe]]. 75% bars have reduced amplitude and are broadcast-safe.

Some vectorscope models have only one set of bar targets. The vectorscope can be set up for 75% or 100% bars by adjusting the gain so that the [[Colorburst|color burst]] vector extends to the "75%" or "100%" marking on the graticule.

The reference signal used for the vectorscope's display is the color burst that is transmitted before each line of video, which for NTSC is defined to have a phase of 180°, corresponding to the nine-o'clock position on the graticule. The actual color burst signal shows up on the vectorscope as a straight line pointing to the left from the center of the graticule. In the case of PAL, the color burst phase alternates between 135° and 225°, resulting in two vectors pointing in the half-past-ten and half-past-seven positions on the graticule, respectively. In digital (and component analog) vectorscopes, colorburst doesn't exist; hence the phase relationship between the colorburst signal and the chroma subcarrier is simply not an issue. A vectorscope for SECAM uses a demodulator similar to the one found in a SECAM receiver to retrieve the U and V colour signals since they are transmitted one at a time (Thomson 8300 Vecamscope).

On older vectorscopes that use [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), the graticule was often a silk-screened overlay superimposed over the front surface of the screen. One notable exception was the [[Tektronix]] WFM601 series of instruments, which are combined waveform monitors and vectorscopes used to measure [[CCIR 601]] television signals. The waveform-mode graticule of these instruments is implemented with a silkscreen, whereas the vectorscope graticule (consisting only of bar targets, as this family did not support composite video) was drawn on the CRT by the [[electron beam]]. Modern instruments have graticules drawn using computer graphics, and both graticule and trace are rendered on an external [[VGA]] monitor or an internal VGA-compatible LCD display.

Most modern waveform monitors include vectorscope functionality built in; and many allow the two modes to be displayed side-by-side. The combined device is typically referred to as a waveform monitor, and standalone vectorscopes are rapidly becoming obsolete.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Audio===
In audio applications, a vectorscope is used to measure the difference between channels of [[stereo]] audio signals. One stereo channel drives the horizontal deflection of the display, and the other drives the vertical deflection. A monoaural signal, consisting of identical left and right signals, results in a straight line with a [[gradient]] of +1. Any stereo separation is visible as a deviation from this line, creating a [[Lissajous figure]]. If a straight line appears with a gradient of −1, this indicates that the left and right channels are 180° out of phase.

'''Vertical roller mill''' is a type of [[Milling (grinding)|grinder]] used to grind materials into extremely fine powder for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, cements and ceramics. It is an energy efficient alternative for a [[ball mill]].

==Overview==
Vertical roller mill has many different forms, but it works basically the same. All of these forms of machine come with a roller (or the equivalent of roller grinding parts), and roller along the track of the disc at the level of circular movement imposed by external grinding roller in the vertical pressure on the disc on the material being the joint action of compression and shear, and to crush.
[[Image:Rollenmuehlen-Innen.jpg|thumb| Vertical roller mill.]]

==Manufacturers==
[http://www.gebr-pfeiffer.com/en/home.html Gebr. Pfeiffer],[http://www.loesche.com/en/ Loesche], Polysius, Atox, F L Smidth, OK mill,Zhongya，HRM， ICIL, Poittemill, Ecutec are the type of mills which are used worldwide.
Famous Manufacturer, Hefei Zhongya Building Material Equipment Co., Ltd.

==Operation==
Material grinding process motor through reducer rotating drive disc, the material falls from the mill under the central entrance and exit, under the action of centrifugal force to the disc edge by the roller to move and the crushing, grinding out lap after the material was speed up the flow to and vertical mill with one of the separator, after the meal by the separator back to the mill, the re-grinding; powder while grinding out with air, dust collection equipment in the system to collect down, that is, products. Established through the mill in the pneumatic conveying of materials, a larger air flow rate, which can use waste heat of gas, at the same time dry grinding operations.

==Principle==
Used in cement grinding production grinding parts of its various forms, there is a cylinder, cone type, ball type, etc., and roller surface is also flat, curved, convex round noodles. Applied to the grinding roller to roller grinding along the track bed in close contact with the material strength of a spring pressure, hydraulic, etc.

==Method of operation==
It has two pairs of grinding rollers, each pair of roller composed of two narrow rollers, mounted on the same axis and can rotate at different speeds. There are two circular disc slot, and roller to the tire shape, work pressure in the tank. Disc roller and the relative sliding velocity between small and roller can swing, even if the roller sleeve and the disc after the liner wear can guarantee a good abrasive, will not affect the grinding effect. Roller symmetrical structure, one side can be upside down after use and wear.
Material grinding process: hydraulic pneumatic roller device through the pressure applied to the material on the crushing of materials, the materials have been moved to crush the edge of disc, from the disc around the nozzle from the exhaust air to improve these materials to Separator.Meal to separate returns after a concentrated mill, fine powder was collected in the precipitator unloading. In the gas flow is small, the meal can not be increased to enhance air flow, they would fall through the nozzle discharged outside the mill, bucket elevator to be transported to the feeder of vertical [[roller mill]], and was re-grinding mill feed people. This cycle features of the way there:
# ring by adjusting the air valve, can change the product fineness can Shide mill bed load material uniformity and stability, improving the grinding efficiency;
# coarse particles in the external circulation, helps reduce Fan power consumption and overall system power.

==Benefits over ball mill==
[[File:Vertical roller mill.jpg|thumb|Laboratory vertical roller mill]]
# Smaller footprints
# Can be erected on site which avoid logistical issues.
# Low wear rate
# More grinding capacity (approx. 20–25% more) than ball mill
# lower power consumption (KWh/Ton) than ball mill + pregrinding

==Limitations==
# Complex system
# Maintenance requirement are higher, In cement grinding, Practically need 2 times annually to re-weld roll and table due to excessive wear
# Higher overall cost

A '''white sale''' is a [[marketing strategy]] in which a store steeply [[discounts and allowances|discount]]s its [[product (business)|merchandise]] to increase [[sales]] during a short period of time.

==Origins==
In 1878, [[John Wanamaker]] of [[Philadelphia]] department store fame decreed January to be the time for a "White sale." [[Linens|Bed linens]], which were available in white only, were sold at a discount. This was done to increase sales for these items at a time of the year when sales were normally slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lisicky|first=Michael J.|title=Wanamaker's: Meet Me at the Eagle|year=2010|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9781596290082|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Today, white sales usually revolve around household items. However, they no longer only involve items that are white in color, and they are not restricted to take place in the month of January. "White sales" should not be confused with sales on "[[white goods]]," which is to say [[durable good]]s such as refrigerators, freezers, stoves, washing machines, and similar large appliances.
