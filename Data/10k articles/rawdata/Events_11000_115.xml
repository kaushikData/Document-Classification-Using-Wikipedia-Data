"'''5 Minutes Alone'''" is a song by American [[Groove metal]] band [[Pantera]] from their 1994 album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]''. The song also appears on the band's [[Official Live: 101 Proof|live album]]. The song was released as downloadable content for ''[[Rock Revolution]]'' and ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and can be heard during a cut-scene in ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier]]''.

==Meaning==

Speaking about what the song is about, Pantera's drummer [[Vinnie Paul]] said:

:"The story behind this song is we were opening for [[Megadeth]], and there was a guy that was flipping us off the whole show and so we stopped the show. And I was like, 'Listen, in case you haven't noticed there's 18,000 people who really dig what we're doing. You're the only one doing that stupid shit without even having to egg the crowd on.' Ten guys just jumped the guy and beat the shit out of him. His dad called the manager after all the lawsuits and this and that, and basically said, 'Give me five minutes with that [[Phil Anselmo]] guy. I want to whup his ass.' "&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pantera-look-back-at-20-years-of-far-beyond-driven-20140327 |title=Pantera Look Back at 20 Years of 'Far Beyond Driven' |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |author=Kory Grow |date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantera's vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]] spoke about what the song is about saying:

:"There are always gold-diggers out there. The way I remember it was there was this kid that swore that I jumped off the stage and beat him up. Well, that was bullshit. That did not happen at all. When the father asked for five minutes alone with me, our manager responded aptly and perfectly: 'No, you don't.' [Laughs] 'I really doubt that,' and basically hung up on the guy. But once that story was conveyed to me, it actually made me angry because it wasn't fucking true. I basically plucked out those words from my agitator's mouth and yeah, man, 'five minutes alone,' fucking bring it."&lt;ref name=RS /&gt;

==Reception==
Upon release the song had an immediate impact on the band's fanbase, quickly becoming one of Pantera's most popular songs.

==Covers==
"5 Minutes Alone" was covered by the bands [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Ill Nino]], [[DevilDriver]], [[Soilwork]], and [[Killswitch Engage]] in Dallas, Texas on December 8, 2007 on the 3rd anniversary of Dimebag Darrell's death. It featured 3 vocalists, 5 guitarists, and 3 drummers.&lt;ref name="donkaye"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaye |first=Don |title=The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits! |year=2003 |publisher=Warner Music Group |url=http://www.wmg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was covered by [[Nonpoint]] for the ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' [[tribute album]] ''Getcha Pull! A Tribute to Dimebag Darrell''as a downloadable bonus track. Nonpoint then released the song on their 2010 studio album ''[[Miracle (Nonpoint album)|Miracle]]''.

Texas [[deathcore]] band [[Upon a Burning Body]] recorded the song as well. It can be said as another bonus track for ''Getcha Pull! A Tribute to Dimebag Darrell''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31455">This article is about the international '''Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards''' (abbreviated "AJOYA"), issued from 1996 to 2009-2010 by the '''[[World Leadership Forum]], Ltd''', of London, England, U.K., in conjunction with the [[Farnborough Air Show]] (England) and the [[Paris Air Show]] (France).

AJOYA should not be confused with the Australia's "'''Aviation Journalist of the Year" Awards''', issued by that country's '''National Aviation Press Club''' (at least during 2010, in Sydney, Australia).  Those awards were restricted to writers from Australia and New Zealand. For more on those awards in 2010, see:  [http://australianaviation.com.au/2010/12/australian-aviations-mclaughlin-aviation-journalist-of-the-year/ "Australian Aviation’s McLaughlin ‘Aviation Journalist of the Year’"], on australianaviation.com.au December 6, 2010.

==Overview==
The international '''Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards''' (abbreviated "AJOYA") were awards for writers and broadcasters working in the aerospace and aviation field, including specialists and those working for non-specialist titles. The awards dinner took place in mid-July (timed to coincide with the [[Farnborough Air Show]] and the [[Paris Air Show]]), and brought together aviation media and industry representatives.

The awards were organised between 1996&lt;ref name="swissair111_2004-07-22"&gt;[http://forums.swissair111.org/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/322103945/m/6971074601 "Air Safety Week's David Evans Wins International Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award"] (POTOMAC, MD, July 22, 2004), posted July 23 2004 on swissair111.org&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010 by Malcolm Turner and his company (the "'''[[World Leadership Forum]], Ltd'''," of the UK) under the auspices of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] of the U.K. and the [[Aero Club of France]] ([[Aéro-Club de France]]).&lt;ref name="duedil_WLF"&gt;[https://www.duedil.com/company/04085053/the-world-leadership-forum-limited "The World Leadership Forum Limited" page], in the business-information database-website Duedil.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awards, given annually, were typically organized in a hierarchy:
* 1.)  '''All entries''' in each category of each award (typically varying from seven to dozens of contestants, depending on the volume of entries—commonly in the hundreds&lt;ref name="swissair111_2004-07-22" /&gt;).
&lt;br /&gt;...which judges narrowed down to...
* 2.)  '''"Shortlist" finalists''' in each category (usually about the top 5 candidates) (Shortlists were published on the respective Awards program websites for the few months leading up to the Awards Banquet/Ceremony.)
&lt;br /&gt;...from which, based on judges' scores, were selected...
* 3.)  "'''"Best in Category" winners'''" in each topical category, announced at the Awards Banquet/Ceremony
&lt;br /&gt;...from which were selected, based on judges' scores...
* 4.)  The OVERALL '''"Aerospace Journalist of the Year,"''' also announced at the Awards Banquet/Ceremony
&lt;br /&gt;...and an additional award...
* 5.)  The '''"DECADE OF EXCELLENCE" Award''' was also awarded each year (based on judges' scores), for the most outstanding aerospace journalist of the previous ten years.

==Trophies==

The AJOYA awards were originally trophies in the form of a bronze eagle - leading the awards to become known colloquially as 'budgies', and for the competition to become known as the 'Budgie Awards'. The design of the Trophy changed several times, becoming a representation of the Aerospace Journalist of the Year logo, and then a simple engraved glass 'spike'.

==History==
The aerospace industry's writing awards, previously for many years (1960s to mid/late-1990s), had been awarded annually by the U.S.-based [[Aviation &amp; Space Writers' Association]], at a grand banquet gathering aviation industry leaders and luminaries.  That organization and its awards program dissolved, leaving a vacuum in the aviation media world.

Starting in the late 1990s, until 2009-2010, that void was filled by a British enterprise—the [[World Leadership Forum]], Ltd. -- in collaboration with the world's two oldest aviation organizations: the [[Aero Club of France]] ([[Aéro-Club de France]]), and the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] (of the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="defensemedia_2009-07-16"&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/craig-covault-wins-2009-aerospace-journalist-of-the-year-award/ "Craig Covault Wins 2009 Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award"], Chuck Oldham (Editor) on July 16, 2009, DefenseMediaNetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Awards were issued in several "Category" topic areas (see lists below).

Contest entries (copies of published articles or broadcasts) were received from publications and authors, then copied and redistributed to judges in each category, who then narrowed the submissions down to a few finalists (the prestigious "Shortlist") in each category, which was then published on the organization website during the months leading up to the Banquet.

The "Shortlist" candidates were invited to the Awards Banquet, where they would then discover who, among them, would be awarded the "Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award" in that respective category. Then from the category winners, a tally of judges' scores determined the one overall "Aerospace Journalist of the Year,"  and one Honoree for a "Decade of Excellence" Award.

The awards were first presented in London in 1996, and throughout the years, the presentation ceremonies have alternated between [[Paris]] and [[London]]—roughly coinciding with the world's two main airshows: the Paris Air Show and Farnborough Air Show (England), held on alternate years.

In London, the AJOYA ceremonies have taken place at the Ballroom of the [[Park Lane Hotel]], [[Piccadilly]],&lt;ref name="vayu_2010"&gt;[http://www.vayuaerospace.in/vayu.htm "Vayu nominated again for The 2010 Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards"], ''Vayu Aerospace and Defence Review'', posted in 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  and at the Royal Courts of Justice and they directly preceded the biennial [[Farnborough Airshow]].

The organization depended upon aerospace industry companies to sponsor the awards, and reciprocated their generosity by offering them seating with the AJOYA finalists at the awards banquet—a public-relations opportunity for aerospace industry leaders and P.R. execs to charm their industry's leading writers and opinion-shapers.

However, remotely located from most of the world's aviation media (in London or Paris, far removed from the Americas, Africa and Asia), many aerospace writers who made the awards-finalist "Shortlists" (and were thus invited to the banquet), were unable to attend—undermining the value of the banquet, and sponsorships, to AJOYA's commercial sponsors.

The awards then began to be limited to only those writers who would make the trip to the banquet, sharply reducing eligibility for the awards.

Initially, relatively few of the world's aerospace journalists competed, and the awards were almost exclusively from the U.S. and Britain, with a few contestants from Western Europe and British Commonwealth nations.

But as the years went by, many more entered the contests, and additional categories of judging were added, and non-English entries were admitted (and translated into English for the judges), drawing contest entries from throughout the world—Russia and Eastern Europe, China and East Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Africa.

The volume of entries began to overwhelm the limited number of AJOYA judges, creating difficuties.

The global economic "Great Recession" that started in 2007 soon collapsed the aerospace industry, and forced drastic budget-tightening on nearly all aerospace companies.  "Extras"—such as support of aviation organizations and programs—were cut out of many companies' budgets.

The awards ended amid rumours that they folded due to a lack of sponsorship.

The World Leadership Forum, Ltd. organization dissolved in 2009, according to the business-info website Duedil.com.&lt;ref name="duedil_WLF" /&gt;

The AJOYA.com website is now off-line and the domain name is for sale.

There were no awards in 2011, and in 2012 a different organiser held a new Aerospace Media Awards dinner at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London.

==Judges==
Judges were chiefly leading aerospace industry editors &amp; writers, and business/technical leaders &amp; experts—largely chosen from the ranks of former AJOYA Winners or "Shortlist" finalists—from around the world.

The judges came from aerospace industry publications such as:
* [[Aero Revue]]
* [[Aviation International News]]
* [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]
* [[Business &amp; Commercial Aviation]]
* [[Flight International]]
* [[Jane's Defence Weekly]]

To ensure fair judging, judges were recused from voting on their own submissions, and from voting on any other submissions from any publication for whom they wrote, or any "sister" publication (owned by the same, or a related, company).

The final list of AJOYA judges (see below) finished with the note:
"The judges have not marked any entry from their own publication/company, or any sister publication/company"

This is the last list of Judges, which remained on the AJOYA.COM website until 2010:

"'''Anthem for a Lost Cause'''" is a song by Welsh [[alternative rock]] band [[Manic Street Preachers]]. It is the second single released from the band's eleventh studio album, ''[[Rewind the Film]]''.&lt;ref name=M1&gt;http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/news/anthem-lost-cause-second-single-taken-album-rewind-film&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Both song and lyrics were written by singer [[James Dean Bradfield]], in an interview he stated that the song was about the question of if lyrics today are as important as they were before. The song has one of the longest, if not the longest chorus of any song on the album.
The music video features Tori Lyons, who previously starred in the video for "[[Show Me the Wonder]]", reprising her role as a miner's wife in the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984 miners' strike]].&lt;ref name=M1 /&gt; The band stated that [[Kieran Evans]] was important for this video, because not only did she appear in the band's last video, but because they wanted to capture the feeling of the 80´s and how women dealt with the big miners' strike. in the video we see a woman that is trying to survive without her husband that has left her because of the conditions that they were living in.
The video shows many realities of the consequences of that 80's strike.&lt;ref name=M1 /&gt;

==Release==

The song was made available by digital download on 25 November 2013, backed up by two songs ''Death of a Digital Ghost'' and ''See It Like Sutherland''. A live version of [[She Is Suffering]] at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena]] in 2011 was also in the single digital download. It peaked on number 200 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="UK chart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20086/MANIC%20STREET%20PREACHERS/ |title=Manic Street Preachers|website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bedara Vesha''' is a folk dance performed days before Holi night in [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi town]] of [[Karnataka]]. It is also known as ‘Hunter Dance’. People of Sirsi celebrate [[Holi]] with this unique folk dance every alternate year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prasadgovenkar.com/2015/03/the-celebration-of-holi.html The Celebration of Holi]&lt;/ref&gt; It attracts a large crowd from different parts of the state on all the five days of Holi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/A-unique-folk-dance/article16633139.ece |title=A unique folk dance |publisher=thehindu.com |date=18 November 2016 |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

‘Bedara Vesha’ is a unique folk dance with a legend of 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/A-unique-folk-dance/article16633139.ece A unique folk dance - The Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, after the reign of ‘Vijayanagar Kings’, Sirsi (then Kalyanapattana) and other southern India regions were taken over and ruled by Sonda dynasty.

In Sonda region, there was always a fear of Muslims invaders attacking. In order to protect them, the rulers appointed ‘Malleshi’, a young boy from Beda community and a warrior in the Vijaynagar Empire.

Initially, Malleshi performed his duties well, but later, he became a troublemaker and a womanizer. He wanted to marry Rudrambika, who was the daughter of local leader Dasappa Shetty. She was bold and fearless; for the interest of society, she married Malleshi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kannada.oneindia.com/festivals/general/2013/holi-festival-sirsi-bedara-vesha-folk-dance-072609.html |title=Sirasiyalli disguised as offensive expression, Holi special |publisher=kannada.oneindia.com |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Holi night, while Malleshi was dancing, Rudrambika threw acid in his eyes which made him blind. He then tried chasing Rudraambika to kill her but was caught by 12 villagers and burnt alive. Back then, villagers practiced ‘Sati’ (a ritual where wife sets herself on fire on her husband’s funeral pyre)

In appreciation of rudrambika’s sacrifice, ‘Bedara Vesha’ was started and is performed even today.

==How is it done?==

The Hunter Dance is practiced for months before the actual performance. The artists are donned with peacock feathers, mustache, cotton and red cloth, fruits, shield and sword.

==Popular places where it can be found==

‘Bedara Vesha’ is performed in the [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]] town of Karnataka. Another folk dance called ‘[[Dollu Kunitha]]’ is also performed during Bedara Vesha.

==Modern Form==

Nearly 50 solo artists’ perform the hunter dance with whistle blowers and a troupe of drum beaters.

'''Brain damage''' or '''brain injury''' ('''BI''') is the destruction or degeneration of [[human brain|brain]] [[neuron|cells]]. Brain injuries occur due to a wide range of internal and external factors. In general, brain damage refers to significant, undiscriminating trauma-induced damage, while [[neurotoxicity]] typically refers to selective, chemically induced [[neuron]] damage.

A common category with the greatest number of injuries is [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) following [[physical trauma]] or [[head injury]] from an outside source, and the term [[acquired brain injury]] (ABI) is used in appropriate circles to differentiate brain injuries occurring after [[birth]] from injury, from a [[genetic disorder]], or from a [[congenital disorder]].&lt;ref name="ABI"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an Acquired Brain Injury?|url=http://www.headway.ie/download/pdf/what_is_abi.pdf|publisher=Headway|accessdate=19 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705082634/http://www.headway.ie/download/pdf/what_is_abi.pdf#|archive-date=2016-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary and secondary brain injury|Primary and secondary brain injuries]] identify the processes involved, while [[focal and diffuse brain injury]] describe the severity and localization.

Due to more recent Medical, Rehabilitation and ongoing results 'neuroplasticity' within the mechanics of our brains lead to re-arrangement of the brain's workings. These often result in the 'synapses' arranging alternate routes, to achieve previous habits. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of brain injuries vary based on the severity of the injury or how much of the brain is affected. The three categories used for classifying the severity of brain injuries are mild, moderate or severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Information-Page|title=Traumatic Brain Injury Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mild brain injuries ===
Symptoms of a mild brain injury include headaches, confusions, ringing ears, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, mood or behavior. Other symptoms include trouble with memory, concentration, attention or thinking.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/traumatic-brain-injury/basics/symptoms/con-20029302|title=Traumatic brain injury Symptoms - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental fatigue is a common debilitating experience and may not be linked by the patient to the original (minor) incident. [[Narcolepsy]] and sleep disorders are common misdiagnoses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Moderate/severe brain injuries ===
Cognitive symptoms include confusion, aggressive, abnormal behavior, slurred speech, and coma or other disorders of consciousness. Physical symptoms include headaches that do not go away or worsen, vomiting or nausea, convulsions, abnormal dilation of the eyes, inability to awaken from sleep, weakness in extremities and loss of coordination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Symptoms in children ===
Symptoms observed in children include changes in eating habits, persistent irritability or sadness, changes in attention, disrupted sleeping habits, or loss of interest in toys.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Location of brain damage predicts symptoms===
Symptoms of brain injuries can also be influenced by the location of the injury and as a result impairments are specific to the part of the brain affected. Lesion size is correlated with severity, recovery, and comprehension.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Brain injuries often create impairment or [[disability]] that can vary greatly in severity.

In cases of severe brain injuries, the likelihood of areas with permanent [[disability]] is great, including [[neurocognitive deficit]]s, [[delusion]]s (often, to be specific, [[monothematic delusion]]s), speech or movement problems, and [[intellectual disability]]. There may also be personality changes. The most severe cases result in [[coma]] or even [[persistent vegetative state]]. Even a mild incident can have long-term effects or cause symptoms to appear years later.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Studies show there is a correlation between brain lesion and language, speech, and category-specific disorders. Wernicke's aphasia is associated with [[anomic aphasia|anomia]], unknowingly making up words ([[neologisms]]), and problems with comprehension. The symptoms of Wernicke’s aphasia are caused by damage to the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnalc.org/view/2121-superior-temporal-gyrus-.html|title=Superior Temporal Gyrus :: DNA Learning Center|website=www.dnalc.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/wernickes-aphasia/|title=Wernicke's Aphasia - National Aphasia Association|newspaper=National Aphasia Association|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage to the [[Broca’s area]] typically produces symptoms like omitting functional words ([[agrammatism]]), sound production changes, [[dyslexia]], [[dysgraphia]], and problems with comprehension and production. Broca’s aphasia is indicative of damage to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/intro/course_core/lectures/aphasia_cases_slides.html|title=Broca's and Wernicke's Aphasia|last=Kean|first=Mary Louise|date=|website=www-rohan.sdsu.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An impairment following damage to a region of the brain does not necessarily imply that the damaged area is wholly responsible for the cognitive process which is impaired, however. For example, in [[pure alexia]], the ability to read is destroyed by a lesion damaging both the left visual field and the connection between the right visual field and the language areas (Broca's area and Wernicke's area). However, this does not mean one suffering from pure alexia is incapable of comprehending speech—merely that there is no connection between their working visual cortex and language areas—as is demonstrated by the fact that pure alexics can still write, speak, and even transcribe letters without understanding their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;More Brain Lesions, Kathleen V. Wilkes&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesions to the [[fusiform gyrus]] often result in [[prosopagnosia]], the inability to distinguish faces and other complex objects from each other.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Lesions in the [[amygdala]] would eliminate the enhanced activation seen in occipital and fusiform visual areas in response to fear with the area intact. Amygdala lesions change the functional pattern of activation to emotional stimuli in regions that are distant from the amygdala.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Other lesions to the [[visual cortex]] have different effects depending on the location of the damage. Lesions to [[Visual cortex|V1]], for example, can cause [[blindsight]] in different areas of the brain depending on the size of the lesion and location relative to the [[calcarine fissure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celesia|first=Gastone G.|date=2010-01-01|title=Visual Perception and Awareness|journal=Journal of Psychophysiology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=62–67|doi=10.1027/0269-8803/a000014|issn=0269-8803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions to [[Visual cortex|V4]] can cause [[color-blindness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaeger|first=W.|last2=Krastel|first2=H.|last3=Braun|first3=St.|date=1988-12-01|title=Cerebrale Achromatopsie (Symptomatik, Verlauf, Differentialdiagnose und Strategie der Untersuchung)|journal=Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde|language=de|volume=193|issue=12|pages=627–634|doi=10.1055/s-2008-1050309|issn=0023-2165|pmid=3265459}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bilateral lesions to [[Visual cortex|MT/V5]] can cause the loss of the ability to perceive motion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Lesions to the [[parietal lobes]] may result in [[agnosia]], an inability to recognize complex objects, smells, or shapes, or [[amorphosynthesis]], a loss of perception on the opposite side of the body.&lt;ref name="Denny-Brown"&gt;Denny-Brown, D., and Betty Q. Banker. "Amorphosynthesis from Left Parietal Lesion". A.M.A. Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 71, no. 3 (March 1954): 302–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-localizing features===
Brain injuries have far-reaching and varied consequences due to the nature of the brain as the main source of bodily control. Brain-injured people commonly experience issues with memory.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} This can be issues with either long or short term memories depending on the location and severity of the injury. Sometimes memory can be improved through rehabilitation, although it can be permanent. Behavioral and personality changes are also commonly observed due to changes of the brain structure in areas controlling hormones or major emotions. Headaches and pain can also occur as a result of a brain injury either directly from the damage or due to neurological conditions stemming from the injury. Due to the changes in the brain as well as the issues associated with the change in physical and mental capacity, depression and low self-esteem are common side effects that can be treated with psychological help. Antidepressants must be used with caution in brain injury people due to the potential for undesired effects because of the already altered brain chemistry.

===Long term psychological and physiological effects===
There are multiple responses of the body to [[brain injury]], occurring at different times after the initial occurrence of damage, as the functions of the [[neuron]]s, nerve tracts, or sections of the brain can be affected by damage. The immediate response can take many forms. Initially, there may symptoms such as swelling, pain, bruising, or loss of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brainline.org/content/2008/07/what-happens-immediately-after-injury_pageall.html|title=What Happens Immediately After the Injury?|access-date=2016-11-12|date=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Post-traumatic amnesia]] is also common with brain damage, as is temporary [[aphasia]], or impairment of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-definitions/|title=Aphasia Definitions - National Aphasia Association|newspaper=National Aphasia Association|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progresses, and the severity of injury becomes clear, there are further responses that may become apparent. Due to loss of blood flow or damaged tissue, sustained during the injury, [[amnesia]] and [[aphasia]] may become permanent, and [[apraxia]] has been documented in patients. Amnesia is a condition in which a person is unable to remember things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amnesia|title=Definition of AMNESIA|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aphasia]] is the loss or impairment of word comprehension or use. [[Apraxia]] is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain, and may be more common in those who have been left brain damaged, with loss of mechanical knowledge critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumard|first=Josselin|last2=Osiurak|first2=François|last3=Lesourd|first3=Mathieu|last4=Le Gall|first4=Didier|date=2014-01-01|title=Tool use disorders after left brain damage|journal=Cognition|volume=5|pages=473|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00473|pmc=4033127|pmid=24904487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headaches, occasional dizziness, or fatigue, all temporary symptoms of brain trauma, may become permanent, or may not disappear for a long time.

There are documented cases of lasting psychological effects as well, such as emotional swings often caused by damage to the various parts of the brain that control human emotions and behavior.&lt;ref name="msktc.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msktc.org/tbi/factsheets/Emotional-Problems-After-Traumatic-Brain-Injury|title=Emotional Problems After Traumatic Brain Injury|website=www.msktc.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some who have experience emotional changes related to brain damage may have emotions that come very quickly and are very intense, but have very little lasting effect.&lt;ref name="msktc.org"/&gt; Emotional changes may not be triggered by a specific event, and can be a cause of stress to the injured party and their family or friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assessment &amp; Management of Emotional Reactions to Brain Damage &amp; Aphasia|last=Währborg|first=Peter|publisher=Far Communications Ltd|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[Counseling psychology|counseling]] is suggested for those who experience this effect after their injury, and may be available as an individual or group session. It may also be covered by insurance, or offered at a discounted price, or for free. See local resource centers near you for more information.

It is important to note that the long term psychological and physiological effects will vary by person and injury. For example, perinatal brain damage has been implicated in cases of neurodevelopmental impairments and psychiatric illnesses. If any concerning symptoms, signs, or changes to behaviors are occurring, a healthcare provider should be consulted.   Different types and degrees of trauma will cause different effects, and if any concerning symptoms, signs, or changes to behaviors are occurring, a healthcare provider should be consulted.

==Body's response to brain injury==
Unlike some of the more obvious responses to brain damage, the body also has invisible physical responses which can be difficult to notice. These will generally be identified by a healthcare provider, especially as they are normal physical responses to brain damage. [[Cytokines]] are known to be induced in response to brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dammann|first=Olaf|last2=O’Shea|first2=Michael|date=2016-11-12|title=Cytokines and Perinatal Brain Damage|journal=Clinics in Perinatology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=643–v|doi=10.1016/j.clp.2008.07.011|issn=0095-5108|pmc=3657129|pmid=19026332}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have diverse actions that can cause, exacerbate, mediate and/or inhibit cellular injury and repair.  TGFβ seems to exert primarily neuroprotective actions, whereas [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNFα]] might contribute to neuronal injury and exert protective effects. IL-1 mediates ischaemic, excitotoxic, and [[Complications of traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain injury,]] probably through multiple actions on glia, neurons, and the vasculature. Cytokines may be useful in order to discover novel therapeutic strategies.

Brain injuries can result from a number of conditions including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.traumaticbraininjury.com/understanding-tbi/what-are-the-causes-of-tbi/|title=TBI: Causes of Traumatic Brain Injury|website=www.traumaticbraininjury.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[File:Coup injury.jpg|thumb|242x242px|A Coup injury occurs under the site of impact with an object, and a contrecoup injury occurs on the side opposite the area that was hit.]][[traumatic brain injury|trauma]]; multiple traumatic injuries can lead to [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]]. A [[coup-contrecoup injury]] occurs when the force impacting the head is not only strong enough to cause a contusion at the site of impact, but also able to move the brain and cause it to displace rapidly into the opposite side of the skull, causing an additional contusion.

===Chemotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] can cause brain damage to the neural [[stem cells]] and [[oligodendrocyte]] cells that produce [[myelin]]. Radiation and chemotherapy can lead to brain tissue damage by disrupting or stopping blood flow to the affected areas of the brain. This damage can cause long term effects such as but not limited to; memory loss, confusion, and loss of cognitive function. The brain damage caused by radiation depends on where the brain tumor is located, the amount of radiation used, and the duration of the treatment. Radiosurgery can also lead to tissue damage that results in about 1 in 20 patients requiring a second operation to remove the damaged tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oncolink.org/cancers/brain-tumors/treatments/possible-side-effects-of-radiation-treatment-for-brain-tumors|title=Possible Side Effects of Radiation Treatment for Brain Tumors {{!}} OncoLink|last=Prevention|first=Cancer Resources from OncoLink {{!}} Treatment, Research, Coping, Clinical Trials|website=www.oncolink.org|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/brain-tumour/treatment/radiotherapy/long-term-side-effects-of-brain-tumour-radiotherapy|title=Long Term Side Effects of Brain Tumour Radiotherapy|last=|first=|date=October 22, 2015|website=Cancer Research UK|publisher=|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome===
[[Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome]] can cause brain damage and results from a Vitamin B deficiency. This syndrome presents with two conditions, Wernicke’s encephalopathy and [[Korsakoff psychosis]]. Typically Wernicke’s encephalopathy precedes symptoms of [[Korsakoff psychosis]]. Wernicke’s encephalopathy causes bleeding in the thalamus or hypothalamus, which controls the nervous and endocrine system. Due to the bleeding, brain damage occurs causing problems with vision, coordination and balance. [[Korsakoff psychosis]] typically follow after the symptoms of Wernicke’s decrease and result from chronic brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000771.htm|title=Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korsakoff psychosis]] affect memory. [[Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome]] is typically caused by chronic alcohol abuse or by conditions that affect nutritional absorption, including colon cancer, eating disorders and gastric bypass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome#Treatments6|title=Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome|newspaper=Healthline|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iatrogenic===
Brain lesions are sometimes intentionally inflicted during [[neurosurgery]], such as the carefully placed brain lesion used to treat [[epilepsy]] and other brain disorders. These lesions are induced by excision or by electric shocks (electrolytic lesions) to the exposed brain or commonly by infusion of excitotoxins to specific areas.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Lehmann, Mumby, Woodside. "Differential Fos Expression Following Aspiration, Electrolytic, or Excitotoxic Lesions of the Perirhinal Cortex in Rats"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffuse axonal===
Diffuse axonal injury is caused by [[shearing force]]s on the brain leading to lesions in the white matter tracts of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vieira RC, Paiva WS, de Oliveira DV, Teixeira MJ, de Andrade AF, de Sousa RM | title = Diffuse Axonal Injury: Epidemiology, Outcome and Associated Risk Factors | journal = Frontiers in Neurology | volume = 7 | pages = 178 | date = 2016-10-20 | pmid = 27812349 | doi = 10.3389/fneur.2016.00178 | pmc = 5071911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These shearing forces are seen in cases where the brain had a sharp rotational acceleration, and is caused by the difference in density between white matter and grey matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-axonal-injury|title=Diffuse axonal injury |publisher=Radiopaedia|last=Gaillard|first=Frank|name-list-format = vanc |website=radiopaedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS) is the most widely used scoring system used to assess the level of severity of a brain injury. This method is based on the objective observations of specific traits to determine the severity of a brain injury. It is based on three traits eye opening, verbal response, and motor response, gauged as described below.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brainline.org/content/2010/10/what-is-the-glasgow-coma-scale.html|title=What Is the Glasgow Coma Scale?|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Glasgow Coma Scale severity is classified as follows, severe brain injuries score 3-8, moderate brain injuries score 9-12 and mild score 13-15.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There are several imaging techniques that can aid in diagnosing and assessing the extent of brain damage, such as [[computed tomography]] (CT) scan, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) and [[magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (MRS), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).  CT scans and MRI are the two techniques widely used and are most effective. CT scans can show brain bleeds, fractures of the skull, fluid build up in the brain that will lead to increased cranial pressure. MRI is able to better to detect smaller injuries, detect damage within the brain, diffuse axonal injury, injuries to the brainstem, posterior fossa, and subtemporal and subfrontal regions. However patients with pacemakers, metallic implants, or other metal within their bodies are unable to have an MRI done. Typically the other imaging techniques are not used in a clinical setting because of the cost, lack of availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation|last=Watanabe|first=Thomas|last2=Marino|first2=Michael|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-179329-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Access Medicine|date=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
===Acute===
The treatment for emergency traumatic brain injuries focuses on assuring the person has enough oxygen from the brain blood supply, and on  maintaining normal blood pressure to avoid further injuries of the head or neck. The person may need surgery to remove clotted blood or repair skull fractures, for which cutting a hole in the [[skull]] may be necessary. Medicines used for traumatic injuries are [[diuretic]]s, [[anti-seizure]] or [[coma]]-inducing drugs. Diuretics reduce the fluid in tissues lowering the pressure on the brain. In the first week after a traumatic brain injury, a person may have a risk of seizures, which anti-seizure drugs help prevent. Coma-inducing drugs may be used during surgery to reduce impairments and restore blood flow.

In the case of brain damage from [[traumatic brain injury]], dexamethasone and/or [[Mannitol]] may be used.

===Chronic===
Various professions may be involved in the medical care and [[physical therapy|rehabilitation]] of someone suffering impairment after a brain injury. [[Neurologist]]s, [[neurosurgeon]]s, and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|physiatrists]] are [[physician]]s specialising in treating brain injury. [[Neuropsychology|Neuropsychologists]] (especially [[clinical neuropsychology|clinical neuropsychologists]]) are [[psychologist]]s specialising in understanding the effects of brain injury and may be involved in assessing the severity or creating [[rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] strategies. [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapists]] may be involved in running rehabilitation programs to help restore lost function or help re-learn essential skills. [[Registered nurse]]s, such as those working in hospital [[intensive care unit]]s, are able to maintain the health of the severely brain-injured with constant administration of medication and neurological monitoring, including the use of the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] used by other health professionals to quantify extent of orientation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Physiotherapists]] also play a significant role in rehabilitation after a [[brain injury]].  In the case of a [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBIs), physiotherapy treatment during the post-acute phase may include: sensory stimulation, serial casting and splinting, fitness and aerobic training, and functional training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hellweg|first=Stephanie|author2=Johannes, Stonke|title=Physiotherapy after traumatic brain injury: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Brain Injury|date=February 2008|volume=22|issue=5|pages=365–373|pmid=18415716|doi=10.1080/02699050801998250}}&lt;!--|accessdate=May 8, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory stimulation refers to regaining sensory perception through the use of modalities. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of this intervention.&lt;ref name="watson233"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Martin|title=Do patients with severe traumatic brain injury benefit from physiotherapy?

Evidence based research reveals that serial casting can be used to increase passive range of motion (PROM) and decrease [[spasticity]].&lt;ref name="watson233"/&gt; Studies also report that fitness and aerobic training will increase [[cardiovascular fitness]]; however the benefits will not be transferred to the functional level.&lt;ref name="turner1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner-Stokes|first=L|author2=Disler, P. |author3=Nair, A. |author4= Wade, T. |title=Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for acquired brain injury in adults of working age|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2005|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–45|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub2|pmid=16034923}}&lt;!--|accessdate=May 8, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Functional training may also be used to treat patients with TBIs.

Other treatments for brain injury include [[medication]], [[psychotherapy]], [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|neuropsychological rehabilitation]], [[snoezelen]], [[surgery]], or physical implants such as [[deep brain stimulation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Prognosis==
{{Medical citations needed|section|date=September 2016}}
Prognosis, or the likely progress of a disorder, depends on the nature, location, and cause of the brain damage (see [[Traumatic brain injury]], [[Focal and diffuse brain injury]], [[Primary and secondary brain injury]]).

In general, [[neuroregeneration]] can occur in the [[peripheral nervous system]] but is much rarer and more difficult to assist in the [[central nervous system]] (brain or spinal cord). However, in [[neural development in humans]], areas of the brain can learn to compensate for other damaged areas, and may increase in size and complexity and even change function, just as someone who loses a sense may gain increased acuity in another sense - a process termed [[neuroplasticity]].

There are many misconceptions that revolve around brain injuries and brain damage. One misconception is that if someone has brain damage then they cannot fully recover. Recovery depends a variety of factors; such as severity and location. Testing is done to note severity and location. Not everyone fully heals from brain damage, but it is possible to have a full recovery. Brain injuries are very hard to predict in outcome. Many tests and specialists are needed to determine the likelihood of the prognosis. People with minor brain damage can have debilitating side effects; not just severe brain damage has debilitating effects.&lt;ref name="Holtz"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://taskandpurpose.com/10-myths-about-traumatic-brain-injury/|title=10 Myths About Traumatic Brain Injury|last=Holtz|first=Pamela|date=2015-06-09|newspaper=Task &amp; Purpose|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side- effects of a brain injury depend on location and the body’s response to injury.&lt;ref name="Holtz"/&gt; Even a mild [[concussion]] can have long term effects that may not resolve.&lt;ref name="Myths &amp; Facts About TBI"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbirt.org/tbi-education/about-tbi/myths-facts-about-tbi/|title=Myths &amp; Facts About TBI|website=cbirt.org|access-date=2016-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127231739/http://cbirt.org/tbi-education/about-tbi/myths-facts-about-tbi/|archive-date=2016-11-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another misconception is that children heal better from brain damage. Children are at greater risk for injury due to lack of maturity. It makes future development hard to predict.&lt;ref name="Myths &amp; Facts About TBI"/&gt; {{dead link|date=November 2018}} This is because different [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] areas mature at different stages, with some major cell populations and their corresponding cognitive faculties remaining unrefined until early adulthood. In the case of a child with [[Frontal lobe|frontal brain]] injury, for example, the impact of the damage may be undetectable until that child fails to develop normal executive functions in his or her late teens and early twenties.

== History ==
The foundation for understanding human behavior and brain injury can be attributed to the case of [[Phineas Gage]] and the famous case studies by Paul Broca. The first case study on Phineas Gage’s head injury is one of the most astonishing brain injuries in history. In 1848, Phineas Gage was paving way for a new railroad line when he encountered an accidental explosion of a tamping iron straight through his frontal lobe. Gage observed to be intellectually unaffected but exemplified post injury behavioral deficits. These deficits include: becoming sporadic, disrespectful, extremely profane, and gave no regard for other workers. Gage started having seizures in February, dying only four months later on May 21, 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haas L. F. | year = 2001 | title = Phineas Gage and the Science of Brain Localisation | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 6| page = 761 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.71.6.761| pmid = 11723197 | pmc = 1737620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, [[Paul Broca]] examined two patients exhibiting impaired speech due to frontal lobe injuries. Broca’s first patient lacked productive speech. He saw this as an opportunity to address language localization. It wasn’t until Leborgne, formally known as "tan", died when Broca confirmed the frontal lobe lesion from an autopsy. The second patient had similar speech impairments, supporting his findings on language localization. The results of both cases became a vital verification of the relationship between speech and the left cerebral hemisphere. The affected areas are known today as [[Broca's area|Broca’s area]] and Broca’s Aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Dronkers, N. F., O. Plaisant, M. T. Iba-Zizen, and E. A. Cabanis. "Paul Broca's Historic Cases: High Resolution MR Imaging of the Brains of Leborgne and Lelong." Brain : A Journal of Neurology130.5 (2007): 1432-441. Web. 31 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, a German neuroscientist, [[Carl Wernicke]], consulted on a stroke patient. The patient experienced neither speech nor hearing impairments, but suffered from a few brain deficits. These deficits included: lacking the ability to comprehend what was spoken to him and the words written down. After his death, Wernicke examined his autopsy that found a lesion located in the left temporal region. This area became known as [[Wernicke's area]]. Wernicke later hypothesized the relationship between Wernicke's area and Broca's area, which was proven fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guenther|first=Katja|date=2013-11-01|title=THE DISAPPEARING LESION: SIGMUND FREUD, SENSORY-MOTOR PHYSIOLOGY, AND THE BEGINNINGS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/div-classtitlethe-disappearing-lesion-sigmund-freud-sensory-motor-physiology-and-the-beginnings-of-psychoanalysisa-hreffn01-ref-typefnadiv/21AD951927A8370F6DF2C4C433556AAE|journal=Modern Intellectual History|volume=10|issue=3|pages=569–601|doi=10.1017/S147924431300022X|issn=1479-2443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">The '''chaos cloud''' is a hoax that originated in a ''[[Weekly World News]]'' article in September 2005. It was published online at [[Yahoo!]] Entertainment News. According to the article, the chaos cloud is a massive object in outer space that "dissolves everything in its path, including comets, asteroids, planets and entire stars", and is due to reach Earth in 2014.

The hoax article generated a large amount of discussion online, as people attempted to discern whether or not it was genuine. Articles on the subject appeared at a diverse range of sites, such as [[Phil Plait#Badastronomy.com|Bad Astronomy]], [[Whirlpool (website)|Whirlpool]], [[Free Republic]] and [[Overclockers Australia]]. It has been debunked on [[Snopes]] and other urban legends sites.

== Rebel attack and capture of Eastern Aleppo ==
[[File:Map of northern Aleppo Governorate on 20 July 2012.png|thumb|Map of northern Aleppo on 20 July 2012]]
Gunfire between rebels and security forces broke out on the night of 19 July 2012 in and around Salaheddine, a district in the city's southwest portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Jul-20/181348-fierce-fighting-in-syrias-aleppo-ngo.ashx#axzz21EXLhUyc |title=Fierce fighting in Syria's Aleppo:activists |date=20 July 2012 |work=The Daily Star |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the district had a strong rebel presence before the battle began, or was captured by opposition fighters coming from the outskirts. Meanwhile, thousands of rebel soldiers from Aleppo's northern and eastern countryside began to move towards the city.

Fighting in Salaheddine continued into the next day, as the Syrian Army began shelling rebel-controlled districts with artillery and attack helicopters. By the early afternoon of 21 July, rebel forces had penetrated Aleppo's northeastern neighborhoods of Haydariya and Sakhour, where they clashed with the Syrian Army. The fighting drove many residents to safer areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/first-time-we-feel-aleppo-has-turned-battle-zone-housewife-aleppo-says |title="For the first time we feel Aleppo has turned into a battle zone," a housewife in Aleppo says. |date=21 July 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, fighting had spread from Salaheddine and neighboring Saif al-Dawla to al-Jameeliya and its surrounding neighborhoods near the city center,&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-22/syrian-rebels-take-fight-to-aleppo-after-seizing-border-posts#p1 |title=Syrian Rebels Battle for Aleppo After Seizing Border Posts |author=Zaid Sabah and Glen Carey |date=22 July 2012 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a battle for the city's main intelligence headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/rebels-reportedly-battle-government-forces-near-intelligence-headquarters-aleppo |title=Rebels reportedly battle government forces near intelligence headquarters in Aleppo |date=22 July 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next day, rebels on the eastern front captured Helweniyeh, and according to a rebel commander, Hanano and the industrial area of [[Shaykh Najjar|Sheikh Najjar]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/fsa-says-several-districts-aleppo-liberated |title=FSA says several districts of Aleppo "liberated" |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, continuing clashes near the city center included a rebel attack on the state TV station and the central prison, where a massacre conducted by security forces had taken place, according to activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/eight-people-killed-prison-mutiny-syrias-second-city-aleppo-during-night-opposition-says |title=Eight people killed in a prison mutiny in Syria's second city of Aleppo during the night, opposition says. |date=24 July 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the day, power was out in much of the city.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18952891 |title=Battle for Aleppo: Syrians react |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fighting in the city center and army reinforcements ==

On 24 July 2012, according to [[Al Jazeera]], the FSA launched an offensive to take the city center, leading to heavy fighting near the gates of the Old City, a United Nations [[World heritage site]]. Rebel forces on the eastern front continued to push westwards. The FSA set up checkpoints in the eastern al-Sahkour district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/syrian-activist-tweets-warning-what-he-says-are-fsa-roadblocks |title=Syrian activist Tweets warning on what he says are FSA roadblocks|publisher=Al Jazeera |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the Syrian Army employed fighter jets for the first time to bomb rebel-held districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/24/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE8610SH20120724 |title=Syria sends armored column to Aleppo, strikes from air |author=Khaled Yacoub Oweis and Erika Solomon |date=24 July 2012 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next two days, the government sent thousands of reinforcements to Aleppo. The troops were sent mostly via the M5 highway connecting Damascus and Aleppo from the city's south, and the main Aleppo-Latakia road from the city's west. Rebels conducted deadly attacks on arriving troops. Among the reinforcements that massed on the outskirts of Aleppo were special forces units. By day's end 10,000 soldiers had massed around Aleppo and its countryside.&lt;ref name="fears"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/jul/27/syria-us-fears-aleppo-massacre-live#block-17#block-31 |title=Syria crisis: US fears Aleppo 'massacre' |date=27 July 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=29 July 2012 |location=London |first1=Matthew |last1=Weaver |first2=Brian |last2=Whitaker}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, 1,500 to 2,000 rebel fighters from around northern Syria arrived to assist the 2,000 already fighting.&lt;ref name="gather"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/syrian-forces-gather-aleppo-assault |title=Syrian forces gather for Aleppo assault |author=Luke Harding and Ian Black |date=26 July 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=29 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting raged in the Old City and in the central districts of Jamaliya, Kalasseh, and Bustan al-Qasr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Aleppo+in+for+major+battle&amp;NewsID=341007 |title=Aleppo in for major battle |date=25 July 2012 |work=The Himalayan Times |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July, skirmishes occurred on the outskirts as reinforcements continued to arrive. Rebel forces advanced to the central district of Fardous, despite continued bombardment.&lt;ref name="fears" /&gt; Kurdish fighters, who had gained control over most of the northern districts of [[Sheikh Maqsood|Sheikh Maqsud]] and Al-Ashrafiya, clashed with Syrian troops a day after they attacked a Kurdish convoy on the airport road.&lt;ref name="kurdish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/3/318894/ |title=Kurdish forces kill six Syrian soldiers in Aleppo |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=Kurdistan News Agency |accessdate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108095353/http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/3/318894/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salaheddine raid ==

On the morning of 28 July 2012, the Syrian Army started an attack against Salaheddine district, which held the largest concentration of rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=423149 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104052912/http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=423149 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2013 |title=Syrian army launches Aleppo counter-offensive, activists say |date=28 July 2012 |publisher=Now Lebanon |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assault commenced with an eight-hour artillery bombardment, which started at four in the morning, after which tanks and ground troops moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skynews.com.au/topstories/article.aspx?id=777067 |title=Syria rebels fend off Aleppo assault |date=29 July 2012 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the clashes, rebels, providing unverified video footage, claimed to have shot down a government helicopter gunship, a rare feat. Rebels also claimed that 8–10 tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bostonglobe.com/2012/07/27/syria/A6mTjwStmy8t0ebLx9wUMJ/story.html |title=Syrian forces reportedly kill 12 in Aleppo |author=Kareem Fahim |date=27 July 2012 |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|title='Tragedy brewing' as Syria launches Aleppo assault|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/syria-launches-aleppo-attack/story-fnejlrpu-1226437715385|work=News Limited|date=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebel forces attacked a strategic police station in the city center for the third day, in an attempt to link up with opposition forces in the northeastern Sakhour district on the eastern front.&lt;ref name="ngo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/news/syria-launches-aleppo-attack/story-fnejlrpu-1226437715385 |title='Tragedy brewing' as Syria launches Aleppo assault |date=29 July 2012 |publisher=news.com.au |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/hell-in-aleppo-as-syrian-troops-bombard-rebels/story-e6frg6so-1226437775325 |title=Syrian troops bombard rebels in Aleppo |date=29 July 2012 |work=The Australian |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the day, the rebels had repelled the assault, but the bombardment continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebels-survive-regime-onslaught-aleppo-192314241.html |title=Syrian rebels survive regime onslaught in Aleppo |author=Paul Schemm |date=28 July 2012 |work=Yahoo |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the FSA fighters killed was a battalion commander.&lt;ref name="ngo" /&gt; On the next day, fighting continued in Salaheddine.

== Continued rebel advance ==

In late July and early August 2012, the FSA continued its offensive in Aleppo, with both sides suffering high casualties. Rebel commanders said their main aim was to capture the city center.&lt;ref name="armypounds"&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon |first=Erika |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/31/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE86H18C20120731 |title=Syrian army pounds Aleppo, rebels claim successes |publisher=Reuters |date=31 July 2012|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels [[Battle of Anadan|seized a strategic checkpoint in the town of Anadan]] north of Aleppo, gaining a direct route between the city and the Turkish border, an important rebel supply base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/syrian-rebels-seize-strategic-checkpoint-between-aleppo-and-turkey-according-rebel |title=Syrian rebels seize strategic checkpoint between Aleppo and Turkey, according to rebel officer |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also captured [[Al-Bab]], northeast of the city with an army base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2012/07/201273154349545922.html|title=Rebels claim victory in Syria's al-Bab town|date=31 July 2012 |work=Al Jazeera |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, rebels attacked the Minakh air base, 30&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Aleppo, with arms and tanks captured at the Anadan checkpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-1-124473-Rebels-use-tanks-to-attack-air-base |title=Rebels use tanks to attack air base |publisher=The News |date= |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805025858/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-1-124473-Rebels-use-tanks-to-attack-air-base |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition forces continued to make territorial gains in the city, controlling most of eastern and southwestern Aleppo, including Salaheddine and parts of Hamdaniyeh.&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ambushes-and-air-strikes-as-syrian-regime-fight-rebels-streetbystreet-to-gain-possession-of-aleppo-7994450.html |title=Ambushes and air strikes as Syrian regime fight rebels street-by-street to gain possession of Aleppo |author=Kim Sengupta |date=31 July 2012 |work=The Independent |accessdate=31 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to target security centers and police stations, as clashes erupted near the Air Force intelligence headquarters in Aleppo's northwestern Zahraa district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/syrian-forces-blast-rebel-held-districts-aleppo-according-activists |title=Syrian forces blast rebel-held districts of Aleppo, according to activists |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels overran several police stations and posts in the central and southern districts of Bab al-Nerab, Al-Miersa, and Salhain, seizing significant amounts of arms and ammunition.&lt;ref name="independent1" /&gt;

The Army appeared to have made little effort in sending ground forces to recapture the central and southern districts.&lt;ref name="independent1" /&gt; The loyalist al-Barre militia began to clash with rebel forces in southern Aleppo and near the city's southeastern international airport.

Armored units inched forward on Salahaddine from the south and west. Military snipers deployed on rooftops and tanks were stationed in the streets. Snipers were also positioned in the local roundabout where they prevented rebel reinforcements and supplies from entering the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shalchi |first=Hadeel Al |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/07/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE8610SH20120807 |title=Syrian forces encircle rebels in Aleppo stronghold |publisher=Reuters |date=7 August 2012|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebel withdrawal from Salaheddine ==

[[File:Aleppians waiting in a bread line during the Syrian civil war.jpg|thumb|Aleppines waiting in a bread line while shelling continues.]]
On the morning of 8 August 2012, the Syrian military launched an offensive to retake Salaheddine, a rebel stronghold that an important southern supply route. The military hoped to link up with troops at the Aleppo Citadel. Rebel fighters were reportedly low on ammunition and exhausted. After intense fighting and shelling in the district throughout the day, half a dozen Army tanks breached the center. In the early morning of the next day, artillery shelling intensified as more tanks moved in. FSA units began to depart. By mid-morning, hundreds of rebel fighters were pulling out of the district, with some leaving the city.

Fighting took place at dawn 12 September in [[Al-Nayrab]] area, five kilometres north of the airport in response to a rebel attack on the airport; the airport remained fully operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria army, rebels clash near Aleppo airport |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/312067/syria-rebels-kill-18-soldiers-at-idlib |work=Bangkok Post |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September, SANA said the Syrian Army took the Agricultural Institute and areas of al-Quran Mosque and Ali Nasser Agha School in Suleiman al-Halabi.

According to multiple sources, a new opposition offensive began on 27 September 2012, which promised to be "zero hour" in the start of a "decisive battle" to capture the city.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Karouny |first=Mariam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/27/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE88J0X720120927 |title=Syria rebels say launch "decisive battle" in Aleppo |publisher=Reuters |date=27 September 2012|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebel commander said they wanted to surprise the Army, which had started to creep forward towards the southern neighborhoods. He claimed the Tawhid brigade was enticing the Army forward. The operation included 6,000 fighters of the Tawhid brigade, in addition to brigades such as al-Fatah and Ahfad al-Fatiheen for the Turkmen. Weapons and ammunition captured during the attack on the Hananou base were used.

On the second day of the offensive, there was a growing threat of clashes between the rebels and a Kurdish militia believed to be linked to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]. The rebels, who grew suspicious over some Kurdish militants' ties with the government, also threatened to confront groups they said were linked to the PKK in neighboring Turkey.  Tawhid Brigade commander [[Abdul Qader Saleh]], requested that the Kurdish militia surrender and "not drag themselves into a losing battle that is not their fight."

It was the first time that substantial government or rebel forces moved into Kurdish areas. The area had been regarded as neutral with Kurdish militia clashing with both rebel and army units. The rebel unit responsible was allegedly the Liwa al-Tawhid brigade who reportedly told the locals that ''We are here to spend Eid with you''. Ashrafiyeh is important as a part of the city heights and controls routes between the north and south of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="kurdisharea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1704757/Syrian-rebels-take-Aleppo-Kurdish-area |title=Syrian rebels take Aleppo Kurdish area |publisher=Sbs.com.au |date=|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/10/201210258572215445.html |title=Syria violence flares ahead of possible truce |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous rebel attempts to move into the district had been repelled.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Rebels were reported to have taken control of the Syriac quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/25/245909.html |title=Russia says U.S. coordinates weapon deliveries to Syria rebels |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyst [[Joshua Landis]] said that according to reports he had received, the Syrian army had retreated from the Aleppo center, allowing the FSA to control the central Christian neighborhoods of Jedida and Qadime. The claims were unverified due to a lack of reporters on the ground.&lt;ref name="crucialgains"&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Weaver and Brian Whitaker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/25/syria-conflict-ceasefire-doubts-live#block-50892e83b5794584b1c13f66 |title=Rebels said to make crucial gains in Aleppo |publisher=Guardian |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locals from the Armenian district of Al-Zukur said that the FSA had entered their district leading to clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/news/126130.html |title=Clashes continue in Armenian-populated district of Aleppo |publisher=News.am |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aide to colonel [[Riad al-Asaad]] confirmed the reports of the FSA's recent advances and claimed that the rebels captured the Salaheddine district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Surk |first=Barbara |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2019516092_apmlsyria.html |title=Activists: Rebels make advances in Aleppo |publisher=Seattle Times|date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesman of the Liwaa al Shabhah brigade claimed that the FSA had limited the Syrian army to five districts.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Weaver and Brian Whitaker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/25/syria-conflict-ceasefire-doubts-live#block-50892e83b5794584b1c13f66 |title=Syria accepts ceasefire with conditions |publisher=Guardian |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear whether the rebels had the strength to hold the new areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/25/top-un-official-urges-syrian-rebels-assad-regime-to-observe-cease-fire/ |title=Syria regime agrees to holiday cease-fire amid fighting in Aleppo |publisher=Fox News|date=25 October 2012|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were indications that the rebels had been forced out of some areas by late afternoon, with one resident saying that the government forces were fighting fiercely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fielding |first=Abigail |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/68a1a246-1eb5-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AKImfaox |title=Battle for Aleppo intensifies |publisher=Financial Times |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October, one FSA fighter told the Guardian that their main focus was on security branches the Syrian army used as bases. He said that rebels were in the process of besieging the Midan security branch and stopped Army reinforcements from getting to the [[Khan al-Asal Police Academy|police school in Khan al-Assal district]] which had been under FSA siege for 10 days. The fighter claimed that the Ashrafiya take-over by the rebels was the result of a deal with the PKK.&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;

SANA said that the Army had recaptured the Syrian-French Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terrorists Chased and Killed in different Syrian Provinces |url=http://sana.sy/eng/337/2012/10/25/449064.htm |agency=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rebels believed that the increased talk of a truce from the Syrian government was an effort to stop rebel gains and to use the four days of Eid to reinforce their forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macfarquhar |first=Neil |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/middleeast/syrian-military-declares-four-day-holiday-truce.html|title=Syrian Military Declares Holiday Truce, but Will Respond to Rebel Attacks|location=Syria |publisher=The New York Times |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a rebel commander claimed that the FSA were fighting in Arqoub, Siryan, Zahra and Firqan districts and had secured Suleiman al Halabi. Local activists claimed fierce clashes were occurring around the Airport and that rebels were trying to besiege the Nairab base just south of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/25/top-un-official-hopes-syria-cease-fire-will-take-place-but-no-guarantees-it/ |title=Syrian regime says it will honor 4-day holiday truce, as rebels gain ground in Aleppo |publisher=Fox News |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center of Aleppo was reported to be in rebel hands with snipers in positions to block counterattacks. The retreat from the city center was seen as either a government trap or signs that the rebel tactic of attacking the government's supply lines was working. Another question was whether the government was prepared to bomb Christian and Kurdish areas, like other rebel-held areas in the past, and risk dragging them into the rebel camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sebastian Usher |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20087416 |title=Syria army 'to observe ceasefire' over Eid al-Adha |publisher=BBC |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels who had taken the predominantly Christian areas and Jdeidah, where [[Lawrence of Arabia]] once stayed, reported intimidation by the rebels who feared retaliation from both sides in the conflict.

It was reported that government tanks moved into Faisal street, the main thoroughfare running the length of the Christian districts of al-Jadide and Qadime, forcing the rebels to make a tactical retreat back into the Kurdish Ashrafiyya district. The tanks positioned themselves at Ashrafiyeh district the next day, leading some to fear the possibility of the district being shelled, although the tanks did not open fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Weaver and Brian Whitaker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/26/syria-eid-ceasefire-live |title=Syria conflict: Eid al-Adha ceasefire – live updates |publisher=Guardian |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kurdish activists claimed that army howitzers shelled Ashrafiyya, leaving 15 people dead including 8 Kurds.

On 18 November, rebels stormed the home base of the 46th Regiment in nearby [[Urum al-Sughra]], securing the base the following day in a key strategic victory following a [[Siege of Base 46|two-month siege]]. The fall of Base 46 has further isolated government troops fighting in Aleppo as well as in Idlib Province while simultaneously providing the rebels with secure supply routes from the Turkish border and much-needed ammunition and heavy weaponry. The nearby army base at Sheikh Suleiman remained in government hands, though rebel forces had stepped up their attacks on it in the aftermath of Base 46's capture.

On 22 November, a building next to a major Aleppo hospital was targeted by an airstrike that killed at least 15 people according to the SOHR, including at least 11 rebels, a doctor and three children. The Dar al-Shifa hospital was a private clinic before it was turned into a field hospital by opposition forces. It has been targeted at least six times in recent months, mainly affecting the upper floors of the seven-story high building.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers}}
The '''descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|''Bounty'' mutineers]]''' and their [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] consorts include the modern-day [[Pitcairn Islanders]] as well as a little less than half of the population of [[Norfolk Island]]. Their descendants also live in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Because of the scarcity of people on the island, many of the mutineers' children and grandchildren intermarried, with some marrying cousins and second cousins. Occasionally a new person would arrive on the island bringing with them a new surname (like the American Samuel Russell Warren, whose descendants still live on the island today).

* [[Thomas Colman Christian]] (1 November 1935{{spaced ndash}}died 7 July 2013) known as the "Voice of Pitcairn" for his nearly lifelong role in keeping the island connected to the world via ham radio, died at age 77 on the island where he was born. He was a great-great-great-grandson of Fletcher Christian. In 1957, while working on a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]-sponsored dive off Pitcairn, Christian helped salvage some of the sunken remains of the Bounty, including its old hull fittings. Tom was the son of Frederick Christian, grandson of Daniel Christian, great-grandson of Thursday Christian, and great-great-grandson of Friday Christian, who himself, was the son of Fletcher Christian. The cause of Tom's death was complications of a recent stroke, said his daughter Jacqueline Christian.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Tom Christian, Descendant of Bounty Mutineer, Dies at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/world/asia/tom-christian-descendant-of-bounty-mutineer-dies-at-77.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the many [[list of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands|rulers of the Pitcairn Islands]] have been descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers, till this day.

In 1935 - in the wake of their successful American blockbuster movie ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', which premiered that year - the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]] also shot a short documentary with the title "Pitcairn Island Today" (a Eugene H. Roth production, narrated by Carey Wilson).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykgDX-dYN6g''Pitcairn Island Today (1935)''], accessed on 14 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301732/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm''Pitcairn Island Today (1935) - Full Cast &amp; Crew''], accessed on 14 December 2014. NB! the film poster on this page erroneously depicts that of the blockbuster movie!&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of some of the descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers, who were natives of Pitcairn and inhabitants of the only village of the island, [[Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands|Adamstown]].

The list of descendants mentioned and presented in this MGM documentary includes:

* William Christian, approx. 60–70 years old (judging by appearance), farmer, presented as "Fletcher Christians great grandson".
* Benjamin Young, 84 years old (i.e. born around 1851), blacksmith, presented as the "great grandson of a happy young Midshipman of the Bounty" (that would be [[Ned Young|Edward "Ned" Young]]).
* Edward Christian, approx. 55–60 years old (judging by appearance), stonecutter, presumably another descendant of Fletcher Christian.
* "Pastor Christian", pastor and mayor of the island. Most likely he is to be identified as [[Edgar Allen Christian]] (at that time 52 years old, an age corresponding to his appearance in the video). Furthermore, this assumption is based on the fact that he (as seen later in the footage) appears to have signed a marriage announcement in his function of being the "Magistrate" of the island (see below). In earlier and later years, however, Edgar A. Christian's cousin [[Charles Richard Parkin Christian]] too held this double office of being both the religious leader as well as the Chief Magistrate of Pitcairn (cf. [[List of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamps.gov.pn/ParkinChristian.html''Prominent Pitcairners - Part I: Parkin Christian''], accessed on 14 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* (Aunt) Annie McCoy, 70–80 years old (judging by appearance), descendant of Able Seaman [[William McCoy (mutineer)|William McCoy]].
* Rebecca Young, approx. 12–20 years old (judging by appearance), presumably another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young.
* Allan Christian and Eva Christian, a couple (of likely young age?) whose intention of marriage is officially signed and publicly announced by "Edgar Christian - Magistrate" (during the time of shooting the documentary).
* David Young, a newborn baby (who nearly died because the doctor came by ship from abroad and almost arrived too late), yet another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young.

On top of those, three more people are mentioned in the MGM documentary: Andrew Warren (grandson of a whaler who came to Pitcairn around 1875, thus being no descendant of the mutineers), as well as Dora Warren and Roy Clark, whose exact direct descent from the mutineers (or lack of such) remains unclear, when judging only from the information that the documentary reveals.

A 1962 documentary, ''Pitcairn People'' (directed by [[Peter Newington]], narrated by [[Patrick Wymark]]), was produced by the [[British Petroleum Company]]. It featured many of the island residents of that time. Another documentary, ''Miracle on Pitcairn Island'', was produced in the 1960s by the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]] (filmed and written by Eric Were, narrated by Neal C. Wilson). It featured many of the same residents.

The '''Free and Open Source Software Asia-Pacific Consultation''', or '''FOSSAP''', was an event promoting [[free software|free and open source software]] held twice in Asia, in 2004 and 2005. The first event was held in March 2004 in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], while the second event was held in September 2005 in [[Siem Reap]], [[Cambodia]].

==Organisers==
[[Image:Fossapflags.jpg|thumb|Flags from across Asia, at FOSSAP II.]]
FOSSAP was organised by the [[International Open Source Network]], which is part of the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme]]. FOSSAP-II was sponsored by UNDP-APDIP with [[Intel Corporation]] as its co-sponsors. Local hosts were the [[National ICT Development Authority]] (NiDA) of Cambodia and the [[Open Forum]], Cambodia.

==Goals==
According to the organisers, FOSSAP II was aimed at providing "an effective policy-level platform for the exchange of information and experiences in the use of [[free software|Free and Open Source Software]] (FOSS) for development". FOSS has earlier been described [[Alternative terms for free software|as FLOSS]], or Free/Libre and Open Source Software.

They also argued that "there is a growing need for awareness on the benefits of FOSS, assistance with formulation of national policies, and case studies of FOSS implementation. This consultation sees its primary target as policy-makers "who can influence national Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policies".

== FOSSAP-II ==
FOSSAP-II was a three-day event, held September 1–3, 2005, in [[Siem Reap]]. It had participants from twenty countries in Asia, including FOSS campaigners, supporters, funders, software developers and government officials. The focus was on capacity building, localisation, development paradigms of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), open content, and e-governance.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Iosnpublications.jpg|thumb|right|IOSN-published e-primers and a live CD.]] --&gt;

Cambodian deputy prime minister [[Sok An]], in a speech delivered on his behalf, argued that Free and Open Source Software could help a country like [[Cambodia]] to have a "lot of savings in license fees", make software readily available locally and reduce usage costs drastically, eliminate software piracy, and enable Cambodian students to closely study the software code and "understand its behaviour".

[[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the [[Free Software Foundation]], said at the end of the conference: "People here represent a broad spectrum in beliefs and their goals. There are people from both the [[Free Software]] and [[Open Source]] movements. It looks like we can work together and make programs that ensure users can be in control of the software they use. I've seen a lot of useful things come up here."

[[Software localisation]]—or translating software into local languages—was another issue strongly discussed. There were interesting issues that came up about localisation of software into the [[Khmer language]]. One of the suggestions to come up was that FOSS needed its "global ambassador" to promote its case. [[Image:Kharilandsunil.jpg|thumb|Kharil Yusuf (left) of Malaysia and Sunil Abraham (India), managers of the IOSN. Photographed at FOSSAPII, Cambodia September 2005.]]

Participants came from [[Bangladesh]] including the [[Bengal Linux Project]]; [[Myanmar]] and the [[Burma IT Project]];  Cambodia including its [[National ICT Development Authority (NiDA)]] and the [[Open Forum Cambodia]]; [[China]] including the [[Chinese Co-create Association]]; [[Fiji]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[FOSSFP]] Free and Open Source Software Foundation of [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. Other participants came from the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[Uniced]], the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[Intel]], etc.

Sessions looked at FLOSS in government and the public sector, case studies of FLOSS in education, FLOSS in ICT4D, or Information and Communication Technologies for Development, government-lead community initiatives, and FLOSS community initiatives led by GNU/Linux user groups.

There were special parallel sessions to discuss FLOSS and policy, FLOSS and capacity building, FLOSS and localisation, FLOSS and open standards, FLOSS and development practise, FLOSS and e-government, and software localisation teams in the FLOSS world.[[Image:Fossapname.jpg|thumb|right|IOSN, announcing its interests]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1655">A '''formal trilogue meeting''', more commonly known as a Trilogue, is a type of meeting used in the [[European Union]] (EU) [[European Union legislative procedure|legislative process]]. It takes its name from a literary form, the [[trilogue]], which means a conversation with three parties.

Trilogue negotiations are provided for in [[EU treaties]].  They are used if the [[Council of the European Union]] does not agree to the amendments proposed by the [[European Parliament]] at the second reading. In this case, formal trilogue negotiations are carried out within the framework of a conciliation committee. A trilogue is understood as an equally composite tripartite meeting between those involved in the legislative process of the EU institutions.  These bodies are the [[European Commission]] (EC), the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Parliament]]. The European Commission takes on the mediating function.

Critics argue that the use of trilogues is detrimental to transparency in the legislative process.  They believe the EC uses this process to bypass public transparency and the supposed opposition the proposed legislation would cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edri.org/trilogues-the-system-that-undermines-eu-democracy-and-transparency/|title=Trilogues: the system that undermines EU democracy and transparency - EDRi|date=2016-04-20|work=EDRi|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frédéric Pierre Bourdin'''&lt;ref name=observer/&gt; (born 13 June 1974)&lt;ref name="mbrown"&gt;Mick Brown, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/9459425/The-Imposter-interview-with-the-Chameleon.html "The Imposter: interview with the Chameleon,"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is a French serial [[impostor]] the press has nicknamed "The Chameleon".&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; He began his impersonations as a child and claims to have assumed at least 500 false identities,&lt;ref name="lplitt"&gt;Laura Plitt, producer, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19949847 "Frederic Bourdin – the man who changed his identity 500 times,"] [[BBC News]], 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; three of which have been actual teenage [[missing persons]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1491956/Chameleon-caught-pretending-to-be-boy.html |title=

==Early life==
Born in [[Nanterre]], Bourdin was raised by his grandparents in [[Nantes]] until he ran away and eventually went to Paris. He never knew his father, whom his mother stated was a married Algerian immigrant named Kaci.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;[[David Grann]], [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/08/11/080811fa_fact_grann?currentPage=all "The Chameleon: The many lives of Frédéric Bourdin,"] ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impersonations==
Nicholas Barclay, aged 13 at the time, was last seen playing basketball with his friends in his home town of [[San Antonio, Texas]], on 13 June 1994. Barclay never made it home and has not been seen or heard from since. In 1997, Bourdin took Barclay's identity and was flown to the United States. Although, Bourdin had brown eyes and a French accent, he convinced the family he was their blue-eyed son, saying he had escaped from a [[child prostitution]] ring and the ring had altered his eye color.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; Bourdin lived with the family for almost five months until the 6th of March, 1998.

In late 1997, a local private investigator grew suspicious while he was working with a TV crew that had been filming the family. The investigator compared a photo of Bourdin's ears to Nicholas' ears and discovered that they did not match. In February 1998, the [[FBI]] obtained a court order to take the young man's fingerprints and [[DNA]], which were later identified as belonging to Bourdin. In September 1998, Bourdin pleaded guilty to [[passport fraud]] and [[perjury]] in a San Antonio federal court. He was imprisoned for six years, more than twice as long as recommended by the sentencing guidelines.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news|author=David Grann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/28/crime.unitedstates |title=The great pretender: David Grann meets Frederic Bourdin, the man who pretended to be missing teenager|journal=[[The Observer]]|date=27 September 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bourdin returned to France from the U.S. in 2003, he moved to [[Grenoble]] and assumed the identity of Léo Balley, a 14-year-old French boy who had been missing since 1996; DNA testing proved he was not Balley.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

In August 2004, he was in Spain, claiming to be an adolescent named Ruben Sanchez Espinoza whose mother had been killed in the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid bomb attacks]]. When the police found out the truth, they deported him to France.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

In June 2005, Bourdin passed himself off as Francisco Hernandes-Fernandez, a 15-year-old Spanish orphan, and spent a month in the College Jean Monnet in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], France. He claimed that his parents had been killed in a car accident. He dressed as a teenager, adopted a proper walking style, covered his receding hairline with a baseball cap and used [[Chemical depilatory|depilatory face creams]]. On 12 June, an administrator from his school unmasked him after seeing a television program about his exploits. On 16 September, he was sentenced to four months in prison for possessing and using the previous false identity of Léo Balley.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

According to interviews, Bourdin has been looking for "love and affection" and attention he never received as a child. He has pretended to be an orphan several times.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==Personal life==
On 8 August 2007, Bourdin married a French woman named Isabelle after a year-long courtship.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; The couple resides in [[Le Mans]] with their five children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamelin|first1=Carol|title=Frédéric Bourdin dit "Le Caméléon" a changé de peau|url=http://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/2014/01/15/le-cameleon-a-change-de-peau,1174192.php|accessdate=4 August 2014|work=La République des Pyrénées|date=15 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23rd, 2017, Bourdin made a Facebook post stating that Isabelle had left him for another man, claiming she had been unhappy for 10 years and very unhappy in recent months. He claims that she left him with their children.

According to ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', Bourdin claimed that he would "never impersonate anyone again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/the-imposter-frederic-bourdin-fooled-family-946178 |title=The elaborate imposter: Conman, 30, fools family into thinking he is their missing teenage son |work=The Mirror |first=Matt |last=Roper |date=30 June 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdin was interviewed in 2008 by [[David Grann]], a staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''. After Isabelle gave birth to their first child, Bourdin contacted Grann and told him that the child was a girl. Grann then asked if Bourdin had become a new person now that he was a father and a husband, to which Bourdin replied, "No, this is who I am."&lt;ref name=observer/&gt;

==Depictions in the media==
Aired on January 6, 2009, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', episode "Stranger" (Season 10, Episode 11), fundamentally resembles Bourdin moving into a family's home by impersonating their missing son Nicholas Barclay, living in their home for some time before eventually being discovered as well as coming forward with allegations of his own abuse when confronted in court. While the fictional episode changes the names and sexes of the base characters, the situational elements remain parallel in their similarities. The story formula (along with its resemblance to Bourdin) was later largely reused in the October 25, 2017 episode "Complicated" (Season 19, Episode 5).

In 2010, a fictionalized account of the Nicholas Barclay case was brought to theaters under the title ''[[The Chameleon (film)|The Chameleon]]'', by French director and screenwriter [[Jean-Paul Salomé]]. Bourdin – renamed Fortin in the film – was portrayed by Canadian actor [[Marc-André Grondin]]. The film was adapted from ''Le Caméléon'', Christophe D'Antonio's authorized biography of Bourdin.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Holden, [https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/movies/the-chameleon-directed-by-jean-paul-salome-review.html "A 'Who Is It?' More Than a Whodunit,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at the 2010 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Rogers, [http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/news-views/QA_The_Chameleon.html#.UNDmWBgn2zM "Q&amp;A: The Chameleon,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224021609/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/news-views/QA_The_Chameleon.html |date=24 December 2010 }} tribecafilm.com, 24 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Imposter (2012 film)|The Imposter]]'', a documentary about Bourdin's impersonation of Nicholas Barclay, premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;David Rooney, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sundance-imposter-film-review-285212 "The Imposter: Sundance Film Review,"] ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', 26 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GP2 Series'''  was a form of [[Open wheel car|open wheel]] motor racing introduced in 2005 following the discontinuation of the long-term [[Formula One]] feeder series, [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]]. The GP2 format was conceived by [[Bernie Ecclestone]] and [[Flavio Briatore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Brad|last = Spurgeon|title = Formula One experiments with its minor league|work = The International Herald Tribune|page = 22|date = 2005-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Ecclestone also has the rights to the name GP1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns15388.html grandprix.com August 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[GP3 Series]] class was launched, as a feeder class for the GP2 series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/71098 autosport.com October 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the series was rebranded as the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]].

Designed to make racing affordable for the teams and to make it the perfect training ground for life in Formula One, GP2 has made it mandatory for all of the teams to use the same chassis, engine and tyre supplier so that true driver ability is reflected. All but three races had taken place as support races at Formula One race weekends to boost the series' profile, to give drivers experience of the Grand Prix environment, and to take advantage of the infrastructure (marshals, medical facilities etc.) in place for a Formula One event. GP2 mainly races on European circuits, but has appearances on other international race tracks as well with their most recent races in the [[2012 GP2 Series|2012 season]] at the [[Sepang International Circuit]] in [[Malaysia]] and the [[Marina Bay Street Circuit]] in [[Singapore]].

Many drivers have used GP2 as a stepping stone into Formula One. The 2005 Champion [[Nico Rosberg]] was hired by the Williams team for the 2006 F1 campaign, 2006 GP2 winner [[Lewis Hamilton]] made the transition to F1 the following year with McLaren and the 2007 Champion [[Timo Glock]] to Toyota for the 2008 F1 season. 2009 GP2 champion [[Nico Hülkenberg]] moved up to a Williams F1 race driver in the 2010 Formula 1 season. In addition, [[Heikki Kovalainen]] (2005), [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] (2006) and [[Lucas di Grassi]] (2007)&amp;nbsp;—all runners up— became [[Renault F1|Renault]] test drivers the following year. All three earned F1 seats, but have since been replaced.

[[Karun Chandhok]], [[Bruno Senna]] and [[Vitaly Petrov]] were also granted an F1 seat in 2010. For 2011 [[Pastor Maldonado]] was granted a seat at Williams. This meant that Nico Hülkenberg was deposed by Williams. [[Sergio Pérez]] was given the drive alongside [[Kamui Kobayashi]], another former GP2 driver and [[GP2 Asia Series]] winner, at [[Sauber]]. [[Jérôme d'Ambrosio]] got his Virgin Racing drive for the 2011 season. However, some drivers have reached Formula One without competing in GP2, for example [[Paul di Resta]], [[Daniel Ricciardo]], [[Jean-Éric Vergne]], [[Valtteri Bottas]], and [[Kevin Magnussen]].

During 2011, it was announced that in 2012 the GP2 and GP2 Asia Series would combine to make a single, longer GP2 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp2series.com/News-Room/News/2011/07_July/GP2-Series-and-GP2-Asia-Series-to-be-merged/|title=GP2 SERIES™ AND GP2 ASIA SERIES™ TO BE MERGED|publisher=[[GP2Series|http://www.gp2series.com]]|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GP2 Series and role==
===Progression to Formula One===
Current Formula One drivers that have graduated from the GP2 series include [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Romain Grosjean]], [[Stoffel Vandoorne]], recently [[Pierre Gasly]] (who triumphed in the [[2016 GP2 Series|2016]] staging amongst various others). Lewis Hamilton stepping straight into the [[McLaren F1|McLaren team]] and [[Nico Hülkenberg]], [[Pastor Maldonado]] and [[Kazuki Nakajima]] going straight to [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] have particularly highlighted how F1 teams take F2 seriously, and Hamilton's Formula One World Championship title in only his second year in F1 is probably the strongest example of the series creating highly competitive racers.

At the end of the 2016 season, nine of the twelve (GP2) champions were able to secure a seat in Formula 1, a correlation of 75%.

==Race weekend==
On Friday, drivers had a 45-minute&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gp2series.com/Guide-to/The-regulations/&lt;/ref&gt; free practice session and a 30-minute qualifying session. The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturday's race which has a length of 180 kilometres (112 miles).

During Saturday's race, each driver has to make a pit stop in which at least two tyres have to be changed.

On Sunday there is a sprint race of 120 kilometres (75 miles). The grid was decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday have started from pole position and the winner have started from 8th place.

===Point system===
;2005–2011

*Pole for Saturday races: 2 points

*Fastest lap: 1 point in each race. Driver recording fastest lap has to drive 90% of race laps. The driver must now also start the race from his allocated grid position and as of 2008 must finish in the top ten of the race to be eligible for the fastest lap point.
With this points system, the most points anyone can score in one round is 20 by claiming pole position, winning both races with the fastest lap in each race. This feat has only been achieved twice in GP2 racing's short history; by [[Brazil]]ian [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] in the 9th round of the [[2006 GP2 Series|2006 season]] in [[Hungaroring|Hungary]] and by [[Germany|German]] [[Nico Hülkenberg]] in the 5th round of the [[2009 GP2 Series|2009 season]] in [[Nürburgring|Germany]].

;2012-2016

From the [[2012 GP2 Series|2012 season]] the GP2 series changed its scoring system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/95044|title=GP2 adopts Formula 1-like tyre rules for 2012|publisher=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feature races ran with a scoring system similar to the one used in Formula One:

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size:95%; text-align:center"
! colspan="10" | Point system for Feature Race

|-
| 25
| 18
| 15
| 12
| 10
| 8
| 6
| 4
| 2
| 1
|}

The top eight finishers in a sprint race received points as follows:

|-

Pole position for the feature race will now be worth 4 points, and 2 points will be given for the fastest lap in each race. Therefore, the maximum number of points a driver can score at any round will be 48.

==Car specifications==
The GP2 Series car was used by all of the teams, and features a [[Dallara]] [[carbon-fiber]] monocoque chassis powered by a [[Mecachrome]] [[normally-aspirated]] [[fuel injection|fuel-inject]]ed [[V8 engine|V8]] engine and [[Pirelli]] dry slick and rain treaded tyres. Overall weight is 688 kg including driver.
===Chassis===
The 2011 specification GP2 Series car has been designed by Dallara Automobili. The 2006 GP2 car featured a biplane rear wing, with the triplane rear wing used in previous seasons only to be used at the Monaco race. The front upper and lower wishbones have been reinforced, as have the front and rear suspension uprights. Currently, Dallara GP2/11 are the current chassis since debut in 2011 and will be used until end of 2017 season. The price of Dallara GP2/11 FIA Formula 2 Championship cars are approximately up to €1.5 million-€2 million per car (including wheels, tyres, wings, steering wheel and other components excluding engine).
===Engine===
The 4.0-litre [[normally-aspirated]] [[fuel-injection|electronic indirect fuel-inject]]ed [[Mecachrome]] [[V8 engine]] features internal, cartographic and software upgrades designed to improve performance and fuel consumption.  The engine produces 612&amp;nbsp;hp and 500 Nm (380&amp;nbsp;ft-lb) of torque @ 8000 rpm. FIA Formula 2 Championship Series engines are rev-limited to 10000 rpm and need a rebuild after 4000 to 4500&amp;nbsp;km. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The Mecachrome V8 engine weight is {{Convert|326|lb|kg|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons are forged aluminum alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The electronic engine management system is supplied by [[Magneti Marelli]], firing a high-power inductive (coil-controlled) ignition system. The engine lubrication is a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump.

Mecachrome came to the GP2 Series in 2005, and by 2005 was clearly the dominant engine manufacturer. Starting in 2005, they became the only engine manufacturer in the GP2 Series, and continued in that capacity through 2016. Mecachrome also has a mutually beneficial technical relationship with Teos Engineering of Montigny-le-Bretonneux. They will continue working together for on-going research and development, engine maintenance and trackside support for the Mecachrome GP2 V8 racing engine at all GP2 Series venues.

During that time, since the GP2 Series had only one engine manufacturer, Mecachrome still focusing on minimizing engine failure and minimizing costs instead of defeating rivals. As such, the engines were moderately de-tuned. The engines proved themselves to be quite durable—there had been no engine failures at all F2 tracks from 2005 to present, which also lowered the number of crashes. Most of the engines, including those used for the Monaco race, are used for multiple races and were intended to last 1,100 miles between rebuilds. The Mecachrome engines were only available via lease arrangement from Mecachrome currently.

Mecachrome V8 GP2 engines were crated and shipped to all GP2 teams on a serial-number basis as determined by the sanctioning body (FIA) to ensure equality and fairness in distribution.

===Fuel and lubricants components===
Since 2005, [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]] exclusively providing the LMS 102 unleaded fuel and also [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf HTX 840 0W-40]] lubricants for all GP2 Series cars (except [[Total S.A.|Total Quartz 9000]] with [[ART Grand Prix]]).
===Gearbox===
The current [[gearbox]] has been manufactured by Hewland and features an 8-position barrel with ratchet body and software upgrades as well as a new transverse shafts fixing system designed to facilitate improved gear selection. The GP2 gearbox used a 6-speed semi-automatic configuration with electronically-controlled paddle shifters with reverse operated by a button on the steering wheel.
===Wheel rims===
[[OZ Group|O.Z. Racing]] exclusively supplies wheel rims for all GP2 Series cars since 2005.
===Tyres===
Similar to the 2011 change for Formula 1, Pirelli is now the sole tyre supplier for the series. The GP2 Series runs the same compounds as F1. The front tyre size are 245/660-R13 and rear tyre size are 325/660-R13.
===Brakes===
[[Brembo]] supplies monobloc [[brake]] calipers and disc bells, which are exclusive to GP2 Series. Hitco also supplies carbon brake discs and pads for FIA Formula 2 Championship. The brake discs are 278 x 28 mm in size (similar to [[Formula One]]).
===Other parts===
The car also features internal cooling upgrades, a new water radiator, radiator duct, oil/water heat exchanger, modified oil degasser, new oil and water pipes and new heat exchanger fixing brackets.
===Steering wheel===
Since 2011, [[XAP Technology]] exclusively providing the XAP single-seater GP2 Series steering wheel as well as XAP SX steering wheel dash display. The XAP steering wheel features 6 buttons in the front with 5 paddles (DRS, gear shift and clutch) in the back of steering wheel.
===Performance===
According to research and pre-season stability tests, the 2005 model can go 0 to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h (124&amp;nbsp;mph) in 6.7 seconds. The car has a top speed of 320 km/h (198&amp;nbsp;mph) meaning that it is the fastest single seater racing car behind [[Formula One car|Formula One]] and [[IndyCar Series]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} &lt;br /&gt; The 2011 model can go 0 to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h (124&amp;nbsp;mph) in 6.6 seconds. The car has a top speed of 332&amp;nbsp;km/h (208&amp;nbsp;mph) with the Monza aero configuration.

==History of previous seasons==

===2005===
The [[2005 GP2 Series|2005 Season]] was the first of the series, it succeeding the now defunct Formula 3000 championship. [[Arden International]] won the last [[International Formula 3000|F3000]] titles, thus starting as one of the favourites.

The 2005 season began on April 23, 2005 on the weekend of the [[San Marino Grand Prix]] at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] in [[Imola]], [[Italy]]. In the pre-season test to decide the inaugural season's car numbers, the [[iSport International]] and [[HiTech/Piquet Racing]] teams showed a competitive edge. The latter team was largely funded by the former Formula One world champion [[Nelson Piquet]] in order to aid [[Nelson Piquet Jr.|his son]]'s route to the premier Formula sport.

The championship lasted 23 rounds, two races occurring a weekend with the exception of a single race in [[Monaco]]. It was won by German [[Nico Rosberg]], who was subsequently hired by the [[WilliamsF1]] Team.

It was also notable for being the only season that GP2 used grooved tyres like F1 cars rather than slicks.

===2006===
The [[2006 GP2 Series|2006 season]] was the second of the series. After championship holder Nico Rosberg's move to the Williams F1 team, and runner-up [[Heikki Kovalainen]]'s move to be reserve driver at [[Renault F1]], [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] in the Piquet Sports car was installed as the early title favourite, though the [[ART Grand Prix]] cars of [[Alexandre Prémat]] and [[Lewis Hamilton]] also had fairly short odds, given ART were reigning champions.

For the first time, the season began on a calendar separate to the [[2006 Formula One season|2006 Formula One]] calendar, starting out at the [[Circuit de Valencia]], in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Spain]] on April 8, 2006 with Piquet Jr. the first victor.

Piquet raced into an early lead before Lewis Hamilton came back into the fray. A dominant run by the Briton took him into the championship lead before the balance came back into Piquet Jr.'s favour.

After an exciting championship battle lasting 20 races, Hamilton claimed the title in the penultimate race, at the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]], in [[Monza]], [[Italy]], and celebrated with a second place in the 21st and final round.

===2007===
The [[2007 GP2 Series]] began on 13 April at the [[Bahrain International Circuit]], and completed on 30 September at the [[Circuit de Valencia]] (which was the only race that wasn't on the F1 calendar). Eventual champion [[Timo Glock]] was a driving force throughout the series but came under stiff competition from [[Lucas di Grassi]] in the closing stages- however, with a convincing win at the last race in Valencia, Glock sealed the championship.

===2008===
The [[2008 GP2 Series]] featured the same teams as in previous seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/63419 | title=Current teams confirmed for 2008 | publisher=Autosport.com | date=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first time that the calendar supported all of the F1 races in Europe with a late deal to run at the [[Valencia Street Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/66712| title=New Valencia track secures GP2 race | publisher=Autosport.com |date=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first season to feature a new car design from Dallara, the GP2/08, the only non-F1 car to pass the 2007 FIA crash test in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/Sport/GP2/default.html |title=New car passes F1 crash tests |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318233906/http://www.itv.com/Sport/GP2/default.html |archivedate=2008-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the 2008 GP2 Series was exclusively aired on [[ITV4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/Sport/GP2/Teamsanddrivers/default.html |title=Teams and Drivers |publisher=itv.com |date=2008-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330021349/http://www.itv.com/Sport/GP2/Teamsanddrivers/default.html |archivedate=2008-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from April 2008. It was won by [[Giorgio Pantano]] for [[Racing Engineering]], with [[Bruno Senna]] finishing distant runner-up.

===2009===
The [[2009 GP2 Series|2009 season]] began and ended on the Iberian peninsula, with the first race weekend at [[Circuit de Catalunya]] (9–10 May) and ending in the stand-alone headline event (i.e. not supporting a corresponding [[Formula One]] event) at Portugal's [[Autódromo Internacional do Algarve]] (19–20 September). The title was won by German rookie [[Nico Hülkenberg]] at the penultimate round of the championship at Monza, the second time the championship had been won before the last race.

===2010===
The [[2010 GP2 Series|2010 season]] contained ten rounds, all of which were supporting F1 World Championship. The series started in May at Catalunya and concluded at Abu Dhabi in November.

[[Pastor Maldonado]] won the title in his fourth season in the series. He won a record-breaking six successive feature races mid-season. [[Sergio Pérez]] was his closest rival, but the title was sealed already in the penultimate round at Monza.

===2011===
The [[2011 GP2 Series|2011 season]] contained nine rounds and a final tenth round with no points, all of which were supporting F1 World Championship. The series started in May at Istanbul and concluded at Abu Dhabi in November.

The championship was won by reigning GP2 Asia champion [[Romain Grosjean]] at the penultimate round of the series. Following a three-year cycle, the previous GP2 chassis was replaced by a brand new car, the GP2/11, built by Italian racing car manufacturer Dallara. The series will change tyre supplier from Bridgestone to Pirelli for 2011–13. The 2011 season saw the addition of two new teams to the grid, Carlin and Team AirAsia. Meanwhile, DPR was not selected to continue in the series.

===2012===
The [[2012 GP2 Series|2012 season]] contained twelve rounds, eleven of which supported the F1 World Championship and one stand alone round in Bahrain. The series started on March 24 in Malaysia and concluded in Singapore on September 23. [[Davide Valsecchi]] (DAMS) won the title by 25 points from Arden's [[Luiz Razia]], with Lotus GP's [[Esteban Gutiérrez]] third.

For the 2012 season, Team Lazarus replaced Super Nova Racing using the name "Venezuela GP Lazarus". Lotus ART was renamed "Lotus Grand Prix", reflecting their increased relationship with title sponsor 'Lotus Cars'.

===2013===
The [[2013 GP2 Series|2013 season]] contained eleven rounds, all of which supported the F1 World Championship. The series started on March 23 in Malaysia and concluded in Abu Dhabi on November 3.

[[Fabio Leimer]] won the title driving for Racing Engineering, with a total of 201 points and 3 wins. [[Sam Bird]], driving for Russian Time, finished runner-up.

===2014===
The [[2014 GP2 Series]] contained eleven rounds, all of which supported the F1 World Championship. The series started on April 5 in Bahrain and concluded in Abu Dhabi on November 23.

[[Jolyon Palmer]] won the title in [[Sochi Autodrom|Sochi]] driving for DAMS. [[Stoffel Vandoorne]], driving for ART Grand Prix, finished runner-up in Abu Dhabi.

===2015===
The [[2015 GP2 Series|2015 season]] contained eleven rounds, supporting the F1 World Championship and the final round of the World Endurance Championship at the 6 Hours of Bahrain. It started in Bahrain on 18 April and finished in Abu Dhabi on 29 November.

[[Stoffel Vandoorne]] won the title in Sochi driving for [[ART Grand Prix]]. [[Alexander Rossi (racing driver)|Alexander Rossi]], driving for [[Racing Engineering]], finished runner-up.

===2016===
The [[2016 GP2 Series|2016 season]] contained eleven rounds, supporting the F1 World Championship. It started in Spain on May 14 and finished in Abu Dhabi on November 27.

[[Pierre Gasly]] won the title driving for [[Prema Powerteam|Prema Racing]] (who won the team's championship in their debut season). [[Antonio Giovinazzi]], also driving for Prema, finished runner up.

==Television rights==
The television rights are held by [[Formula One Management]], which also manages the rights to Formula One.

[[Sky Sports F1]] broadcast every race live in the UK and Ireland, while [[Setanta Sports]] also broadcasts in Ireland.

The races were also broadcast in the United States on Comcast's NBC Sports Network, while in Brazil it is broadcast by cable TV channel SportTV. In Venezuela MeridianoTV broadcast, and in the rest of Latin America, the races from 2012 are shown on delayed in South Cone and live in North Cone on [[Fox Sports LA|Fox Sports +]].

Other European countries:
In Spain, races are broadcast by [[MarcaTV]], [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] and [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]]. In Germany, PayTV Channel Sky broadcast all races live, and in [[Finland]] Pay-TV-channel [[MTV3 MAX]] broadcasts all races and qualifying live. [[RAI]] broadcasts only the races.

In the UK, races were being shown on Setanta Sports until the channel ceased broadcasting in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/other-sports/2009/05/01/Motorsports-on-Setanta/gnid-51126/ |title=GP2, FIA GT, DTM and SF on Setanta |first=Dave |last=Maher |work=setanta.com |publisher=[[Setanta Sports]] |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2009-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505162158/http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/other-sports/2009/05/01/Motorsports-on-Setanta/gnid-51126/ |archivedate=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Setanta took up coverage of the series from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], who had shown GP2 in all four seasons to date (highlights only for 2005–2007, live coverage for 2008). However, by the German GP, Setanta GB had gone into administration so UK viewers could have been left without a GP2 broadcaster, but [[Eurosport|British Eurosport]] subsequently picked up the UK rights to GP2 for the next two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/08072009/58/british-eurosport-secures-gp2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Setanta Ireland continues to operate for the Irish market and retain GP2 rights for that country. In February 2012, it was announced that Sky Sports F1 had secured the broadcasting rights to the GP2 series and will broadcast every race live in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/formula-1/news/12433/7474325/Sky-Sports-to-show-GP2-GP3|title=Sky Sports to show GP2 &amp; GP3|publisher=Sky Sports|date=2 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617121048/http://www1.skysports.com/formula-1/news/12433/7474325/Sky-Sports-to-show-GP2-GP3|archivedate=17 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formula One pundit Will Buxton provided commentary for the UK broadcast until he departed at the end of the 2014 season and was succeeded by Alex Jacques.

'''''Grey Gardens''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with book by [[Doug Wright]], music by [[Scott Frankel]], and lyrics by [[Michael Korie]], based on the 1975 [[Grey Gardens|documentary of the same title]] about the lives of [[Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale]] ("Big Edie") and her daughter [[Edith Bouvier Beale]] ("Little Edie") by [[Albert Maysles|Albert]] and [[David Maysles]]. The Beales were [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]'s aunt and cousin, respectively.  Set at [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens, the Bouviers' mansion]] in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the musical tracks the progression of the two women's lives from their original status as rich and socially polished aristocrats to their eventual largely isolated existence in a home overrun by cats and cited for repeated health code violations. However, its more central purpose is to untangle the complicated dynamics of their dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship.

== Storyline ==
The first act depicts the characters in their heyday and is a speculative take on what their lives might have been like when they were younger, when Little Edie was 24 and Big Edie 47. The second act is set 32 years later in 1973 at the decaying [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens estate]] and hews closely to the [[Grey Gardens|Maysles Brothers' documentary]] in its portrayal of them in their later years, when Little Edie is 56 and Big Edie is 79.  While the first act is almost entirely fictional (the central event, the engagement between Little Edie and Joseph Kennedy, never happened), the second act takes much of its dialogue and action directly from the film. The same actress who plays Big Edie in the first act plays Little Edie in the second act.

==Productions==
The musical opened [[Off-Broadway]] at [[Playwrights Horizons]] on February 10, 2006 and ran through April 30, 2006. Directed by [[Michael Greif]] with choreography by [[Jeff Calhoun (director)|Jeff Calhoun]], it starred [[Christine Ebersole]], [[Mary Louise Wilson]], and [[John McMartin]].  It received mixed reviews, but attracted particularly good reviews for Ebersole and Wilson. It earned five [[Lucille Lortel]] Award nominations and twelve [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations. 

Christine Ebersole received the [[Obie Award]], [[Drama Desk Award]], [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], a Special Citation from the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]], and the [[Drama League Award]] for Performance of the Year (2006) for her dual roles of Edith and Edie Beale in the Off-Broadway production.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

Independent productions, which started playing in those markets in 2008."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

==Reception==
The Broadway production was received enthusiastically by critics. ''[[Time Magazine]]'' named ''Grey Gardens'' the No. 1 best show to come out in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Zoglin, Richard.[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2011254_2015084,00.html "Top 10 Everything 2006. TIME names the year's best in arts and entertainment"] ''Time Magazine'', December 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In reviewing the Off-Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]], reviewing for [[The New York Times]], wrote "A blend of gentle compassion and acute observation, Ms. Ebersole's performance is one of the most gorgeous ever to grace a musical." However, he also noted that the musical "tilts perilously toward cheap celebrity camp." with a "very long and finally tedious first act."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/theater/reviews/08grey.html?pagewanted=all "Theater Review.'Grey Gardens'"] ''The New York Times'', March 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stephen Holden]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that the musical "brings to mind two phrases seldom linked nowadays: 'Broadway musical' and 'artistic integrity'... the songs, with music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie, sustain a level of refined language and psychological detail as elevated as [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s. The score is a meticulously fashioned piece of musical theater that gains in depth the more you listen to it."&lt;ref&gt;BWW News Desk.[http://broadwayworld.com/printcolumn.php?id=15734] broadwayworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">Hosted by the [[Detroit]]-based [[Vattikuti Urology Institute]], the '''International Robotic Urology Symposium''' (IRUS) is a semi-annual conference featuring the latest in robotic urological surgery presented through intensive courses and leading robotic surgeons.&lt;ref name=VUI&gt;[http://www.henryford.com/body.cfm?id=41144 Henry Ford Hospital - The Vattikuti Urology Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120318/http://henryford.com/body.cfm?id=41144 |date=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irushomepage&gt;[http://www.henryford.com/body.cfm?id=39282&amp;oTopID=33677 International Robotic Urology Symposium]&lt;/ref&gt; The symposium attracts surgeons, nurses, operating room coordinators, hospital administrators, and residents from around the world. Prominent robotic surgeon [[Dr. Mani Menon]] is the event's symposium director. 2009 IRUS will be held at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]] Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] from January 12-January 14, 2009.&lt;ref name=Pressrelease&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS176351+05-Aug-2008+PRN20080805 Henry Ford Hospital - The Vattikuti Urology Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Vattikuti Urology Institute (VUI), at the [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] played a prominent role in the development of robotic surgery as treatment for [[prostate cancer]] and, more recently, as a treatment for [[renal disease]], [[stone disease]], and [[adrenal disease]].&lt;ref name=Sciencedaily&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/06/010611072600.htm Science Daily - "Fast Track"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Newsweek&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3403901 MSNBC - Robots Invade The Operating Room]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute hosted the 2004 International Robotic Urology Symposium and the 2006 International Robotic Urology Symposium at the [[Ritz-Carlton]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].

==2009 IRUS==
Reflecting the expansion of the role of robotic surgery, 2009 IRUS will for the first time include a section for [[gynecologic]] and female [[urological surgery]]. Other session offerings include OR management for robotic surgery, economics for robotic programs, robotic [[pediatric]] urology, robotic kidney surgery, robotic [[bladder]] surgery, and robotic prostate surgery.&lt;ref name = IRUSProgram&gt;[http://www.henryford.com/body.cfm?id=49871 2009 IRUS Program Agenda]&lt;/ref&gt;  Delegates can also observe 3 live surgeries and 3D surgical video sessions.

The growing prominence of the Vattikuti Urology Institute has allowed 2009 IRUS to host more than 50 faculty members including many of the world's prominent robotic surgeons and two former presidents of the [[American Urological Association]]. The event is sponsored by the Endourological Society, the Society of Urologic Oncology, and [[Intuitive Surgical]]. Intuitive Surgical, one of America's fastest growing companies, has featured the event on its homepage.&lt;ref name = IntSurg&gt;[http://www.henryford.com/body.cfm?id=49871 Intuitive Surgical]&lt;/ref&gt;

In consideration of the growing demand amongst surgeons for in-depth learning of techniques,  2009 IRUS also hosts two post conference events (Jan 15th-16th) at Intuitive Surgical in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California|CA]] (live tissue experience) and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI (spectrum of urological surgery).

[[File:Alif Laam Meem Muslim Fraternity At Domestic Violence Rally.JPG|thumb|On March 23, 2013, members of [[Alpha Lambda Mu|Alif Laam Meem]], a national Muslim fraternity based at the University of Texas at Dallas, stood up against domestic violence as Muslims and as men of Dallas.]]
The relationship between '''Islam and domestic violence''' is disputed. Even among Muslims, the uses and interpretations of [[sharia]], the moral code and religious law of Islam, lack [[consensus]].

Conservative {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} interpretations of [[Surah]] [[An-Nisa, 34]] in the [[Qur'an]] regarding marital relationships find that hitting a woman is allowed.  Other interpretations of the verse claim it does not support hitting a woman, but separating from her. Variations in interpretation are due to different schools of Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], histories and politics of religious institutions, conversions, [[reforms]], and education.&lt;ref name=Hajjar&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hajjar | first1 = Lisa | year = 2004 | title = Religion, State Power, and Domestic Violence in Muslim Societies: A Framework for Comparative Analysis | url = | journal = Law and Social Inquiry | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 1–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence among the Muslim community is considered a complicated [[human rights]] issue due to varying legal remedies for women by the nations in which they live, the extent to which they have support or opportunities to divorce their husbands, cultural stigma to hide evidence of abuse, and inability to have abuse recognized by police or the judicial system in some Muslim nations.

== Definition ==
{{further|Domestic violence}}

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, domestic violence is: "the inflicting of physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated or habitual pattern of such behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/domestic%20violence ''Domestic Violence.''] Merriam Webster. Retrieved 14 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coomaraswamy defines domestic violence as "violence that occurs within the private sphere, generally between individuals who are related through intimacy, blood or law…[It is] nearly always a gender-specific crime, perpetrated by men against women." It used is as a strong form of control and oppression.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy&gt;Coomaraswamy, Radhika. [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/thematic52/53-wom.htm Further Promotion and Encouragement of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.] United Nations. Economic and Social Council. 5 Feb. 1996. Retrieved 19 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name=Moradian&gt;Moradian, Azad.

[[Surah]] [[An-Nisa, 34]]-35 passage on the [[social interaction]] between husbands and wives defines the husband and wife relationship in [[Islam]], with interpretation subject to debate among Muslim scholars (or 'jurists'). Quran 4:34 reads,
{{quote|
Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) strike them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all). If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things|{{cite quran|4|34-35|t=y|s=ns}} }}

Various translations of the above passage read 'strike them' or 'beat them' or 'scourge them', depending on the translator.

=== In Hadith ===

{{quotation|Narrated 'Ikrima: Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon 'AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. 'Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Apostle came, 'Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!" When 'AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, "By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this," holding and showing the fringe of her garment, 'Abdur-Rahman said, "By Allah, O Allah's Apostle! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa'a." Allah's Apostle said, to her, "If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa'a unless Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you." Then the Prophet saw two boys with 'Abdur-Rahman and asked (him), "Are these your sons?" On that 'AbdurRahman said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow,"|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|715}} see also {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|2127}}}}

{{quotation|Narrated 'Abdullah bin Sam'a The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|62|132}} see also {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|68}} }}

{{quote|It was narrated that Sulayman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: “My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of God. He praised and glorified God, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are helpers of you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit lewdness. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding, nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ” (sunan ibn Majah vol. 3 book. 9 Hadith 1851) &lt;ref&gt; (sunao ibn Majah vol.3 book 9 Hadith 1851) &lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Interpretations that support domestic violence ===
Hajjar LisA&lt;ref&gt;Hajjar, Lisa. "Religion, state power, and domestic violence in Muslim societies: A framework for comparative analysis." Law &amp; Social Inquiry 29.1 (2004); see pages 1-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treacher, Amal. "Reading the Other Women, Feminism, and Islam." Studies in Gender and Sexuality 4.1 (2003); pages 59-71&lt;/ref&gt;{{year needed|date=February 2018}} claims Shari'a law encourages "domestic violence" against women, when a husband suspects ''[[nushuz]]'' (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Raines &amp; Daniel C. Maguire (Ed), Farid Esack,  What Men Owe to Women: Men's Voices from World Religions, State University of New York (2001), see pages 201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim wife beating, for ''nashizah'', is not consistent with modern perspectives of Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Nicky Ali, ed. Encyclopedia of domestic violence. CRC Press, 2007. (see chapter on Qur'anic perspectives on wife abuse)&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative translations find that Muslim husbands are permitted to act what is known in [[Arabic]] as Idribuhunna with the use of "light force," and sometimes as much as to strike, hit, chastise, or beat.&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;Ahmed, Ali S. V.; Jibouri, Yasin T. (2004). ''The Koran: Translation.'' Elmhurst, NY: Tahrike Tarsile Qurʼān. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Tafsir|exegesis]] such as those of [[Ibn Kathir]](1300-1373AD) and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]](839-923AD), the actions prescribed in Surah 4:34 above, are to be taken in sequence: the husband is to admonish the wife, after which (if his previous correction was unsuccessful) he may remain separate from her, after which (if his previous correction was still unsuccessful) he may hit her&lt;ref name=Makarem&gt;[http://www.al-ijtihaad.com/ulema-e-islam/ulema_10.html ''Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarem Shirazi: Fatwas and viewpoints.''] Al-Ijtihaad Foundation.

{{refn|[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] in his Quranic commentary states that: "In case of family jars four steps are mentioned, to be taken in that order. (1) Perhaps verbal advice or admonition may be sufficient; (2) if not, sex relations may be suspended; (3) if this is not sufficient, some slight physical correction may be administered; but Imam Shafi'i considers this inadvisable, though permissible, and all authorities are unanimous in deprecating any sort of cruelty, even of the nagging kind, as mentioned in the next clause; (4) if all this fails, a family council is recommended in passage 4:35."&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Ali, Abdullah Yusuf]], (1989) ''The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary.''

If this is not helpful, he should sleep apart from her, trying to awaken her agreeable feminine nature so that serenity may be restored, and she may respond to him in a harmonious fashion.

A translated passage by [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali|Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] and [[Muhammad Muhsin Khan|Muhsin Khan]] in 2007 defines men as the protectors, guardians and maintainers of women, because [[Allah]] has made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.  Upon seeing ill-conduct (i.e. [[disobedience]], [[rebellion]], nashuz in Arabic) by his wife, a man may [[admonish]] them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Muhammad Muhsin; Hilālī, Taqī Al-Dīn.

Indicating the subjective nature of the translations, particularly regarding domestic abuse, [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]]'s English translation of the word ''idribu'' is "to forsake, avoid, or leave."{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  His English translation of verse 4:34 is:
…As for women you feel are averse, talk to them cursively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them), and go to bed with them (when they are willing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-34/|title=Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 34 ) with English Translation الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنْفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ ۚ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَاللَّاتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ۖ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا|website=IReBD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his native Urdu translation of verse 4:34, he translates ''idribuhunna'' as "beat them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Ahmed|title=34 القرآن, النساء|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/ur.ahmedali/4:34|website=Tanzil.net|page=84|language=Urdu|quote=مرد عورتوں پر حاکم ہیں اس واسطے کہ الله نے ایک کو ایک پر فضیلت دی ہے اور اس واسطے کہ انہوں نے اپنے مال خرچ کیے ہیں پھر جو عورتیں نیک ہیں وہ تابعدار ہیں مردوں کے پیٹھ پیچھے الله کی نگرانی میں (ان کے حقوق کی) حفاظت کرتی ہیں اور جن عورتو ں سےتمہیں سرکشی کا خطرہ ہو تو انہیں سمجھاؤ اور سونے میں جدا کر دو اور مارو پھر اگر تمہارا کہا مان جائیں تو ان پر الزام لگانے کے لیے بہانے مت تلاش کرو بے شک الله سب سے اوپر بڑا ہے (34)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Laleh Bakhtiar found out by reading Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, a 3,064-page volume from the 19th century, among the six pages of definitions for ''daraba'' one definition was "to go away."&lt;ref name=Bakhtiar&gt;Bakhtiar, Laleh.

the same root word (''daraba'') as ''idribuhunna'' in 4:34.&lt;ref name=4:94&gt;Unknown author.
[http://www.islamawareness.net/Wife/beating1.html ''Systematic comparison with 4:94''] Islamawareness.net&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is negated however by the fact that most definitions of ''daraba'' in Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon are related to physical beating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=William Lane |first1=Edward |title=Arabic-English Lexicon by Edward William Lane  (London: Willams &amp; Norgate 1863) |url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/TABS/Lane/ |pages=1777–1783 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that when the root word ''daraba'' and its derivatives are used in the Qur'an in relation to humans or their body parts, it exclusively means physically beating or striking them (e.g. in [http://quran.com/2/73 Qur'an 2:73][http://quran.com/37/93 37:93], [http://quran.com/8/12 8:12], [http://quran.com/8/50 8:50], [http://quran.com/47/4 47:4] and [http://quran.com/47/27 47:27]).

In a certain hadidth, Muhammad discouraged beating one's wife severely:

Bahz bin Hakim reported on the authority of his father from his grandfather (Mu'awiyah ibn Haydah) as saying:
"I said: Messenger of Allah, how should we approach our wives and how should we leave them? He replied: Approach your [http://quran.com/2/223 tilth] when or how you will, give her (your wife) food when you take food, clothe when you clothe yourself, do not revile her face, and do not beat her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2138|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newageislam.com/islam,-women-and-feminism/does-islam-allow-wife-beating?/d/7244|title=Does Islam Allow Wife-Beating?, Islam, Women and Feminism, Aiman Reyaz, New Age Islam, New Age Islam|work=newageislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same hadith has been narrated with slightly different wording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2139|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/99|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of this hadith, only beating the face is discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Al-Baghawi|authorlink1=Al-Baghawi|title=Mishkat Al-Masabih|volume=2|page=691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2137|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/97|website=Sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when beating is acceptable under the Quran, it is still discouraged.{{refn|[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body."

[[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).|group=nb}} Ibn Kathir in concluding his [[exegesis]] exhorts men to not beat their wives, quoting a hadith from Muhammad: "Do not hit God's servants" (here referring to women). The narration continues, stating that some while after the edict, "Umar complained to the Messenger of God that many women turned against their husbands. Muhammad gave his permission that the men could hit their wives in cases of rebelliousness. The women then turned to the wives of the Prophet and complained about their husbands. The Prophet said: 'Many women have turned to my family complaining about their husbands. Verily, these men are not among the best of you."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir 1981 vol I: 386, Sunan Abi Dawud, Book of Marriage #1834, ad-Darimi, Book of Marriage #2122; quoted in Roald (2001) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] throws light on the general trend when it comes to the verse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

| {{main|Domestic violence in Iran}}

In Iran the nature of domestic violence is complicated by both a national culture and authoritative state that support control, oppression and violence against women.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) study in [[Babol]] found that within the previous year 15.0% of wives had been physically abused, 42.4% had been sexually abused and 81.5% had been psychologically abused (to various degrees) by their husbands, blaming low income, young age, unemployment and low education.&lt;ref&gt;Faramarzi, M. et al.

In 2004 a study of domestic violence was undertaken by the Women's Center for Presidential Advisory,  [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Higher Education]] and  [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|The Interior Ministry]] of capital cities in Iran's 28 provinces. 66% married women in Iran are subjected to some kind of domestic violence in the first year of their marriage, either by their husbands or by their in-laws. All married women who were participants in this study in Iran have experienced 7.4% of the 9 categories of abuse. The likelihood of being subject to violence varied: The more children in a family or the more rural the family lived, the greater the likelihood of domestic violence; Educated and career women were less likely to be victims of abuse.  9.63% of women in the study reported wishing their husbands would die, as a result of the abuse they have experienced.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

The prevalence of domestic violence has been cited as a cause of high rates of suicide, mostly through [[self-immolation]], among [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] women in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Esfandiari, Golnaz.

|A 2009 study published by the Government of Turkey reports widespread domestic violence against women in Turkey. In urban and rural areas, 40% of Turkish women reported having experienced spousal violence in their lifetime, 10% of all women reported of domestic abuse within last 12 months. In the 15-24 year age group, 20% of the women reported of domestic violence by their husbands or male members of their family. The domestic violence ranged from slapping, battering and other forms of violence. The injuries, as a result of the reported domestic violence included bleeding, broken bones and other forms needing medical attention. Over half reported severe injuries. A third of all women who admitted domestic abuse cases, claimed having suffered repeat domestic abuse injuries in excess of 5 times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hips.hacettepe.edu.tr/eng/dokumanlar/2008-TDVAW_Main_Report.pdf Domestic violence against women in Turkey] Jansen, Uner, Kardam, et al.; Turkish Republic Prime Minister Directorate General Office (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[United Nations]] study in East and South-East Anatolia in 1998, 58% of the women (age 14-75) had been subject to domestic violence during some period of their life; some of the women in the sampling had never been in a relationship which might have otherwise resulted in a higher statistic.&lt;ref name=UN55/&gt;

==Laws and prosecution==
According to Ahmad Shafaat, an Islamic scholar, "If the husband beats a wife without respecting the limits set down by the Qur'an and Hadith, then she can take him to court and if ruled in favor has the right to apply the law of retaliation and beat the husband as he beat her."&lt;ref name="shaf"/&gt; According to ''Honour, Violence, Women and Islam'', and Islamic scholar Dr. Muhammad Sharif Chaudhry, [[Muhammad]] condemns violence against women, as he says: "How loathsome (Ajeeb) it is that one of you should hit his wife as a slave is hit, and then sleep with her at the end of the day."&lt;ref name=Idriss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry, Muhammad Sharif. Prophet Muhammad: as Described in the Holy Scriptures. Lahore: S.N. Foundation, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, laws against domestic violence, as well as whether these laws are enforced, vary throughout the Muslim world.

Some women want to fight the abuses they face as Muslims; these women want "to retain the communal extended family aspects of traditional society, while eliminating its worst abuses, by seeking easy ability to divorce men for abuse and forced marriages."&lt;ref name=Ask47&gt;Ask, Karin; Marit Tjomsland.

| Existing laws (Iranian Code of Criminal Procedure articles 42, 43, 66) intend to prohibit violence in the form of kidnapping, gender-based harassment, abuse of pregnant women and "crimes against rights and responsibilities within the family structure," but due to cultural and political culture do not protect women, prosecute their abusers and provide services to victims.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;&lt;ref name=JIRI&gt;[http://en.humanrights-iran.ir/news-18220.aspx ''Iran enforces laws on prevention of violence against women: Iranian MP''] Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, High Council For Human Rights. 16 Sep. 2011.

The government has laws that support violence against women in the case of adultery, including flogging, imprisonment and death.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

Laws to better enforce existing laws and protect women against violence were placed before the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]] the week ending 16 September 2011, focusing on both protection and prevention of violence against women, including focus on human trafficking, better protection and services for abuse victims, rehabilitation (especially concerning domestic abuse) and better processes to manage questioning of female offenders.

| In 1993 as a response to the women's rights activism against aspects of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] family law that are discriminatory or otherwise harmful to women, King Hassan II had instituted some modest reforms of the Mudawwana, and in 1998, he authorized Prime Minister El-Yousoufi to propose further changes. When the King Hassan died in 1999, the throne passed to his son, Muhammad VI, who committed to bolder reforms to improve the status of women.&lt;ref name=Euben/&gt; Opponents of the plan argued that this reform conflicted with women's duties to their husbands and contravene  their sharia-based status as legal minors. However, the controversy marked by the huge competing demonstrations intimidated the government, which led to the withdrawal of the plan.

== Victim support programs ==
In Malaysia, the largest government-run hospital implemented a program to intervene in cases where domestic violence seems possible.  The woman is brought to a room to meet with a counselor who works with the patient to determine if the woman is in danger and should be transferred to a shelter for safety.  If the woman does not wish to go to the shelter, she is encouraged to see a social worker and file a police report.  If the injury is very serious, investigations begin immediately.&lt;ref name=UN92&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.aspsymbol=A/61/122/Add.1 ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.''] United Nations, General Assembly.  6 July 2006.

== Divorce ==
{{See also|Divorce (Islamic)}}

Though some Muslim scholars, such as Ahmad Shafaat, contend that Islam permits women to be divorced in cases of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="shaf"/&gt; divorce may be unavailable to women as a practical or legal matter.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gavin. "Marriage and Divorce in Islamic South East Asia."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states:
(2:231) And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the Verses of Allah as a jest, but remember [[Islam|Allah's Favours]] on you, and that which He has sent down to you of the [[Quran|Book]] and Al-Hikmah [the Prophet's Sunnah, legal ways, Islamic jurisprudence] whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad, Farida Khanam; Ḫān, Wahīd-ad-Dīn. (2009). The Quran. New Delhi: Goodword. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Islam permits women to divorce for domestic violence, they are subject to the laws of their nation which might make it quite difficult for a woman to obtain a divorce.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy/&gt;

Most [[women's rights activists]] concede that while divorce can provide potential relief, it does not constitute an adequate protection or even an option for many women, with discouraging factors such as lack of resources or support to establish alternative domestic arrangements and social expectations and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, Howard, and Astri Suhrke.

'''José Luis Jiménez Marín''' (born 8 August 1983 in [[Curanilahue]], [[Bío-Bío Region]]) is a professional [[Chile]]an footballer who currently plays as a [[Striker (football)|Forward]] for [[Ñublense]].

==Club career==
Jiménez played at [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] youth ranks until 2003, but he left the team because he was not in the coach's plans. In 2003, he arrived to [[Deportes Talcahuano]] of the [[Primera B (Chile)|Chilean Primera B]]. In the next season, he arrived to [[Club Deportivo Trasandino de Los Andes|Trasandino de Los Andes]] of the [[Liga Chilena de Fútbol: Tercera División|Tercera División Chilena]]. At the team of Los Andes, Jiménez was the top-scorer of the Tercera División with 26 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20050112/pags/20050112005719.html|title=La sorpresa Andina|publisher=Mercurio Valpo.cl|accessdate=2005-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2005, Jiménez was transferred to [[Santiago Wanderers]] of the [[Primera División de Chile|Primera División Chilena]], because of his good performance in Tercera División. In the first season, Jiménez played very few matches and at times was not in the plans of coach Carlos González, but because the departure of González, the new coach [[Mario Soto (footballer)|Mario Soto]] had his sights set on Jiménez. In 2007, Wanderers was relegated to Primera B and Jiménez canceled his contract with the club, having to pay 15 million [[Peso chileno|pesos]]. He then signed with [[C.D. Universidad de Concepción]] for a one-year deal in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellavalpo.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20080214/pags/20080214000816.html|title=Guachupé Jiménez le pagó 15 palos a Wanderers para irse|publisher=La Estrella de Valparaíso.cl|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first season of Jiménez in the club, he scored 2 goals in 8 games. In January 2009, Jiménez won his first professional title, the [[Copa Chile 2008|Copa Chile 2008–09]].

In 2009, he was loaned to his former club [[Santiago Wanderers]] for a six-month deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiagowanderers.cl/inicio-sw/mas-noticias/759-jose-luis-jimenez-vuelve-a-vestir-la-verde-del-puerto.html|title=José Luis Jiménez vuelve a vestir la verde del puerto|publisher=Santiago Wanderers.cl|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Wanderers the player achieved the promotion to [[Primera División de Chile|Primera División Chilena]]. Lengthening his loan for one year. However, in December 2011, Jiménez return to Universidad de Concepción.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20101222/pags/20101222180013.html|title=La incógnita que rodea a dos históricos|publisher=Mercurio Valpo.cl|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Jiménez was sent off for grabbing a dog that wandered onto the pitch by the neck and throwing it into a metal fence.

During the lead-up to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], protests and campaigns arose surrounding the [[LGBT rights|rights]] of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people [[LGBT rights in Russia |in Russia]].

Concerns for LGBT athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a [[Pride House]] in [[Sochi]], ruling that "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" would "undermine the security of Russian society", and that it conflicted with [[public morality]] and the country's policies "in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."&lt;ref name=itg-nopridehouse&gt;{{cite web |title=Judge bans Sochi 2014 gay Pride House claiming it would offend "public morality" |url= http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2014/16259-judge-bans-winter-olympics-gay-pride-house |work=Inside the Games |accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which [[Russian LGBT propaganda law |banned]] the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on "gay propaganda", arguing  that it was broad enough to ban any public display of [[LGBT symbols]] and suppress [[LGBT culture]]. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBT protesters.&lt;ref name=nyt-nohaven&gt;{{cite news |title=Gays in Russia Find No Haven, Despite Support From the West |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/world/europe/gays-in-russia-find-no-haven-despite-support-from-the-west.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=10 February 2014 |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-gaychallenge"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Ted |title=Russia's Anti-Gay Laws Present Challenge for NBC's Olympics Coverage |url= https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/russia-7-1200567694/ |accessdate=25 July 2013 |newspaper=Variety |date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-crackdown"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fierstein |first=Harvey |title=Russia's Anti-Gay Crackdown |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/russias-anti-gay-crackdown.html?_r=0 |accessdate=25 July 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=homophobicviolence&gt;{{cite news |last=Luhn |first=Alec |title=Russian anti-gay law prompts rise in homophobic violence |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/russia-rise-homophobic-violence |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fthomophobicviolence&gt;{{cite news |last=Weaver |first=Courtney |title=Russia gay propaganda law fuels homophobic attacks |newspaper=Financial Times |date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of the law on the then-upcoming Winter Olympics were a major concern among athletes and the Western media, as the [[Olympic Charter]] contains language explicitly denouncing all forms of [[discrimination]]. Early international pressure was leveraged to compel the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to move the Olympics to another country, as well as pressure on Olympic sponsors to take a stand for LGBT equality. In tandem, calls to boycott and protest the Olympics before, during, and after the games also went out from various organizations and groups, and a number of Olympic athletes [[Coming out|came out]] as a symbolic protest of the law. Prior to the Games, similar pressure was placed on major Olympic sponsors, and several non-sponsors also made public statements in support of LGBT rights. Several national politicians declined to attend the Games, which some Western media outlets attributed as connected to the legislation, while others stated that few leaders normally attend the Winter Games as it is not a "must attend" event.

===2014 (pre-Games)===
* (10 January 2014) The U.S. State Department issued warnings for American traveling to the Olympics. Specifically for LGBT people it noted that "Russia has in place a law that bans the 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' to minors. It said authorities have been vague about defining 'propaganda' and that the law applies to foreigners. A conviction on the charge could result in a fine, a jail term and deportation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Auletta |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/10/sochi-travel-alert_n_4577659.html?ir=Gay%20Voices |title=Sochi Travel Alert: U.S. State Department Issues Warning For Americans During Olympics |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2014-01-10|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* (17 January 2014) Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], in a meeting with Olympic volunteers explained that their rainbow-colored uniforms were not considered violating the Kremlin's anti-LGBT initiatives because "We do not have a ban on non-traditional sexual relationships ... We have a ban on the propaganda of homosexuality and [[paedophilia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shaun Walker in Moscow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/vladimir-putin-gay-winter-olympics-children |title=Vladimir Putin: gay people at Winter Olympics must 'leave children alone': Russian president vows no discrimination but says gay people must observe law banning 'homosexual propaganda' |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement) |rainbow flag and colors]] are an international symbol for LGBTQ communities.

The '''lighthouse and naval vessel urban legend''' describes an encounter between a large naval ship and what at first appears to be another vessel, with which the ship is on a [[collision course]]. The naval vessel, usually identified as of the  [[United States Navy]] and generally described as a [[battleship]] or [[aircraft carrier]], requests that the other ship change course. The other party (generally identified as [[Canadians|Canadian]] or often [[Ireland|Irish]] and occasionally [[Spain|Spanish]]) responds that the naval vessel should change course, whereupon the captain of the naval vessel reiterates the demand, identifying himself and the ship he commands and sometimes making threats. This elicits a response worded as "'''I'm a [[lighthouse]]. Your call'''" (or similarly), a punchline which has become shorthand for the entire anecdote.

It has circulated on the Internet and elsewhere in particular since a 1995 iteration that was represented as an actual transcript of such a communication released by the office of the U.S. [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. There appears to be no evidence that the event actually took place, and the account is implausible for several reasons.&lt;ref name="Fast Company article"&gt;{{cite news |last = Chadderdon |first = Lisa |title = This Time, Consultants Are In The Dark |url = http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/27/cdu.html |newspaper = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date = August 31, 1999 |accessdate = September 17, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110528151136/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/27/cdu.html |archivedate = May 28, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus considered an [[urban legend]], a variation on a joke that dates to at least the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Snopes page"&gt;{{cite web |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |authorlink = Barbara Mikkelson |title = The Obstinate Lighthouse |url = http://www.snopes.com/military/lighthouse.asp |publisher = [[Snopes.com]] |date = March 18, 2008 |accessdate = September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as "'''the lighthouse vs. the carrier'''" or "'''the lighthouse vs. the battleship'''". The U.S. Navy has a webpage debunking it,&lt;ref name="USN denial"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Lighthouse Joke |publisher = [[United States Navy]] |url = http://www.navy.mil/navydata/questions/litehuse.html |date = September 2, 2009 |accessdate = September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this did not stop the former U.S. [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]] using it as a joke in a 2008 speech.&lt;ref name="McConnell speech"&gt;{{cite news |last = Silva |first = Mark |title = DNI Mike McConnell: 'America hates spies' |url = http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/03/dni_mike_mcconnell_america_hat.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date = March 13, 2008 |accessdate = September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other speakers have often used it simply as a [[parable]] teaching the dangers of inflexibility and [[egotism|self-importance]], or the need for [[situation awareness]]. In 2004 a Swedish company dramatized it in an award-winning television advertisement.&lt;ref name="Silva ad blog post"&gt;{{cite web |first = Duncan |last = Macleod |title = Silva Captain and the Lighthouse |url = http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2006/silva-the-captain-and-the-lighthouse/ |publisher = The Inspiration Room |date = December 3, 2006 |accessdate = September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
A commonly circulated version goes thus:&lt;ref name="Snopes page" /&gt;

{{quote box|This is the transcript of a radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in October, 1995. Radio conversation released by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] 10-10-95.

::Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a collision.

::Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.

::Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.

::Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.

::Americans: This is the aircraft carrier ''[[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS Lincoln]]'', the second largest ship in the United States' [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic fleet]]. We are accompanied by three destroyers, three cruisers and numerous support vessels. I demand that YOU change your course 15 degrees north, that's one five degrees north, or countermeasures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship.

::Canadians: This is a [[List of lighthouses in Newfoundland and Labrador|lighthouse]]. Your call.&lt;ref name="Snopes page" /&gt;}}

Other vessels sometimes named in the transcript include the carriers ''[[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|Enterprise]]'', ''[[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)|Coral Sea]]'' and ''[[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|Nimitz]]'', and the ''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|Missouri]]'', a battleship.&lt;ref name="Snopes page" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USN denial" /&gt; The location of the exchange has also sometimes been claimed to be [[Puget Sound]], or off the coast of [[North Carolina]], some other times the lighthouse is located at [[Cape Finisterre]] ([[Spain]]).&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6filPCtrt0c Hilarious Radio Conversation between US Naval Ship and Spanish Authorities]&lt;/ref&gt; (The Spanish version expands the joke by having the lighthouse keeper respond to the aircraft carrier's inventory of the fleet by saying he's accompanied by "our dog, our food, two beers, and a canary that's currently asleep.") Some versions relocate it to the Irish or Scottish&lt;ref name="Scottish version"&gt;{{cite web |title = Scottish Humour, Real Life Stories |url = http://www.rampantscotland.com/humour/blhumreal.htm |publisher = RampantScotland.com |accessdate = September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; coasts; in the former case the ship is sometimes identified as British, with the conversation taking place off the coast of [[County Kerry|Kerry]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="The Levity Effect"&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Adrian |last1 = Gostick |first2 = Scott |last2 = Christopher |title = The Levity Effect: Why It Pays to Lighten Up |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M-IcnWTal0cC|date = 2010-12-29 |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |location = New York, NY |isbn = 978-1-118-03941-0 |pages = 107–08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is sometimes an additional line of dialogue where the [[lighthouse keeper]] tells the ship captain he is a [[Seaman First Class]] before the final exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Greenfield |first = Gary |title = Life's Ride Or Fall ...

== Debunking ==
''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'', the daily newspaper in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], a city with a large naval presence, investigated the story after it had begun circulating extensively on and off the Internet in 1995. A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet called it "a totally bogus story". Boorda's office said it had not released any such transcript on the date in question. And not only was the story an old one, the ships commonly named in it were mostly either out of service by 1995 (the ''Coral Sea'', in fact, had been scrapped two years before)&lt;ref name="Fast Company article" /&gt; or not aircraft carriers.&lt;ref name="V-P article cited at Snopes"&gt;{{cite news |last = Addis |first = David |title = Standoff: Navy Says No Lighthouse – No Comment|newspaper=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |date = March 14, 1996}} Cited by Mikkelson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources the paper consulted found more flaws with the story. A spokesman for the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], which operates all American lighthouses, said that they had all long since been automated, so there would have been no one in one to talk to a ship, if the incident had taken place in U.S. waters. He speculated that it had been circulated by members of the Coast Guard to make fun of the Navy.&lt;ref name="V-P article cited at Snopes" /&gt;

Four years later, in response to a report that a consultant continued to tell the story at speeches as if it were a true occurrence, ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' talked to Wayne Wheeler, a former Coast Guardsman who was then head of an enthusiasts' group called the U.S. Lighthouse Society. He confirmed that it was an old story, and that in his experience with lighthouses was highly unlikely:

{{quote|text = First, a lighthouse doesn't look anything like a ship. Unless the weather's really foggy—and most versions of the story don't mention fog — you can see a lighthouse from far away as [[light characteristic|a fixed white light that flashes at a set number of seconds]]. On the other hand, ships are usually moving and have smaller, colored lights at the fore and aft. There's absolutely no way to mistake one for the other.}}
An actual Canadian lighthouse keeper, Jim Abram of British Columbia, agreed. "I've been lighthouse keeping for 21 years," he told the magazine, "and no one's ever thought that I was in anything but a lighthouse."&lt;ref name="Fast Company article" /&gt;

The [[Military Officers Association of America]] (MOAA) calls it "easily believable if you are not familiar with how the Navy operates or simple things such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]." In addition to the historical inaccuracies with most of the ships named, the organization notes on its blog the extreme improbability that an aircraft carrier's crew would not realize they were off the coast of a landmass such as Newfoundland. The MOAA claims to receive it in [[email forwarding|forwarded email]] an average of three times a day. "[After] fifty times the only interesting part about it is to see which details have been changed."&lt;ref name="MOAA blog entry"&gt;{{cite web |last = LoFiego |first = Mathew |title = Classic Bilge: The Lighthouse vs. The Aircraft Carrier |url = http://www.moaablogs.org/battleofthebilge/2009/03/classic-bilge-the-lighthouse-vs-the-aircraft-carrier/ |publisher = [[Military Officers Association of America]] |date = March 29, 2009 |accessdate = September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest known version of the joke appeared in a  single-panel cartoon, reproduced from the London tabloid weekly ''The Humorist'' by the Canadian newspaper ''The Drumheller Review'' in 1931. It showed two men standing by their rails, shouting through megaphones:

"Skipper: Where are you going with your blinking ship? / The Other: "This isn't a blinking ship. It's a lighthouse!""

In August of 1934, the London weekly ''Answers'', founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmsworth]], expanded the cartoon into a humorous anecdote, which was reprinted on both sides of the Atlantic. This version read:

{{quote box|align=center|There was a dense summer fog and the officer on the bridge was becoming more and more exasperated. As he leaned over the side of the bridge trying to pierce the gloom, he saw a hazy figure leaning on a rail a few yards from his ship.

He almost choked.

"What do you think you're doing with your blinking ship?" he roared. "Don't you know the rules of the sea?

"This ain't no blinkin' ship, guv'nor," said a quiet voice; "this 'ere's a light'ouse!"&lt;ref name="Snopes page" /&gt;}}

Variants appeared in humor books and periodicals over the next several decades. In 1943, [[Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons]] issued a postcard version, with an illustration of the prow of an ocean liner and passing a uniformed man at the rail of a similar object: 
"Where the ell are you going on your perishin' ship? / This ain't no ship, it's a lighthouse!"

[[Steven Covey]] told his own version in his 1989 bestseller ''[[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]]'',&lt;ref name="Covey at Snopes"&gt;{{cite book |last = Covey |first = Stephen R. |authorlink = Stephen Covey |title = The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n060QgAACAAJ |year = 1989 |publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn = 978-0-671-71117-7 |pages = 32–33 }} Cited by Mikkelson&lt;/ref&gt; and Covey in turn cited an issue of ''[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]]'' published two years earlier.&lt;ref name="Proceedings at Snopes"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Koch |first = Frank |title = Pulling Rank|journal=[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]] |date = November 1987|page=81}} Cited by Mikkelson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]] included it in a 1992 humor anthology.&lt;ref name="Asimov at Snopes"&gt;{{cite book |last = Asimov |first = Isaac |title = Asimov Laughs Again |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HvtkAAAAMAAJ |date = 1992-03-11 |publisher = HarperCollins |isbn = 978-0-06-016826-1 |page = 119 }} Cited by Mikkelson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, the story continues to be told, albeit with some awareness that it is probably fictional.&lt;ref name="Glow in the Dark"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1 = Bill Bright |first1 = Bill |last1 = Bright |first2 = Ron |last2 = Jenson |title = Glow in the Dark: A Life that Lights The Way |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h2BB22jtM9IC |date = 2005-08-01 |publisher = Random House Digital |isbn = 978-1-59052-485-5 |pages = 29–30 |quote = Apocryphal or not ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borderlands"&gt;{{cite book |last = New |first = W.H. |title = Borderlands: How We Talk About Canada |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v5nlp2Z2b7IC |date = 1998-06-01 |publisher = UBC Press |isbn = 978-0-7748-0659-6 |page = 68 |quote = I do not know its origin and I suspect it to be apocryphal ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 [[Silva compass]], a Swedish maker of marine navigational equipment, dramatized it in a television ad called "The Captain". Its version was set in the [[Irish Sea]], with the ship called the [[USS Montana|USS ''Montana'']]{{efn|No actual U.S. Navy ship has used that name since the early 20th century.}} and an Irish lighthouse keeper.&lt;ref name="Silva ad blog post" /&gt; The advertisement, filmed in English with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] subtitles, won a Bronze Lion at that year's [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes 2004 awards"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canneslions.com/downloads/winners_pdfs/Cannes_Lions_2004_Film_Lions_Winners.pdf |title= Cannes Lions 2004 Film Award Winners |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110627051759/http://www.canneslions.com/downloads/winners_pdfs/Cannes_Lions_2004_Film_Lions_Winners.pdf |archivedate= June 27, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}, retrieved September 20, 2011; p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, in 2008, retired Admiral [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]], then [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]], used the anecdote at the beginning of a speech at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He insisted it was a true story. "I was in the signals intelligence business where you listen to the people talk and so on" he told his listeners beforehand. "This is true. It's an actual recording."&lt;ref name="Snopes page" /&gt; When he was later questioned on this, a spokesman said those statements were meant merely to set the audience up. "It's a technique—comedians use it all the time to get the audience to buy in".&lt;ref name="Gail Collins column"&gt;{{cite news |last = Collins |first = Gail |authorlink = Gail Collins |title = A Black Hole Rating System |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/opinion/03collins.html |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = April 3, 2008 |accessdate = September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
Most commentators who have used it in speeches or books point to it as Mikkelson does, "a lesson in the unimportance of [[egotism|self-importance]]".&lt;ref name="Snopes page" /&gt;  [[Felix Dennis]], in whose retelling the story, represented as true, takes place off the coast of British Columbia, calls it his "favorite story about the 'infallibility' of power". He comments:
{{quote|Oh, boy. Naturally that officer of the watch can never have lived it down. He will be nicknamed "Your Call" or "Lighthouse" until the day he retires. All those years of saluting and keeping his nose to the grindstone destroyed in moments, because he believed the sun shone out of his backside.&lt;ref name="Felix Dennis book"&gt;{{cite book |last = Dennis |first = Felix |authorlink = Felix Dennis |title = How to Get Rich: One of the World's Greatest Entrepreneurs Shares His Secrets |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=meKL68N5esEC |date = 2008-06-17 |publisher = Penguin |location = London, England |isbn = 978-1-59184-205-7 |page = 282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others, particularly those writing about management for business audiences, see it as demonstrating the need for flexibility. Barry Maher calls the intractability of some listeners the ''Abraham Lincoln'' Syndrome after the ship named in his version of the anecdote, which he also represents as true. "When the person you're dealing with refuses to let you go where you want to go, divert your course", he advises salespeople, echoing the language in the story. "Smashing into lighthouses is not a successful navigational strategy—no matter how pushy those lighthouses might be."&lt;ref name="Filling the Glass"&gt;{{cite book |last = Maher |first = Barry |title = Filling the Glass: The Skeptic's Guide to Positive Thinking in Business |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FOTkCSHkkekC |date = January 2001 |publisher = Dearborn Trade Publishing |isbn = 978-0-7931-3865-4 |pages = 142–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a marital context, [[Gary Smalley]] uses it to advise husbands trying to reconcile with their wives that "like the navy captain's attempts to manipulate the lighthouse, your attempts to control the situation could cause your wife to become an immovable rock and resent you more deeply".&lt;ref name="Winning Your Wife Back"&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Gary |last1 = Smalley |authorlink1 = Gary Smalley |first2 = Deborah |last2 = Smalley |first3 = Greg |last3 = Smalley |title = Winning Your Wife Back Before It's Too Late |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w5v5trH7zCgC |date = 2004-09-16 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 978-0-7852-6028-8 |pages = 26–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[wikt:exegesis|exegesis]] of the story is the importance of [[situational awareness]]. Christian media consultant [[Phil Cooke]] tells the story, conceding that it's fictional, and uses it to demonstrate the importance of the research he reads, and knowing one's audience in particular. "We're blind unless we know who we're talking to."&lt;ref name="Phil Cooke page"&gt;{{cite web |last = Cooke |first = Phil |authorlink = Phil Cooke |title = Why Researching Your Audience Matters |url = http://philcooke.com/research_matters/ |publisher = PhilCooke.com |date = July 4, 2010 |accessdate = September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[W]hile it is [the captain']s ship, it's most definitely not his ocean" writes Russ Linden, a columnist at ''[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]'', of the lesson offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Linden |first = Russ |title = How's Your 'Court Vision'? |journal = [[Governing (magazine)|Governing]] |date = August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speakers think the anecdote is an overused [[cliché]]. Alan Stevens, president of the Global Speakers Federation, noted that Covey was still using it in speeches in 2010, and reported that the same week he heard him use it a client emailed him that two speakers at a political event she attended had used it. He tells those giving speeches to avoid not only the lighthouse story, but the [[boiling frog]] story and the story about a young boy [[The Star Thrower|throwing beached starfish]] back into the sea. "They may have happened once, but they won't have happened to the storyteller. What's worse, they are used so often, they have lost their impact." They should instead follow his example and tell stories of things that actually happened to them or that they did themselves.&lt;ref name="Alan Stevens"&gt;{{cite web |last = Stevens |first = Alan |title = Beware starfish, boiling frogs and lighthouses |url = http://www.ecademy.com/node.php?id=157403 |publisher = Ecademy.com |date = November 28, 2010 |accessdate = September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|In Vienna, the capital city, people met in front of the Karlskirche in the first district. The march went through the first district and ended in the Stadtpark. Only one or two hundred people were expected to show, so it was a great shock when two thousand people came to support the movement. Many students from various schools in Vienna made an appearance. Ranging from locale to international schools. There were many signs calling for gender equality, human rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. Some people even took this opportunity to call upon the government to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis, which was currently a problem for Austria and other European countries.

The '''Milan Furniture Fair''' ({{lang-it|Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano}}) is a [[furniture]] fair held annually in [[Milan]]. It is the largest [[trade fair]] of its kind in the world. The exhibition showcases the latest in furniture and design from countries around the world. 
It is considered a leading venue for the display of new products by [[designers]] of furniture, lighting and other home furnishings. The show, also known as "Salone", "Milano Salone" and "Milan Design Week," is held every year, usually in April, in the [[FieraMilano]] complex in the [[Milan metropolitan area]] town of [[Rho, Italy|Rho]].&lt;ref name=cosmit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmit.it/tool/home.php?s=0,2,69,93 |title=Cosmit - Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano |publisher=Cosmit.it |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Lago stand in Salone del mobile 2008.jpg|thumb|Exhibitor display at Salone 2008]]
The Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano was launched in 1961, with the original focus being Italian furniture.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/arts/18iht-design18.html?pagewanted=all Milan's Furniture Whirlwind]&lt;/ref&gt;  The original sponsors were furniture manufacturers from the Federelegno-Arredo trade association.&lt;ref name=cosmit/&gt;  The trade show grew in size over the years, allowing many of the 13,000 companies which comprised the global [[furniture industry]] to showcase their wares in a single event.&lt;ref name=cosmit/&gt;

The current show occupies an area of nearly {{convert|230000|m2}}, and includes 2,500 companies, along with 700 young designers at the Salone Satellite, a secondary exhibit.&lt;ref name=cosmit/&gt;  The show's annual visitation numbers 270,000, with attendees from over 150 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=cosmit/&gt; The show is now organized and operated by Cosmit [[Società per Azioni|S.p.A.]], a trade show corporation and a member of the ICSID ([[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]]) and ADI (Association for Industrial Design). Interior design around the world gathers at Milan in April every year at Milan Design Week commonly known as Salone Internazionale del Mobile covered online at designers such as designerzcentral.&lt;ref name=cosmit/&gt;

In 2011, there were 2,720 exhibitors at the official fair, compared to 2,499 in 2010. New lighting technologies at the show included the Flos 2620 LED chandelier with 2,620 LEDs in what appeared to be random rings of light arranged to create the illusion of movement. The standpoint piece for Arco, a 106-year-old Dutch company, was the wooden furniture produced by the [[Israel]]i designer Shay Alkalay. Of the student shows, the Dutch design school [[Design Academy Eindhoven]] took first place, followed by Israel's [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Also, some early examples of the combination of [[sustainability]] and design were showcased, which eventually resulted in a [[United Kingdom|British]] entrepreneurial initiative a few years later, pioneer of the upcoming sustainable design revolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://hear.ceoblognation.com/2013/06/03/why-did-you-start-your-business-2/ Ashley Poulter, Editor for CEO Blog Nation writes for Hearpreneur.com, 2 June 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

In year 2018, the 57th edition of the Salone del Mobile.Milano, there were 434,509 visitors in 6 days from 188 different countries. To compare the year 2016 and 2017, it has increased 17% and 26%. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elledecor.com/it/best-of/a20683458/milano-design-week-2018-attendance-performance-eng/|title=MILANO DESIGN WEEK 2018: LET’S TALK NUMBERS|last=|first=|date=2018-05-29|website=Elle DECOR Italia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music Tech Fest''' (MTF) is a three-day [[arts festival]] and creative space where participants share and "develop new formats of musical performance and expression." It is billed as the 'festival of music ideas'.

MTF presents technological innovations and artistic experimentation, performance, new inventions, commercial applications, and academic research.

Music Tech Fest events are streamed live online, and videos of individual presentations are made available on YouTube.

The festival runs a 24-hour weekend hackathon and an academic symposium known as the 'afterparty' on the Monday following the weekend's event. At the Boston afterparty, participants collaborated on the composition of a ''Manifesto for the Future of Music Technology Research''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musictechifesto.org Manifesto for the Future of Music Technology Research].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Music Tech Fest began as result of the [http://mires.cc/files/MIRES_Roadmap_ver_1.0.0.pdf Roadmap for Music Information Research] (MIReS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mires.cc|title=MIReS - &gt;&gt;&gt; the future of music tech|work=mires.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#FP6 and FP7|FP7]] project run by seven European research centers: [[Music Technology Group]] at the [[Universitat Pompeu Fabra]] in Barcelona; [http://www.stromatolite.com Stromatolite]; [[OFAI]], Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Vienna, Austria; [http://www.inesctec.pt INESCP], Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Porto, Portugal; [[IRCAM]] at the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris; Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary, University of London, UK; and Barcelona Music and Audio Technology (BMAT), Barcelona, Spain.

The project's Scientific Director Michela Magas of Stromatolite launched the first Music Tech Fest event in London 2012 as a way to bring academics and practitioners together. The first festival included contributions from [[EMI]], [[BBC]], [[Spotify]], [[Soundcloud]] and [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]] as well as academic researchers, makers, developers and artists. MTF London 2012 featured 54 performers and presenters, 70 hackers and 70 creatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In May 2013 the festival ran again in London with the additional involvement of all of the major record labels. In September of that year, Professor Andrew Dubber from [[Birmingham City University]] joined as festival director. In 2014, the festival went on tour with events in [[Wellington]], [[Boston]], [[London]], [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. In 2015 festival organisers scheduled larger regional events, rather than focusing on individual cities: MTF Scandinavia in [[Umeå]] and MTF Central Europe in [[Ljubljana]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Starting with 2015, the Music Tech Fest is supported by the EU [[Horizon 2020]] project ''MusicBricks'' which aims at fostering creative development of new ideas around music technology and supporting pilots which lead to market prototypes. This opens the pathway to reach a wider community of creative SME innovators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musichackday.upf.edu/mhd/2015/?p=73|title=» The European project #MusicBricks will run a creative testbed pilot during the hacking session|work=upf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hack Camp==
Music Tech Fest supports the growing [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hack culture]], and promotes it as an important source of creativity. The festival holds its own [[hackathon]] at each festival, MTF Hack Camp, which runs for 24 hours from Saturday afternoon to Sunday.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27062533|title=BBC News - Hackathon brings new instruments and sounds to life|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[Music Hack Day]] events, the MTF hack camp focuses on music-related hack challenges, but with a particular focus on performance with tangible objects, physical concepts and new integrations between [[software]] and [[Electronic hardware|hardware]]. There are competitions held at each MTF hack camp where individuals and groups work in response to particular challenges that reflect the themes of each festival. MTF hack camp challenges have engaged with ideas of accessibility (London 2014), fashion and wearables (Paris 2014), and creative spaces (Berlin 2014).

The festivals in London and Umeå also involve a Kids Hack which Andrew Dubber discussed in an interview for WebTVspot as an 'opportunity for families and young people to get involved'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vk.se/tv?video=3beca3e9-dc2b-4a17-95c5-ad30a52cb47b&lt;/ref&gt; The MTF website and YouTube pages show performances from the Kids Hack, of participants presenting simple gestural controllers and instruments. Some of the older 'hackers' showed some more complex projects including a remote controlled Tricopter with a camera which was connected to some video goggles to navigate and film the Tricopters flight.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ssk3RKOJgY&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival contributors==
Contributors to the festival have included: [[IRCAM]], The [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Soundcloud]], [[Mixcloud]], The [[BBC]], [[EMI]], [[RCA Records]], [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]], [[Last.fm]], [[Ableton]], [[Native Instruments]], [[Izotope]], [[FXpansion]], [[RS Components]], [[RjDj]], [[WIRED]], [[MTV]], [[Microsoft Research]], [[Cisco]], [[Stephen Fry]]/[[Penguin (publisher)|Penguin]], [[EU Commission]], [[DMIC]], [[British Council]], [[Sound and Music]], [[Modern Times Group|MTG]], [[Fraunhofer Society]], [[Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne|BCU]], [[MIT Media Lab]], [[Berklee College of Music]], [[McGill University|McGill]], [[Goldsmiths]], [[Royal College of Art]], [[Ninja Tune]], [[Warp (record label)|Warp]], [[The Echo Nest]], [[MusicBrainz]], [[Reactable]], [[Jamie Cullum]], [[Tim Exile]], [[Leafcutter John]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==MTF Scandinavia==
MTF Scandinavia took place in [[Umeå]] [[Sweden]] from the 29–31 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kitmonsters.com/blog/music-tech-fest-from-paris-to-sweden|title=Music Tech Fest from Paris to Sweden|work=kitmonsters.com.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival included presentations and performances from Jon Eades from Abbey Road Red, [[Abbey Road]]'s new technology and innovation incubator, electronic artist Scanner, [[Robin Rimbaud]] and founder of English electronic group [[808 State]], [[Graham Massey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musictechfest.org/scandischedule/|title=Music Tech Fest Scandi Schedule|work=musictechfest.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24hr Hack Camp had four hack challenges of which there were seven winning teams. Each challenge reflected the values and ideas spread by MTF; the 'Music Things for Music Ecosystems' and 'The Sound Objects in Smart Homes' challenge connected with ideas of collaboration and the Internet of Things, IoT.  The Cymatics Challenge aimed to explore the relationships between sonic and visual art through this interdisciplinary medium. The final challenge from MTF Scandinavia was the 'Music as Communication' which focused on music tools that were communicative and accessible. Four winning teams used the #MusicBricks technologies which, led to the funding and incubation of their projects to develop them further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=2fff492682fa89054a14e8980&amp;id=cbdc594fdb&amp;e=6ff253a722|title=#MusicBricks: 8 new startup ideas with half a million social reach}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation was also awarded to the two winning hacks from the 'Music Things for Music Ecosystems' and 'Music as Communication' prizes from Umeå based incubators eXpression, and the final winning Cymatics team were awarded the materials to help with future endeavours.

The [[Volvo]] Kids Hack ran on Sunday morning 10:00-12:00, led by Siobhan Ramsey of Sandbox Education, with presentations on stage in the afternoon at 14:00. Young Hackers, aged between 8-12 used tools from [[Arduino]] and Bare Conductive to create interactive instruments and musical interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandboxeducation.co.uk/sandbox-education-youth-hack-at-the-music-tech-fest/|title=Sandbox Education Youth Hack at the Music Tech Fest|work=sandboxeducation.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTF Scandinavia also included two new editions, a Jam Camp which lasted the duration of the festival and a Trackathon which ran for a week. The Jam Camp, led by Obi Blanche, was a space for people to try out music technology and play together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prote.in/en/feed/2015/05/inventing-the-future-of-music|title=Inventing the Future of Music|work=prote.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in a Jam performance on stage on the final night of the festival. The trackathon was sponsored by [[EZdrummer|Toontrack]] and was a competition to create a track using the [[EZdrummer|Toontrack]] drum packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVroo9zQz1Y&amp;index=13&amp;list=PLF3eM81pDgI3eqEnVJEP0rpS82Uk__Ef-|title=#MTFScandi Live Jam - MTF Allstars|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two winners of the challenge, CJ Carr and Matan Berkowitz had their tracks mastered and released on [[Bandcamp]] by members of the judging panel including Vince Lynch, Pascal Guyon and Phonat (Michele Balduzzi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musictechfest.org/toontrack-trackathon-winners/|title=Toontrack Trackathon Winners|work=musictechfest.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; All money raised went to a charity supporting artists suffering from depression.

MTF Scandinavia was held at Sliperiet - a co-creative space in [[Umeå Arts Campus]] where MTF is based, alongside many other creative enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umu.se/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=4510&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=252463|title=Music Tech Fest Scandinavia at Sliperiet|work=umu.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the weekend, organisations from Sliperiet put on sound installations around the upper floors of the building. These included ‘The Voice Harvester’ by Swedish ICT Interactive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tii.se|title=Swedish ICT Interactive|work=tii.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Audification of Absence’ by Willem Zwagers,&lt;ref&gt;Willem Zwagers&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘Bubble Room Instrument’, ‘Bridging Realities Collaborative’, ‘Untitled 5:22mins’ and ‘Silent Forest’ by JAQ. There were also two installations on the ground floor from outside of Sliperiet; James Brewster’s Electro Acoustic Cafe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electro-acoustic-cafe.com/about.htm|title=Electro Acoustic Cafe|work=electro-acoustic-cafe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘The Worlds Biggest Midi Controller’ by Hakan Lidbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hakanlidbo.com/archives/3657|title=Big Cubes|work=hakanlidbo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a gamification workshop on Saturday, which led to the development of the CreaCity platform for the city of Umeå, [[Sweden]]. CreaCity was released as part of the European SPECIFI project to develop tools for engagement with city culture and local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficG_PGXR7k|title=#MTFScandi: Alexandra Antonopoulou - Creative Ring Workshop|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NAMM Show''' is an annual event in the [[Music of the United States|US]] that its organizers describe as "the world’s largest trade-only event for the music products, pro audio and event tech industry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namm.org/board-members/joe-lamond Joe Lamond]. NAMM.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt; It is held every January in [[Anaheim, California]], US at the [[Anaheim Convention Center]], and is one of the two largest music product [[Trade fair|trade shows]] in the world. Its European counterpart is the ''[[Musik Messe]]'' in [[Frankfurt]]. The event attracts numerous famous musicians, many of whom are endorsed by exhibitors and come to promote their own signature models and equipment.

NAMM is a trade-only business show catering to domestic and international dealers and distributors. The product exhibits are an integral part of the show, allowing the dealers and distributors to see what's new, negotiate deals and plan their purchasing for the next 6 to 12 months. Exhibitors are allotted a specific number of badges based on the size of their booth. Retail Members are allowed a certain number of badges based on their full-time employees.

Founded in 1901, '''"NAMM"''' stands for the '''''N''ational ''A''ssociation of ''M''usic ''M''erchants,''' although, since its inception, NAMM has evolved from a national retail association into an international association whose members now include commercial companies, distributors, affiliates and manufacturers.

The association's other show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namm.org/summer/2013|title=Summer NAMM - NAMM.org|work=NAMM.org|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer NAMM, takes place in the Summer in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the newly constructed [[Music City Center]]. Summer NAMM is approximately one quarter the size of the NAMM Show in January and focuses more on industry meetings and professional development than products.

During the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], the second largest Yugoslav city of [[Novi Sad]] was one of the cities that bore the brunt of the bombing. According to NATO press releases, {{ref|NATO}} the bombing targeted oil refineries, roads, bridges, and telecommunications relay stations, facilities which had military uses. The bombing of the city caused great damage to local [[civilian]]s, including severe pollution and widespread [[Environmental degradation|ecological damage]] as well as lasting consequences for the well being of the population.

==Consequences==
[[File:Бомбардовање СР Југославије 1999.jpeg|thumb|right|NATO missile hit the area between two apartment buildings and elementary school "Svetozar Marković Toza".]]

===Impact on civilians===
The civilians of Novi Sad were greatly affected by the bombing of their city. The city's oil refinery was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage.

====Direct impact====
The bombing caused civilian deaths and injuries. Those who were not directly physically harmed suffer from consequences for their physical health caused by ecological damage as well as permanent consequences for psychological health caused by almost 3 months of trauma and fear. Due to the NATO attacks, many in Novi Sad were left jobless.

Notably, NATO were accused of failing to give "effective advance warning" of attacks which may affect civilians, as required by Protocol I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2000/07/02kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; One such attack where NATO was accused of this was the bombing of the Ministry of Education in Novi Sad, premises which administered social welfare programmes.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/reports/2004/Yugowar%20for%20website.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact on infrastructure====
[[File:Нато авијација срушила Мост слободе на Дунаву у Новом Саду.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Liberty Bridge, Novi Sad|Liberty Bridge]] destroyed in NATO air strike.]]
The NATO bombing left the city without any of its three Danube bridges, communications, water, and electricity, which severely impaired the day to day living of the residents of Novi Sad. All three bridges have been rebuilt as of 2018 [[Žeželj Bridge]].

Water supplies (including drinking water) for parts of the city were cut off as a result of the bombing. One attack cut off water supplies to 40,000 people in Petrovaradin, and severely disrupted water supplies to 300,000 people in Novi Sad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/reports/2004/Yugowar%20for%20website.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Services were restored only after two years, partially due to funding from Britain, one of the countries which bombed targets in the city in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1318455.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact on environment====
[[File:Бомбардовање рафинерије нафте Нови Сад.jpeg|thumb|right|Refinery hit by NATO missile.]]
[[File:Нато бомбе изазивале еколошку катастрофу у Новом Саду.jpeg|thumb|right|Smoke from bombed Novi Sad's refinery.]]
The bombing of Novi Sad had implications for the environment. A United Nations study (the BTF ‘Industrial Sites’ and ‘Danube’ missions) found that there were serious environmental issues, "requiring immediate action", some of which resulted from the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grid.unep.ch/btf/final/finalreport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing of Novi Sad's refinery caused fires which burned 50,000 tons of crude oil, sending toxins and [[carcinogen]]s into the air and contaminating groundwater. The BTF study was complicated by the heavy pollution that existed before the bombing, with the group noting that "the enforced shutdown of the refinery may even have led to local improvements in the aquatic environment, due to a possible reduction in chronic pollution".{{ref|BTF}}

Once all the samples for Novi Sad (Danube Mission) were collated, ''"based on field observation and results from sample analysis, the BTF concluded that there was no evidence of significant adverse impacts on the Danube aquatic environment as a result of air strikes on Novi Sad refinery. It is thought that most of the oils and oil products released were burned and that no significant volume entered the river"''.{{ref|BTF}}

The BTF study also found that prior to the air strikes, local technicians helped minimise the potential harmful effects of air strikes by "removing oil products that could be harmful to human health if spilt or burnt, such as transformer oil containing PCBs. Production was also accelerated to use up as much as possible of the crude oil, intermediate products and additives, and the final products were shipped to other locations. The remaining oil was mixed with gasoline, so that the tanks would ignite if hit, rather than leak into the soil and groundwater". {{ref|BTF}}

Local scientists also studied the impact of the bombing. "NATO didn’t use chemical weapons during the bombing", said Dr. Zorka Vukmirović, a leading environmental physicist, "But indirectly it caused the effects of chemical weapons use. If you release so many hazardous substances, major air pollutants and carcinogens in the vicinity of big cities like Belgrade and Niš, it is obviously a deliberate action against the civilian population".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0131-05.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until 2003, the Danube river was declared clear again. It took four years of work by the [[Danube Commission]] to remove the debris of bombed bridges and ordnance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3020734.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; The clearing of the debris was not only important for Novi Sad, but for European states (Hungary &amp; Romania) who were economically impacted by the blockade of river traffic to the Black sea caused by the bombing.

==The views of the respective parties==
{{see also|Legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia}}
NATO was accused of committing war crimes due to the nature of some of the bombing raids. Some Novi Sad residents found it ironic that Novi Sad was so heavily targeted by NATO due to the fact that during the time of the bombing, the city was ruled by the local Democratic Opposition, which was against the regime in [[Belgrade]]. Therefore, some citizens of Novi Sad were not able to understand why the city was targeted heavily for the events in [[Kosovo]].

A press release one year on from the bombing by then NATO Secretary General [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|Robertson]], claims that [[NATO]] encountered complications from Yugoslav military use of civilian buildings and human shields. NATO officials have "expressed deep regret at any civilian casualties it caused".&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nato.int/kosovo/repo2000/conduct.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

NATO claims that the bombing of targets such as bridges was aimed at impairing the Yugoslav Army's [[command and control]] structure. However, the efficacy of the campaign and choice of targets was brought into question by human rights groups, after bridges of no conceivable strategic relevance to the military situation in Kosovo were bombed, including a bridge which led to Hungary, a NATO country. MAICL argued{{ref|MAICL}} that the civilian deaths caused were clearly disproportionate to the military benefits in response to NATO's justification of actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/reports/2004/Yugowar%20for%20website.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglas Brian "Pete" Peterson''' (born June 26, 1935) is an American politician and diplomat. He served as a [[United States Air Force]] pilot during the [[Vietnam War]] and spent over six years as a prisoner of the [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]] after his plane was shot down. He returned to [[Hanoi]] when he became the first [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Vietnam|United States Ambassador to Vietnam]] in 1997. He was an ambassador until July 2001, after which he devoted himself to philanthropic work.

==Early life and education==
Peterson grew up in [[Milton, Iowa]] and attended college at the [[University of Tampa]]. He joined the U.S. Air Force and served in the Vietnam War, where his [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter was shot down on September 10, 1966. He spent six years in prison, a period he described as "hours and hours of boredom, spliced with moments of stark terror."&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{cite news|last=Webb|first=Carolyn|title=POW's journey to Australia, via love in Vietnam |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pows-journey-to-australia-via-love-in-vietnam-20090916-frp6.html|accessdate=8 October 2010|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on March 4, 1973.

==Career==
After the Vietnam War, Peterson remained in the U.S. Air Force and retired in 1981 as a colonel with 26 years of service. After retirement he established a general contracting firm in [[Tampa, Florida]] and later a small computer company in [[Marianna, Florida]].  He served for 5 years on the faculty of [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].

In 1990, Peterson ran as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Florida's 2nd congressional district]]. He defeated [[James W. Grant]], a politician who grew unpopular after switching from the Democratic Party to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the middle of his second term.

He declined to run for a fourth term (he was succeeded by [[Allen Boyd]]) and in 1997 was asked by President [[Bill Clinton]] to become the United States's first post-war ambassador to Vietnam.&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt; One of his goals was securing an account of those still listed as missing in action from the war and so helping to resolve the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]].

On November 17, 2000, he was presented with the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President Clinton.

===Philanthropy, business===
Since retiring as ambassador, Peterson founded [[The Alliance for Safe Children]], TASC, which aims to lower preventable injuries to children worldwide, and focuses specifically on such issues as drowning in Asia.&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite news|title=Children from developing world dying of preventable injuries: UN|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200210/s694479.htm|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=6 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC, Swimming" &gt;{{Cite web

Peterson is a Senior Advisor for [[Albright Stonebridge Group]], an international strategic consulting firm.

==Personal life==
In 1995, his first wife, Carlotta, had died, and two weeks after his installation in [[Hanoi]] he met Vi Le, [[Australia]]'s senior trade commissioner, born in Vietnam, whom he married. In 2002, he moved to [[Melbourne, Australia]] so they could be closer to her family.&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt;

In 2009, Peterson acquired Australian citizenship.&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt;

A '''post-war period''' or '''postwar period''' is the interval immediately following the end of a [[war]]. A post-war period can become an [[interwar period]] or [[interbellum]], when a war between the same parties resumes at a later date (e.g., the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]). By contrast, a post-war period marks the cessation of conflict entirely.

In [[Western world|Western]] usage, references to the '''post-war era''' or '''postwar era''' (sometimes capitalized) usually refer to the time since the end of [[World War II]], although many nations involved in the Second World War have been involved in wars since.

==Post-war==

===Chronology of the post–World War II era===

The term "post-war" can have different meanings in different countries and refer to a period determined by local considerations based on the effect of the war there. In Britain, "post-war" refers to the period from the election of [[Clement Attlee]] in 1945 to that of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979, a period of so-called [[post-war consensus]], while it may also refer to a shorter period, ending in 1960 or shortly after and corresponding to the 1950s era, hence 1945–1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/aec-lorries-post-war-years-1945-1979-248690820 AEC Lorries in the post war years 1945–1979 book (09/10/2011)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~weterb/The%20Post.htm The Post-War Years 1945 – 1960&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.about.com/od/useconomichistory/a/post_war.htm The Post War Economy: 1945–1960&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War era===
Considering the post-war era as equivalent to the [[Cold War]] era, post-war sometimes includes the 1980s, putting the end at December 1991, with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsgo.com/12350-europe-travel-guides-the_netherlands-history-c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822122321/http://www.letsgo.com/12350-europe-travel-guides-the_netherlands-history-c |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://soapbox.websitetoolbox.com/post?id=2019573 Charting Europe's Future in the 'Post Postwar' Era. - Soap Box Discussion Forums and Messageboard - Home of the Patrioteer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s and the 21st century are rarely considered to be part of the post-war era.

==History==
By the early 1800s, live performance was increasing in popularity in Australia, although no entertainment venues existed to house performances. In the 1830s, both [[Sydney]] and [[Hobart]] received two theatres, the first in the Australian colonies.&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt; 

Only four years following settlement of South Australia in 1836, attempts to build a substantial theatre in an increasingly prosperous Adelaide were made, with a declaration by the ''South Australian Register'' stating "...Mr Solomon, of Currie Street, is about to make an important addition to the quarter of Gilles Arcade, by the erection of a spacious and handsome edifice which he ends to fit up as a theatre".&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt;  It was built for [[Emanuel Solomon]] (1800–1873) and his Sydney-based brother [[Vaiben Solomon]] (1802–1860)&lt;ref&gt;Two of Vaiben's brothers lived in Adelaide: Emanuel and Isaac. The famous [[Vaiben Louis Solomon]] and [[Judah Moss Solomon]] were of the following generation.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1840&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27441265 |title=Gilles Arcade |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=14 March 1840 |accessdate=10 August 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; for £3000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/finds-from-the-19th-century-in-archaeological-dig-at-old-queens-theatre-to-be-handed-to-sa-museum/news-story/44f23c33f955b28dda66935136ee98ac?login=1|title=Adelaidenow.com.au {{!}} Subscribe to The Advertiser for exclusive stories|website=www.adelaidenow.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with seating for over 1000 people&lt;ref name="Mail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55729046|title=Our Notable Pioneers|date=7 November 1936|newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]]|accessdate=8 August 2012|publisher=National Library of Australia|location=Adelaide|page=4 Section: Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Public appetite for entertainment had waned with the Depression brought on by [[Governor Grey]]'s fiscally responsible regime following the prosperity of [[Governor Gawler]]'s rule, when huge sums were invested in public infrastructure. 
After months of losing money, Lazar dismissed his company and converted the seating to something more appropriate to public meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71615222 |title=Theatricals in Adelaide |newspaper=[[Southern Australian]] |volume=IV, |issue=237 |location=South Australia |date=27 August 1841 |accessdate=18 June 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some use was made of the theatre for public meetings and lectures, but did not renew his lease.
 
Solomon offered the government use of the theatre ''gratis'' if they would prohibit the building of further taverns in the vicinity (his Shakspere Tavern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50246683 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=7 February 1849 |accessdate=10 August 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently named Temple Tavern, was adjacent). This was rejected, but in 1843 the government signed a contract with Solomon for three years' rental at £200 per annum for use as Resident Magistrates Court, Supreme Court and offices for the Registrar General, the Advocate General, the Assistant Crown Solicitor and Assistant to the Bench of Magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37115150 |title=South Australia |newspaper=[[The Australian (1824 newspaper)|The Australian]] |location=Sydney |date=24 July 1843 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1846 and 1847 Solomon, whose nephew [[Judah Moss Solomon]] (1818–1880) was an occasional partner, attempted to sell the theatre and tavern by lottery, but it was never fully subscribed so he refunded to the punters their stakes.

It reopened, re-using the name '''Royal Victoria Theatre''', under the management of [[John Lazar]] and [[George Coppin]], on 23 December 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38437326 |title=The Theatre |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=24 December 1850 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 it closed for refurbishment and substantial remodelling, and reopened in July with A. J. Solomon the new lessee and Robert MacGowan the stage manager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50084507 |title=Victoria Theatre |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 July 1861 |accessdate=30 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what was Adelaide's only theatre until the opening of the Theatre Royal at 28 [[Hindley Street, Adelaide|Hindley Street]] on 13 April 1868,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55153409 |title=Old-Time Theatres |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=6 January 1921 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spelled the demise of the "Victoria".

It then became successively a dance hall designated the "Prado",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39198678 |title=The Dancing Saloons and Night-Houses |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=28 June 1870 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the headquarters for the [[Mission Australia|City Mission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39264368 |title=The City Mission |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 August 1872 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; a horse market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56073135 |title=Early Experiences on South Australia |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=27 March 1901 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other commercial uses, and finally a car park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57055963 |title=Gilles Arcade |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=14 July 1928 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent development===
[[File:Queen's Theatre, Adelaide, interior.JPG|thumb|The partially restored interior, now used as a performance space, during a History Month tour in 2014]]
The building was purchased by the South Australian Asset Management Corporation and transferred to Heritage SA in the 1980s. Excavation revealed historically significant remains and numerous artefacts.

The Queen's Theatre was reopened as a performance venue at the 1996 Adelaide Festival of Arts, with a performance of [[The Magic Flute]] by [[Opera Australia]]. Following essential refurbishments, it was reopened  for the launch of the 1998 Festival of Arts by [[Robyn Archer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveguide.com.au/Venues/6518/Queens_Theatre Queens Theatre in Adelaide, SA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is now used as a performance space and function venue, but with stringent conditions intended to preserve as far as possible, the old character of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/queens-theatre-adelaide Queen's Theatre – Adelaide South Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;.
The Queen’s Theatre is now managed by GWB McFarlane Theatres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenstheatre.com.au/contact/ GWB McFarlane Theatres] Retrieved 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==New Queen's Theatre==
A new theatre was built in 1846 for [[George Coppin]] on nearby land on [[Light Square]] belonging to Solomon and managed by John Lazar, architect one Thomas Price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158923388 |title=Our Colonial Review |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=IV, |issue=176 |location=South Australia |date=7 November 1846 |accessdate=10 February 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}} Price, active 1845–50, had offices in Hindley Street&lt;/ref&gt; The hall held 700 and had the distinction of prohibiting smoking in the [[box (theatre)|boxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71606193 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The South Australian]] |location=Adelaide |date=23 October 1846 |access-date=8 August 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1850, the New Queen's Theatre was described by the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' as "a hotbed of demoralization" and that "no man can sit out a performance without being disgusted ; no lady can enter the impure precincts without contamination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/38438554/3932001 | title=A Licentious Stage | newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] | date=16 January 1850}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article was the occasion of a successful libel case against editor [[John Stephens (editor)|John Stephens]] in March 1850.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/18836185 | title= Law and Police Courts : Lazar vs Stephens | newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] | date=9 March 1850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adelaide Garrick Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38438426 |title=Local Intelligence |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=XIV, |issue=1068 |location=South Australia |date=14 March 1850 |accessdate=19 February 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have been the last company to mount plays there, with productions of three [[Thomas Morton (playwright)|Thomas Morton]] comedies, the last in September 1850. There is no newspaper reference to this theatre after November 1850.

'''Russell George Foskett''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|OBE|DFC}} (7 May 1917 – 31 October 1944) was an Australian aviator and [[flying ace]] of the [[Second World War]]. Born in a suburb of [[Sydney]], Foskett was employed as a clerk in 1940 when he enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Accepted as a pilot under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]], he completed his training in Australia and [[Southern Rhodesia]], before transferring for service over [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. In subsequent aerial engagements, Foskett was officially credited with the destruction of 6½ [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft and awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. Appointed to command [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;94 Squadron RAF]], he was transferred to the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]] in 1944. Foskett was killed on 31 October 1944, after his aircraft developed engine trouble and he was forced to bail out over the [[Aegean Sea]], where his parachute failed to open.

==Early life==
Foskett was born in the Sydney suburb of [[Roseville, New South Wales]], on 7 May 1917 to Edward George Foskett, an [[accountant]], and his wife Dora Mabel (née Cotterill). Foskett was educated at Hornsby Junior Technical School, before going on to study accountancy. He later gained employment as a clerk in the credit department of Shell Co. of Australia Pty Ltd. In his youth, Foskett was active in [[Scouts Australia|scouting]] as a [[Rovers (Australia)|Rover]] as well as sport, particularly [[field hockey|hockey]]; he was a member of the [[Gordon, New South Wales|Gordon]] district hockey club and represented New South Wales.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Scully|first=P. J.|year=1996|id=A140218b|title=Foskett, Russell George (1917–1944)|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
===Training===
On 18 September 1940, Foskett enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1047638|title=Foskett, Russell George|accessdate=11 March 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepted for flight training under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]], he received his initial flight instruction at No.&amp;nbsp;2 Initial Training School, [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]]. Completing this course on 9 November, Foskett was advanced to [[leading aircraftman]] and posted to No.&amp;nbsp;2 Embarkation Depot. On 10 December, he embarked from Sydney bound for [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="ServRec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=5254148&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=Foskett, Russell George: Personal Service Record – Officers|accessdate=11 March 2009|work=Records Search|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foskett disembarked at Southern Rhodesia in January 1941,&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt; following a three-week voyage. Allocated to the Initial Training Wing, he completed a two-week stint with the unit before proceeding to No.&amp;nbsp;25 Empire Flight Training School. On graduating from the school, Foskett was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;20 Service Flying School for advanced flight instruction on 5 March; he was promoted to acting [[sergeant]] the following day. On 23 April, Foskett was awarded his [[flying badge]], becoming a fully qualified pilot.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt;

===North Africa===
Promoted to the substantive rank of sergeant on 10 June 1941, Foskett was transferred to the [[Middle East Command|RAF Headquarters, Middle East]] the following day. He spent two weeks with the headquarters, prior to moving on to No. 71 Operation Training Unit.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt; In July, Foskett was posted to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron RAF]], flying [[Hawker Hurricane]]s over North Africa. [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned]] as a [[pilot officer]] on 15 March 1942, Foskett was further promoted to acting [[flight lieutenant]] in July and appointed a flight commander of the squadron the following month. The commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron, Donald Jack, later commented of Foskett during this time: "the man, who was a born leader&amp;nbsp;... had everything required; enthusiasm, aggression, humour, a zest for life and boundless energy".&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

[[File:Hurricanes 80 Squadron RAF 128173.JPG|thumb|left|Hawker Hurricanes from No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron RAF at an airfield in North Africa. c.1941]]

On 3 November 1942, Foskett led his squadron in a sortie over [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] against a formation of [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] [[dive bomb]]ers that were escorted by [[Messerschmitt 109]]s.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt; During the ensuing engagement, seven Stukas were shot down, with an additional eight probably destroyed and several others damaged. Foskett himself shot down two of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft before he was hit by fire from one of the Messerschmitts.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DFC"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35809|date=4 December 1942|page=5265|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced down, Foskett landed his aircraft in a minefield, where he was safely extracted by a formation of the [[British Army]] in the area.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; Returning to his squadron that evening, Foskett resumed flying duties the following morning.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt; Foskett was subsequently awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his actions during the engagement.&lt;ref name="DFCrec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00301/003010711.pdf|title=Recommendation for Russell George Foskett to be awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross|accessdate=11 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 4 December 1942, reading:&lt;ref name="DFC"/&gt;

{{quote|''Air Ministry, 4th December, 1942.''

ROYAL AIR FORCE.

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the following awards in recognition of gallantry displayed in flying operations against the enemy: —

Distinguished Flying Cross.

Acting Flight Lieutenant Russell George FOSKETT (Aus.402652), Royal Australian Air Force, No. 80 Squadron.

One day in November, 1942, this officer led his squadron in an attack on a formation of Stuka dive bombers, heavily escorted by fighters. During the combat 7 Stukas were shot down, a further 8 probably destroyed and several others were damaged. Flight Lieutenant Foskett, who displayed great skill and daring, destroyed 2 of the enemy aircraft before his own was hit. He landed safely, however, and re-joined his squadron the same night. The following morning he resumed his flying duties. This officer has participated in a large number of sorties and has displayed inspiring leadership.}}

===No.&amp;nbsp;94 Squadron===
Foskett continued to undertake sorties with No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron until late March 1943, when his operational tour came to an end. Promoted to acting [[squadron leader]], he was posted as a staff officer to the headquarters of No.&amp;nbsp;209 Group, located in [[Haifa, Israel|Haifa]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], on 25 May. Foskett's service with the headquarters lasted until 6 October, when he was appointed as commander of No.&amp;nbsp;94 Squadron RAF. Based in the [[Libya]]n town of El Adem, the squadron was equipped with Hawker Hurricanes and consisted of a mixture of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] personnel, in addition to a contingent of [[Yugoslavia]]n pilots.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt;

Foskett administered and led No.&amp;nbsp;94 Squadron as it operated over North Africa and the Middle East throughout 1944. Noted as "outstanding" as "a fighter pilot and commander" during this time,&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; Foskett was consequently [[Mentioned in Despatches]] and awarded the wings of the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] by [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36544|date=2 June 1944|page=2642|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron was re-equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s during February that year, and it was while piloting one of these aircraft that Foskett scored his final victory of the war. On 6 June, Foskett was involved in a sweeping sortie over [[Crete]] when he became engaged with a [[Junkers Ju 52]]. In the ensuing battle, Foskett managed to shoot down the opposing aircraft over [[Timimi|Tmimi]], Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Alfred|title=Late Mark Spitfire Aces 1942–45|year=1995|publisher=Osprey Publishing|place=London, England|isbn=1-85532-575-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; During October 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;94 Squadron was relocated to [[Alimos|Kalamaki]], Greece.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19176">The '''Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy''' concerns the publication of a series of diaries by Scott Thomas Beauchamp  (b. 1983 [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]) – a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army]], serving in the [[Iraq War]], and a member of Alpha Company, [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-18 Infantry]], [[2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (United States)|Second Brigade Combat Team]], [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|First Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=Beauchamp2007-07-26&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/the_plank?pid=128957 |title=A Statement From Scott Thomas Beauchamp |accessdate=2007-08-08 |date=2007-07-26 |work=The Plank |publisher=[[The New Republic]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814195634/http://www.tnr.com/blog/the_plank?pid=128957 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen2007-07-28&gt;{{cite news |first=Patricia |last=Cohen |title=Shedding Pen Name, Private Says He’s ‘Baghdad Diarist’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/28/books/28diar.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-07-28 |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, using the [[pen name]] "Scott Thomas", Beauchamp filed three entries in ''[[The New Republic]]'' (TNR) about serving at [[forward operating base]] [[Forward Operating Base Falcon|Falcon]], Baghdad. These entries concerned alleged  misconduct by soldiers, including Beauchamp, in [[post-invasion Iraq]].

Several publications and bloggers questioned Beauchamp's statements. A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] investigation had concluded the statements in the material were false.  ''The New Republic'' investigated the statements, first standing by the content of Beauchamp's articles for several months, then concluding that they could no longer stand by this material.

=="Shock Troops"==

In a diary entry in ''The New Republic'', Beauchamp claims he ridiculed a woman in Iraq whose face had been severely burned: "I love chicks that have been intimate with IEDs" ([[improvised explosive device]]s), Beauchamp quotes himself as saying, loudly, to his friends in the chow hall. "It really turns me on—melted skin, missing limbs, plastic noses," he recounted. "My friend was practically falling out of his chair laughing...The disfigured woman slammed her cup down and ran out of the chow hall."

Next, he described finding the remains of children in a mass grave uncovered while his unit constructed a combat outpost: "One private...found the top part of a human skull... As he marched around with the skull on his head, people dropped shovels and sandbags, folding in half with laughter ... No one was disgusted. Me included."

Finally, Beauchamp described another soldier "who only really enjoyed driving [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s because it gave him the opportunity to run things over. He took out curbs, concrete barriers, corners of buildings, stands in the market, and his favorite target: dogs."  Beauchamp described how the soldier killed three dogs in one day: "He slowed the Bradley down to lure the first kill in, and, as the diesel engine grew quieter, the dog walked close enough for him to jerk the machine hard to the right and snag its leg under the tracks."&lt;ref name=Beauchamp2007-07-23&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Thomas |authorlink=Scott Thomas Beauchamp |title=Shock Troops |url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070723&amp;s=diarist072307 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071002041929/https://ssl.tnr.com/p/docsub.mhtml?i=20070723&amp;s=diarist072307 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-02 |work=[[The New Republic]] |page=56 |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=="Baghdad Diarist"==
After the publication of "Shock Troops", ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' and ''[[National Review]]'' questioned the veracity of Beauchamp's statements.&lt;ref name=Goldfarb2007-07-31&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/07/reporting_from_fob_falcon.asp |title=Reporting From FOB Falcon |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Goldfarb |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Goldfarb (political writer)|date=2007-07-31 |work=Worldwide Standard |publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ''The Weekly Standard'' reported that one of the anonymous military experts consulted by ''TNR'' refuted Beauchamp's allegations regarding Bradley Fighting Vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/967doure.asp ''Weekly Standard'', August 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  As the controversy continued, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Beauchamp did not provide documentation for his three published columns.

In a follow-up posting on ''The New Republic'', Beauchamp objected to charges of falsification: "It's been maddening...to see the plausibility of events that I witnessed questioned by people who have never served in Iraq. I was initially reluctant to take the time out of my already insane schedule fighting an actual war in order to play some role in an ideological battle that I never wanted to join."&lt;ref name=Cohen2007-07-28/&gt;

''New Republic'' editor [[Franklin Foer]] disclosed that Beauchamp is married to [[Elspeth Reeve]], a former ''New Republic'' reporter and [[fact checker]], and that his relationship with Reeve was "part of the reason why we found him to be a credible writer."&lt;ref name=Kurtz2007-07-27&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |authorlink=Howard Kurtz |title=Army Private Discloses He Is New Republic's Baghdad Diarist |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700037.html |work=The Washington Post |page=C07 |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accused of insufficient fact-checking, the magazine had, according to Foer, planned to "re-report every detail",&lt;ref name=Cohen2007-07-28/&gt; but the magazine later stated that their investigation was "short circuited" after the Army severed Beauchamp's communications with anyone overseas.&lt;ref name=TNR2007-08-02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w070730&amp;s=editorial080207 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814205024/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w070730&amp;s=editorial080207 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-14 |title=A Statement on Scott Thomas Beauchamp |accessdate=2007-08-08 |date=2007-08-02 |work=The New Republic Online |publisher=[[The New Republic]]}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==''New Republic'' investigation==
[[File:Beauchamp Transcript.pdf|thumb|Transcript of Conversation between Scott Thomas Beauchamp and ''[[The New Republic]]'']]

In an August 2 statement, after an internal investigation, editors for ''The New Republic'' defended Beauchamp's statements,&lt;ref name=Kurtz2007-08-03&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |authorlink=Howard Kurtz |title=Editors Confirm Soldier's Claims |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/02/AR2007080202348.html |work=The Washington Post |page=C02 |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one exception—that the conversation about the disfigured woman had occurred at [[Camp Buehring]] in [[Kuwait]], not Iraq, an error for which The New Republic apologized to its readers.  According to the statement, five anonymous members of Beauchamp's company had also confirmed the other aspects of Beauchamp's entry.

{{cquote|We...spoke with current and former soldiers, forensic experts, and other journalists who have covered the war extensively. And we sought assistance from Army Public Affairs officers. Most important, we spoke with five other members of Beauchamp's company, and all corroborated Beauchamp's anecdotes, which they witnessed or, in the case of one soldier, heard about contemporaneously. (All of the soldiers we interviewed who had first-hand knowledge of the episodes requested anonymity.)}}

The statement continued to say that the Army's investigation had impeded their own investigation, because communication with Beauchamp had been cut off, and "his fellow soldiers no longer feel comfortable communicating with reporters...If further substantive information comes to light, TNR will, of course, share it with you."&lt;ref name=TNR2007-08-02/&gt;
''The New Republic's'' Jason Zengerle was told by the Army there was no evidence of a horribly burned woman at a Kuwait base camp after the magazine published its Editor's Note on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NmU3MmQxYWYxNjlmZGNjYTZkMzVjN2Y0ZWU4ZDVkZWM= John Podhoretz, The Corner, ''National Review'', August 6, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Scoblic, executive editor of TNR, has stated to Beauchamp directly that "I understand why there are questions being raised about the piece".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/1.pdf "Transcript of Conversation, Scott Thomas Beauchamp and The New Republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306172411/http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/1.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}, ''U.S. Army'', July 17, 2007. Posted at the website of ''National Review'', October 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2007, A spokesman for the 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division clarified the results of the Army investigation in an e-mail interview with the ''[[Associated Press]]'':

{{cquote|During that investigation, all the soldiers from his unit refuted all statements that Pvt. Beauchamp made in his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Milburn and Ellen Simon |title=New Republic Iraq Stories Questioned |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2007-08-09-3160847497_x.htm |work=Associated Press |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate = 2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A July 31, 2007 memorandum from Major John D. Cross, the Investigating Officer, entitled "Legal Review of AR 15-6 Investigation Regarding Allegations of Soldier Misconduct Published in ''The New Republic''" found:&lt;ref&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Legal_Review_of_AR_15-6_Investigation_Regarding_Allegations_of_Soldier_Misconduct_Published_in_The_New_Republic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*That the incident of blatant disrespect for a disfigured woman in the FOB Falcon DFAC is a tale completely fabricated by Private Beauchamp.  (The New Republic issued a correction saying the story took place in Kuwait, not Iraq.)
*That the desecration of human remains and the discovery of a "Saddam-era dumping ground" is false.
*That the deliberate targeting of wild dogs is completely unfounded.
*That Private Beauchamp desired to use his experiences to enhance his writing and provide legitimacy to his work possibly becoming the next Hemmingway [sic].
*That Private Beauchamp is not a credible source for making the allegation he wrote about in "Shock Troops." He admitted that he was not an eyewitness to the targeting of dogs and only saw animal bones during the construction of Combat Outpost Ellis. Combined with the piece of fiction that he wrote on 8 May 2006 on his blog, I find that Private Beauchamp takes small bits of truth and twists and exaggerates them into fictional account that he puts forth as the whole truth for public consumption.

In a "[[:File:Beauchamp - Memorandum of Concern.jpg|Memorandum of Concern]]" the commanding officer of Beauchamp's battalion, Lieutenant Colonel George A. Glaze, wrote in part:{{cquote|The New Republic published an article, authored by you, under your pen name, Scott Thomas. This article contained gross exaggerations and inaccurate allegations of misconduct by [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Vanguard]] Soldiers. Your article discredited the service of your fellow Vanguard Soldiers and comrades at arms. Between January 2006 and September 2006, you published sensitive information about your unit's deployment dates on your personal web log. By placing this sensitive information in the public domain, you jeopardized the lives of Vanguard Soldiers and the Vanguard mission.}}

==Alleged recantation==
On August 6, 2007, the ''Weekly Standard'''s blog reported that Scott Thomas Beauchamp [[Recantation|recanted]] under oath to Army investigators.&lt;ref name=Goldfarb2007-08-06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/08/beauchamp_recants.asp |title=Beauchamp Recants |accessdate = 2007-08-08 |last=Goldfarb |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Goldfarb (political writer)|date=2007-08-06 |work=Worldwide Standard |publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fog of War"&gt;[[Franklin Foer]].

On August 7, ''The New Republic'' reported:

{{cquote|"We've talked to military personnel directly involved in the events that Scott Thomas Beauchamp described, and they corroborated his account as detailed in our statement. When we called Army spokesman Major Steven F. Lamb and asked about an anonymously sourced allegation that Beauchamp had recanted his articles in a sworn statement, he told us, 'I have no knowledge of that.' He added, 'If someone is speaking anonymously [to The Weekly Standard], they are on their own.' When we pressed Lamb for details on the Army investigation, he told us, 'We don't go into the details of how we conduct our investigations.'"&lt;ref name=TNR2007-08-02/&gt;}} Michael Goldfarb and the ''Weekly Standard'' stood by the story.&lt;ref name=Goldfarb2007-08-07&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/08/beauchamp_recants_update.asp |title=Beauchamp Recants: Update |accessdate = 2007-08-08 |last=Goldfarb |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Goldfarb (political writer)|date=2007-08-07 |work=Worldwide Standard |publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}; [http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/08/the_media_turns_on_tnr.asp ''Weekly Standard'', August 8, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2007, the [[Drudge Report]] website published the transcript of a phone call that occurred on September 7, 2007 between Beauchamp and senior TNR staff, including [[Franklin Foer]]. In this conversation, Beauchamp refused to affirm the accuracy of his reports, despite pressure from Foer to do so. Foer confirmed the accuracy of the transcript, but asserted that Beauchamp did not recant his story and claimed that independent, anonymous sources have backed up Beauchamps's charges and therefore TNR will not retract the stories.&lt;ref name="wapo20071025" &gt;{{cite news|author=Howard Kurtz|title=Baghdad Diarist Was On Guard When Questioned by Editors|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=2007-10-25|accessdate = 2007-10-25|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402687.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kathryn Jean Lopez, ''National Review Online''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s editor also questioned the accuracy of Drudge's characterization of ''The New Republic'' interview as a recantation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzBkNjFmY2Y0MDdhMzAwOGFiNzk4Y2Y5NGU5ZjIzMDA= The Corner on National Review Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours later, the documents were no longer available at the Drudge Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/2007/drudge-calls-out-tnr-beauchamp-takes-it-back-hours-later October 24 New York Observer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026045027/http://www.observer.com/2007/drudge-calls-out-tnr-beauchamp-takes-it-back-hours-later |date=2007-10-26 }}; only the archive of the original newsflash remained [http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2007/10/24/20071024_171240_flash8.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Review]] Online posted the documents on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/1.pdf New Republic Transcript Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306172411/http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/1.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}; [http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/2.pdf New Republic Transcript Part 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306172420/http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/2.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}; [http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/3.pdf Army investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306172359/http://www2.nationalreview.com/dest/2007/10/24/3.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents, and other details of the Army investigation, in spite of being confirmed by ''National Review'' as real, were not officially released.  "We are not going into the details of the investigation," Maj. Steven F. Lamb, deputy public affairs officer in Baghdad, wrote in an e-mail message. "The allegations are false, [Beauchamp's] platoon and company were interviewed, and no one could substantiate the claims he made."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/washington/08diarist.html?ei=5124&amp;en=33f5f5d8678c992a&amp;ex=1344225600&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&amp;adxnnlx=1186581767-NqjRAZ3XpB7hxmlnQ2MYGg  Army Says Soldier’s Articles for Magazine Were False], ''New York Times'', August 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The New Republic'' "cannot stand by these stories"==
A December 2007 article by [[Franklin Foer]] lengthily addresses the issues of the controversy, concluding:

{{cquote|"In retrospect, we never should have put Beauchamp in this situation. He was a young soldier in a war zone, an untried writer without journalistic training. We published his accounts of sensitive events while granting him the shield of anonymity—which, in the wrong hands, can become license to exaggerate, if not fabricate.

"When I last spoke with Beauchamp in early November, he continued to stand by his stories. Unfortunately, the standards of this magazine require more than that. And, in light of the evidence available to us, after months of intensive re-reporting, we cannot be confident that the events in his pieces occurred in exactly the manner that he described them. Without that essential confidence, we cannot stand by these stories.&lt;ref name="Fog of War"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5314">The '''Southern Forestry Conclave''' is an annual competition among students from 15 southern forestry schools in a variety of physical and technical events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/warnell/ugrad/forclub/asfc.htm University of Georgia: Warnell School of Forest Resources: ASFC Forestry Conclave] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614081517/http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/warnell/ugrad/forclub/asfc.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It typically involves more than 250 contestants. Traditional [[Lumberjack#Loggersports|physical events]] include [[archery]], [[axe throwing]], [[pole climbing]], log rolling, [[bow saw]]ing, log birling, and [[crosscut saw|cross-cut saw]] competition.  Technical events include [[dendrology]], [[timber]] volume estimation, [[photogrammetry]], [[wood|wood identification]], and others.  Scores from individual events are combined to determine the overall winning school of each year's conclave, which is a highly sought honor.  The Forestry Conclave is hosted by the participating schools on a rotating basis and is sponsored by the '''Association of Southern Forestry Clubs'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/forclub/association_of_southern_forestry.htm Auburn University: School of Forest and Wildlife Science: Association of Southern Forestry Clubs.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617055747/https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/forclub/association_of_southern_forestry.htm |date=2010-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conclave promotes spirited competition among the forestry students representing their respective schools and clubs, and participation in the Conclave helps students develop high standards and professionalism.&lt;ref name=ASFC&gt;[http://asfc-conclave.org/wordpress/about/ ASFC News: Forestry Conclave] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011023355/http://asfc-conclave.org/wordpress/about/ |date=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Planning the Conclave requires considerable cooperation among the participating forestry clubs for it to be successful.

==History==
Eight forestry schools participated in the first Conclave in 1958, which was sponsored by the University of Georgia.  Fewer than 100 students competed in the first Conclave's mainly physical events.&lt;ref name=ASFC/&gt;  Over 50 Conclaves have been conducted since the first one.

The '''Stadttheater Meran''' is the civic [[theatre]] of the town of [[Meran]] in [[South Tyrol]], northern Italy.

With the economic and financial development of the city as a [[spa]] for [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and the aristocracy, the need for a higher cultural institution rose. The architect [[Martin Dülfer]], who was a representative of the Munich School of Architecture, was given the commission to build the new theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klein, Martin Dülfer. ''Wegbereiter der deutschen Jugendstilarchitektur''. Arbeitshefte des Bayerischen Landesamtes für Denkmalpflege, 8. Lipp, Munich 1993. {{ISBN|3-87490-531-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the theatre in the ''[[Jugendstil]]''. It was completed in 1899 and inaugurated on December 1, 1900.

After the annexation of the town following the end of [[World War I]] from Austria-Hungary to Italy was the theatre renamed by the Italians after [[Giacomo Puccini]], who visited the town in 1923. The theatre saw its decline after [[World War II]] and the 1950s. It was, however, revived again and renovated after a fire in 1978.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">The '''Supreme Economic Council''' was established at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in February 1919 to advise the conference on economic measures to be taken pending the negotiation of peace. Specialized commissions were appointed to study particular problems: the organization of a [[League of Nations]] and the drafting of its Covenant; and the determination of responsibility for the war and guarantees.

==Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief==
The [[Allied Maritime Transport Council]] (AMTC) had been established in 1917 to co-ordinate the tight control of all shipping of the [[Allies of World War I]]. Even prior to the [[armistice of 11 November 1918]] the [[Allied Maritime Transport Council]] had been making preparations for changes to introduce in the event of fighting ceasing. In particular they had sent a proposal that German and Austrian ships should be placed under their control as part of the armistice agreement  – however they did not succeed in this. By 13 November, two days after the armistice, the British government proposed to their counterparts in [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]] that the AMTC be transformed into a "General Economic Council". However the American government wanted the previous organisation to be discontinued, with a new organisation being set up to deal with such economic problems as arose. After discussion amongst the parties involved an agreement to set up the Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief was reacged on 12 December 1918, with the organisation holding its first meeting on 11 January 1919, a week before the actual Paris Peace Conference opened.&lt;ref name="Flemming"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flemming |first1=Thomas |title=The illusion of victory : America in World War I |date=2004 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0465024698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of February the Supreme Economic Council had been established by merging the Allied Maritime Transport Council with the barely established Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief and the [[Inter-Allied Food Council]] and the [[Superior Blockade Council]].&lt;ref name="Hurley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwpda.org/wwi-www/Hurley/bridge7.htm | title=The Bridge to France | accessdate=September 4, 2012 | author=Hurley E.

'''Swanti''' ([[Devanagari]]: स्वन्ति) is a five-day festival of [[Nepal]] which is one of the year's greatest celebrations for the [[Newar]] people. It is the Newar version of [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] or [[Diwali]]. The festival highlights the central role of women in the household, and the rituals are related to wishing for good fortune of the family members by presenting them auspicious items and praying for longevity by placating the god of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shrestha |first= Bal Gopal |date= July 2006 |title= The Svanti Festival: Victory over Death and the Renewal of the Ritual Cycle in Nepal |url= http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/contributions/pdf/CNAS_33_02_03.pdf |journal= Contributions to Nepalese Studies |publisher=CNAS/TU |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=206–221 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Robert Isaac |year=1990 |title=Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6k4007rd;chunk.id=d0e14766;doc.view=print |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the festival, windows and doorways are decorated with flower garlands and lamps. Deities, animals, and people are honored as part of the celebrations. The festival is marked by both [[Hindu]]s and [[Buddhist]]s. It is held according to the [[lunar calendar]] so the dates are changeable. In 2017, the festival is 17–21 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.drikpanchang.com/nepali/tihar/tihar-calendar.html | title=2017 Tihar &amp;#124; Swanti Calendar | accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lakshmi Pujā==

The first two days are Kwah Pujā and Khichā Pujā dedicated respectively to crows and dogs, both known as messengers of death. Goodies are left on the roof for the crows to feast upon. People honour dogs by putting a flower garland around their neck and offering them delicacies. The third day is Sā Pujā, the day dedicated to cows. They are believed to lead the spirits of the deceased to the land of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gutschow |first1= Niels | last2= Bau |first2= Christian |year=2005 |title=Death and ancestor rituals among the Newars of Bhaktapur, Nepal |location= |publisher= Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn= 9783447051606| page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on the third day, householders observe [[Lakshmi]] Puja by worshipping Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: Lakshmi Dyah लक्ष्मी द्य:) (also spelled Laxmi). They paste a new painting of the Goddess at the shrine installed in an inner room and worship her by making a sand painting of a [[mandala]]. All the members of the family then offer coins and venerate her. The next day on [[Mha Puja]], a feast known as Thāybhu, which consists of an immense plate piled high with various food items, is offered to the Goddess.

The painting of Goddess Lakshmi in Newar tradition is distinguished by her accessories and attendants. She is shown holding a Jwālā Nhāykan (ज्वाला न्हायकं) (mirror encircled by flames) in her right hand and a Sinhamu (सिन्ह:मू) (powder container covered by a five-tiered parasol) in the left hand. These two ritual objects stand for prosperity and good fortune and are necessary for many ceremonies in Newar society.

The figure of a man holding a sack of money is said to be the lord of wealth [[Kubera]] or a rich trader. The hairy creatures are known as [[Khyah (legendary creature)|Khyāh]] are believed to live in the high [[Himalaya]]. In antiquity, merchants travelling to [[Tibet]] are said to have encountered them on the snowy passes, and they may be the same as the [[Yeti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chitrakar |first=Madan |year=2012 |title=Nepali Art |location=Kathmandu |publisher=Teba-Chi Studies Centre |isbn=978-9937-2-4933-1 |pages=19–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mha Pujā==

{{Main| Mha Puja}}

The next day is Mha Puja which means "worship of the self". The ceremony is believed to purify and empower the soul. Mha Puja signifies an auspicious beginning of the New Year of [[Nepal Sambat]], and invokes prosperity and longevity for the participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maharjan |first=Ujjwala |title=Cultural symbolisms in Mha Puja | url=http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=24968| accessdate=30 October 2013 |newspaper=Republica |date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mha Puja today, Nepal Sambat 1132 being observed|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/10/27/top-story/mha-puja-today-nepal-sambat-1132-being-observed/342845.html|accessdate=30 October 2013 |newspaper=Ekantipur |date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony consists of worshipping one's mandala and presentation of the [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan]], a set of auspicious food items (rice wine, meat, smoked fish, lentil cake and boiled egg) which represent [[Tantra|Tantric]] concepts.

==Kijā Pujā==

The fifth day of Swanti is known as Kija Puja and is dedicated to brothers. Sisters honor their younger brothers with a ceremony where a mandala similar to the one used for Mha Puja is worshipped. They present them long-burning wicks (khelu itāh खेलु इता:) which are placed next to the mandala, and also sacred threads (kwakha क्वखा) and a basket of fruits (tahsibwa त:सिब्व) symbolizing long life and good fortune.

The sisters then offer [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan]] to their brothers which consists of auspicious food items. The five items wine, meat, fish, lentil cake and egg symbolize the five [[Tantra|Tantric]] concepts of light, earth, water, air, and sky respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Juju |first1=Baldev |last2=Shrestha |first2=Surendra Man |date=1985 |title=Nepa ya Tantric Dyah wa Tantric Puja |trans-title=Nepal's Tantric Deity and Tantric Worship |language=Newari|location=Kathmandu |publisher=Baldev Juju and Surendra Man Shrestha|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers give gifts of cash and clothes in return. They are then treated to a lavish feast. The ceremony may be held at the sister's home or at the brother's home as per family tradition.

The day after the end of Swanti, parents invite their married daughters to eat their share of the feast presented to Goddess Laxmi during Mha Puja. Each dish on the large plate is divided into small portions so that all the family members get a share. This party concludes the sequence of events.

'''''The Moor's Account''''' is a novel by [[Laila Lalami]]. It was a
[[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] finalist in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Finalists|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/2015|accessdate=2015-07-29|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Review: 'The Moor's Account'|date=2014-09-15|accessdate=2015-07-29|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/09/15/348765060/book-review-the-moors-account|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Moor's Account'' is a fictional memoir of [[Estevanico]], the Moroccan slave who survived the [[Narvaez expedition]] and accompanied [[Cabeza de Vaca]]. He is widely considered to be the first black explorer of America, but little is known about his early life except for one line in Cabeza de Vaca's chronicle: "The fourth [survivor] is Estevanico, an Arab Negro from Azamor."

==Plot==
The story is narrated in the first person by Mustafa ibn Muhammad ibn Abdussalam al-Zamori, a Moroccan slave who has been taken by his Spanish master, Andrés de Dorantes, on an expedition to the New World. The expedition lands in Florida in the vicinity of what is now [[Tampa Bay]]. Under the leadership of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], the men leave their ships behind and travel inland to look for gold. As they journey northward, they face resistance by indigenous tribes, suffer from disease and starvation, and quarrel with one another. Within a year there are only four survivors: [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca|Cabeza de Vaca]], the treasurer of the expedition; [[Alonso del Castillo Maldonado|Alonso del Castillo]], a young nobleman, [[Andrés Dorantes de Carranza|Andrés de Dorantes]], one of the captains; and his Moroccan slave, Mustafa, whom the other three Spaniards refer to as [[Estevanico|Estebanico]]. Together, these four survivors travel westward, crossing the continent and living among indigenous tribes, reinventing themselves along the way as faith healers. Some years later, they are found by a party of Spanish slavers and brought to Mexico City, where they are asked to provide testimony about their journey—all except the slave, who tells his own story in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/236023/the-moors-account-by-laila-lalami/ Publisher book page] Penguin Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The style of ''The Moor’s Account'' is shaped to resemble sixteenth-century travelogues. To give the impression of historical authenticity without making the novel inaccessible to contemporary readers, Lalami decided to use words that belong to the register of the 16th century, but are still in use today.

Since the narrator is of Arabic origin, features typical of Arabic texts are used. Thus, the narrator begins his account with a [[basmala]], notes the passage of time according to the [[Islamic calendar|Hegira calendar]], uses Arabic units of measurement, and refers to places with their Arabic names. The dialogue in the novel lacks quotation marks in order to replicate the style of Arabic manuscripts of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://katemacdonald.net/2015/08/21/interview-with-laila-lalami-author-of-the-moors-account/ Interview with Laila Lalami] Kate Macdonald&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the first half of the novel, ''The Moor’s Account'' alternates between two sets of stories: some chronicling the [[Narváez expedition]], and others narrating Mustafa’s life prior to his arrival in the New World.

'''''The Stones in the Park''''' was a free outdoor festival held in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 5 July 1969, headlined by [[The Rolling Stones]] and featuring [[Third Ear Band]], [[King Crimson]], Screw, [[Alexis Korner]]'s New Church, [[Family (band)|Family]] and The Battered Ornaments,&lt;ref name="hjort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hjort|first=Christopher|year=2007|title=Strange Brew: Eric Clapton and the British Blues Boom, 1965–1970|publisher= Jawbone Press|location=London|page=249|isbn=978-1-906002-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in front of a crowd estimated at between 250,000&lt;ref name=hjort/&gt; and 500,000 fans.&lt;ref name="guardianarchive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9CLzE5NjkvMDcvMDYjQXIwMDMwMw==&amp;Mode=Gif&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom|title=Requiem For A Stone|publisher=[[The Observer]]|date=6 July 1969|accessdate=16 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keef/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/stones-in-the-park.html|publisher=UK Rock Festivals|title=The Stones in the Park|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Stones' first public concert in over two years, and was planned as an introduction of new guitarist, [[Mick Taylor]], though circumstances inevitably changed following the death of former member [[Brian Jones]] two days earlier. The band rehearsed at [[the Beatles]]' studio in the basement of [[Savile Row]], and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set; the Hyde Park concert would be the first time many of the songs had been played before a public audience. The PA system was supplied by [[Watkins Electric Music]], who had already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows.

Fans started to arrive at the park with candles on 4 July in tribute to Jones, and by the morning of 5 July, 7,000 people had already gathered. [[Mick Jagger]] read a short eulogy on stage before the Stones' set began, reading two stanzas of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s poem on [[John Keats]]'s death, ''[[Adonaïs]]'', from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred [[Pieris (butterfly)|cabbage white]] butterflies were released. The setlist for their performance was "[[Johnny Winter (album)|I'm Yours &amp; I'm Hers]]", "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]". "[[Mercy Mercy]]", "Down Home Girl", "[[Stray Cat Blues]]", "[[No Expectations]]", "[[I'm Free (The Rolling Stones song)|I'm Free]]", "[[Loving Cup (song)|Loving Cup]]", "[[Love in Vain]]", "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]", "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", "[[Midnight Rambler]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]" and "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]". During the 18-minute-long rendition of "Sympathy for the Devil", a number of African tribal drummers joined the band.

While the event is considered a memorable one by several critics, they also agree that it was not one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Keith Richards]] evaluated their performance, "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again." The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by [[Granada Television]] and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD&lt;ref name="film4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1969/the-stones-in-the-park|publisher=[[Film 4]] Reviews|title=Stones in the Park|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?sku=623967|publisher=[[HMV]]|title=Stones in the Park|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.&lt;ref name=BBCr5/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Newsw"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Rolling Stones add second Hyde Park concert in July|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22077159|accessdate=10 April 2013|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The festival was an important one for the Stones. They had not performed a public concert since their [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1967|1967 European Tour]], and in 1968 had only performed at the [[New Musical Express|NME]] Poll Winners Concert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/awards/history/1968|title=NME Awards History : 1968|publisher=[[New Musical Express]]|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at their television project ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''. In interviews, [[Mick Jagger]] stated that he felt the band's forte was performing live, rather than in the studio, and was keen to return to the stage.&lt;ref name="stonesinthepark"/&gt;{{rp|34:08}} [[Blackhill Enterprises]], which had already managed several successful concerts in Hyde Park, including a festival headlined by [[Blind Faith]] in June 1969 attended by 150,000 people,&lt;ref name=normy2&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Philip|title=Mick Jagger|year=2013|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-732951-9|pages=346–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; were contacted to organise one at the next convenient date after the organiser-compère of that concert, [[Sam Cutler]], had met Jagger in the VIP area at the concert and later at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; When asked why the festival would be free, Jagger noted that they had not made much money from previous concert tours anyway, and that he felt the audience would have a better time if they did not have to pay&lt;ref name="stonesinthepark"&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14:23}}  although he ensured that the cost of the concert would be covered by selling exclusive television rights to [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]].&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

However, the gradual estrangement of [[Brian Jones]] and his decreasing musical contributions – he had only appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' — made a return to touring problematic. They had shelved ''The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus'' after having been upstaged by [[The Who]].&lt;ref name="perkins-heatley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=Jeff|last2=Heatley|first2=Michael|title=Rolling Stones – Uncensored On the Record|publisher=Coda Books Ltd|isbn=978-1-906783-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1969, matters had finally come to a head and it was decided that Jones should be replaced for the gig.

[[File:Mick Taylor2.jpg|thumb|right|The Hyde Park concert was [[Mick Taylor]]'s first gig with the band]]
[[Mick Taylor]], who had by this time obtained a reputation for himself by playing with [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]], was invited to work on ''Let It Bleed''. The band enjoyed his contributions and decided to make him an offer to join full-time. After considering this for a few days, he accepted,&lt;ref name="perkins-heatley"/&gt; and his position was officially announced at a press conference in the park's bandstand on 13 June. The single "[[Honky Tonk Women]]," recorded on 1 June with Taylor, was rush-released to tie in with the festival date.&lt;ref name="stark-dexter"/&gt; The Hyde Park concert would be Taylor's first gig with the band, and as they had barely had any time to rehearse with him he was understandably nervous,&lt;ref name="perkins-heatley"/&gt; though he later stated that he felt the others, who were far closer to Jones than him, would feel more emotionally drained.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Jagger, too, was nervous, unsure whether Jones's fans would take to Taylor and indeed whether they would boycott the concert; he did not expect the crowd to match the 150,000 who had come to the Blind Faith gig.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; In addition, the hot summer had sent the pollen levels soaring and Jagger suffered from hay-fever and laryngitis in the days leading up to the concert.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

Jones died on 3 July, two days before the festival. The Stones were in [[Olympic Studios]] when they were told of his death by [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], and, although grief-stricken, decided they would go ahead with the gig and dedicate their performance to him.&lt;ref name="perkins-heatley"/&gt; [[Keith Richards]] later wrote:
{{quote|The all-important thing for us was it was our first appearance for a long time, and with a change of personnel. It was Mick Taylor's first gig. We were going to do it anyway. Obviously a statement had to be made of one kind or another, so we turned it into a memorial for Brian. We wanted to see him off in grand style. The ups and downs with the guy are one thing, but when his time's over, release the doves, or in this case the sackfuls of white butterflies.&lt;ref name=keef&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Keith|last2=Fox|first2=James|title=Life|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=978-0-297-85439-5|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The band rehearsed at [[the Beatles]]' studio in the basement of [[Savile Row]], and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set; the Hyde Park concert would be the first time many of the songs had been played before a public audience.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

== Performance ==
[[File:Hyde Park, Tour de France Day - geograph.org.uk - 490653.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], seen here in 2007]]
The performers at the festival included [[Third Ear Band]], Screw, [[King Crimson]], [[Alexis Korner]]'s New Church, [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], Battered Ornaments, [[Family (band)|Family]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name="stark-dexter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlink.com/20080629-forty-years-of-rock-in-hyde-park.html|title=Hard Rock Calling : 40 Years of Hyde Park|author1=David Stark | author2=Jeff Dexter|publisher=Songlink International|year=2008|origyear=1996|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans started to arrive at the park with candles on 4 July in tribute to Jones, and the police allowed the park to be opened late so they could stay.&lt;ref name="stark-dexter"/&gt; By the following morning, there were already 7,000 people.&lt;ref name="wyman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyman|first=Bill|title=Rolling With The Stones|publisher=Dk Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7894-8967-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323}}
As with the Stones' performance at the infamous [[Altamont Free Concert]] later that year, the [[Hells Angels]] were hired as stewards to protect the stage and equipment,&lt;ref name=normy&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Philip|title=The Stones: The Acclaimed Biography|year=2012|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-747706-7|pages=329–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; something suggested by the [[Grateful Dead]]'s manager [[Rock Scully]], who was used to the Angels performing this service at free festivals in California.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; According to Cutler, Jagger said that he was keen on doing a similar free concert in California at some time in the future.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; At Hyde Park, fifty Angels patrolled the vicinity of the stage, though there was little resemblance other than a superficial one to their American counterparts. They performed their duties in exchange for a cup of tea.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; In the event, there were only twelve arrests on the day and a subsequent police report claimed that the Angels were "totally ineffective".&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

King Crimson at this point still consisted of the original line-up of [[Robert Fripp]], [[Greg Lake]], [[Ian McDonald (musician)|Ian McDonald]], [[Michael Giles]] and [[lyricist]] [[Peter Sinfield]]. They had not yet released an album, and were invited to play on the strength of word of mouth after their live performances in venues such as the [[Marquee Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Pete|last2=Newquist|first2=Harvey|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|page=81|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7935-4042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cutler introduced them on stage, stating the "new band is gonna go a long way".&lt;ref name="allmusickc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-in-hyde-park-july-5-1969-mw0001270851|title=King Crimson : Live in Hyde Park: July 5, 1969|author=Planer, Lindsay |publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The band's setlist was "[[21st Century Schizoid Man]]", "[[The Court of the Crimson King]]", "Get Thy Bearings", "[[Epitaph (King Crimson song)|Epitaph]]", "Mantra", "Travel Weary Capricorn" and "[[The Planets|Mars]]".&lt;ref name="progarchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=9582|title=KING CRIMSON Hyde Park, London, 1969 review|publisher=Prog Archives|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the tracks appeared in studio form on the band's debut album, ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'', albeit with different lyrics compared with the performance here.&lt;ref name="allmusickc"/&gt; The band's set has since been released on CD, with some bonus material.&lt;ref name="progarchives"/&gt; Recalling the event, Fripp remembers the sense of community at the event and the good weather, particularly noting a sense of goodwill backstage.&lt;ref name="stark-dexter"/&gt;

Alexis Korner's involvement with [[Blues Incorporated]] had been a key ingredient in the Stones forming in 1962, and he had played onstage with several group members during this time. New Church had been formed with guitarist [[Peter Thorup]] after the demise of Blues Incorporated.&lt;ref name=Shapiro1997&gt;{{cite book|last = Shapiro |first = Harry  |title = Alexis Korner: The Biography |year =1997|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|isbn = 0-7475-3163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Harper had been regularly appearing at a number of Hyde Park festivals since 1968 and saw his popularity increase as a result of these. This eventually resulted in Blackhill's [[Peter Jenner]] managing him, leading to a contract with [[Harvest Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-harper-mn0000345427|title=Roy Harper – Music biography|author=Jason Ankeny|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 5 July gig, he contributed a one-song set between equipment changes.&lt;ref name="stark-dexter"/&gt;

The Battered Ornaments had been the backing band for [[Cream (band)|Cream]] collaborator [[Pete Brown]]. They performed without Brown for the festival, who had been fired from the band the previous day.&lt;ref name="TOD"&gt;{{cite book| first= Vernon| last= Joynson| year= 2006| title= The Tapestry of Delights Revisited| edition= 1st| publisher= Borderline productions| location= Telford| isbn= 1-899855-15-7| pages= 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist [[Chris Spedding]] took over lead vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chris-spedding-mn0000118261|title=Chris Spedding biography|author=Steve Huey|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band supplied the [[armoured personnel carrier]] that carried the Stones from their hotel to the park.&lt;ref name="stark-dexter"/&gt;

=== The Rolling Stones ===
The band met at the Londonderry Hotel on [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]], overlooking the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, [[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]] and [[Tony Sanchez (photographer)|Spanish Tony Sanchez]].&lt;ref name=normy/&gt; They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage.&lt;ref name=normy/&gt; Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress.&lt;ref name=normy/&gt; He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] at the [[Michael Fish (fashion designer)|Mr. Fish]] boutique, and wore it to [[Löwenstein-Wertheim|Prince Rupert Lowenstein's]] white ball, where he had shown it to [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; Jagger was only to wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white [[Bell-bottoms|loon pants]].&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

[[File:Pieris.brassicae.male.mounted.jpg|thumb|right|A male specimen of ''[[Pieris brassicae]]'', the large cabbage white]]
Before the Stones opened their set, Jagger addressed the crowd, asking them to be quiet so he could read something as a tribute to Jones.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; He then read two stanzas of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s poem on [[John Keats]]'s death, ''[[Adonaïs]]'', from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred [[Pieris (butterfly)|cabbage white]] butterflies were released,&lt;ref name=normy/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jul/07/from-the-archive-rolling-stones-brian-jones-1969|title=From The Archive Blog|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 July 2012|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Gott|first2=Katy|last2=Stoddard|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]] authority having stipulated before the concert that any butterflies released by the Stones should be sterilised and should certainly not be of the voracious cabbage white genus (''Pieris'' spp.).&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; 2,500 butterflies were due to be released, but due to the hot weather, many of them died from lack of air in storage.&lt;ref name=normy/&gt; Watts later said that the butterflies "were a bit sad, there were casualties. It was like the Somme".&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4872320/The-Stones-on-legendary-Hyde-Park-gig-in-1969-and-2013.html|title=The Stones on Legendary Hyde Park gig in 1969 and 2013|publisher=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=4 April 2013|location=London|first1=Paul|last1=Sexton|first2=Music|last2=Journalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stones then launched into "I'm Yours and I'm Hers", which, according to [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], was an ironic choice given that [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]], both of whom Jagger was alleged to be having relationships with at that time, were in the audience.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

The setlist for their performance was "[[Johnny Winter (album)|I'm Yours &amp; I'm Hers]]", "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]", "[[No Expectations]]", "[[Mercy Mercy]]", "[[Stray Cat Blues]]", "[[I'm Free (The Rolling Stones song)|I'm Free]]", "Down Home Girl", "[[Love in Vain]]", "Give Me a Little Drink", "[[Midnight Rambler]]", "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]", "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]" and "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]".&lt;ref name=hjort/&gt;

During the 18-minute-long rendition of "Sympathy for the Devil", a number of [[Ginger Johnson]]'s African tribal drummers joined the band.&lt;ref name="stonesinthepark"/&gt;{{rp|42:25}}&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; After the concert ended, the volunteers who cleared up the 5,000 tonnes of rubbish were each given a copy of "Honky Tonk Women".&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt;

Though park keepers feared that the crowd would cause damage to the park, an official estimate suggested the cost was only around £100 (now £{{inflation|UK|100|1969|fmt=c|r=-3}}). Park superintendent John Hare reported the most serious damage was to a silver birch tree planted the previous year. He praised the concertgoers, many of whom helped clear up after the concert and were awarded with a free Stones LP if they returned a full sack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Stanhope|title=Pop concert damage by hangers-on|newspaper=The Times|location=London, England|date=7 July 1969|p=2|accessdate=16 August 2017|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=kccl&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS34959591&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackhill Enterprises provided a {{convert|6|ft}} high stage, with the speakers being housed in a thirty-foot-high tower so that people at the far end of the park would be able to hear the music.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album.&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; Richards had started experimenting with [[open tunings]] by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing [[Ry Cooder]],&lt;ref name=keef2&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Keith|last2=Fox|first2=James|title=Life|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=978-0-297-85439-5|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a [[Gibson ES-330]] tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a [[Gibson Flying V]]. Taylor, meanwhile, played a [[Gibson Les Paul]] for the opening number, followed by an [[Gibson SG|SG]] for the majority of the set.&lt;ref name="stonesinthepark"/&gt; The PA system was supplied by [[Watkins Electric Music]], who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from [[T. Rex (band)|T-Rex]]. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tpimagazine.com/Chronicle/137802/the_buccaneers_part_two.html|publisher=Total Production International|title=The Buccaneers — Part Two|date=October 2008|issue=110|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In 1971, in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Richards said, "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Richard Gott]] stated that the show was "a great and epoch-making event in British social history", although he added that "most of the music ... was indifferent".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; According to Norman, "the band's underpreparedness was painfully obvious. Keith and Mick Taylor's guitars, so harmonious at first meeting, turned into a pair of pneumatic drills fighting a grudge match to the death. Charlie's drumming and Bill's bass each seemed to have melted into jelly."&lt;ref name=normy2/&gt; The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Iain Martin stated that the Stones were "under-rehearsed and quite possibly nervous, not having performed live in front of an audience in more than two years. The guitars were badly out of tune and half the songs were approached at the wrong tempo", adding that Jagger appeared to be "trying to cover up for the shortcomings of his bandmates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin1/100210412/the-rolling-stones-were-terrible-at-hyde-park-in-1969-theyll-be-much-better-this-time/|title=The Rolling Stones were terrible at Hyde Park in 1969 – they'll be much better this time|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Ian Martin|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=5 April 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively reviewing the DVD release of the Stones' set, [[Film 4]] commented: "It isn't the greatest film about the band and it isn't their greatest performance, but for fans it captures the band at a significant moment."&lt;ref name="film4"/&gt;

[[File:Théâtre de Saint-Pierre en 1900.png|thumb|Théâtre de Saint-Pierre en 1900]]
The '''Théâtre de Saint-Pierre''', also known as La Comédie, was a theater in [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique]], active from 1786 to 1902. It was a famous center of culture in the [[West Indies]] for over a century. Destroyed in the volcano eruption of 1902, its ruins became a historical monument and a site for tourists. 

Originally, theatre companies from France performed in temporary localities on tours to Martinique. From 1780, there where demands to the authorities to provide the colony with a permanent theatre. At that point, there where already theatres in the cities of [[Saint-Domingue]] since the 1760s and two in [[Guadeloupe]] (in Basse-Terre and Pointe-a-Pitre), and a theatre was considered to be an essential hall mark of civilisation and sophistication. The building was designed inspired by the famous Theatre of Bordeaux, and had room for 800 seats. The theatre was described as extremely elabourate and elegant, and became famous in the Caribbean.  In the facility, the latest drama, opera and ballets where performed by artists from France.  The artists typically stayed no more than a few years or temporary until they continued to Saint-Domingue.

'''Yellow stickers''' are a method of alerting shoppers to food which has been reduced in price because it is approaching its [[sell by date]].

Yellow stickers are used by most UK supermarket chains, including [[Asda]], [[Co-op]], [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[Tesco]] and [[Waitrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37624872|title=The yellow sticker hunters|first=Owen|last=Amos|date=3 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/17/i-did-my-entire-weekly-shop-buying-discounted-yellow-sticker-food-6857455/|title=I did my entire weekly shop buying discounted yellow sticker food|date=17 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also found elsewhere in the world, such as in Japan.
